1556471,5,B00005JNJV,I did not know they were making another Batman movie. I think its cool. I love Batman. I own all 4 batman movies on VHS and I own games also. It looked pretty cool but I will have to wait and see if it is really good.  Some people did not like the last 2 movies in the series but I have enjoyed them all myself. I will be 24 when the new batman movie comes out in 2005 because my brithday is April 1st and I was only 8 when the first movie came out. So you can see batman has been around for awhile even before the first movie and how Batman has come along way. When I have seen the movie I will give it whatever rating in my opiion it deserves. But for Now the 5 stars are for the first 4 movies. The TV show and the games. can't wait. Thanks,1100736000,4,743,3.7628205128205128
1556472,4,B00005JNJV,"This movie will most likely be good. There is one bad part though. The batmobile completely sucks. It looks like a pimped up range rover. I think any of the old ones are better than this. The movie does have two really good villians though, Ras Ah Gauhl played by Ken Wantanbe and The Scarecrow played by Cillian Murphy. THe story is about Bruce Wayne played by Christian Bale becoming Batman. When he returns to Gotham it is corrupt and the Scarecrow is terrorizing the city. Bruce went on a trip and Ras offered him to join him. Bruce learned what Ras' plans were and declined. He went back to Gotham and then startedd to become Batman with the help of Lucious Fox played by Morgan Freeman.",1092355200,9,692,4.456692913385827
1556473,5,B00005JNJV,"Either this or Sin City is going to the best summer movie of next summer. Batman Begins will probely make the most money, since the hype is up so high all ready. Let me tell you what I think of Batman's next big movie. I think the idea of making a Batman prequel is the best Warner Bros has come up with so far. Now we can go back and see him when he was all fueld up with revenge. I can't wait to see what Scarecrow is like in this. He's probley my favirte Batman villian, so it's good to see him on the big screen. Cristain Bale looks like his going to be the best Batman yet. The movie looks so cool and I can't wait to see it. I'll write an offical review when I see the movie.",1092355200,2,681,3.8368794326241136
1556474,5,B00005JNJV,"Christopher Nolan is an awesome director, and this movie looks like the best live-action version of Batman to date! I've been following the production of the movie VERY carefully, and I can say that this movie will probably be one of the greatest comic book adaptations ever made. The production designs for this movie rival those of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I think it's pretty safe to say that this will be one of the most epic superhero films made.

After the disasters that were Batman & Robin, Steel, and CINO (Catwoman In Name Only), it's such a relief to see a DC comics character finally being done with the respect it deserves. Hats off to Chris Nolan and his team!",1092182400,9,684,4.516129032258065

1556621,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is my favorite movie in the Nolan trilogy by far. Yes its better in my opinion than The Dark Knight because one person isn't carrying the whole movie. Liam Neeson and Bale shine in this but also Katie Holmes did a wonderful job too. Don't get me wrong I love The Dark Knight, I thought Heath's role was outstanding and that it will never be duplicated. But Heath carries the movie by himself and Bale isn't nearly as good as he is in Batman Begins. Anyway,  Batman Begins shows Bruce Wayne's incredible journey to becoming Batman and ridding society of people who put fear into others. I think its the more emotional movie of the three, it also shows Bruce's fear and determination as a kid to an adult. The quality of this movie in 4k 2160P and the HDR is stunning. The mountain scenes in the beginning and the whole Vietnam scenes really pop out with the colors and detail. No IMAX scenes but the quality is still excellent especially for OLED users. You'll be able to get those natural black scenes which don't look washed. I have a LG OLED C6 65"" TV and it looks incredible. The Audio is DTS HD 5.1 and  Dolby Digital 5.1 Unfortunately no Dolby Atmos. I highly recommend this movie especially if you're an OLED owner.",1521504000,3,1235,4.460176991150442

1556848,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins was the first of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy (Batman Begins/Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises) - this review will be focusing on the 4K Upgrade rather than the movie itself.

This was one of the first Blu-Ray's, back when the format was competing against HD-DVD. One of the problems back then is that Warner Brothers used the same video file/bitrate as HD-DVD (which had a smaller disc size, hence a lower bitrate/higher compression was needed to make it fit). The Blu-Ray is also nearing 10 years old at this point, so it's definitely in need of an upgrade.

For the 4K release, Christopher Nolan went through and did a full remaster of the release! Unfortunately, and this is possibly due to the way the film was shot, it's very hit-or-miss. Some parts of it look like an obvious upgrade while others are mediocre at best. I will say that this is the best the film has ever looked, but compared to Dark Knight or Dark Knight Rises on 4K.. it leaves some to be desired. For me, the outdoors shots looked great while indoors was a bit disappointing. The HDR, however, is a nice upgrade and probably more noticeable than the clarity.

If you've never purchased the Blu-Ray (or if you're just wanting an upgrade), this is the version to get. I just wish they had gone all out with it.

On the audio side we're also looking at DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio (no Dolby Atmos) but it's a good track still.

The disc comes with a nice slipcover, the 4K Disc and a Blu-Ray + Special Features as well as a digital copy code. You can also pick this up in the Dark Knight Trilogy which has the same content (but no slipcover) or in the Christopher Nolan 4K Collection (which uses a bulky case to house all 7 Christopher Nolan movies and has no digital copy codes)",1513641600,32,1761,4.490625

1557197,5,B00005JNJV,"I am Shere Khan.

 This will be my brief review for the Batman Begins blu-ray disc I purchased through Amazon. In my personal opinion, this is a movie every Batman fan has to see and own. It's spectacular on every level. Since Ben Affleck took on the role of Batman and the entire DC universe currently happening like Marvel's doing, this one stands out as a classic. There will never be another like this.

  Christian Bale is and always will be Batman. I don't care what anybody else says. So many people complain about his raspy voice he uses for the character, I say it's genius. It is a special and unique way of representing Batman as not an ordinary guy, but a monster of the night that criminals fear. If he doesn't change his voice, then he just looks like some man wearing a cool suit but insignificant and I think we all remember George Clooney when we think of a guy dressed in a bat suit looking insignificant. His voice sounded great in this film I think whereas in the films' two sequels, he took the voice up a notch, something noticeable but still great. As Batman he looks and sounds cool and as Bruce Wayne Bale really delivers an emotional performance where we as viewers can relate and understand what he goes through since the death of his parents that eventually leads up to the tragic millionaire becoming the caped crusader. The film did a masterful job exploring Wayne's childhood from the death of his parents to his fear of bats to him coming of age and growing up in anger to him traveling the world looking for a way to leave his old life behind and seek purpose. Bottom line, Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman stands out as the greatest in this tigers' opinion.

 The other actors do splendid as well. Everyone was casted perfectly for their roles and that being said, the film contains a rare epic cast of actors many know and love. Beginning with Michael Caine who is by far the perfect Alfred. The relationship he and Christian Bale possess is the exact kind of relationship Bruce Wayne and Alfred are meant to have with one another that is more than the master/servant connection they have, Alfred being the only family Bruce really ever had vice versa him being all Alfred had for a son. Katie Holmes is beautiful and perfect for the role of Rachel Dawes, Bruces' childhood friend. She and Bale made for a great love pair that it is unfortunate she was replaced with the other actress in the second film. Liam Neeson rocks as the movies' main villain Ras al'Ghul, leader of the League of Shadows. He comes across as a wise, fatherly figure to Wayne and Neeson does it so well that when his character goes to the dark side, it is clear what a great actor he is as his character switches gears and becomes diabolical. Gary Oldman is the perfect movie Gordon I have ever seen up to date. He and Batman share that relationship of honor and respect for one another as partners in justice, very similar to how the characters do in Batman: The Animated Series. The actor who played Scarecrow in the movie is just as disturbed as his comic book counterpart is supposed to be. The special effects for him looked
creepy and amazing. Fianlly, Morgan Freeman brings charisma and warm smiles as Lucius Fox, definitely a worthy comforting presence to have in Batman.

 This is the best film in Christopher Nolans' Dark Knight Trilogy followed by the third sequel The Dark Knight Rises and then the second one (which contrary to what most believe to be the greatest, I see as the weakest). But for me, it's the only one worth owning from all the Batman films. The movie looks great on blu-ray and sounds just as roaring as the Batmobile. The delivery was perfect and the discs' condition looked fresh and new. To conclude, this is if not the best, one of the best superhero movies ever made. Yes it may not be the most action packed due to the slow pace of it, with the flashbacks and everything in the first act, it's story is epic nonetheless. I like a film with a slower pace than most, with less action than most, but with an excellent story. Kind of like the original Star Wars films.

I approve this message. God bless my fellow Amazon shoppers.",1495152000,,4164,4.510610079575597

1557330,5,B00005JNJV,"The perfect start to this thrilling trilogy, quoting Nolan: Bale has the exact balance of light and dark necessary to play Batman. It should be noted that few actors can interpret so masterfully Bruce Wayne and Batman at the same time, are two totally different personalities in the same body and Bale got it to perfection.

The performance of Michael Caine is impeccable and reliable, as we are accustomed. On the other hand Gary Oldman playing Gordon was something I did not expect, I am so used to seeing him in bad roles and I love that despite knowing what Gordon's personality in comics, seeing Oldman always felt in the Background load the character by fighting against the dark side we all carry inside and the relief to see how he always made the right decision.

1557639,2,B00005JNJV,Christian Bale probably plays Batman the way it ought to be played.  With a cynical attitude.  The biggest problem with this movie is it's too long.  Which wouldn't be bad if there was some action it it.  But it takes too long to get going.  It goes from the beginning of the story to how Batman came to be.  It also tells the back story of Commissioner Gordon and how he became Commissioner.  But o me this movie is just too long and drawn out and not very interesting.,1477612800,,470,4.213483146067416

To me, the always awesome Liam Neeson steals so much of this film with his glued-on goatee (that looks a little to thick on the right of his face) with the Jedi-like training of the pre-Batman Christopher Bale (who isn't bad in the title role, but there's something cardboard about him. Actually, during the court sequences with his mop of thick hair I couldn't help but be reminded of the powerless Clark Kent in the original 'Superman II"" right as he's about to be beaten up by the trucker in the diner). The film is passable but not as bright and colorful as earlier version of the character, particularly the Michael Keaton version.

Christian Bale brings Batman to life with all of the emotion of a real person, I guess it takes a real actor to do so. The supporting cast is a group of actors with so much character that they could have had there own movies. Alfred is awesome.

The 2005 Batman Begins directed by Christopher Nolan was an absolutely stunning masterpiece for a 2005 film. The breathtaking special effects in conjunction with its fascinating and layered plot make for a movie ahead of its time. Batman Begins starts with the classic story of childhood Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) falling into a well and being traumatized by bats. The plot now begins a series of well-crafted flashbacks to Waynes childhood (which reveals the story behind the murder of his parents) and to present day in which Ras al Ghul (Liam Neeson) has begun to teach Bruce Wayne the arts of The League of Shadows. The story really begins to take off when Wayne decides to try to save Gotham, the city he loves while Ras al Ghul tries to destroy it. This is a central message of the film; the story of good vs evil as well as the student vs the teacher. The construct of the Batman Begins plot is one rivaled by few.
The main plot of Batman vs Ras al Ghul is just the surface of the story, and is complimented with many other aspects of the film. Below the main story of the antagonist are secondary enemies such as Carmine Falcone and The Scarecrow that are introduced early in the film to confuse and throw off viewers. Viewers feel a sense of victory and relief when those secondary enemies are defeated but are quickly thrown into a hole of confusion when an enemy from the first 15 minutes of the film comes back to destroy Gotham. Ducard, aka Ras al Ghul is above Bruce Wayne throughout the film. Whether he be knocking Bruce down while training him for the League of Shadows or standing over Batman while burns Wayne manor to the ground, Ducard always has the upper hand over the protagonist. However, at the very end of the film, Batman momentarily stands over Ducard before flying away before the train plummets to its destruction. Beneath all the plot twists lies a romantic subplot between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes. A girl that Wayne had loved years earlier is once again thrust into his life and is, like many superhero movies, in danger once again. Bruce Wayne must now balance his feelings for her with his responsibilities to the city. This conflict is perfectly illustrated as Wayne destroys houses, cop cars and homes while racing to save Dawes life after she was poisoned. This devotion has grown since the start of the movie where Bruce briefly saw Rachel at a hotel and quickly dismissed her to the past. This amazing plot goes even deeper when Alfred comes into play. Alfred plays many roles that compliment Bruce Waynes Batman and take the film from good to exceptional. First and most notable is Alfreds comic relief that he provides to the film. Whether he be cracking a joke at the absurdity of Bruces actions or making a witty retort when being scrutinized for awkwardly putting Rachel in the back of a car, Alfred provides that light, yet important comic relief to the film. Without it, the film would seem too dark and serious (especially for a film thats over two hours long). Alfreds secondary role is his care taker of Bruce Wayne. He has been like a father to Bruce since his parents passed away and took care of Wayne Manor long after Bruce disappeared. He takes care of Bruce when he is hurt and offers wisdom only a parental figure could give. His tertiary (and less noticed) roll is his role as Batmans side-kick. Batman has no robin in this series and is seemingly left to his own devices. However, Alfred is always there at his side. Alfred helps Bruce design the bat cave, protects Rachel, and even saves Bruces life from the fire.  These actions make Alfred arguably the most important secondary character in the series. Between these characteristics and layers, this plot is one for the ages. However, one aspect of the film that moves it into a different orbit are its brilliant visual effects.
For a 2005 film, with technology of that era, Batman Begins cinematography is absolutely out-of-this world. Primarily, the miniatures that took over 3 months to film. These shots beautifully illustrate a Chicago-based Gotham city that combines beautiful architecture as well as a dark sense of evil overwhelming the population. The shots are even more stunning when the water main is vaporized sending man-hole covers 50 feet in the air, steam exploding across the set. Besides its miniatures, Batman Begins set locations are impressive. The crew traveled from Chicago to England, and even hit major locations like Iceland and London. These locations make the movie feel like it takes place across the global scale. On top of the shooting locations and styles, the films special effects are what make the film to me. The Scarecrows poison gas creates effects of fear and distortion that cause mental breakdowns into insanity. While this type of hallucination is hard to create, the producers and special effects artists illustrate this wonderfully. The twitching camera as well as the dark and unnatural scenes perfectly show the effects of this poison. These filming aspects compliment the plot in such a way that make Batman Begins arguably the most advanced superhero film in the last decade.
 This film is a jewel among superhero films in our time. Its multilayer plot creates a deep and emotional story line that draw in the viewer and take them on a journey that make them feel anger, empathy and joy. It can make viewers crack up with laughter and even bring them to tears. The depth of the plot create a story that can be enjoyed by all. Combining such a strong plot with such artful filming makes Batman Begins one of the most exceptional films to date. No wonder that this film is one of the top grossing, and most influential superhero films in our generation. Batman Begins uses its exceptional imagery, symbolism, and multilayered plot to weave a tale unlike anything before it. Every post-Batman Begins-era film should take a lesson from this movie on how to create a world so real it captures everyone who watches it and transports them into a world of mystery, suspense and action. This movie transports viewers into the world of Batman.",1446681600,2,6254,4.741046831955923

1558814,5,B00005JNJV,Fun and thrilling,1446508800,,17,5.0
1558815,5,B00005JNJV,"In 2005 Christopher Nolan directed the first of 3 new Batman films Batman Begins stars actors Christian Bale as Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, Liam Neeson as Ducard/Ras Al Gul, Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, and Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. It is based around the origin story of the super hero and his mission to save Gotham from corruption and crime. Through much of the beginning of the film we go between a young Bruce Wayne and the older Bruce Wayne. The scenes with young Bruce provide the backstory of Batman and establish some of the characters motivations, his fear of bats, and beliefs. The scenes with old Bruce show what he is doing now to act on his motivations and beliefs. The flashbacks help to provide us with the full origin story of the character and the super hero Batman. Once he comes back to Gotham and starts to amass an arsenal of different gadgets and devices that will aid him in taking down the criminals and corrupt people of Gotham, especially Carmine Falcone. As he makes progress on taking down the corrupt that plague Gotham he learns that there is more to the issue than meets the eye. We are introduced to the super villain Scarecrow and also we learn of the return of the character Ducard who was really Ras Al Gul. We also learn of their mission to take down Gotham. Once Ras Al Ghuls plan goes into action Batman goes to combat the madness and fear that Scarecrow and Ras Al Ghul have caused throughout the city.
 Throughout the film there are clear messages and motifs but I believe that the most critical message is that we shouldnt let our fear control us; we should control our fear. This message is successfully conveyed through the use of costume, lighting, and key scenes that didn't rely on such attributes. Since much of this message is focused on Bruce Waynes development throughout the film, my focus will be on what Christopher Nolan does with the character to convey his most critical message.
 The first key scene that really starts to build up the critical message is one of the many flashbacks that we experience in the intro. Soon after Bruces fear of bats and the darkness is established we witness a flashback of Bruce and his parents attending an opera which contains people in bat costumes flying around the stage. We see that the bat costumes make Bruce uncomfortable which leads to him and his parents leaving the theater out a side exit into a sketchy alley and into the hands of the mugger Joe Chill who would kill both of Bruces parents. This scene is so important because it establishes the importance of not allowing your fears to control you. If Bruce hadnt let his fear of bats control him his parents probably wouldnt have died that night. Now Im not saying that Bruce was the cause of the death of his parents, but rather pointing out how when we let or fears control us like that there will be unintended negative consequences. This message of not letting fear control us is also echoed in various scenes throughout the movie that involve the crime boss Carmine Falcone and his use fear to bring Gotham to its knees.
 The use of costume design in the movie also contributes to the overall message as we witness Bruce gain control of his fears. In the film we see Bruce go through many costume changes, many of them representing different stages of his development. One of the most outstanding costume changes was the gradual increase in dark clothing and armor that he would wear as he went through his training and the development of the Batman persona. Before his training we never see him in any dark clothing but by the end of the training he is in full black armor, then he has the unmodified suit when he goes back to Gotham, and then the Bat suit. This progression reveals how the character Bruce is starting to control his fears rather than being controlled by them and how it makes him stronger. As these costume changes progress he seems to become stronger and takes more action against the crime in Gotham as his armor becomes darker and more advanced.
 The use of lighting also plays a role in conveying the critical message of the film. Much like the progression of Bruces costumes the lighting that Bruce is in gets darker and darker as he develops his identity as Batman. As he works through his training and works to become the Batman he takes his fear of darkness and makes it a larger part of his identity and how he acts. This means he acts more in the shadows and in the darkness, places where its hard to see him or cant see him at all because of his costume. Bruce uses the darkness and the fear of the darkness to his advantage when he confronts criminals and those who have escaped justice in the past. He ducks in and out of the darkness, keeping his enemies guessing and afraid. Also when we see him return to Gotham he goes back down into the wheel that he fell in at the beginning of the film where it is very dark and also full of bats. He goes from living in this mansion that is very well lit to spending most of his time in his bat cave which is dark and full of bats.
 Overall through the combination of all these attributes it was clear what the message of the film was and it made for a very compelling movie that was well made and full of great actors. The message of fear was consistent throughout the film and watching its development through different key scenes, costumes, and lighting choices was interesting to watch because it helped the viewer understand what drives Bruce to become Batman and also visually see the changes that he is going through as he develops his new persona. It was also a unique message and perspective for a super hero because we often don't see super heroes have fear or heroes that are driven and made by fear.",1446508800,,5750,4.503831417624521

Then the last hour and half is a great action adventure movie full of great fight scenes, an amazing car chase sceen have to watch to witness it for yourself, and a villan who usally plays a good guy but a villian you love to hate to start this trilogy off.  I only gave this movie a 4 star rating because of the first part of the movie but the movie is saved by the acting of the main actor plus Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain.  The movie also ends on the setting the path for Batman's next villan to take on in the movie The Dark Knight.

Don`t get me wrong the story is great but the acting is not. Christian Bale did not portray Batman like he should have. For me it is the voice that he uses to portray both Bruce Wayne and Batman, yes both voices should be different and unique at the same time. Christian overdoes it with Batman, to deep and to raspy. No this is not a jab at him, their have been many other actors to portray Batman and do much worse, George Clooney just an example.

1559658,4,B00005JNJV,"I never cared about Batman, couldn't understand others fascination, and I was never impressed with his mythology  the tragedy he suffered as a young boy.  Because he had no superpowers, and there didn't seem to be anything that elevated or distinguished him above other superheroes, except wealth and gadgets, I just didn't care.

I enjoyed the campy series featuring Adam West.  Ive seen the other Batman films with Michael Keaton, and George Clooney, and Val Kilmer in the titular role.  And though I rooted for Batman to win over his nemesis, I was still distant from caring about Batman as a superhero.

This film changed all that.

We all know Batmans childhood was bleak.  But never was it brought to light more than this film.  Years later, I still recall the young Bruce Wayne recoiling with horror because of the bats.  Never has any film brought to light how tormented Batman was  until this film.  He might be rich and handsome and have a solid support base, but he is still suffering.

I love this film.  Christian Bale is perfect in this role.  He conveys so beautifully Batmans depth, his need to be great, and also his vulnerabilities.

If I had a quibble it was in the character of Rachel Dawes.  The sanctimoniousness and stupidity of the character really irritated me, and I don't know if Katie Holmes recognized that, and therefore, played her deadpan, or if she was just not good in the role.  I will say that in The Dark Knight, I actually loathed the character of Rachel Dawes more.  Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a solid performance, and she was praised, but for me (personally), Rachel Dawes came off sanctimoniousness, with tunnel vision, gloating, and even sadistic, and her presence almost ruined the film for me.  She was like a Judge Judy litigant cross-bred with Nancy Grace and then given a heavy tranquilizer to make her more demure, but all the bad parts eked through.

Still, I love this reboot.  Despite Rachel Dawes  yuck.",1433030400,2,1952,4.7611940298507465
1559659,4,B00005JNJV,"The ""Batman"" comics were already popular when I was a kid in the 1950s, and at that time I had hoped there would be something better on the big screen than the corny 1943 serial, ""The Batman,"" of which I had seen a chapter or two.  I was doubly frustrated in the 1960s when the Adam West television series only seemed to ridicule the Caped Crusader.

So it was a long but worthwhile wait until Tim Burton's ""Batman"" in 1989, which became one of my favorite superhero movies.  Yet with each successive ""Batman,"" I saw the franchise fall further and further into the campy style of the old TV show.  By the third and fourth installments of the movie series, I had again given up hope.

Then came 2005's ""Batman Begins,"" cowritten and directed by Christopher Nolan, and I was happy all over again.  I found the movie spellbinding, easily among my favorite films of the year.  While it didn't conjure up quite the mystique of Burton's film, it had, like Burton's movie, abandoned the look of a colorful old comic book for the darker, more realistic aspect of a graphic novel.  I'm glad Nolan resolved to go back to square one and take everything more seriously for a change, loading his cast with fine, serious actors like Michael Caine, who steals the show, and Morgan Freeman, a close second.  Then, too, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Katie Holmes portray characters who are plausible as well.  And Christian Bale is the first actor in the title role who actually fits my mental image of Batman.  In Nolan's hands, this is no mere comic-book character; this is a Knight Noir.

""Batman Begins"" is a rethinking of the cinematic ""Batman"" saga, and as the title suggests, it starts by going back to the beginnings of the ""Batman"" legend suggested by the early comics.  The first half of the movie, and the best part in my opinion, recounts the origins of Batman:  How an angry, disillusioned young billionaire, Gotham City's Bruce Wayne, travels to the ends of the Earth to study the criminal mind and grapple with his own fears, forever seeking a means to fight the injustice he sees around him.

Eventually, on the edge of nowhere, he finds the counsel he's looking for in the League of Shadows, a centuries' old secret society bent on checking world corruption.  Here, he learns to look inward, face himself, and draw on his inner as well as outer strength.  Besides learning new martial-arts skills, Wayne learns several other things:  He discovers that theatricality and deception are powerful weapons and that ""You always fear what you don't understand,"" notions that would presage his eventual donning of cape and mask to become the melodramatic Dark Knight.

The film takes great pains to present every detail of its plot and characters as things that might actually happen, no matter how preposterous.  There is no radioactive bat biting Bruce Wayne and turning him into an instant superhero with supernatural powers.  Wayne is an ordinary human being with extraordinary sensibilities, a strong physical makeup, access to high-tech gadgetry, and a ton of money.  What he decides to become as ""Batman"" seems entirely within the realm of possibility (if not probability).  Even the Batmobile, here the Tumbler, is a believable real-life incarnation of the hackneyed comic-book creation.

Then, the second half of the film takes us closer to comic-book territory with a far-fetched plot involving madmen attempting to destroy the ""decadent"" Gotham City by pouring hallucinogenic drugs into the city's water supply and using a microwave emitter to vaporize it and cause panic in the streets.  ""If you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy.""  While it's all very silly and tends to diminish somewhat the more realistic goings-on that preceded it, I have no objection to anything that happens.  Comic-book plots are comic-book plots, no matter how earnestly their creators present them, and one has to accept such conventions if one is to appreciate any work in the genre.

Everybody in the film, heroes and villains alike, are more true-to-life than in previous ""Batman"" movies and come close to being almost believable in Nolan's vision.  This is no tongue-in-cheek spoof.  Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne may not exhibit the haunted complexities of Michael Keaton's Batman, but we are able to see in Bale's characterization a strong moral courage and a determination to do good.  ""What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?"" asks his friend Rachel (Katie Holmes).  He resolves to be one of those ""good people"" who will stand up and fight.

Nevertheless, as sympathetic as Bale is in the role, Nolan hedges his bets by surrounding the actor with a supporting cast to die for, peripheral characters who despite their number the director weaves well into the fabric of the plot and who never detract from the movie's focus on Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Michael Caine as the surrogate father figure, Alfred the butler, for example, is good enough to get his own show.  I've always thought there were three actors in Hollywood who consistently transcended their material, routinely putting in great performances even when the scripts were against them, and in this movie (which does not work against them at any rate) we get two of these folks:  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.  (I missed only Gene Hackman among this magic three.)  Freeman plays Lucius Fox, an old friend of Bruce's father whom Bruce comes to trust; and whom we come to trust just as much as Bruce does.

Liam Neeson plays Henri Ducard, a strong, tough, wise, but vaguely sinister mentor, a role Neeson seems consigned to play forever unless he puts a stop to it.  Well, OK, he does it so well, one can't blame him, but really--""Star Wars,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and now ""Batman Begins""?  Next up, it's gratifying to see Gary Oldman portraying a good guy for a change as Sgt. James Gordon, and Oldman has played so many Americans in films it's hard to remember that he's British.  Cillian Murphy is perfectly cast as the slimy Dr. Jonathan Crane, alias the Scarecrow; but make no mistake, the villains are not any more superhuman than Batman is.  The Scarecrow works his mischief with a crude burlap mask and a powerful hallucinogen.  Then, there's Tom Wilkinson as a ruthless crime boss, Rutger Hauer as a scheming business partner, and Ken Watanabe as a shadowy cult figure, all equally up to the task.  Even Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's romantic interest (the romance admittedly taking a backseat to the rest of the story) is fine, although she appears too young to be the Assistant District Attorney of a major city.

In a nod to ""Batman Begins"" fitting into the world of the earlier films as well as the comic books (several minor but notable inconsistencies aside), I liked the way Nolan ends his tale with a signal of things to come in subsequent installments.  Without giving too much away, the ending tells us about the construction of a new Batcave; Sgt. Gordon's becoming Lt. Gordon, suggesting a Commissioner Gordon in the future; and, most important, the escape of a whole passel of inmates from the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane, foreshadowing the various loonies dressing up in costume to commit their evildoings, one in particular who at the scene of his crimes leaves his calling card, a Joker.

OK, did I have any misgivings about this new venture?  Of course, but I didn't find them severe enough to spoil my enthusiasm for the movie.  First, I found director Nolan's fondness for close-ups and quick edits a bit off-putting, not only in the fight scenes but throughout the picture.  Nolan probably uses so many of these devices because he believes they involve the audience more in the action and, just as likely, because he believes people expect this of an action film.  As far as I can tell, this was Nolan's first outright adventure movie, and while he does a superb job moving things forward, it is clear he's feeling his way along like anybody else.

Next, there's James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer's score that tries hard to recall Danny Elfman's original ""Batman"" music without actually duplicating it.  The new score succeeds mainly in sounding louder and less inspired than before, reminding us once again how unique Elfman's music was.  However, I won't complain too much since the new score does have an epic, heroic sweep that grows on a person, especially as the film wears on.

Then there's the matter of the villains, something I mentioned earlier as primarily a plus.  What I didn't mention is the lesser problem that ""Batman Begins"" offers us a layering of villains throughout rather than a single dominant force.  Although I can understand how the surprise factor in using multiple evildoers can keep an audience on edge, I also feel it tends to water down our fear of any one scoundrel, particularly when we don't know who is at the top of the hierarchy.

Still, these are minor quibbles in a film that succeeded in keeping my attention from beginning to end.  I've seen it a record (for me) seven times now in three years--twice in a regular theater, once in IMAX, once on SD DVD, twice on HD-DVD--and now in Blu-ray.  And you know what?  I look forward to watching it again.

Video:
I spent the better part of an hour comparing the picture quality of the Blu-ray and HD DVD editions of this movie, both of them using VC-1/1080p transfers, the Blu-ray on a dual-layer BD50, the HD DVD on a dual-layer HD30.  I first compared still pictures from each disc, pausing at the beginning of chapters and switching back-and-forth.  Then I did the same thing with moving pictures, again switching to-and-fro.  At one point, I put on my reading glasses and examined the screen from about eight inches away.  I must have looked at the same spot on the same wallpaper fifty times, checking both versions for sharpness and clarity.  In the end, I had to conclude that if Warner Bros. did anything different with the Blu-ray transfer, they pretty much fooled me.  After all this, an audio-video insider friend assured me that the Blu-ray transfer is a direct port of the HD DVD release, so the two versions should, indeed, be identical.

No doubt any minute differences I may have noticed were so miniscule they have to have been characteristics of the two disc players I was using (a Panasonic BD30 and a Toshiba A35) rather than differences in the transfers themselves.  So, if you already own the HD DVD version, there is little reason to replace it.  In any case, the BD screen size measures the same 2.40:1 ratio as the HD DVD, with the same pleasing delineation, rich and radiant colors, solid contrasts, and well-detailed textures.  The fact is, both versions of ""Batman Begins""--Blu-ray and HD DVD--look almost as good as anything I've seen in either format.  Yes, it's a dark film, but inner nuances are still good, even in duskier sections of the screen, and black levels are inky black on my CRT television.

Incidentally, I've read the criticisms leveled at Warner engineers for supposedly using too much DNR on the encode to clean up grain, in the process smoothing over detail and softening some of the image.  I dunno.  It's true the movie appeared to have more grain when I saw it originally in IMAX, but that giant screen exaggerates everything.  In a regular theater, the movie seemed very clean.  I think both of WB's high-def transfers look good.  Facial features are a bit soft, as I've said in previous reviews, but most things are in fairly sharp focus compared to practically every other high-def movie I've watched, and the overall video quality is quite attractive.

Audio:
The Blu-ray disc makes the English audio available in lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and regular Dolby Digital 5.1.  Either way, it is as good as the video.  In Dolby Digital, I found big dynamic contrasts and a robust deep bass.  In Dolby TrueHD I found a small but noticeable improvement in sonic quality.  In TrueHD the dynamic surges and impact, pinpoint surround activity, taut bass, extended frequency response, realistic clarity, and wide, open feeling of depth and breadth are more prominent than ever.  Yes, I also spent a few minutes comparing the TrueHD tracks on the Blu-ray and HD DVD discs, and again I found no discernable differences.  There is no reason I can think of for either of the TrueHD tracks to sound any better than the other, and they don't.

Remember, though, that on both the BD and HD DVD discs the default settings are regular Dolby Digital.  As happens more often than I like to admit, I was ten or fifteen minutes into the movie before I thought to switch over to TrueHD.  I wish that owners could set their players or receivers to automatically detect and play back the best available audio codecs, but as yet most equipment doesn't work that way, and it's usually up to absentminded fellows like me to remember to do it.  Oh, well....

Extras:
The bonus features on the Blu-ray Limited Edition Giftset include everything found on the HD DVD and more.

The first major item on the disc itself is the In-Movie Experience, which basically replaces a regular audio commentary.  The filmmakers take you behind the scenes as you're watching the film, providing small image inserts, comics, special effects, and the like, all on screen along the way.  Because it took a while to develop the capability for Blu-ray to reproduce this feature and because Warner Bros. apparently didn't want to release the Blu-ray disc without it, the studio postponed the BD edition for some time.  Now that it's here, it's worth the wait, unless, as I say, you already own the HD DVD.  (Note, though, that you must use a BD player with BonusView or BD-Live capability in order to access this extra.)

After the ""In-Movie Experience"" you'll find another exclusive high-def bonus, the first six-and-a-half minutes of the IMAX ""Prologue"" (16x9) to the movie's sequel, ""The Dark Knight,"" in high definition.

Following the ""Prologue"" is a section of ""Additional Footage"" that contains ""Reflections on Writing Batman Begins"" with David S. Goyer, two minutes; ""Digital Batman,"" the effects you may have missed, a little over one minute; and ""Batman Begins Stunts,"" two minutes.

The longest section is called ""Beyond the Story,"" which includes eleven sections.  There is MTV's ""Tankman Begins,"" a cute parody lasting about five minutes, integrating scenes from the movie with added shots of Jimmy Fallon and a surprise guest.  Next is ""Batman: The Journey Begins,"" a fourteen-minute documentary on the development and casting of the film.  It's typical of such making-of documentaries, with comments from the director and filmmakers, plus excerpts from the movie.  After that is ""Shaping Mind and Body,"" twelve minutes on Christian Bale's transformation into Batman.  Then it's ""Gotham City Rises,"" twelve minutes on the creation of Gotham City, the Batcave, Wayne Manor, and more.  Following that is ""Cape and Cowl,"" eight minutes on the development of the new Batsuit; ""Batman: The Tumbler,"" thirteen minutes on the reinvention of the Batmobile; ""Path to Discovery,"" a fourteen-minute look at the first week of filming in Iceland; ""Saving Gotham City,"" thirteen minutes on the miniatures, CGI, and effects for the monorail chase scene; and ""Genesis of the Bat,"" a fourteen-minute look at the Dark Knight's incarnation and influences on the film.

The extras on the disc conclude with ""Confidential Files,"" which lists and explains ""Hardware,"" ""Enemies,"" and ""Allies and Mentors"" in the story; a stills gallery; forty scene selections (but no chapter insert); and a widescreen theatrical trailer.  There are English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

As usual with a Warner Bros. Blu-ray disc, this one also includes pop-up menus, bookmarks, and an indicator of elapsed time.

In addition to the Blu-ray disc, the Limited Edition Giftset contains several other fun items.  Foremost, there is what WB call ""lenticular"" artwork.  I guess this is what I would call a 5"" x 7"" holographic photograph, and it is startlingly realistic in its 3D depth.  Then, there are five collectable postcards, also 5"" x 7""; a thirty-two-page booklet containing script pages, storyboards, and film stills from ""The Dark Knight"" prologue; a sixteen-page DC Comics adaptation of ""The Dark Knight"" prologue; and a coupon worth up to $7.50 to see ""The Dark Knight.""  OK.  You're getting the idea that the ""Batman Begins"" giftset heavily promotes ""The Dark Knight.""  Life could be worse.

Parting Thoughts:
Is ""Batman Begins"" the best superhero film of all time?  I have no idea.  But is it entertaining?  You bet.  There have been few films over the years I liked well enough to watch as many times as I have watched this one, with the story and characters holding up each time.  I found the movie creative, energetic, imaginative, involving, and even a little inspiring.  Its edgy tone and dark atmosphere coupled with its comic-book theatrics make it a winning combination for older children and adults alike.  If this Blu-ray version can't sell the film to a whole new group of home-theater buffs, nothing can.",1432944000,,17333,4.916122378824339

1560011,5,B00005JNJV,"Great return from what became of Batman in the unspeakably horrific 1997 Batman and Robin.  Batman Begins starts out as an origin story, but the pace moves it along quickly until Batman appears.  This is the only movie of the trilogy where Batman uses bats for assistance and where we see him use his gadgets to leave an area, unlike the sequels, where he just disappears.  The only thing I can complain about is Scarecrow, who I feel was pretty much wasted.  I saw promotions, pictures, and figures of him as a little kid during all the hype, and when I saw the movie, I was let down that he got taken out quickly by his own gas and then by a taser.  He looked scary in the mask, but didn't do much.  All that aside, I liked the action scenes and the characters.  I thought Christian Bale portrayed a good Bruce Wayne and Batman, Michael Caine was good as Alfred, and so on...  Batman Begins is dark and serious, entertaining, and a fantastic re-imagining of the character.  While not as twisted or entertaining as The Dark Knight, This is a solid and well-made movie.",1427414400,,1069,4.441025641025641

1560590,3,B00005JNJV,"I would actually give this film a 2 1/2 star rating.  I thought the film was very average for a superhero action film.  Now before all the fanboys thrash my review.  Keep in mind I liked Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.  It was way better than the god awful Joel Schumacher films.  But I still believe Tim Burton's first 2 Batman movies were the best so far (Yes that includes ""The Dark Night"" more on that later).  I am probably in the minority but so be it.

I wondered about this movie even before seeing it in the theatres.  Did we really need another origin story.  Hollywood always seems the need to reboot a superhero genre instead of just having the characters be caught up to the present day.  This film was much better than the Spiderman reboot several years later.

Batman Begins had a few to many slow points for me.  The action is definitely there but it is not always shot correctly on camera.  I am referring to the fight scene with Scarecrow in the apartment building.  That was so poorly shot you could not tell what was going on. I know the title is ""Batman Begins"" but maybe it should have been called Batman Year 1 or something similar.  It might have been interesting to see Christian Bale start out clumsy as Batman fighting criminals and progress into an elite crime fighter.  Kind of a learning the ropes type of thing.  There is a lot to like about this film I liked the railway system in the city a large scale L train.  I enjoyed the crooked cop aspect where it seemed like Gordon was the only honest policeman on the force.  Altogether though I don't see how people call this a great film.

I did not like the fact that like Joel Schumacher Christopher Nolan uses multiple villain characters in each of his Batman movies.  I think it would have been better to stick with 1 villain for most of the film and set up the next movie with the entrance of another main villain rather than have Batman constantly trying to fight 2 villains at once.  For instance ""Scarecrow"" why not just use him as the main villain for the  entire film.  They could have built up the backstory for Scarecrow with more character development that would have been much more interesting than the Batman Origin story. I thought Cillian Murphy did an excellent job as that villain.  The thing about the origin stuff is it takes almost 1/3rd of the movie before the star finally becomes Batman and unless it is really well done the audience is probably not going to care which makes it unnecessary.

That being said Liam Nielson was excellent as the Ras al Ghul character.  I wish the film spent more time on his character rather than the origin stuff. If the story stayed with his progression instead of the ""Scarecrow"" maybe it would have been a even better movie.

Christian Bale is a good actor.  I thought he would make a very good Batman which for the most part he does besides the stupid growl in his voice when he has the outfit on. I think he did a good job.  He can pull off the flamboyant playboy character with lots of charm.  He definitely looks the part physically and has the appearance of intelligence.

Michael Caine as Alfred is another great actor for that role.  Other than not being bald he nails it and is a delight every time you see him onscreen.

This film definitely had a great cast and all the pieces to be a great film.  I just do not think it achieved that acclaim.  I found the film ok at best.  I kind of wished the director would have taken the story in a different direction and cleaned up some of the fight scenes, and concentrated more on Batman learning to fight crime in the city rather than off in China somewhere.",1421193600,,3653,4.422788605697152

1560680,5,B00005JNJV,"I can not count the number of times I have seen Batman Begins. When the movie first released back in 2005, I did not get the opportunity to see the movie in theatres, but my first time seeing the movie was after opening it on Christmas morning of that year. And not only did Batman Begins stay true to the character, but it provided the audience with an unforgettable experience.

After a fight between Bruce Wayne and a couple of fellow prisoners., Bruce meets a certain man ""Henri Ducard"" who knows exactly who Bruce is and offers Bruce a path for Bruce to conquer his fear and become something greater. And as Bruce returns to Gotham, he realizes that as a man, he has vulnerabilities but as a symbol he can not only stand for something, but he can in fact inspire good.

Christian Bale gained a great ordeal of muscle mass and read Batman comics for preparation of the character; while he also uses the Keysi fighting technique. All that being said, Bale is able to master the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman exactly as he should. Bruce has this combination of fear and rage, and Bale immerses those characteristics in his portrayal. And that being said it goes to show Christian Bale's full appreciation/understanding of the character. Michael Caine's portrayal as Alfred is very admirable, and I love how he reminds Bruce the importance of his family name. As Jim Gordon, Gary Oldman succeeds at being the character that is one of the few good cops left in Gotham. Morgan Freeman is equally just as sharp and funny as Lucius Fox. Cillian Murphy is an actor I consider underrated/ I wish he were in movies more often. And he completely owns his role as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. What is likable about his performance is the creepy, sarcastic nature he embodies in the character. Liam Neeson plays ""Henri Ducard"" and I LOVE how he portrays the character. ""Henri"" does not view justice the way Bruce does. He believes that through tactics of terror and suffering, the world then can finally become a better place. Katie Holmes plays Bruce's longtime friend and interest Rachel Dawes, and her performance works well.

If the acting in Batman Begins deserves heaps of praise, then so does the story. With themes of fear and justice, Batman Begins succeeds in terms of telling us the origin of Bruce Wayne/Batman; while still being able to deliver a great movie. The realism of the Nolan Batman movies has been both praised and criticized but that is where these movies(including Batman Begins) feel genuinely different( in a great way).

But above all else, Batman Begins is a great movie thanks to acting talent, the brilliance of the story and the brilliance of Christopher Nolan. I definitely consider Batman Begins as one of (if not the best) best origin movies ever made. And for those reasons, Batman Begins is

A GREAT Experience

With a brillant casting, lead by a very convincing Christian Bale and some of the most clever actors of the last 20 years (Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson) and an epic as ever music by the incredible Hans Zimmer, BATMAN BEGINS delivers a high quality entertainment. Drawing the lines of Bruce Wayne's dilemnas and complexity, Nolan clearly sets this movie as an introduction to his saga even if it weakens a bit the end-result.

Didn't George Clooney kill the Batman franchise Forever?"" When this movie came out on DVD, I rented it as part of a two for one rental deal. This movie was the free one. WOW! What a pleasant surprise this movie was. The thing I like most about this movie is the character development of the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Director Christopher Nolan has done a fantastic job bringing new life to this franchise that had grown old and tired over the years.",1417910400,,576,4.548076923076923

1561150,1,B00005JNJV,This is just to notify anyone who plans on getting Ultra Violet version. These discs are not normal retail discs as they have to be taken to be taken to a Way mart to do so. You are better off buying a used original release version then you can convert it with the Vudu app for windows. I have done over 50 conversions to UV and the Batman trilogy have been the only ones that need to be taken to Walmart.

The film brings to the big screen about the story of how Bruce Wayne,who leads a privileged life,brings it upon himself to providing protection to the citizens of the crime-ridden Gotham City by disguising himself as a masked caped crusader after his parents were murdered. This movie provides a new genre for it is dark which the viewer would find new aside from being exciting and entertaining. Added to that,it was also great in production values and special effects. It is definitely far from the Adam West-starred TV series known for its ""Pow!!Wham!!!"" and a lot better than the 90's Batman movie series. For this reason,it provides reverence and respect to Batman which is known as The Dark Knight which the enduring superhero badly needs and a treatment that it truly deserves.",1413244800,,851,4.875862068965517

I don't know what I would have changed, maybe a one-on-one battle between Batman and Ra's Al Ghul. We get this huge build up of mini battles and then at the very end we get nothing. Same in the dark knight & dark knight rises. But Chris Nolan isn't the only one victim to the battle royal letdown. Most movies have failed to give us the great protagonist vs antagonist showdown. Other than that: awesome Batman movie, I love comic books, fantastic action scenes, Christian Bale brings solid martial arts to the action scenes. A must own for Batman lovers.

The story and acting in this film is both top notch.  Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  I have watched this movie about 10 times, it is very rewatchable.  That is an important factor for most when purchasing a movie.  It isn't the type of movie that is good but not good enough to watch multiple times, you will certainly want to watch it again.  Great story and thrilling action.
As far as the blu-ray, I found the video quality to certainly be better than the DVD but it isn't top notch compared to what I think it could be.  The audio is very good.  I wouldn't be surprised if this movie is released on blu-ray again with improved video quality.

This movie is excellent and certainly worth a purchase.  However, I recommend waiting until you get a deal for around $7 or less because the video quality isn't top notch and I wouldn't be surprised if it were released with better picture quality in the future.",1412726400,2,1131,4.441747572815534

His father, a medical doctor who gave back to the City of Gotham in the form of Wayne Enterprises and also with the building and financing of a hospital, among many other institutions and philanthropic deeds. The Bruce Wayne - Family, genuinely cared about everyone in need and proved it, time and again, by their supreme generosity and charitable fund raisers. This love, honor and protection of the people was instilled within their only and beloved son, the 'Batman', to be. But, in order to become this mysterious Bat Crusader - the helper of mankind, he first had to overcome his own fear of bats and take stock of, who he was as an individual. In addition to a thorough review of all the luxuries, gifts, talents and finances that were afforded to him and the purpose, thereof. His priorities needed to be straight as well as, his motives. But the biggest hurdle he had to overcome was his justifiable rage at the double-murder of his parents, which he witnessed as a child. Orphaned and alone, without relatives to care for him, he is the sole beneficiary of the immense personal wealth and corporate revenue which his late parents netted, during their short lives. However, this scared and tramatized, darling, little boy was not left without mercy. In that, Alfred - the live-in butler whose loyalty and integrity to the Wayne Family and their estate, was beyond reproach... was rewarded and entrusted with the love, care and overall welfare of this now, orphaned, billionaire boy: Bruce Wayne. The two bonded but the horror of his parents' senseless murder never, left him. As a result, apart of him grew into a bewildered, angry, vengeful state of manhood which needed to be channeled properly and some... for his own good, altogether extinguished. And so, Bruce the man, left the luxurious creature comforts of home and familiar surroundings to try and find himself and the purpose for which his life..., was spared. Action, drama, adventure, teamwork with an honest, genuinely caring, then Detective: Jim Gordon. Who, was kind and compassionate to him as a boy right after his parents were murdered... and was now, the Police Chief in Gotham City. Along with, Lucius Fox - his ingenious, scientific friend, who had worked for his late father, combine their creative forces to overcome evil with protective good. The origins of Batman are all here, especially within this 2-disc, Deluxe Edition, DVD set. Dear reader, if you have a 'fear of bats' before watching this, you probably won't fear them after viewing this big-screen 'Bat' film. Because this 'Batman' really cares and is here, to help all those in need. So, go ahead and pop the popcorn and watch this Super Hero, keeper. Nina Kish",1409184000,,2841,4.859793814432989

1562119,5,B00005JNJV,My favorite Barman movie. Saw it in theaters with little expectations but I  surprisingly really liked it.  Usually I  go for romantic comedies.,1401148800,3,144,5.173913043478261
1562120,5,B00005JNJV,Scarecrow is in this one. The city is under attack and Batman has to save the day. This one is more focused on his past and building the character Batman.,1400889600,3,154,4.166666666666667
1562121,5,B00005JNJV,"Okay...first off, I have to priase this film for the fact that the hero from the comic books wasn't facing off against his well-known arch-foe (i.e. Batman vs. The Joker, Superman vs. Lex Luthor, etc.)  That fact in itself brings something special to the plot.  It was nice to see Liam Neeson play that ""wise master"" role that he's pulled off so well before, but now with a villainous twist.  Incorperating him into Bruce Wayne's journey towards becoming Batman definetly made him more cunning and dangerous as he knew all of Batman's moves and stradegies.  Cillian Murphy was creepy as the Scarecrow, bringing a sense of sophistication to the role befitting of his intelligence.  In conjunction with my opening remark, it was nice to see a lesser-known villain become such a threat to all of Gotham.  Also, his mask, or that burlap sack, was a nice touch.  We don't all have the resources to become a supervillain with the high-end costume to terrorize the city in...sometimes we have to make do with what we can find in the garage, and it worked out for the better here.  But for all the super-baddies, there was an element of realism in Gotham's criminal underworld, exhibited by Tom Wilkinson as the reigning mob boss of Gotham (the city's own Al Capone) and Richard Brake as the mugger who killed Bruce Wayne's parents.  These and others are just as great to watch as their more theatrical counterparts.  As for the good guys, there's a ""dream team"" cast that is so worth watching.  Playing Alfred Pennyworth and James Gordan respectively, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman gave these characters much more to do than in any previous Batman theatrical film.  Lucius Fox was also given a larger role than ever before and power house actor Morgan Freeman uses every oppurtunity to show why he has earned his spot in the good graces of the Dark Knight.  Katie Holmes was good as Bruce Wayne's friend and love interest Rachel Dawes, but I can't think of anything truely memorible about her role...I do recall her being uncorupt but not nieve to what was going on in the world around her, which kept her from even coming close to any sort of a goody-good, but I don't really remember anything else about her.  And finally, there is Batman himself, played by Christian Bale.  With the Dark Knight's cape and cowl having been worn by about half a dozen men by this time, Mr. Bale brings a dark intereption to the character that is a match for Michael Keaton of the Tim Burton films.  I won't dwell on his voice except to say that I do not nessessarily care for it.  Apart from that, this is a new Batman whom the city of Gotham and fans of all ages can stand behind as he embarks on his journey across the rooftops.  And with this film's excellent plot, it will indeed be quite the journey.  Enjoy.",1400716800,,2791,4.602020202020202

But if, like me, you don't care for action movies or superhero movies, I don't think this will work for you any better than it worked for me. I have no interest in watching fighting, and this spends a lot of time filming fighting that is unnecessary to further the plot. To wit, the first fighting scene at the prison, where the hero beats the (*&(& out of another prisoner. It goes on and on. You could have made the point in a tenth of the time.

Maybe more of the story should have focused on the second act, so that it didn't feel so rushed. Overall a good movie, and a must watch if you want to fully appreciate what is going on in Dark Knight. Pro-tip: Katie Holmes and Maggie Gyllenhaal play the same character.

I was not disapointed in the quality of the print of the sound at all.

As for the movie, this is the 2nd best superhero movie ever made. It is second only to The Dark Night, the 2nd movie in this trilogy.

It shows a darker Batman than you saw in the Michael Keaton version. (Though that version will always hold a special place in my heart). This movie makes all the Batman gadets and his stroy line almost plausible, rather than the comic book version Michael Keton was in. That gives the whole film a much more realsistic and immersive experience.

1562280,5,B00005JNJV,"I have to admit, I liked the first Batman film that starred Michael Keaton, Kim Bassinger, and Jack Nicholson (an unforgettable Joker!).  The musical score by Hans Zimmer and the soundtrack by Prince surprisingly worked for a film that did not take itself too seriously.  Sadly, the subsequent films got worse and worse, until they were just bad jokes for the likes of Jim Carrey.  When the Batman franchise was rebooted, I was none too interested, and actually missed seeing the film in the theaters.  It wasn't until ""The Dark Knight"" came out that I went back and took a look at this film.

It's been out for many years, so there probably aren't any surprises to be revealed.  This film was much more gripping: the story was compelling and the cast (including Christian Bale, Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson) is magnificent.  In describing Batman's origins, we get to see in this hero his fragility and power juxtaposed.  Prior to this, I thought that the Marvel franchise was putting out the best comic movies.  After this, Batman took things over again.

As you would expect, the quality and resolution of the Blu-Ray puts DVD to shame, particularly on a true high-definition TV, navigating the disk is intuitive, and the extras are entertaining enough.  Some of the most impressive scenes are actually near the beginning of the film, when Bruce Wayne is being trained in the ninja arts in the Himalayas.

1562583,5,B00005JNJV,"To that end, Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman has given a wonderful performance of a man with deep psychological turmoil. As an ""origin story"", like it has never been told on the big screen before, much credit to the direction, production and acting is deserved. An unthinkable horror for a young boy to witness, as both parents are shot down in cold blood before his eyes. The trauma set into motion a series of events for young Bruce that would mold him into the man he became.
Never truly dealing with the PTSD he lived with, he grew to hate all evil in all people and places. At times, he saw it worse than the reality of its being. This is what forced him to go into self induced exile. If only to seek more evil and justify the fight under the pretense of justice. To have us, the viewer, understand Bruce's mental and emotional break from his renown fame and status, Nolan phased the storyline quickly. Maybe too rapidly.

Could a young, wealthy man just disappear for 7 years with only his trusted confidant Alfred awareness? Sure. Is it possible for a man to cross ice sheets with crevasses of 20 feet apart with NO special gear? No. Of course he was able to be imprisoned for stealing from a Wayne Enterprises product. That was the goal. But after meeting Henri Ducard, (decent performance by Liam Neeson), and suggested to turn his idea into an ideal, to then climb to the Cantonese Monastery is a bit of comic book ability. Nolan must keep the film to time and advance the storyline. I guess the presumption was folks can figure out the small missing time spots. My 12 year old son did and he has not heard the origin story.

Once the Mentor/trainee brutality of artful fighting has concluded, Bruce is faced with his first moral dilemma. Does he decapitate the criminal as Ra's Al Ghul demands? If so, his initiation into ""The League of Shadows"" would be complete. Only to learn that Ra's has greater plans to destroy Gotham as has been done to all great civilizations before it once gluttony and sinful waste has become all encompassing. Or, choose his own path of seemingly righteous, one man against evil and corruption that has overtaken Gotham? Taking the road of saving Gotham but carrying the weight of the horrific sights viewed as a boy, Bruce negates his Mentors wicked wisdom.
The same could be said for anyone who has been scarred from wounds left open and salt poured on every now and then. Bruce was a well-groomed boy. He knows wrong from right. He thinks of his city, his home, first. Destroying Ra's Al Guhl might save it and prevent cataclysmic events to other peoples in the future. Yet his single-mindedness has betrayed him. The League of Shadows is not a man or of men. It is a symbolic society that restores harmony to any unbalanced civilization, as THEY see it!

Bruce returns to Gotham with a new vigor. A man on a mission. Rid the city of the evils that took his parents as it were. Seeking to be more than a vigilante, he looks within his own darkest place. His mind. The darkest fears that haunt him will be the fear he will instill in his enemies. Are they his enemies?

Well, this is where all the other Batman movies pick up. The George Clooney and Michael Keaton versions sort of missed the point. Don't get me wrong. They were fun in a funny, Hollywood way. Unfortunately neither actor grasped the true Darkness of who Batman is. Batman, as told by the Frank Miller stories, is seriously dark and a tad twisted. Batman isn't a real Superhero. More likely, he's a ""rebel-anti-hero."" This is why I feel Bale has brought the character directly from the Miller pages to the big screen so well. He is brooding, torn, lonely and on the edge of psychosis. Purely stemming from never confronting his childhood trauma. The Cowl not only hides his face but it brings out Bruce's angst. The anger and rage that underlies his every waking moment. As Batman, the ideals he adopted can be an advantage. Even if it takes him deeper into those dark places he has feared. Perfectly spoken to Flass, Batman questions him of the whereabouts and nature of the drugs. Flass says, ""I don't know, I swear to god!"" Batman responds with, ""Swear to me!""
We see the beginnings of Batman who sometimes changes back to Bruce Wayne. All he has left is Alfred/Michael Caine. Caine has truly revamped the importance Alfred plays out in Bruce's life. He is the moral compass that grounds Bruce to the Wayne name, and still keeps Batman on his feet! Caine is incredibly versatile in every role he's done!
Lucious Fox/Morgan Freeman has provided Batman every item that is synonymous to the character. Bruce has the money, Fox has the tech knowhow. The relationship between the two shows a trust and professionalism of both actors who stay true to Miller's work. Caine is so talented that he can make the third to Bale and Freeman so believable.

Now that Batman is outfitted with all his toys, the Tumbler makes its way into the pinnacle of Batman's success. Realizing that Dr. Crane/Cillian Murphy, AKA The Scarecrow, is but a pawn for Batman' s ultimate showdown with the League of Shadows, he pulls out all the stops. Befriending Lt. Gordon/Gary Oldman, they both work together to stop Gotham's end.
As Batman says, he doesn't have the luxury of friends. Without enlisting the beginning of a quasi friendship with Gordon, Gotham would have been ripped apart by the inhabitants gone insane from the dispersant of the drugs. Every superhero needs help. The love interest? Katie Holmes did a fine job as Rachel Dawes. Nothing spectacular, compared to the A-list'ers here, she held her own.
Defeating Ducard and the Microwave Emitter, Batman sure left a heck of a lot of destruction in his wake! The flattened cop cars via the Tumbler. Crazy rooftop jumps and wasted units on those roofs. How many people might have been lost in those collapsed cop cars? The crushed concrete lane dividers, the end of that entire Monorail system and it's last few carriages...and so much more! Seems like Batman leaves more destruction behind him then the bad guys!

Yet this is a blow-up, action, Superhero. A hero who lives on the edge of sanity and teeters off the other end. This is what the Frank Miller stories had depicted Batman to be, a very dark figure who must walk a very fine line. Sometimes Batman needs to step across that line to do what others can't or won't. The darkness that stews within lags from the hell he saw in youth. The unchecked crime in his city and a corrupt police force that were on the take. This is not a pretty movie. Not the Tim Burton film or the 60's Batman & Robin. No. THIS is exactly the Batman that was so beautifully drawn less than 20 years ago. A character who is suffering immensely and with all his wealth and family power, sleeps alone. Nightmares about the bats that attacked him down in the well on his family property.

1562584,5,B00005JNJV,As usual Batman is a child's fantasy and my grandson absolutely loved this beginning movie as it explained all the characters etc etc.,1392422400,,134,4.869565217391305
1562585,1,B00005JNJV,"A comic is a comic and nothing but a comic. In this case the filmmakers however seem to have forgotten or deliberately overlooked the fact, because it does exactly what a comic's film version never ought to do: it takes itself by far too seriously. The other Batman films I know had opera-like sets and music, stunning pictures and special effects, they were colourful, lively, winking at the viewer and always a little larger-than-life, so that right from the beginning one knew that they were taking place in a kind of parallel world where peculiar, sometimes bizarre things can happen. But no, ""Batman Begins"" is supposed to be a film with depth, oh dear me, it's so serious, so dramatic, it has a background, it's supposed to say something to us... Only what?

I guess the following: how do you become a superhero, someone who, immaculate and invincible, wins over all the ""bad boys"" in the world? Honestly speaking, I still don't know. This film's plot was so confused and pieced together that I could hardly follow it. Usually I like ambitious stories, but to me, ""Batman Begins"" only appears to be sophisticated: the truth is that countless clichs were dragged out of the closet and embellished with huge violence and action scenes. The dream of the little boy residing in every man about nobleness and heroism at the cost of the bad guys (whereas ""evil"" is an epithet affixed to everyone who stands in the way of your ego) is painstakingly retraced and gilded with a lot of suffering and renouncement, which as a viewer you unfortunately never believe because there is not one actor here who would play well: most of them always wear the same expression on their face. Batman in particular does not look cool but clueless almost all the time.
Oh, please! If there is something I can't stand it's the lack of authenticity, and this film was from start to finish one single, implausible, superficial clich. Batman films are supposed to be fun, not about some pseudo-philosophical ""Asian"" mumbo-jumbo every Ninja would be ashamed of. Even the music wasn't convincing, although it is usually one of the few things even the worst action movie can score with. I watched the film during an open air show and the falling stars I could see from time to time were more interesting than this whole so-called opus.

The most annoying scene to me was the party which takes place halfway through the film: two carefree guests take a bath in the decoration pool, apparently believing it's a swimming pool, and Wayne has them inconspicuously brought away and succinctly tells his other guests, ""They are Europeans."" Somehow the scene fit perfectly to the film's theme ""Coward turns heroic and sallies forth to save the world.""
What was this film supposed to say? The US as the cradle of civilization? George W. against the rest of the world? A similar remark about US Americans in a German film would probably have caused a diplomatic incident worldwide. What the (alleged) moral casualness of European women is supposed to have to do with this already totally overwrought plot I can't fathom until today.

In my opinion, whoever created this film ought to change his profession as quickly as possible. If I could I would give it 0 stars, but all right, I will still give it 1 star since some of the pictures were actually pretty well made.",1392336000,3,3332,4.7612456747404845

1562669,5,B00005JNJV,"I have been a fan of Bob Kane's creation since the time when comic books were a dime, and the bigger ones were a quarter. The first time I read a Batman comic I was hooked. I watched this Character evolve over the years from a two dimensional goodie two shoes, into the dark figure and complicated character portrayed by Frank Miller in his graphic novels. By far Christopher Nolan is the only one to successfully capture the true essence of Batman.

In Batman Begins we see the most creative retelling of the legend of the origins of one of America's most enduring characters. We see how the death of his parents affected young Bruce Wayne. We watch his transformation from a bitter young man hell bent on revenge to a highly skilled crusader for justice. It was not as cut and dried as other portrayals of the character. This is a man in turmoil who finally finds his way, his true north so to speak.

Ken Wantanabe plays a very convincing Ra's A Ghul, who mentors Bruce Wayne and helps him gain the skills he will need. But those of you who know the character from the graphic novels, know that Ra's can be vicious though eloquent and you just know teacher and student will cross paths again.

Christian Bale's is by far the best portrayal of the caped crusader. He does not play the two dimensional character of the other movies, he plays a very complicated and driven man. Most likely suffering from PTSD but expresses it in his quest to make Gotham city safe from the criminals. This is the only actor who was able to give us a glimpse into the very heart and soul of Batman. We see from this portrayal that Bruce Wayne is actually the mask, and Batman is who Bruce really is. He cannot live a normal life, he has an obsession that draws him into its web, well meaning as it may be. This is a man who is flawed, and carries deep wounds that drive him on.

The entire cast does a spectacular job with their roles. Michael Cane totally reworks the character Alfred from a mere subservient extra into a man who cares deeply for Bruce Wayne and is very outspoken and not afraid to stand up to Bruce. Cillian Murphy brings the Scarecrow to life as a diabolical yet somewhat comical villain.

The visuals are well done. The action is breath taking and at the end of each action sequence you may find your heart racing and yourself struggling to catch your breath. But the movie does not depend on action alone, The plot is nicely done and weaves into a gripping tale. True Batman fans will notice some elements of the graphic novels in this story.

If you are a true Batman fan, by that I mean you have followed his character over the years, you have to see this movie.",1389657600,,2669,4.392712550607287

1563154,1,B00005JNJV,"I know I am the exception among reviewers, but I found this movie far too dark.  When I saw it in the theater nearly 10 years ago, I was left with an oppressed, heavy feeling that lasted for a long time afterward, which is why seeing the two sequels was absolutely out of the question for me.  This is definitely not an exuberant action movie.  It is a crime story, with enormous disasters affecting huge numbers of people, and I think it is significantly darker than even the first two Spider-Man movies (which, by the way, were all I could stomach).  The more recent Spider-Man and Batman movies are not Tim Burton black comedy or bright and crisp action adventures like Indiana Jones; they are the most broodingly dark action movies I have ever seen.  The effect this movie had on me long-term was so deep that it went beyond depression, all the way to oppression, through its film noir-like or Nietzschean version of a godless society, where justice can only be achieved through power instead of through strength of character.  I still remember portions of it quite vividly from that one viewing.  Also, Hans Zimmer's music is oppressively dark through the entire movie, and also has just one motif based on two notes, and very very little creativity.

I would also add that the sequel, The Dark Knight, which I didn't see except for clips on YouTube, was a direct influence on the Aurora, Colorado theater massacre by James Holmes, and that The Dark Knight deserves some blame for that massacre in that the Joker character was who James Holmes was dressing up as and aspiring to be.  What you watch DOES affect you.

1563290,3,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is about the idea that justice triumphs over vengeance. It is the second best of Chris Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (behind The Dark Knight and ahead of The Dark Knight Rises). And you can see why with the story chart.

Batman Begins goes about demonstrating the idea that justice triumphs over vengeance with three plots. The main external plot is of course, Save Gotham. This is augmented with a love story between Bruce and Rachel and an internal struggle of Bruce to seek revenge or justice.

The problem is the internal plot ends in the first act. He chooses justice when he leaves the League of Shadows and his internal compass never again wavers. The love plot ends ambiguously at the end, even though he has chosen the path of the straight and narrow and defeated the revenge-seeking League of Shadows. So for the majority of the movie all we get to watch is Batman saving Gotham, and that can get boring pretty quickly. For a more interesting take on this idea, you will have to see the next in the trilogy, the epic Dark Knight.

1563371,5,B00005JNJV,"BATMAN BEGINS, while not containing the brutal anarchy of THE DARK KNIGHT, nor the emotion and drama of THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, is perhaps the most entertaining and satisfying of Nolan's excellent trilogy, not to mention the most faithful to the comics.

Let us examine what Nolan did right:

The casting of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christian-Bale/dp/B004S5D3B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christian Bale</a>&nbsp;as Bruce Wayne was a stroke of genius. Suave, charming, and attractive as the billionaire playboy, and menacing, terrifying, and brutal as the Batman, Bale (one of the most versatile and talented actors working today) carries the film with his weighty and brilliant performance. Bale conquers the physical aspect of Batman, and master the tortured psyche and persona of Bruce Wayne.

Nolan surrounds Bale with an incredibly talented cast.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Caine/dp/B004VFONHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Caine</a>&nbsp;is brilliant in his understated role as Alfred, Batman's loyal and often very wise butler.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gary-Oldman/dp/B0079LJZG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gary Oldman</a>&nbsp;is absolutely amazing as Lieutenant James Gordon, the one straight cop in the dodgy Gotham underworld.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cillian-Murphy/dp/B0013KTGAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cillian Murphy</a>&nbsp;oozes psychological menace as Dr. Jonathan Crane, a doctor with an obsession with fear, and an effective villain.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liam-Neeson/dp/B00BP4X3W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liam Neeson</a>&nbsp;makes a very effective and charismatic R'as Al Ghul. The only unfortunate bit of casting is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Katie-Holmes/dp/B000I9UA7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Katie Holmes</a>&nbsp;as Rachel Dawes, since she has neither the charm and attitude of Maggie Gylenhaal, nor the believability to be entirely effective. Look for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Wilkinson/dp/B000067J3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Wilkinson</a>&nbsp;in a scenery-chewing electrifying role, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Morgan-Freeman/dp/B001EBV0OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Morgan Freeman</a>&nbsp;doing his awesome thing as Lucius Fox. If Christopher Nolan has one talent, it is putting together excellent casts.

But do you know what I really like about BEGINS? Nolan. nailed. Gotham. While KNIGHT and RISES are undoubtedly excellent films, I felt the aspect of Gotham was underused. The Gotham of the comics is HELL on earth. Dark, ridden - no, decayed - with crime, corruption, crooked cops, gang lords, the mafia, and far, far, worse things. Old, drab, ugly buildings, cold hard people, a darkened sky... This is not the shining Metropolis of Superman, this is not Peter Parker's familiar New York, this is the backwater of all filth, a dirty, dark, cesspit of crime. Christopher Nolan REALLY brought that point across effectively and brilliantly. The subway, once a shining example of Wayne Industries, is old, rattly, and covered in graffiti. The night streets are dark and scary. This is Batman's element.

And the other thing that sets BEGINS apart. Fear. As Wilkinson's crime boss says ""Men always fear what they don't understand"". Fear is both the reason that Batman exists and his greatest weapon. Fear created Batman, it transformed Bruce Wayne. It gives him drive and reason to live. Fear is one of the major themes of Nolan's first Batman film. Batman strikes fear with his terrifying costume and ninja-learned tactics. People learn to handle fear, and overcome their fear. The Scarecrow uses fear as a weapon. I felt that KNIGHT and RISES also dropped the ball slightly when it came to this aspect of the dark knight.

The action is great. Neeson's swordfight with Bale early on in the film is excellently shot and acted. Batman's early fights perfectly capture his traditional fighting style: shadows, confusion, fear. Characters literally battle fear later on in the film, and the stakes are high, the fights are gritty and realistic, and the action is engaging. The Batmobile is set at it's most awesome mode of kickassery, too, so that's a plus.

Let us see what else helped make Batman awesome again: Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's epic, bloodpumping score (dun DUN dun DUUUUUN!), the excellent production values, gritty costumes, realistic sets, and cinematography (I tell you that moment where Bruce Wayne sets out to find his destiny in the mountains is _stunning_ imagery). The lack of excessive CGI grounds Batman in reality, but there is humour here, and it is funny. You may think that Nolan sacrifices heart for action, but that is not so. Bruce Wayne and James Gordon and Alfred become real, sympathetic characters in our eyes.

The result? A film so awesome it will make you forget of the travesty that was Batman and Robin (Speak to me not of it! OH MY EYES THEY'RE BURNING NOT THE PUNS OH GOD!!). With an excellent cast, amazing cinematography, action, and drama, Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale craft what is perhaps the most enjoyable Batman film ever made. Begins gets almost everything right, and this is a movie that deserves to be seen multiple times.

My rank? Five out of five Batarangs.

P.S. Check out the sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001OGWY1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>, arguably the finest superhero film ever made.

1563569,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins may very well be the best Batman movie ever made. Christopher Nolan does a brilliant job of depicting the origin of Batman. The 1989 Tim Burton film does a great job developing the Joker but is far weaker on developing Batman. That's where Nolan succeeds. From Bruce Wayne's early childhood to the murder of his parents to his journey to become Batman,Nolan weaved an awesome origin story. This movie doesn't have as much action as some other Batman movies but it still may well be the best 1 because the STORY is so great. The character development of Batman is great. And the plot itself is well thought well and well told. The conflict between the League of Shadows and it's determination to destroy Gotham and Batman's determination to stop is well plotted,well acted,and well told. Ducard turning about to be the real Ra's al Ghul was a great plot twist. And then you see a piece of setup for the Dark Knight when Gordon tells Batman about the Joker. And then there's the fact there's no campiness in this movie. It is wonderfully dark and serious. Everything about this movie is spot on. This movie succeeds because of it's awesome plot and character development. The Batman origin story was a great way to reboot Batman and is quite possibly the best Batman movie ever. 5 out of 5 stars.",1373328000,,1308,4.642241379310345

1563689,5,B00005JNJV,"In this franchise reboot instigated by writer-producer-director and film magician Christopher Nolan, the dark knight is given a new face, a detailed back story, and, most of all, a newer, fresher, and darker tone. Fueled by a knockout performance by Christian Bale and a great supporting cast that includes Katie Holmes, Tom Wilkinson, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, and the magnificent Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler, Nolan's first installment in his acclaimed ""Dark Knight"" Trilogy set up audiences for an incredible introspective take on the character, and changed superhero movies forever.
I own the single-disc version of the film, which is a great package for the low price you're paying for it. It comes with no real bonus features other than the theatrical trailer, but it's fine because the film is the real gem here. While do love most of Nolan's special features (Memento's 2-Disc Edition is a masterpiece in its own right apart from the equally magnificent film), it's just such a great deal to get the single-disc version. If you feel so inclined go right ahead and buy the 2-disc version, Nolan has a way of making even the making-of documentaries on his films interesting (see the Prestige single-disc DVD for some pretty cool set designing).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prestige/dp/B003QS9WIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prestige</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memento-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Limited-Edition/dp/B0000640SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memento (Widescreen Two-Disc Limited Edition)</a>",1371513600,2,1626,6.361990950226244

Those two characters are important to each other. I was excited to see Liam Neeson portray a villain who once upon a time meant to change the world in a good way.

1564090,5,B00005JNJV,"We are in a golden age of comic book movies right now -- and at least some of the credit for that goes to Christopher Nolan.

This talented director was singlehandedly responsible for bringing Batman back onto movie screens, years after Joel Schumacher destroyed the franchise. ""Batman Begins"" explores the formation of the Dark Knight of Gotham, following Bruce Wayne as he begins a personal journey leading him to Batmanhood. Even people who aren't into capes and tights can appreciate this story.

After his parents' murderer is paroled, young bazillionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) vanishes on an aimless journey across the world. He's taken under the wing of the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers to train him to be a member of the League of Shadows. But when Bruce learns that the League plans to annihilate his home city of Gotham, he lashes out and destroys the League's base. Oops.

When he returns home, he finds that Gotham has become rotten to the core with mobs, crooked cops and a fear-inducing shrink (Cillian Murphy). Using the company's discarded prototypes, Bruce fashions an armored bodysuit and tanklike vehicle, and uses them to fight crime wherever he finds it. But the League still has plans to destroy Gotham, and the only one who can stop them is Batman.

Most directors would have given this movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in ""Batman Begins"" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.

But since this is a comic-book movie, Nolan peppers the story with kinetic action, high-speed chases and massive explosions, as well as the grim specter of the League hanging over the entire city. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (""Does it come in black?"" Bruce asks with a big smile after trying out the proto-Batmobile), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.

The most striking part of this movie is Nolan's delving into morality, and the darker side of human nature. We see that Gotham has a rottennness in its heart, but Bruce won't harm people even if they are corrupt and evil -- he might not save you, but he won't kill you.

Christian Bale is simply brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman -- sure, his growly voice can get a bit silly at times, but he perfectly conveys the strength, pain and determination of a man who will sacrifice everything to save others. And he's ringed with a bunch of other great performances, particularly by the always-awesome Michael Caine as the faithful Wayne butler Alfred, and Morgan Freedman as the supplier of weird Wayne tech.

There are also some wonderful villain performances. Liam Neeson exudes haughty moralistic chilliness as Ducard, and Cillian Murphy's angel face and giant eyes make his psychosis even creepier.

The one problem: Rachel Dawes. Rachel is a sour, miserable character who seems to enjoy toying with Bruce's affections and emotions (she tries to shame him for wanting revenge against HIS PARENTS' KILLER). And Katie Holmes is shockingly bad in the role as well -- this pouty, baby-voiced girl is supposed to be a hard-nosed assistant DA? Suuuuuuurrreee.

""Batman Begins"" is a powerful, gritty reboot of the whole Batman mythos -- and except for the horrendous female lead, it's an absolute masterpiece. Definitely see this, even if you aren't into superheroes.",1364688000,,3512,4.998287671232877

1564099,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is a moody, gritty, wonderfully flavorful, yet muddled origin story of the Dark Knight, Batman.  Christopher Nolan successfully creates a mostly believable world for Gotham City to inhabit, standing apart from other cinematic adaptations of the source material, yet not so far apart as to rub fans the wrong way.  The movie is careful to position this Gotham City and this Batman as belonging almost to the same world we inhabit, though with the addition of some ridiculously precarious elevated monorails.  The film succeeds in taking us through Batman's evolution from angry, driven young man into caped crusader beginning a war on crime.  The fledgling relationship between Batman and Jim Gordon is effective, the loyalty between Bruce and Alfred is touching.  Philosophically, though, the film flounders.

The film grapples with the theme of fear, sometimes effectively and other times clumsily.  Of particular curiosity is that Batman wants to be both a symbol of hope, but also a symbol that strikes fear into the hearts of criminals.  Batman also consistently seems to believe that criminals are somehow fundamentally different than law-abiding citizens, though he stumbles through some explanation about how stealing to prevent starving gave him some sympathy... without going as far as to say he identified with people who might do so.  He fails to note that vigilantism is a crime, and therefore, technically speaking, Batman himself IS a criminal.  He also fails to consider that among the lower income citizenship of Gotham, a family might have a son or uncle or mother or father who resorts to crime.  Should Batman strike fear into that family member's heart, he will not inspire hope in the hearts of the remainder of the family.  Batman seems to have a very black and white view of the world -- which is fine for Batman, but the film fails to present a different voice.  This is the largest failing of the film.

Since the movie attempts to position the Batman story in a more realistic context, it should position Batman himself -- a morose, disturbed, costume-donning vigilante billionaire -- in the same context, as a complex, unbalanced, individual, rather than simple ""the protagonist.""  The movie seems to share Batman's moral compass, which, given how unstable the guy is, seems dubious at best.

Another point, far too much is made of Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father.  Multiple flashback sequences present the guy as a saint, a perfect, magnanimous caring, giving, charitable billionaire.  At the same time, Martha Wayne, Bruce's mother is a non-entity.  She has perhaps a single line, which has no lasting meaning.  Perhaps Bruce Wayne had a cold and distant mother, but since this doesn't seem to be an important part of Batman's profile, why present her as only window dressing to Thomas Wayne.  I know why, because this movie is essentially a sausage party.  While Rachel Dawes serves as an important grounding force for Bruce Wayne, she also serves as damsel in distress, with one of the more noteworthy action set-pieces being designed entirely around saving her.  So.

None the less, the film is still a thrilling adventure that makes you believe a depressed angry billionaire orphan could become a bat.  And it's realized so effectively that even as you squirm at the muddled socio-political implications, you can't help but enjoy the ride.  So, four stars, in spite of myself.",1363651200,2,3426,5.073214285714286

1564154,5,B00005JNJV,"There has been too few films that capture both the sprit of the character that they were made for, and successfully reboot an entire film franchise. Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" (2005) is such a film. It allows the viewers to go back to the beginning of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman, and explains the training that he learned in order to become a heroic symbol for Gotham City. The acting, set design, and narrative are all excellent, with great nods to the comics and graphic novels that have made Batman a legendary character. The film also tracks Bruce's own self development and progress from mourning 8 year old, to skilled crime fighter. Many other viewers simply describe this film as a seminal or ""mostly decent"" Batman movie, but there are some distinct elements and casting choices that give this film an edge over other Batman films, including the original 1989 epic.

1.) Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes--In my humble opinion, (yours may be different) Holmes was the ""better"" Rachel Dawes. She was not a femme fatale by any means, but she embodied a strong willed, intelligent, and courageous woman with a purpose. This was and still is a welcome surprise to me as a viewer. What had been so repetitive and redundant in the original 1989-1997 Batman series was the fact that the lead female character (except for Pfeffer's Selina Kyle) was often a ""damsel in distress"". Rachel also has a distinct function within the film's narrative. She feels obligated to rid Gotham of crime and injustice, but also is very vulnerable, and is a childhood friend of Bruce. Katie's performance was solid, giving viewers the impression that Rachel was both an independent and sensitive woman; one that should not be crossed. Sadly, all that Holmes brought to Rachel Dawes, and in turn the Nolan Batman franchise has been widely forgotten,  ever since Maggie Gyllenhall was cast in ""The Dark Knight"".

2.) Tom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone. Looking back on this film, who else could have played the ""The Roman"" (Carmine's nickname from the comics) anyway? Wilkinson's acting prowess is fully utilized here, despite his brief screen time. His ""New York""/ ""Chicago"" accent was brilliant, why can't he play more characters like Carmine in other films? Tom's take on Carmine was the kind of ""old world"" gangster, the kind of criminal that cops and other crooks alike could be afraid of. It would have been interesting to see Carmine return in another Batman film, especially if Wilkinson reprised the role.

3.) Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth. What else can be said about Caine here? One of the most prolific and imperative actors of his time, Caine embodied a fatherly warmth and comedic relief to his character, which was similar but also different from Michael Gough (RIP) from the original 1989-1997 series. Caine's ""Alfred"" presented to the viewers a portrait of a butler whose balanced approach to life also provides a great moral guide to Bruce Wayne and his mission as Batman.

4.) Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Freeman's ""Lucius"" serves as the brains behind Batman, the ""Q"" or ""Quartermaster"" of the franchise, and also provides the scientific and technological basis for all of Batman's unique gadgets and vehicles, including ""the tumbler"". Freeman's performance as Lucius is sharp and witty, providing viewers with a smart, and humorous african american character, which up until this film, was not in any other of the Batman movies.

5.) Gary Oldman as James W. Gordon--Who else could have played this Iconic character better? Another one of the most potent and powerful actors our time, portraying one of the most important characters in the Batman mythos. What can be better than that? Oldman remains as the best actor, giving the best performance in this film, as well as the entire Nolan Batman Trilogy. What was most refreshing about Oldman's take on ""James Gordon"" didn't just come from his performance, but also his conception; which allows Gordon's development as a cop to serve as a parallel to Batman and his experiences as a crime fighter. Gordon is a confident and capable cop in this film, which was more in line with Frank Miller's ""Batman Year One"" (1987 Comic) and a far cry from the late Pat Hingle's character from the original 1989-1997 Batman film series.

6.) Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul. Inspired Performance, Great Character Conception,Ducard maintains both the mentor and adversary role well, and his sense of purpose (destroying Gotham through fear) and it shows in Neeson's performance. Neeson uses a certain craftsmanship in shaping his character, and it presents Ra's as both as a master tactician, and ruthless villain. (Enough Said!!)

Overall, Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" was a classic film, one that deserves more credit, due to the fact it re-established Batman as a tragic avenger, a feared and symbolic creature of the night. Christian Bale gives a powerful performance as both Bruce Wayne and Batman that is full of impact. At the time of the film's release, no one that I knew (myself included) could have predicted that the film would not just be successful, but also provide the definitive origin story to Bruce Wayne's career as the Caped Crusader.

5 out 5.

On a side note, however, one thing that was missed in this film was Talia, Ra's Al Ghul's beautiful, yet deadly daughter. Despite her appearance in Nolan's Bat finale, she would have been better utilized (in my opinion) as a tragic love interest; which would have provided Bruce with a tough choice in becoming Batman, and it would have also given Nolan and Co. another female supporting character who could be tied more closely with Batman and his origins.",1362614400,,5677,4.972602739726027

1564297,4,B00005JNJV,"This was a fantastic portrayal of Batman. Worth watching --

Now I want to address the Amazon Instant Video and Prime Video services regarding this movie:

Amazon's Instant Video allows for the ""renting"" of the movie for a reasonably low cost and has no membership requirements-- you don't pay if you don't watch -- and it is great (they could do better with the cataloging process)

The Prime Video Service does not always have the latest movies but for the price, the movie and tv selection is awsome -- you can't beat it at the $75 per YEAR price. And if you order things from amazon, chances are real good that you won't have to pay shipping -- the more you buy the more you save so you cant beat the value. I would recommend this to everyone.

I just wish for a browser that call allow me to schedual shows to play systematicly rather than having to go down a list one at a time -- sometimes I would like to just veg out like the old tv days (I don't pay for the cable/sat services because I just don't think I like paying for commercials).",1360540800,2,1045,4.289340101522843

1564753,5,B00005JNJV,"I'm a big fan of Batman. With that being said, YES I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I loved Tim Burton's version, but this one was an excellent evolution of the franchise. Acting was on par. Action was on par. What more could you want?",1357257600,,223,4.209302325581396

1564756,3,B00005JNJV,"But the service from Amazon is terrible.  The movie starts and stops and there were long periods of ""loading"" or where it just shut down and pushed us back to the main menu.  I love Amazon -- but their streaming is terrible.  Stick with Netflix for this one.",1357257600,,258,4.333333333333333

1564758,2,B00005JNJV,"Movie was great! The Amazon streaming was horrible. Several times the movie would stop to buffer but wouldn't restart on it's own. Several times we had back up and and restart the movie. Picture quality was good but streaming compared to NetFlix, Hulu etc. Amazon has a long ways to go before I'll buy another movie through your system.",1357171200,,336,4.711864406779661
1564759,5,B00005JNJV,"Easily the finest establishing picture a comic book character has ever enjoyed. The entire first act is a masterpiece, telling the crucial parts of Bruce Wayne's fabled origin while flashing forward to key moments in his early adulthood and laying the groundwork with an almost supernatural long-term training session. It's effortlessly cool and enveloping, a perfect hook that grounds the character in reality while also pre-explaining some of his more theatrical habits. The follow-through isn't perfect, with a few puzzling plot holes and a conveniently under-explained resolution to blame, but it does such a good job of maintaining its momentum that those tripwires are easy to brush off. Of course, an industrial-sized bucketful of wonderful performances from the cast doesn't hurt. It's just loaded with big-name talent and nobody's mailing it in. Christian Bale is fantastic as the multi-layered lead character(s), but Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Liam Neeson are right there beside him in a wealth of glowing supporting roles. It's a dream come true for fans of the character, and a great reintroduction for casuals who'd been led astray the last iteration.",1357084800,,1184,5.370967741935484

1564949,5,B00005JNJV,"I've seen all 3, TDK,TDKR and ^Batman Begins. This is a great start to the movie, showed how Batman came to be instead of just jumping into fighting and bashing heads. Christian Bale and all of the other case members did a great job. *SPOILER* One thing to notice, is right after he saves Rachel from the poison, he tells her what to do with the antidote. He talks to her in his Batsuit, without his Batman Voice..interesting huh?",1356739200,,430,4.455696202531645
1564950,5,B00005JNJV,Wonderfully entertaining.  Nothing that will stay with you forever like with Lost or Battlestar Galactica but worth the price of a rental.  Katie Holmes is particularly good in this.,1356739200,,182,5.241379310344827
1564951,5,B00005JNJV,"My favorite of the three Christopher Nolan movies. Takes you into the beginnings of Batman and how he becames such a badass. Also, Liam Neeson is fantastiic as well as great performances from Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman and Michael Caine.",1356652800,,237,4.95

1565065,4,B00005JNJV,A great begining story to what turned out to be a great series. Going to the point of how Bruce became Batman was the most intriguing story I have seen by DC in a long time.,1355875200,2,173,3.8333333333333335

This movie was already a 10.  The Blu-Ray merely cranks it up to 11.",1355788800,,216,4.170731707317073
1565147,5,B00005JNJV,"As far as I am concerned, this movie is a discussion of evil.  At what point does the eradication of evil become evil?  I saw it at the movie theatres 6 times and purchased it as soon as it came out.  The movie provides not only action and a hero with humanity and human failings but it gives one food for thought.",1355702400,,314,4.032258064516129

Excellent sound, dialogue, picture quality is excellent.  This will become a classic masterpiece like vinyl.",1355702400,,256,4.906976744186046
1565150,2,B00005JNJV,"While Batman Begins doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel when it comes to comic book movie adaptations, i.e. Batman & Robin, it is certainly not the apex of the Batman franchise that everyone claims it to be. The first hour is arguably the best part of the film, which chronicles Bruce Wayne's journey to becoming Batman, and his tutelage under Liam Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul. However, the second hour is truly a series of missed opportunities. Tom Wilkinson's Carmine Falcone is a disappointing caricature of Jame Gandolfini's Tony Soprano, while Katie Holmes is an unfortunate casualty of the terrible dialogue that runs rampant throughout the course of this movie (i.e. Liam Neeson at one point says, ""Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy.""). My advice would be to skip this film, and go straight to its sequels&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001OGWY1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-Rises/dp/B00AHSIQWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, which are vastly superior both in terms of dialogue, plot, cinematography, and character development. However, if you are looking for a film that truly embodies all things Batman then I encourage you to watch Tim Burton's classic first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B0013WJGJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.",1355616000,,1572,6.9045226130653266

1565154,5,B00005JNJV,This is much better than The Dark Night or the Dark Night Rises. Bales role in Batman Begins was outstanding. It really shows the dark side of Batman and makes it believable. The next two were more corny and seemed to focus more on the effects and not the story.,1355443200,,262,4.26
1565215,5,B00005JNJV,Great movie.i watched it over and over. I would recommend to anyone. def get entire series and watch to get full history,1355356800,,120,4.5
1565216,4,B00005JNJV,Great Movie.  The Christopher Nolan trilogy is one of my favorites.  I had to watch this one again after I watched The Dark Knight Rises.,1355270400,2,137,4.44

1565285,5,B00005JNJV,What can I say that hasn't been said. This first movie of the trilogy is great. Great effort was made to really explore the Batman psyche. They explore what and how does a man become Batman. I don't think you saw Bruce Wayne in the Batman costume in the first 30 minutes of the movie. This more than made up for the previous Batman movies. As a Dark Knight fan I loved this movie.,1354752000,,380,4.148648648648648

1565292,5,B00005JNJV,"So, I'm a huge superhero fan, and Batman is right up my alley. His story is a little bit darker than most, but Christian Bale makes an excellent performance of the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. I had not really heard of the villan in this story before I had seen the movie however. But the story is excellent. Would definitely recommend this dvd.",1354406400,,346,4.596774193548387
1565293,5,B00005JNJV,"Nolan took this hero franchise and grounded it with real world rules.  His interpretation of Batman avoids comic book trappings in favor of a kinetic pace that drives a story of revenge and justice.  A little Count of Monte Cristo mixed with some Scarlet Pimpernel, Batman Begins chronicles the story of Bruce Wayne, a billionaire heir who forgoes the corporate life in favor of the nightly pursuit of justice.

Although some flaws exist in the film, this is the entry point to one of the best super hero movie franchises in film history.

Nolan was an exemplary choice to direct these films.",1354406400,,592,4.7745098039215685

Then Christopher Nolan made Batman Begins and it showed the world what a quality adaptation should be. Back to basics, stripping out the fluff from the mythology, and making it all about one tormented man and his desire to protect the vulnerable from the worst examples of a city's most evil.

For parents who want to know what it has in terms of violence, it includes martial arts, a hallucinogenic drug that causes to a person who has been exposed to it to think everything is terrifying. People are shone drinking wine at a party, although nobody gets drunk. A few curse words including H*ll, D**n, and A**. A flash back to a scene where a mugger murders Batman's parents (Not bloody, just two gunshots).  No highly romantic material, just one very brief kiss. I know you're wondering if it's even worth watching. I assure you it is. It has lot of compelling fight scenes that have you at the tip of your seat wondering what will happen next.

October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are ""alternative"" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!

""Batman Begins"" is an exceptional movie, no matter how you want to judge it- drama, superhero adaptation, or action movie. What I particularly loved about it was how it gave a credible origin to the legend of Batman. Rather than just asking the viewer to accept that Bruce Wayne has a ridiculously high aptitude for stealth and combat, director Christopher Nolan SHOWS us why this is. Wayne's training in a remote sanctuary of ninjas, as he slowly acquires his remarkable skills, is fascinating and engaging. This is a movie that benefits greatly from the HD transfer to Blu-ray, and it is a treat for the eyes to witness this legendary character's origins.

And let's not forget, ""Batman Begins"" works perfectly as an ""alternative"" Halloween movie, as this crisp October weather rolls in. After all, it features a very cool villain called ""Scarecrow"", whose weapon is nothing less than fear itself... the story of ""Batman Begins"" will draw you in from the first moments, and hold your attention until the final, climactic battle.",1350518400,2,1652,5.003636363636364

1565477,5,B00005JNJV,"Ha! I am the 1500th review of this movie! Me: 1, Rest of the World: 0

I am a huge fan of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. I enjoyed all three films immensely, but this was my favorite. I think I am probably in a minority there. It is always difficult to compare films even when they are by the same director and have the same subject. There are certainly things that I liked better about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001GZ6QDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-Rises-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy/dp/B004LWZWGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight Rises (Blu-ray/DVD Combo+UltraViolet Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;(I intend, eventually, to write reviews of both). Both of The Dark Knight films had more interesting villains.

The reason I still consider this my favorite of the three is because there is literally nothing I would change about this film. That is extremely rare for me. I tend to nitpick even my favorite films, and I almost always find little things I do not like, or that I wish were different. I can honestly say, with this film, that even if Christopher Nolan had come to me with an advanced screening and asked me if I had any suggestions for changes to be made (and frankly I am somewhat put out that he did not) I would have had no suggestions to offer.

The movie, of course, charts the rise of Batman. It has been said many times already, by many other people, but I think it is an important point so I will say it again, what separates this movie from most super hero movies, as well as all the Batman movies made before Nolan's trilogy, is that Christopher Nolan has attempted to create a realistic world, as opposed to a cartoonish world, and he has succeeded brilliantly. It is amazing to me that so few super hero movies are able to achieve this degree of realism (most do not even try). It is always necessary in any super hero movie (or any other movie actually) to suspend disbelief to some degree, but this movie gets about as close as possible to a genuinely realistic super hero movie.

The acting is superb throughout, and there is a whole host of supporting characters that each add their particular flavor to the whole movie. This is one of Christopher Nolan's genuine talents it seems to me. All of these Batman movies are filled with genuinely interesting, well drawn, and superbly acted, supporting characters. I said that the two Dark Knight movies had better villains, but the villains in this movie are actually very well played, and interesting. The addition of The Scarecrow was one of the highlights of this film for me. And, of course, Alfred (Michael Caine), Sergeant Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are all spectacular. I also think Katie Holmes did a very good job as Rachel Dawes. All of the pieces of the jigsaw really came together on this one.

It is easy to look down on super hero movies. I think they generally play into our human-all-too-human desires for perfect justice, or our desire to feel empowered in the face of things that we feel powerless about, but this movie has some substance. The movie analyzes, to some degree, the role that fear plays in perpetuating conditions that people find undesirable. This is a genuine insight into the way the world works. Batman is not out, in this movie, to single-handedly end all crime, or stop some cartoonish super villain. Batman's goal is to empower the citizens of Gotham, who are paralyzed by fear, and to turn that fear around on those doing the terrorizing (to make sure his enemies ""share his dread"").

The movie also has somewhat of a social conscience in the form of Rachel Dawes and Bruce Wayne's father, as well as Bruce Wayne himself. There are a group of people who are willing to take advantage of people's fear, and the social problems of Gotham, for the sake of profit (like Carmine Falcone and The Scarecrow), but there is also a sense that many of the criminals of Gotham are being forced into crime through desperation. The movie has, therefore, some moral complexity, and is not quite the standard good guy/bad guy super hero film that we are used to, particularly when one takes into account the fact that the main villain, Ra's al Ghul, is acting on ""good intentions"". In fact, one could argue, that Ra's al Ghul adopts the position adopted by most super hero movies: that criminals are criminals because they are evil, and cannot be reformed, so the only thing to do is simply wipe them out. Batman represents a more subtle, and more complex, moral standpoint since he believes in reforming conditions as opposed to simply getting the ""bad guys"".

Those are just a few of the reasons this is one of my all time favorite movies. I think you should watch it.",1350086400,3,4959,5.025547445255475

1565609,3,B00005JNJV,"Ok, we all know that the 1997 flick, Batman and Robin was a total disaster, and we were yearning for a watchable Batman movie that would resurrect the franchise, but are we rating Batman Begins on pure emotion? Are we comparing it to Batman and Robin? Is it me, or was this movie a tad boring? It starts off at an anemic pace, then builds some momentum as Bruce Wayne finally gets up to speed as the character we've come to know. By the way, I didn't think much of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, though he wasn't terrible. There is an All-Star cast in this movie, which helps give it its credibility. I didn't like the Gotham City in this movie; it was too modern looking, and took away the atmosphere and tone. I prefer the way Tim Burton did the first two films, in that he created a darker and more believable setting. However, this movie has a solid storyline, especially with Wayne's personal conflict with how to handle himself as the winged vigilante. It just comes up short on screen.

1565688,5,B00005JNJV,"I have seen my fair share of superhero movies, and I find most of them to be garbage, you know, bad acting, no plot what so ever, action every 10 minutes, and stupid comedy sequences that just ruin the film, so I had my doubts about the modern Batman trilogy, I am very delighted to say that this superhero movie, does not fall into any of what I mentioned above.

First off, the acting is just superb, starting of course with Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, who really delivers a strong performance, I have come to be a big fan of Christian Bale, and it all started with this movie, I find that there is not many good actors out there today, but set aside a few, (Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, Johnny Depp) and Christian Bale, Michael Caine does a fine job at playing the butler Alfred, his accent, and facial expressions really fit the part which is looking out for Bruce Wayne's future, because he pretty much takes the father role after Bruce's parents are killed, poor kid, Rutger Hauer plays the head of Wayne Enterprises after he is killed, and I've always liked Rutger Hauer, he's not in it that much, but you know he's there, and Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors from the old school, and I was so delighted to see that he had a part in this movie, and a very big one at that, he play Ducat, and teaches Bruce how to fight, and he plays an important part to the story, you will see what I mean, Gary Oldman plays Jim Gordon, and does a fantastic job, he usually plays bad guys in movies, but this time, he's a good guy, and finally the great Morgan Freeman as Lucious Fox, the man who introduces Bruce to all the high tech gadgets, and explains them, he is perfect for the role.

And like I said, the story is compelling and keeps you interested as it really is a story about revenge, and humanity, and any normal person can relate to what Bruce is going through in his life, as we have all lost loved ones, it just makes it that much more interesting.

And the sets and special effects are just superb, not a lot of CGI was used in these movies either, which just adds to the talent and work that was put into these films, those sets of Gotham City were actually BUILT if you watch the documentaries, and the action sequences are very well done, as real as you can get for a fictional superhero movie.

And if you watch this movie on blu-ray, the work that Warner Brothers put into this disc is just the best, the picture is just stunning, just wait until you see the shots of Gotham City, and the scenes where Ducat is training Bruce on the ice in the mountains, the colors just jump right out and the image is so sharp, it's like you're really there, and the audio is loud and crisp, you can hear EVERYTHING, especially if you put it on the True HD audio channel, and have a stereo hooked up to your tv, it will basically feel like you're watching this in a theatre.

So final word, this is one of the few superhero trilogys that are very well done, my hats off to Christopher Nolan for not going into the cliche of most modern movies and overloading them with CGI and stupid comedy that ruins the movies and adds nothing to them, my rating is 5/5, also if you like this movie, watch The Dark Knight in blu-ray, I don't know which movie I liked better honestly, just watch them both, and when The Dark Knight Rises comes out on home video, I will be the first to be at my local store, I can't wait!",1347148800,,3424,4.2615384615384615

Dr. Crane, who now he'd rather be called ""Scarecrow"", is the main villain, gives people drugs so that they see illusions of their fears. My only issue is, is that there always has to be some kind of inappropriate scene, but thankfully, it was just a short part. Aside from that, AWESOME MOVIE! I'd like to say that the movie itself is not really scary, it's just very intense and I'd advise children under the age of 13 should NOT watch this. If they can handle the violence, then by all means, it's up to the parents. :) Best movie of the year and I gotta say this again... A WOW movie! :D",1345939200,,756,4.149659863945578

1565952,5,B00005JNJV,"After a series of ""Batman"" live action clunkers, Christopher Nolan shows what can be done with one of our best fictional characters.  Unlike nearly all other superheroes, the Batman has no super powers.  So how was Batman born?

In this stylish creation, Bruce Wayne is the son of a corporate giant living in Gotham City (New York is a stand in with bits and pieces of Chicago thrown in as well).  While playing keep away with his playmate Rachel, young Bruce falls into a well, disturbing a cave of bats who disburse all around him.  This leads to a fear of the animal that obviously has some bearing on his future.  While accompanying his parents to an opera [""Die Fledermaus"" (The Bat)], he becomes frightened and the family leaves early though a back alley.  Bad idea.

The city is under a crime wave.  Bruce's parents are murdered by a mugger.  Flash forward to Bruce's (Christian Bale) college years where he comes home to attend the parole hearing for his parent's killer.  Bruce's plan to kill the thug is preempted as he is killed by another on orders from the mob boss (Tom Wilkinson).  Bruce's guilt that his fear of bats caused his parent's death weighs heavily on him. He leaves his company and his billions of dollars and heads to some unnamed country in the Far East (assumed to be China or North Korea).  He ends up in a hell-hole prison but is rescued by a stranger (Liam Neeson) who offers to give him a new life.  But it will involve training under the guidance of Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) high in the mountains.

The training involves facing fear and death which leads Bruce's confrontation with his chiroptophobia.  Upon completion, Bruce learns that Ra's Al Ghul and his group known as the League of Shadows has been around for centuries destroying civilizations that become corrupt and unruly.  They plan the destruction of Gotham City and want Bruce Wayne to lead the charge.  His refusal leads to the eventual destruction of the training camp.  Bruce escapes, returning to Gotham City to make his own mark on crime as his alter ego, Batman.

With the help of his trusted aid and family protector Alfred (Michael Caine) and a previously demoted senior manager, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), the Batman begins his own war on crime beginning with the mob.  Thrown into the mix is a scheming psychiatrist (Cillian Murphy) who appears to be working for Falcone (Wilkinson) but has another agenda.  He has created an airborne gas that renders anyone who breathes it psychotic and hallucinogenic with their greatest fears amplified.

During Wayne's 7 year absence, his old childhood friend Rachel (Katie Holmes) has not only grown into a beautiful woman but a fierce assistant D.A.  She and Bruce still have a twinkling in their eyes for each other and despite some naysayers I found their chemistry to be honest and appealing.  This all leads to a bang up conclusion involving the arrival of the League of Shadows and his personal battle with Ra's Al Ghul.  This Batman is stylistically much different from the earlier films, not to mention the 60's TV series.  It is dark, foreboding, creepy and steeped with action.  What set it apart from others of the genre are the intelligent script, crisp direction and great editing.  Sure the film has some humorous quips but for the most part the ""A"" list actors take their roles seriously.  This film was my second favorite of 2005.

I suspect this Blu ray disc is akin to the earlier HDDVD package, which I've also seen.  While certainly an upgrade from DVD, it is not of the highest quality we see today.  Compare the movie with the 6 minute opening of the sequel (""The Dark Knight"") included on this disc and you can see the difference.  Still, it ain't bad.  It has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio and has a Dolby TruHD 5.1 audio track.  Again it isn't bad but not up to some of the better Blu rays out there today.  Going for $10 or so is still a bargain.",1342828800,2,3915,4.646288209606987

It starts out great and slowly goes down to good, but the whole thing runs out of steam at the end (despite the large amounts of aerosol fear gas at the end, heh heh) and it feels a bit inconsistent. Bruce Wayne talks about how it's never too late to save someone (or in his case save Gotham City) but Batman ignores an opportunity to save Ra's al Ghul's life. The ninja initiation is cool, intense and atmospheric, but the fight scenes as Batman are a jumble of cuts that come too quick to make any sense. That's really the problem right there: the Bruce Wayne sections of the movie are better than the Batman sections. I don't want Bruce Wayne! I want Batman!",1341532800,3,751,4.371428571428571

Nolan brought back the darker Batman that we all loved from the comics,along with a few new villains which we've never seen in a Batman film,before this one. I was really happy how Christian Bale played Bruce Wayne/Batman. He brought back that seriousness to the role that Michael Keaton had. I thought Ra's al Ghul was a great villain. It was kind of a letdown though,because we did not see much of him in the middle of the movie. Just at the beginning and more at the end. I was not very happy with Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow. I didin't think that a guy putting a potato sack over his head and gassing people was very scary at all. Overall though.

His attacks are one hit  knockouts that lay yo ass out for hours. I like christian bale as batman I just don't like the way he sounds or the way his head looks in the batsuit. His head is too round and his voice sounds so forced. But on the other hand hes very intense, he takes his character seriously, and understands how to portray both batman and bruce. Matter fact this was the first batman movie where I was just as interested in seeing bruce as seeing batman. I think all the other characters were casted perfectly and they all play there parts very well. I also love the dark, gritty, small city atmosphere in the movie, so as to leave room for a bigger city in the sequel.

1566029,4,B00005JNJV,"""What the hell are you!?"". ""I'm Batman.""

Batman Begins is the reboot of the Batman movie franchise. The film brings the decades of comics into reality, showing the famous Gotham City with a dark atmosphere, a twisted place where life thrives. The film may linger between action sequences but it provides a slow, understanding of Wayne's struggle dealing with his parent's death, fighting for his city and the innocent people that are trapped in by evil, tying it together with a brilliant cast and strong feel of realism.

Liam Neeson serves well as Wayne's mentor and equal in terms of intelligence, teaching him the skills he'll use which will strongly influence himself as Batman. Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne in as much onscreen time as the Dark Knight himself, something previous films lacked, making the Wayne character real & emotional, showing Wayne must perform as an egotistic, selfish, spoiled rich individual to space himself from the crime fighter.

Alfred provides a great supporting role as more than a butler, portrayed as a close family friend, with comedic one lines. Michael Caine brings certain elegance to the role, provided great heat in whatever scene he appears. Jim Gordon, like Alfred, has an expanded role in this reboot. Gary Oldman, know normally showcasing villains, shows struggles as a good cop in a department of corruption. Cillian Murphy finally brings the Scarecrow to life, doubling as the scary villain & controlling Dr. Crane of the famous Arkham Asylum.

Christopher Nolan directs, showcasing Gotham as dark metropolis, a large city that struggles for survival with or without the aid of a hero. David S. Goyer pens a good origin story, incorporating people, places and things from the comic source material while letting the audience get attached to the characters.

The Blu-Ray shows a nice clear picture of the dark Gotham, providing clear audio for dialogue and classical set soundtrack. Extras are plentiful but basic, mainly contains features of making scenes and costumes. The disc itself loads the movie right away; other features must be accessed through the popup menu. Unlike Batman media of the past Begins brings all the comic goodness into reality, making a smart, enjoyable movie for Batman fans and non fans alike.

Last Words: A-. The Blu-Ray provides a great casted movie, story wise and picture wise.",1339632000,2,2364,5.11139896373057

I'm a casual fan who doesn't know much about the details of the background from the comics, and I have not seen some of the older ones, so take that for what it's worth. But as a great story with great characters that looks great in blu-ray, it is hard to top Batman Begins. Most people I know preferred The Dark Knight when we saw it, but I stick by Begins as better of the two. With the new movie coming out, I encourage picking this up for your own collection or to show a friend who hasn't yet seen it.",1338595200,,540,4.05607476635514
1566032,4,B00005JNJV,"In a pivotal moment in Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne is ordered by his mentor Ducard to execute a man from a small village who has been accused of killing his neighbor because he coveted his land.  Wayne demurs, telling Ducard that the villager deserves to be tried for his crimes before punishment is meted out.  If we merely execute the man, Wayne argues, without a procedure in place to check our baser tendencies for retribution, then the result is not justice but rather retribution.  The question of where we draw the line between justice and vengeance becomes the core theme of Christopher Nolan's first foray into the Batman mythos, and it is a question that seems particularly suited to the character of Batman.  It is also a question that had been all but ignored in the years following the September 11th attacks.  In many ways Batman Begins is the quintessential post-9/11 film that manages to smuggle moral quandaries into a big budgeted blockbuster when the larger discourse surrounding terrorism seemed content to ignore basic questions of justice.

Tellingly, the villains of Batman Begins are an international terrorist organization by the name of the League of Shadows and headed by a mysterious character Ra's al Ghul.  It is later revealed that the League of Shadows has been around for centuries and exists to level empires that have become too big for their britches.  But before the League of Shadows reveals themselves as the villains, they first serve as a training organization for Bruce Wayne, a billionaire driven by the death of his parents to travel across the globe in an attempt to understand the world of criminals from the inside out.

Perhaps one of the most brilliant moves that Nolan makes in the film is to spend nearly half of the movie on the training and origins of Batman.  When Nolan's Batman film was release, it had been nearly eight years since the disastrous Batman & Robin, a film so poorly received that it single handedly killed of the multi-million dollar franchise.  Where Joel Schumaker's Batman & Robin attempted to resurrect the camp and humor of the old Adam West Batman series (although Schumaker's film didn't have one-tenth of the whit of the 1960s TV show), Batman Begins endeavors to shroud the superhero's origins in as much realism as possible.

The film cuts back and forth between Wayne's training with Ducard and his lost years dealing with the death of his parents.  In recounting Batman's origins, Nolan decides to include one of the most controversial figures in all of Batman's seventy year history: Joe Chill.  Plenty of Batman nerds (myself included) have argued about whether or not the murderer of Thomas and Martha Wayne should even have an identity.  Those of us who prefer the anonymous mugger version of the story claim that because the murderer is never caught, any criminal, whether it's an everyday bank robber or one of Batman's rogue's gallery, can serve as a stand in for the man who killed Batman's parents.  I've often found myself on the anti-Joe Chill side of this argument, but Nolan's treatment of the character has forced me to rethink my position.  Instead of a low life scumbag who murdered two people for a handful of cash and some jewelry, Joe Chill is portrayed as a desperate figure who turned to crime in the midst of an economic recession.  And his killing of the Waynes looks more like a man who acted out of fear than sadism.

By transforming the motivations for Chill's crime, Nolan expands the question of crime from the actions of individual actors to notions of systemic economic and ideological circumstances.  In fact, when the League of Shadows reappears in the film's climax, it is explained that the organization first attempted to level Gotham by leveling its economy, causing the recession that lead to criminals like Joe Chill.  This is an astute account of how terrorism works.  Many forget that one of the chief goals of the September 11th attacks was not merely the indiscriminate killing of innocent people; it was also an attempt to embroil the U.S. in foreign wars in order to bleed us dry with deficit spending.  By emphasizing the economics of crime and terrorism, Batman Begins asks us to question the root cause of violence.

The first half of Batman Begins is so well crafted, so methodical in its pacing, that it's almost a shame that Bruce Wayne has to suit up in the second half.  Batman's origins are so compelling that Nolan could have done the entire film without a single appearance of the cape and cowl.  (In fact, I've always felt that a TV series that followed Bruce around the world as he trains to become Batman would be a big hit).  The second half of the film is decidedly overstuffed, and it suffers from a glut of villains, a problem most superhero franchises don't run into until the sequels.  Batman faces off against the League of Shadows, Gotham's crime boss Falconi, and the deranged Scarecrow.  Any fan of the comics has to object to the inclusion of the Scarecrow in this film.  While his psychological obsession with fear and terror fit neatly within the themes of the movie, the Scarecrow is such a strong villain that it's truly a shame he doesn't receive the sole spotlight.  This may be a complaint reserved for comic book geeks, but as a member of this group, I must object.

Nolan also struggles when filming action sequences.  He uses so many quick cuts that it is nearly impossible to see what is going on.  At times this is intentional, such as when we are supposed to see Batman's hit and run techniques from the point of view of the criminals themselves.  But there are scenes later on that use the same choppy camera work for no particular reason.  At one point Batman has to fight four different ninjas, which sounds like the coolest thing ever.  But unfortunately Nolan slices and dices the fight choreography, making the entire thing nearly incomprehensible.

But perhaps the film's single most glaring misstep is Katie Holmes's tone deaf performance as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend, Rachel Dawes.  Whenever Holmes attempts to be charming she tends to smile with half of her face, which can be downright frightening.  But in her defense, she is given some of the film's worst lines of dialogue.  Even Katharine Hepburn couldn't deliver the phrase ""Some of us have work to do"" without sounding like a stuck up prick.  Superhero films have not always been kind to their female characters, and Batman Begins perpetrates this boy's club tradition.

Batman Begins is a much more uneven film in its second half than in its first half, but it still manages to meld big summer action with surprisingly nuanced questions of how we understand terrorism.  When Wayne refuses to executed the villager accused of murder, he asks us to question how far one can go with retribution before you become the very object you are fighting against.  How many indefinite detentions, indiscriminate aerial bombings, extrajudicial executions can a nation participate in until it is perpetuating the same kind of violence it has sworn to stop.  Batman Begins proves that when those in the media stops asking tough questions, popular culture can sometimes smuggle them into the public debate under the guise of entertainment.",1338163200,4,7260,4.851581508515815

And I thought the complaining of the campy Batman's was out of place, well this is a prime example of what happens when all the fun is soaked out of the Batman series. It is way too serious, with way too serious folks, all on the verge on the preachiness of life. Rachel Daws is such a meandering righteous character here I'm sad to say I'm almost glad she finally got to shut up in the next movie, for good. This is almost what differentiates kids from adults, if you knew like me as a kid, adult conversations were boring compared to the silliness and lightheartedness of kid talk. Nothing was taken seriously. This is an adult grown up Batman with nothing of the camp that made if fun from the 60s television show. Even the villians are boring. No memorable lines, and no over the top campy behavior. This is not based on a comic book as comic books define the term comic as fun, not serious drama as that of a dramatic novel. This movie is a pain to watch from any angle, and I am so glad the 60s series is available on You Tube with complete episodes. The villains are many, and extremely entertaining. I would love to hear the Joker in this series say something as lighthearted as, ""A joke a day helps keep the gloom away."" It will never happen as the Joker in this series is portrayed as a clever demented overbearing loony. And that's how the overall perception of this type of entertainment drama defines itself.

Well after watching Dark Knight one weekend, we decided to watch Batman Begins.  We came to the conclusion that if you watch Dark Knight first, and then Batman Begins, Batman Begins comes out looking a whole lot better than if you watch the movies in order of release.  They should have produced Dark Knight first and then Batman Begins, as Batman Begins feels like a much better ""answer the questions from Dark Knight"" movie than a standalone story.

1566150,4,B00005JNJV,"I don't want to start a ""who plays the best Batman"" argument going with this review. That is not the case here. Let me be clear that for the first time ever in movie format, the writers for Batman Begins FINALLY got Bruce Wayne's parents murder correct. I know that sounds strange, but it means a lot if you are a Batman fan. It was not the Joker or Harvey Dent who fueled Bruce becoming the Dark Knight. It was a thief... how hard was that to get right?  Aside from that, this origin story is believable with the present day setting and almost to the point of ""wow, this could actually happen."" The best part of this film is the minimal use of CGI. Of course the bats, parts of the train, and some of Gotham was CGI integrated, but still very believable looking. The Bat-mobile or Tumbler tank was a real treat to see. the amazing notion is that it actually exists and you couldn't help yourself with saying ""I want one!""

Another plus is there is an awesome amount of A-list actors and actresses in this film. All are wonderful performance with making a Batman story come to life scene after scene. The only problem I had with the movie were some new character additions like Rachel Dawes as a main character. But Katy Holmes performance was good so I immediately didn't mind her being in it. I know that people particularly Batman fans and non fans alike questioned the voice Christan Bale used. I just wish people would understand why. Unlike George Clooney's (gags self) or Michael Keaton's performances, you wouldn't talk in your normal voice if trying to hide your real identity and invoking fear into thugs. You want to mask your voice and sound intimidating. It did get questionable in The Dark Knight sequel, but I just wish people would get over this stupid hump. Watch the bonus features for the making of Batman Begins and watch Christian Bale perform. You will understand why he was chosen to be Batman.

The influences from various comic book source material is apparent. Most of the ideas like the famous bat swarm scene is from Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Year One mini series. Anyway, Batman Begins is worth a Blu-Ray price for 720 to 1080p resolution and High Definition surround sound. It's a must own for Batman or action movie fans.",1329782400,,2264,4.5851851851851855

However, after several accolades from consumers such as yourselves, I have decided to view this film with an open mind. ""Spectacular"" is the only word that comes to mind. I bet the entire Amazon universe and the world alike knows the plot of this film so I will not reiterate it.

I received a cardboard slip case that is displayed on Amazon.com's stock photo. Inside, you will also get a nice comic book that is an interesting read for avid Batman fans and newcomers.

The included special features disc is another unique view in Christopher Nolan's Batman universe and complements the feature film well.

And since this is a 2005 release, I won't spend anymore time on the story and themes.

I just want to comment on the video quality. It isn't very good! There is noticeable artifacting in many scenes. I viewed this on a PS3 on a 1080p plasma. I have viewed a number of blu-rays and they were encoded better. Heat for instance has probably an equal number of dark scenes to it and there was not as much artifacting.

1566257,5,B00005JNJV,"Since his first appearence in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939, the Batman has appeared in countless comics, live action and animated T.V shows, feature films, toys, and video games. The Batman has become a fixture of modern pop culture to such a degree that even those individuals that have never read an issue of the comic book know the story of how as a child Bruce Wayne witnessed the death of his parents, an event the inspired him to use his family fortune to become a vigilante as an adult.

After four feature films from Directors Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher from 1989 to 1997, that ran from the darkly gothic to the flamboyantly ridiculous, studio Warner Brothers decided to reboot the franchise with a film grounded in reality. Director Christoper Nolan's 2005 film Batman Begins explores how the childhood trama that Bruce Wayne suffers drives his obsession to fight fear and injustice. The film begins with Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) locked away in a prison in South Asia.  Through flashbacks we see the death of Wayne's parents and his resulting desire to learn about the criminal underworld so that he may learn to fight it.  Lost on his quest, Wayne is recruited by Henri Ducard (played by Liam Neeson), a member of the League of Shadows - an organization who seeks to fight injustice.  Ducard becomes a mentor to Wayne and provides the inspiration for Wayne to return to his home town of Gotham City (a fictional protrayal of New York) and become the Batman.

Wayne uses the resources of his family company, Wayne Enterprises, to secure his suit, gadgets, and Batmobile that he is known for.  The film strives to be as realistic as possible with the development of the Batman's tools.  It's nearly an hour into the film before we even get to see Wayne as Batman, but the journey to that point is so interesting that it feels extremely rewarding when we get to it.  There is a slew of characters, all protrayed excellently by a great cast.  Other than Bale and Neeson, Wayne's Butler and childhood guardian Alfred is played perfectly by Michael Caine. Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox - an executive at Wayne Enterprises that assists Wayne with his gadgets. Gary Oldman is superb as Sgt. James Gordon, seemingly the only honest cop in a truely corrupt city. Cillian Murphy is Jonathan Crane, the Scarcrow, a psychopharmacologist who works at Arkham Asylum and is working with Crime Boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) to bring fear-inducing toxins into Gotham. Actress Katie Holmes is Wayne's childhood friend/love interest and Gotham City assistant district attorney.

The sound and video presentation on this Blu-Ray are excellent given that this release is several years old now. The menus look outdated, but there is a good quantity of special features on this disc.  In addition to a picture in picture commentary track, there are several short featurettes ranging from 10 to 15 mins showing the various elements of the making of the film.  Also, there is a short preview for the film's sequel, The Dark Knight.

Overall, Batman Begins is a insightful look at the motivations of one of comic book's most interesting characters. At the time of the release of this film, I felt it was the best movie based on a comic book that I had seen. So far I believe only it's sequel, The Dark Knight, has surpassed it in terms of quality. It's relatively easy to find it for less than $10, so I recommend a buy price at $10 or less.  At the time of the writing of this review the film is also available on Amazon Video on Demand for $4.99.",1324080000,,3562,4.724193548387097

1566260,5,B00005JNJV,"First of all, forget your memories of Burton's films of Batman because this is much, much different.  Christopher Nolan takes a much darker approach to Batman and tends to swerve farther away from a comic book type feel for the movie.  Where Burton often used bright colors and dramatic close ups of caricatures of the infamous DC universe, Nolan takes a more subdued view of the characters and focuses on their psyches instead of their looks and over personalities.

Batman Begins, quite literally, spends its time showing the audience just how Bruce Wayne developed his alter-ego and then put that other side of him into effect so that he might make Gotham City a better place.  After his father died the city fell into the hands of greedy, biased, and lucrative men who allowed all of the hard work Bruce's father put into the city to fall to the wayside.  Constantly filled with anger and hate for the iconic thug that killed his parents and the city's inability to hold itself up, Bruce flees.  He searches for something to help him and he finds it in the idea, in the concept, in the teachings of Ra's al Ghul.  However, unable to completely follow the definition of ""justice"" presented to him, Bruce returns to Gotham City with specialty training under his belt and a new definition of what he needs to be.  What follows is a heart-stopping, action-packed thrill ride that speaks to any fan of the Batman tradition.

The main villain here is Scarecrow.  Just like Ra's al Ghul, he is not a well-known villain, but he definitely was part and parcel of the comics and deserves his place in the spotlight.  More importantly, however, the villain in this movie is based on fear.  Fear can control, can infiltrate hate, can skew logic, and can make people weak with the inability to act.  Bruce suffered from fear for most of his life which turned into hate and loathing.  The people of Gotham City live in fear and distress, unable to lift themselves out of the mire because of that fear.  Ra's al Ghul and Scarecrow both use fear to further their means while Batman, Bruce, also taps into the fear well to be used for the better.  It is the process of overcoming the psychosis of fear that makes this film so fascinating.  It, like the comic books, is something we can relate to and allows us to empathize with the characters.  Through this the true story of finding one's identity and fighting fear arises.

A great film for the layman and for the comic book connoisseur alike.",1321833600,3,2482,4.6255707762557075

1566407,5,B00005JNJV,"I like Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns. They are dark, funny, sexy, and work great as comic book adaptations. Then of course Schumacher's Batman Forever and Batman & Robin derailed completely the franchise. A new reboot was necessary but I don't think anyone was prepared to see how Batman's return to the big screen was going to be that spellbinding in the hands of the gifted director Christopher Nolan.

Batman Begins takes the hero to its origins in a most realistic, dark way. Bruce Wayne is not a perfect hero, he is driven by sorrow, anger, fear and desire of revenge and we see his struggle to overcome this in order to become Batman. Christian Bale is perfect as the tortured Wayne and also as the no-nosense Batman. What I like most about this film is how Nolan and Goyer were able to give Bruce Wayne the same weight as Batman and give him enough room to develop the character. Also, Bale is surrounded by an extraordinary supporting cast composed by Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes.

This film is not full of big action sequences or special effects. This is a much human and realistic portrait of an amazing character that slowly builds the foundation of future Batman films. A spectacular reboot.

Video & Audio:
BB has a solid but flawed video presentation. It's not bad and is superior to the SD DVD but it's not demo quality as The Dark Knight. Some night scenes look crushed and there is softness in some scenes. Still it offers balanced colors and there are not compression artifacts to see.

The 5.1 Dolby TrueHD is also great but it's not spectacular.

Bonus Features:
BB comes with some special features that include a PIP commentary, many featurettes which delves with the creation of Gotham, the cast, the action sequences, the special effects and more and the Imax Prologue of TDK. There is a great assortment of bonus material that will keep you engaged and entertained.

Closing Thoughts:
Batman Begins is the best origin movie for a superhero and the second best Batman movie (behind its sequel), its has a great story, a compelling hero and amazing supporting characters that make this film to stand above the usual hero films. Warner's BD is not perfect but its not awful and it has many insightful featurettes to keep you interested Recommended!!!",1311552000,2,2328,4.778606965174129

1566412,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins(2005) is a reboot of the Batman movies after the excessively campy Batman & Robin(1997) failed critically and commercially. This time around the emphasis is on plot and character and no campy nonsense. Director Christopher Nolan takes the story seriously and he avoids the ""weirdness"" from the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher Batman movies. Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) is living in Asia after college. Wayne beats up criminals and also ends up becoming one himself. He's still haunted after seeing his parents killed by a mugger. A group of Ninjas led by Ra's Al Guhl teach Wayne martial arts, but he leaves them after refusing to kill a man in cold blood. Wayne returns to Gotham City and is reunited with his butler Alfred(Michael Caine) and his love interest Rachel(Katie Holmes). Wayne becomes Batman and he must stop The Scarecrow(Cillian Murphy) from unleashing a fear-inducing gas on the city.
 Batman Begins is a solid film, but it's 20 minutes too long and it suffers from choppy editing! People complain about Christian Bale's raspy, ""Cookie Monster voice"". Michael Caine sure adds a sense of cool to his version of Alfred Pennyworth.
Morgan Freeman is quite good as Lucius Fox. Liam Neeson played Ducard, an ally of Ra's Al Guhl. The music score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is subtle and never ""in your face""!  Cillian Murphy(28 Days Later) is quite good as The Scarecrow. People also complain about Batman's large, bulky Batmobile-Tank in this film. This film does a good job satirizing the post 9/11 era.

1566471,4,B00005JNJV,"While it has its fair share of silly, over-the-top moments, Batman Begins was quite an enjoyable experience. My complaint has to be Rachel (the ""girlfriend""); the actress portraying her could have done better, the character herself wasn't likable in the least, and her only redeeming attribute was the fact that she was Bruce's childhood friend (and that she offered a couple of fortune cookie advices). Otherwise, her only purpose seemed to be saying things she had no right to say, fitting the role of worried but strong woman for the hero to save, and turning on her headlights at will. Yawn.

This story HAS to be told, and the ending left a nail-biting cliffhanger to The Dark Knight (which, I must admit, is the sole reason I bought THIS movie in the first place). Many scenes were done well, and I enjoyed the action sequences. The famous parents scene near the beginning brought tears to my eyes, especially when young Bruce was sitting in the police station. I'm sensitive, but it takes a special piece of cinematography to make me feel such empathy.

This is a movie with some seriously gritty action. It begins with Bruce Wayne as a child and his first up close encounter with bats. A fear for this creature then grips him. After his parents are brutally killed for almost no reason, the transition cycle reaches a next level.

The Missing Link:

This movie provides the missing link, the element that transforms a scared young boy into a fearless force for justice. This link is located in Asia where he is mentored by Ninja Cult leader Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). He develops his fighting skills, however, he fails to fully develop the ability to kill.

Launching the Batman:

Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) finds that upon his return to Gotham City, that it has been overrun by criminals. It is at this point he activates his alter-ego: Batman.

1566589,2,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is exactly what it sounds like, the early years of Bruce Wayne/Batman and his motivations. The film tries desperately to be more than what it really is, an okay action film.

Christian Bale is the perfect choice for Christopher Nolan's Batman and I am not saying that like a good thing. Bale is a totally un-charasmatic and bland actor who does little more than brood. His Bruce Wayne is not much of a human being, he is a machine operating on vengance. The real tragedy of Batman is that he is destined not to have a normal life in his persuit of his rather un-obtainable goal. Not once during this film do you feel that he is split, he simply has a one-track mind goes down one path. Not much genuine character development ever occurs, it's really just Bruce Wayne learning how to fight and then later acquiring his gadgetry.

When Bruce finally dons the mask, it's an introduction of an action film character and not so much a myth or a legend. True Batman uses fear and confusion to defeat the crowd of thugs by lurking and picking them off one by one; I wish I can only say the thugs were confused because the poorly shot fighting bewildered me as well and it's sadly evident through out the film. This again a case of trying to be ""realistic"" in a film that certainly needn't bother itself with such concerns. Batman is suppose to appear in full view of his victims so they, and the viewer, could absorb that he is the creature of the night come to attack his prey. Of course this could not work with this particularly banal costume Batman wears, it's really meant to conceal one instead of appearing as a theatrical figure; Totally wrong for film or comic books.

As for supporting cast, a lot of talent here is wasted. Liam Neeson is cast as the main anatognist as a very banal Ra's Al Ghul. Al Ghul, in the comics, was depicted as larger than life figure who is looked up to by his minions as a god and speaks like a biblical figure; He posses fantastic wealth and power beyound the common man due has lived longer than any human being in history. He wants to rid the world of man entirely so he can restore to it's natural beauty. This underwhelming counterpart in Nolan's film is little more than an angry man who lost his wife. Like Wayne, simply a machine for vengance but simply takes it one step further. Neeson does well with a banal role and the same can be said for Cillian Murphy. Murphy is not as boring as Al Ghul but he certainly is wasted. He plays a creep with burlap sack over his head, dubbed Scacrecrow, fascinated by fear and uses a gas to induce fear among people but he really is used as a tool in this film for Al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham. I would like to have seen Scarecrow as a genuine threat but he fails to be as much when he only successfully has one victim that no one has sympathy with. Finally we come to the allies and there isn't much to go on here. Everyone here is just ""meh"". Alfred and Rachel Dawes spout prentension about Bruce's obligations every five secounds and Gary Oldman does a good job as a young Jim Gordon not having much else to say because everyone else pointed out the obvious but he does do so at the end. Oh and Lucius Fox played by a Morgan Freeman on auto-pilot was a nice touch for some decent humor.

Now does this film hold up ? Not very well. The action is badly shot and editied, when people fight or get shot it's all in a blur. This seems to be the popular thing in film, bad presentation, but I don't see the appeal. The plot is incredibly stupid and worthy of a lame James Bond feature. Ras Al Ghul wants to use the Scarecrow's fear gas by dumping into the water supply and evaporating it into a gas using some giant Microwave Emitter. When you care about nobody in the film, it dosen't help too much to try and cobble together some silly ticking time bomb plot. They should have taken the time to make Batman an actual flesh and blood character and gave people credible dialogue which dosen't constantly hammer themes in. I love Nolan's formula of close ups, the banal Hans Zimmer score blaring, and then tossing in some fortune cookie sayings to make the film intelligent. Sorry Nolan, it didn't work on me. Let actions speak for themselves and let the audience decide.

Overall, this is an okay action film but if you want great Batman films, look no further than Tim Burton and Bruce Timm's freshman Bat outings.",1283472000,2,4408,4.377289377289378
1566590,4,B00005JNJV,"In my opinion, Batman Begins (2005) should have been called The Dark Knight because Batman takes centerstage in this movie, unlike in The Dark Knight (2008) where Batman seems to take a back seat to The Joker and Two-Face. That's the irony - in the movie that's called The Dark Knight, Batman actually takes a back seat to the villains, who steal the show. I personally think The Dark Knight should have been called The Joker Emerges, or something like that.

Now I want to make some observations about this movie.

First of all, it's inevitable that the new Christopher Nolan movies will always be compared to the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher movies, so that's one thing I myself will do. In contrast to Burton and Schumacher, Christopher Nolan went for darkness, realism, and seriousness in his Batman movies in an effort to make them far different than the semi-campy (though dark) Burton films and all-out campy and bright Schumacher films. I feel that Batman Begins is TOO real. It's TOO serious. To me, Batman movies should have an element of fun to them. An example is Batman (1989) - The Joker was evil, but he had dark humor to go along with his evilness. He used gadgets, like a hand buzzer and squirting lapel flower. Sometimes he went a little too far, like dancing, etc., but he showed he was funny as well as dark and evil. It was a good balance. It seems that in the Nolan movies, all the fun has been sucked out of them and they're way too serious and realistic. Their overall atmosphere and look seem a lot like cop dramas that you see on primetime weeknight TV. I found Batman Begins a little boring for the first hour or so, and this is a big reason why.  However, the second half of the movie kind of makes up for it with lots of action and suspense.

I thought the acting was pretty good. The best acting came from Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox was also pretty good. Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow was OK. I thought Scarecrow was somewhat of a boring villain who didn't do much, and borderline cheesy. Gary Oldman was pretty good as Commissioner Gordon. I thought Katie Holmes was pretty good as Rachel Dawes. I like her portrayal of Rachel Dawes a little better than Maggie Gyllenhaal's in The Dark Knight.

Christian Bale? I thought he was a mediocre Bruce Wayne and a mediocre Batman. Not bad, but not good. His voice while he's Batman sounds as if he's been smoking for 40 years. Bruce Wayne comes off as too much of a playboy in this movie as well as in The Dark Knight. He seems to have an attitude and is arrogant. I think Michael Keaton owns the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman in the 1989 and 1992 movies.

I dislike the Batmobile in this movie. Now, the Batmobile has been through many incarnations in previous movies. First, there was the Batmobile from the '60s TV series and 1966 movie called Batman: The Movie. Then, the Batmobile from the '89 and '92 movies. Then a different one in the '95 and '97 movies. They all were CARS. Like they should be. Right? Well, Christopher Nolan decided that the Batmobile appeared as a car too often, so he changed it to what is called a ""Tumbler"" that looks like a cross between a tank and a Hummer, so now the Batmobile isn't even a car. Bad. This goes too far, in my opinion.  The Batcave? It was cool. It's slightly better than the Batcave from the Tim Burton films.  Batman's costume? It was on par with the costumes used in the '89 and '92 Tim Burton films, maybe slightly better.  Some of the conditions in this movie were unique and different, such as the pouring rain in a few scenes.

I found the musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard to be flat and unmoving in not only this movie, but The Dark Knight as well. They in no way compare to Danny Elfman's masterpiece scores from the 1989 and 1992 movies.

I found the movie hard to follow at times, so I needed to watch it again to understand it.

This is a two-DVD set that comes with many extras.

I think this movie is better than The Dark Knight.  This movie isn't as much of a mess and complicated like The Dark Knight is.  The Dark Knight is all over the place, with some scenes in Hong Kong, too many characters, a confusing story, plot holes, and it's way more serious than Batman Begins, and I thought Batman Begins was serious.  The Dark Knight tops it.

When I think of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies, the first thing I think of is cops, cops in riot gear, SWAT teams, and tons of police cars.  It's way overdone, but especially in the second and third movies.  The second thing I think of is Law & Order, NYPD Blue, and CSI: NY.  The movies feel like these cop dramas, especially the second and third movies.

Overall, this is a good movie, but I still prefer the movies from 1989, 1992, 1995, and 1997, especially the 1989 and 1992 movies.

If you've never seen a Batman movie before, I think you should watch this as well as The Dark Knight and then watch the 1989 and 1992 movies for starters so you can do the inevitable comparison just like I have. You might like the older movies better, or you might like the new Nolan movies better. Everyone has their own opinions.

UPDATE: April 23, 2013 - I rank Batman Begins (2005) the best of the trilogy followed by The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and then The Dark Knight (2008).",1283212800,2,5326,4.423312883435583

I am a 40-year-old male college grad, with no Batman product experience in the last 15 years, although I have seen a lot of other TV/movies.) So I am adding this review for any potential viewers that are like me to consider.

This was a decent action movie, not as good as Spiderman 2. I did love their basic idea of explaining how Batman and all his props and methods came to be. Some of the acting was subpar, although Christian Bale was OK. The fight scenes could have been easier to follow. The main problem as often happens for me, is the story. It seemed like a bunch of scenes from other movies strung together, and I kept having this feeling that things were just too convenient and/or weren't making logical sense. There were occasional good effects, or surprising twists in scenes, but too often they were just ho-hum.

With this role, Christian Bale got into a hot streak from 2005-2009 that have rarely ever been seen before in Hollywood history (just don't say in the world as Andy Lau of Hong Kong cinema has been in over 100 big-screen movies). Bale probably appeared in over 10 movies in lead roles in that span, and deservedly so after this performance.

1566659,5,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" has enough plot elements for 3 or 4 movies, and, amazingly, they all work, and they are all exciting.

The movie is very dark, but this is fitting.

Even the early scenes, of Bruce Wayne's childhood trauma with the bats, and his later trek to the lamasery, are interesting in themselves, and add a lot of emotional weight to the later scenes.

The acting is just superb.  Gary Oldman, who is one of the best actors ever, manages to be humble and awe-inspiring at the same time.  Morgan Freeman is understated and funny and riveting.  Katie Holmes shines.  Liam Neeson is persuasively ambiguous.  Cillian Murphy is deliciously creepy.  And even Christian Bale, who has the expressive range of a tree-stump, manages to be believable, likable, and complex.

(Tom Wilkinson, as a Mafia-boss, is a little over the top, but still a lot of fun.)

Lots of twists and turns.  Lots of surprises.  Great stuff.",1274054400,2,915,4.788461538461538

1566664,5,B00005JNJV,"I did not care much for any of the previous Batman films.  The first movie, which was directed by Tim Burton, was okay I guess.  I had some major problems with it, but it wasn't horrible.  I just didn't think it was very good.  (A position I have held since I first saw that movie, not just since I saw the Dark Knight.  Although I don't see what difference it makes if Dark Knight had made me like Batman '89 less).  I got some serious heat when I reviewed that movie.  There's nothing else I can say about my position on that movie that I haven't stated many times already.  You either agree with me or you don't.  I can't do any more to change your mind.  Batman Returns was, in my opinion, the closest that the Warner Bros. Batman series came to making a great Batman movie.  Again, many people disagree with me, but that's my position.  Batman Forever was not good, but I don't hate it.  It was meant to be a lighter Batman movie that younger kids could enjoy, after the parental backlash that Batman Returns got.  Batman and Robin was admittedly a fiasco, but I actually enjoy watching that movie.  It's what could be called an unintentional comedy, a movie that sucks so badly that it is actually funny.  Nevertheless, that movie killed the Batman movie franchise, and it was not resurrected again until eight years later.  Batman Begins was at the time the best Batman movie by far, and is still one of the best superhero comic book movies I have ever seen in my life.  It doesn't just fix all the problems of the previous movie series.  It erased those movies from my mind and showed me what Batman really looks like on the big screen.

Man, where to begin.  Let's start with the plot.  This movie abandons the continuity of the previous series, and starts a whole new story line from scratch.  This was definitely a wise choice.  In this movie, we actually get to see the origin of Batman, who he is, his training, and we actually explore why he became Batman, something Batman '89 never really answered.  At all.  It was probably a wise choice not to put Batman's origin and the Joker in the same movie, mainly because the Joker is more interesting than Batman.  I didn't like Jack Nicholson's interpretation as the Joker, but he still overshadowed Keaton's performance of Batman.  No matter how you play the Joker, he is always going to steal the show away from Batman in any film.  That's what happened in the Tim Burton movie, and that's what happened in The Dark Knight.  Except it was okay in this instance, because this movie is centered on Batman.  In Dark Knight, the Joker takes center stage, but we already have been introduced to Batman in the previous movie.  The movie starts with Bruce Wayne in a Chinese prison, a man who has pretty much lost his way.  He is approached by Henri Ducard, who wants him to join the League of shadows.  Through a series of flashbacks, Bruce's childhood is revealed, and how his parents were murdered in a random mugging.  It was nice that they put in Joe Chill, the man who killed the Waynes in the comics.  I didn't really care for the '89 version which had the Joker killing Batman's parents in order to set up the complicated relationship that Batman and the Joker have.  In this version, just like in the comics, Bruce feels animosity towards crime in general, not just against one person.  The fact that Bruce is never able to take his revenge on Chill really generalizes Batman's mission.  In the '89 version, when Batman finds out that it was the Joker who killed his parents, then after he killed the Joker, why would he continue to be Batman?  He would feel a sense of finality in avenging his parents' murder.  In this movie, he lost his parents without ever really being able to avenge their murders.  The only way he can truly avenge their murders is by destroying the thing that killed them: the corruption in his city.  He wants to clean up all of Gotham, and in so doing come to terms with the loss of his parents.

Bruce enters training as part of the League of Shadows, but when he realizes that he will be expected to kill criminals, he turns on Ra's al Ghul, the mysterious leader of the League of Shadows.  Fighting for his life, Bruce unintentionally causes Ghul's death.  Ducard, who had supervised Bruce's training, almost falls to his death, but Bruce saves his life.  Bruce returns to Gotham to implement his training.  He becomes Batman, and no one suspects him even though Batman appears right after he comes back after being gone for seven years.  I do love this movie, but that is a small plot hole.  Batman apprehends Carmine Falcone, one of the city's biggest mob bosses.  Bruce then discovers that Falcone was working for the League of Shadows, and plans to introduce the Scarecrow's fear toxin into the air to cause the city to destroy itself through mass panic and hysteria.  Bruce also discovers that a recovered Ducard is in fact the actual Ra's al Ghul, and the other one was just a decoy.  Batman stops Ra's by destroying the train that Ra's was using to disperse the gas.  I didn't like this scene when I first saw it as a fifteen-year-old kid.  Batman actually killed someone.  And I'm going to go off on a tangent here to talk about Batman killing people.  Batman does not kill people.  Yes, I realize he did in the old, old comics.  But that was in the early days of Batman, before he really became who he is today.  In today's Batman comic continuity, Batman does not kill.  It is because his parents were murdered in front of him.  This is one of the defining attributes of Batman.  He hates killing.  If you say that it is okay to make a movie about Batman which depicts him killing people, then I make this argument.  In the original Superman comics, it is not revealed where Superman is from.  Jor-El and Lara are not his parents, and nothing can hurt him, not even Kryptonite.  You can't use Batman's ancient history as a way of explaining away huge errors that some movies have made about him.  So as I was saying, I didn't like this scene as a kid.  But then I realized something.  Batman didn't put Ra's on the train.  He didn't force Ra's to drive toward the Wayne tower.  He just left the car when the train was about to crash.  Anyway, after this Batman and Gordon agree to finish cleaning up the city.

Let me get into the casting.  They originally wanted David Boreazaz to play Batman, but he declined the role.  Which is a shame.  After seeing him on Angel, I think he was born for the role.  Regardless, Christian Bale is by far my favorite Batman.  I know some people prefer Keaton, and I kind of understand why.  The thing is, Bale is much better rounded than Keaton.  Because Keaton plays a horrible Bruce Wayne.  Christian Bale is the first guy who could successfully play both Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Some people complain about his voice, how it's so loud and raspy.  My argument is, it scares the crud out of the bad guys, and that's kind of his main purpose in being Batman, striking fear into the hearts of criminals.  Bale also is great at beating up the bad guys.  Some people complain that the action is to quick and jerky, and you can't see much of it.  But the thing is, Batman is supposed to be one of the most advanced martial artists in the world.  Very advanced martial arts like that is pretty hard to see, even in real life.  Of all the Batman movies, I thought this one did the best as far as choreographing the action scenes.

Just about all of the other cast members were perfect in their roles.  After Batman and Robin, I'm surprised they got so many big names in the movie.  Morgan Freeman is brilliant as always, in his performance of Lucious Fox, Bruce Wayne's business manager.  Michael Caine was perfect for the role of Alfred, Bruce's butler/father figure.  Liam Neeson was great as Ra's al Ghul, and he is my second favorite live action Batman villian, behind Heath Ledger's Joker.  Cillian Murphy was great as the Scarecrow.  People complain that he didn't have enough screen time, and he was underdeveloped.  I thought they spent as much screen time as was necessary.  They hit on his obsession with the mind and it's power over the body, and his obsession with fear.  I don't really know what else they could have done with him.  I really don't think the Scarecrow is interesting enough to be the primary antagonist in a Batman movie.  In my opinion, Gary Oldman is the best actor in this movie.  He completely disappeared into his role.  He became Jim Gordon.  He even made himself look like the drawing of Gordon in Year One.  It wasn't even Gary Oldman anymore, it was actually Jim Gordon.  If there was one performance that was a little weak, it was Katie Holmes' performance as Rachel Dawes.  She was way too self-righteous, and she got on my nerves.  She was supposed to be the voice of reason, I guess, but to me she just came across as an egomaniac with an annoying holier-than-thou attitude.  She wasn't horrible, but she is definitely the weakest link in a long line of excellent performances.

Overall, this is not just a great superhero movie, it is a great movie period.  I think this is far better than the four previous Batman movies combined.  Not only did it get Batman right, but it got all the other characters down, and there were a lot of them.  This was possibly the best comic book movie of all time for a while, until it was topped by the Dark Knight three years later.",1269561600,,9441,4.484420928865373
1566702,5,B00005JNJV,"in my mind,Batman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.the movie basically tells the story of the genesis of the caped crusader.obviously,there is a fair amount of character development involved,which you would expect based on the title.but not so much that the film becomes tedious. Batman is shown as more of a full dimensional character than in previous incarnations..Director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a director,pacing the film very well.there are also some touches of humour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce Wayne. The villains are also more fully realized than in most movies of the genre,instead of simply being devices for the hero(the protagonist)to have a villain(antagonist)to defeat. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are standouts in their respective roles,as is Liam Neeson. Katie Holmes has yet to reach the level of maturity require for her role,so she is a bit weak. This Batman movie is less cartoonish than previous efforts,and is closer to the realm of realism(relatively speaking).the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting superheros.there is much more substance.in fact more substance than style,though it is just stylistic enough.

1566709,4,B00005JNJV,"This movie has grabbed the attention of all those who have grown up in American culture with batman as there childhood hero. This movie revives the darker side of the dark knight as opposed to the corny movies of the nineties. It is a heart breaking scene to see the psychological trauma the young Bruce Wayne goes through as his parents are gunned down and become the victims of a mugging. As a result of this trauma Bruce becomes confused about his life and his purpose, he becomes a bit of a juvenile brat of sorts. Upon the hard truth that a friend named Rachel gives him, Bruce sets out upon a soul searching period and travels to Asia and ends up in a prison that toughens him up. Finally he is discover by a ninja master who belongs to a sect that has for centuries used their power to better the world through violent means. This group has a truly utilitarian view of justice seeing that it doesn't matter who gets hurt as long as in the end more happiness and peace can be seen in the world. It is interesting to note that this line of thought wouldn't typically be found in the Asian culture, but is more a western idea that was imposed on them in this movie. Bruce eventually rejects this philosophy and seeks what he considers to be just vengeance. The one difference between the ninja sect that trained him is that he refuses to kill because it will make him like the criminals and particularly the criminals that killed his parents. Bruce takes one the image and title batman in response to a childhood fear of his, in order to frighten the criminals from their ways. Near the end of the movie he pushes the line with his convictions by letting a man he could have saved die, in some sense relieving him of the guilt of the mans death.
 Overall this movie is a good watch although there are some philosophical reservations that should be taken into account. It is an interesting fact that the ""bad guys"" where a group with a utilitarian philosophy and the ""good guy"" had a self imposed ethical code which is a very postmodern way of thought. This is interesting because postmodernism is the trendy thing or the worldview that is in at the moment. How this movement comes out in movies is subtle but their there if you look for them.
 Also ethics is something that simply can't be avoided when dealing with Hollywood movies. The sad fact is that Bruce was seeking revenge for his parents and could never and can never become satisfied with it because of the simple fact that vengeance only leaves a person feeling empty inside. He took his anger out on those whom never did him any person harm, and as a result of the life he has chosen to live he pushes away the only one in his life whom could perhaps find relief from his pain in. And do we really want our young people to buy into the mentally that when someone wrongs you, violence is the proper response towards those who do wrong. Is it not those that live by the sword that die by it. And those that are violent only spawn more violence around them. Although it should be noted that appropriate responses to correlating crimes under the law are a bit different. But to become a vigilante and break the law in order to uphold it is a bit oxymoronish.
 Batman is yet another in a series of dark heroes who push the line as far as most can accept it. Everything unto the point of death, even torture is deemed right or even ethical for the batman. The impressionable young are never considered when these heroes are portrayed sadly to say. And to say that they and even us adults aren't impressionable is absurd, if not then explain to me why the advertising industry spends billions of dollars a year on media if it didn't have an effect on how people behaved?

This flick was amazing.

After the disaster that was Batman & Robin, I was so scared about how this would turn out. Sure, the trailers looked cool, dark, and edgy, but studios always put the best bits in the trailers anyway. All we had were hopes and good-sounding quotes from those involved in the film's production.

And, man, did they deliver!

This stuff was real. Real-real. Batman Begins was grounded in reality in a way I hadn't seen since X-men. This stuff could really happen. It was that tone that brought a level of seriousness to the movie that the other bat-flicks--except Batman in 1989--didn't have. This wasn't a superhero movie, but a story about a man lost in rage, darkness and needing a way out. It was about the very real contrast between revenge and justice, and making right what once went so terribly wrong.

It's a story about redemption, love, and fighting to protect strangers in a city where crime, filth and evil are the everyday norm.

Christian Bale is Batman. Period. When the mask was on, you could tell Bruce was channeling pure rage and distaste for evil, focusing all that anger on the task before him. When the mask was off, he was the Bruce Wayne who was a spoiled rich boy, dumb, and no one took seriously. Excellent duality.

Katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend/love interest, Rachel Dawes, was a good thing. The other bat-movies always had a girlfriend for him. Though their was romantic interest here, it was rooted in friendship, which was a nice change.

Michael Caine as Alfred--brilliant. He was your loving father-figure, yet was stern with Bruce when the need arose, and even got behind him when Bruce told him his grand plan for saving Gotham. Only the love of a friend would allow such a thing: to believe in an ideal and not necessarily the method.

Cillian Murphy was downright creepy as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. I only knew him from 28 Days Later so wasn't sure how he'd play this. Let's just say I was happy.

Liam Neeson as Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul was all right. As Ducard, sure, made sense. He did a great job as Bruce's mentor. The two were the same at heart. Just chose different paths. As Ra's--that twist didn't surprise me (solely because I stumbled upon the script online before I saw the actual movie), but it did surprise me in the sense that Liam Neeson will always be Qui-Gon Jinn to me. It was hard to see him as a bad guy.

Gary Oldman is James Gordon. He looked the part, acted the part, and I fully sympathized with him being pretty much the only good cop in a bad town.

Batman Begins is the quintessential bat-film.

Anyway, this movie is good. It gives the origin story of Batman and how Bruce's parents died. It gave you two really cool villans, Ra's Al Gul and the Scarecrow, and it was a good origin story.

What I would like to discuss is the picture quality of the Blu-Ray version. I was very disappointed that Warner Bros didn't take more time giving customers the best transfer possible. They originally released this on HD-DVD which needed to be compressed more than a blu-ray disc due to HD-DVD having smaller storage space. I hoped that they would create a whole new transfer for the larger capacity blu-ray, but they used the same exact old hd-dvd transfer. It's still in 1080p so it looks great compared to a DVD or the over-compressed HD broadcasts on cable, but it's definitely not one of the better blu-rays in terms of picture quality. most people won't notice as the image is clear, but not super crystal clear like other blu-rays, such as ""The Dark Knight"". Since the ""Dark Knight"" became such a box office hit, maybe Warner Bros will revisit ""Batman Begins"" and give it a better transfer. But, as of this review, Amazon is listing the blu-ray at 9.99 so the cheap price might make up for the picture quality issues.

1566842,5,B00005JNJV,"What a great start to a new franchise!

The previous Batman films were getting a bit hokey, kinda like the camp of the Adam West sixties TV show (of which I was an avid fan) but not nearly as entertaining.

Christopher Nolan and Dave Goyer came up with a new origin story with a mix from the comics' origins.  Let's take Bruce Wayne, we'll keep the tragic loss of his parents shot by Joe Chill (thank you Bob Kane) and mix a little Ras Aghul (from the 70s comics) and throw in some martial arts.

The League of Shadows, the cult group that pulled Wayne out of the suicidal funk he was in, found and purged his fears but wanted to use him as a pawn to bring down Gotham just as it brought down other civilizations over thousands of years.  Not agreeing to their methods, Bruce destroyed their camp, but in the process saved Neeson, who himself carried on the LOS name and mission.

The Falcony gang continues unopposed to rule Gotham, with its Mafia standards.  Batman puts a crimp in his style.  The Scarecrow, aka Dr. Crane, with his own methods of insanity and destruction, also a pawn in the LOS game.

Chase scenes, a bit of James Bond utility devices and a real, character-driven story that surpasses earlier attempts at telling the story of the Bat.  Katie Holmes is not too bad as the kinda sorta girlfriend of Bruce -- could have been a little more emotional, but that's hard when the Bat gets in the way.  Like MJ and Spiderman, the Bat or the Spider get in the way.

1566843,5,B00005JNJV,"Tim Burton fostered in a new era of superhero films with his impressively dark, original Batman films BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS. Then Joel Schumacher trashed all that with his horrific, comical and empty flicks BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN AND ROBIN.

Thankfully, Christopher Nolan's 2005 rendering BATMAN BEGINS is a fine return to form for the popular dark superhero. Nolan based BB in ""reality"" and focuses on young Bruce Wayne (excellent work by Christian Bale), who witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, who travels the world trying to understand the criminal mind and ends up undertaking ninja training in the Far East under the tutelage of Henri Ducard (a slyly malevolent Liam Neeson) and Ras Al Ghul.

Upon his return to Gotham after years of exile, Wayne resumes his place as the head of Wayne Manor, which was taken care of in his absence by family major domo Alfred (fine performance by the esteemed Michael Caine) and Wayne Industries, run by Mr. Earle (wonderfully played by veteran screen bad guy Rutger Hauer). Wayne also meets Lucius Fox (reliably played by the great Morgan Freeman), the head of the Development section of Wayne Industries, and enlists his help in obtaining high-tech equipment so that he can begin leading his double life as both Wayne and Batman. Last, but not least, Bruce re-acquaints himself with his childhood friend and now assistant DA Rachel Dawes (played surprisingly well by Katie Holmes).

So the adventure begins! Batman prowls the streets of Gotham at night taking out scuzzy lowlifes at first (he saves Rachel from some goons on the subway) and making his initial mark. He also thwarts the city's top criminal Carmine Falcone (solidly played by Tom Wilkinson), who ironically is the man who ordered the kill of the man who killed Bruce's parents. Batman also meets Police Sgt. Jim Gordon (superb work by Gary Oldman), who initially skeptical, ends up being the conduit between Batman and the police force. Batman runs into a higher class of criminal in Dr. Crane/Scarecrow (creepily played by Cillian Murphy), who shoots a toxic concoction from his mask to literally psych out his victims. At the climax, Batman must save Gotham from his former mentor Ducard, who it turns out was the head ninja Al Ghul all along!

BATMAN BEGINS is perhaps the first Batman film to focus primarily on the hero himself and not the villains. A highly involving character study of one man's despair, disillusionment, acceptance, strength, and resolve, Nolan manages to elevate BB above the genre. I've not seen all his work, but I've got to believe this is perhaps one of the best (if not the best!) performance of Christian Bale's career. Additionally, Nolan does a good job of CGI-ing effects to make a real city an authentic stand-in for Gotham. A superhero film where the protagonist is the star? Novel idea!",1258502400,,2850,4.93125
1566844,5,B00005JNJV,"Live-action wise (the animated films having always retained a mature nature since 1992), this is the best take on Batman since Burton's two. Batman's origin's are explored and some of his training is delved into. Christian Bale makes for a good Batman, the voice that he uses for the character doesn't get on my nerves as most people would think but my main complaint are, like others, is the action sequences. There are too many fast cuts and the action is just barely indistinguishable. Michael Caine is the best Alfred, Michael Gough from the previous four hardly being in them until Batman & Robin, and that was only because he was dying. Caine's version is much more involved with Bruce and cares about him, a noted scene being when he's driving a poisoned Batman home. You can tell that he's deeply worried about him. Katie Holmes. How to describe her. Well she's more believable as a DA than Denise Richards was a physicist but she doesn't really convey any emotions (much like Lois Chiles and Barbara Bach from the Bond films). And her inexplicable interest in wanting to know Batman's name seems almost forced in my opinion. I know he saved her life, twice, but she's never really given any inclanation to really find out who he is. Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy are perfect as Ra's al Ghul (Ra'Z al Ghul is not his name) and the Scarecrow respectively. My main problem with the villains, Scarecrow imparticular, is that they look nothing like their comic book counterparts. I know Nolan wants to keep a ""realistic"" look to the films but I wish he were a little more faithful to how they looked in the comics. The plot is very good, with plenty of twists and turns to keep a new viewer on their toes. Lastly, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer's score is quite good but their heroic theme is quite forgettable when compared to Danny Elfman's, but definitely a step up from that atrocious Elliot Goldenthal.",1257552000,,1917,4.674556213017752

1566849,3,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins definitely creates a new story line and creative resurrection of the D.C. Comic character. This movie is definitely long due to the fact of the director laying down the foundation of how the character of Batman was originated. The movie starts out with quite a bit of action. The fight scenes are laid out very well and will keep the viewer's attention for definitely the first 30 minutes of the movie. However, the story does tend to drag out and you may find yourself getting bored or letting your mind wonder. Christian Bale is kind of silly for the part due to his lame dialogue and his monotone voice can be quite comical. However his fighting choreography and physical physique makes up for this partially. Although the movie does have sufficient action and suspense and looking over the stretched out plot the movie really lacks a main villain that is familiar to the Batman franchise that a die hard fan can recognize. The movie does feature Scarecrow who is a major villain of Batman if your familiar with the series, however he isn't a major keystone. Despite all of this I still think that if you enjoy Batman as a comic book character or from the previous movies or shows this movie is positively satisfying. It definitely corrects the saga from where the movie series was going from the last two Batman movies after Tim Burton stopped his directing of the series (which was right in the trash can). This movie is very realistic in creating the myth of Batman and doesn't branch out to extreme, but of course it does go a little bit on limb with its fanatic villain's plot, but what do you expect.......its Batman.",1254528000,,1640,4.658620689655172

Year One is a cult classic in the telling of Batman, and there are alot of liberties taken in this film that die hard fans could raise an eyebrow at, but overall this movie is by far the best in the series.

The origins of Batman were glossed over in the series prior to this and knowing more about the psyche of Bruce is key to understanding his alter ego.

Realistic, gritty, and the story of how a man decides to dedicate his entire being to stop from happening to others what once happened to him. I applaud the choice of Nolan to use Ra's as the villain, instead of just going with the usual Penguin or Catwoman or something that could easily be done. Ra's is Batman's greatest foe, and was done great justice in this film.

I choose this film over The Dark Knight for one reason, really. The Dark Knight was a little TOO realistic. Batman is a comic book character, after all, and Gotham city is a fictional city, filled with fantastic villains as well as the normal real life problems that plague everyone else. In Batman Begins, the city of Gotham feels like it could be a real city, but it also gives you a view of twisted places like The Narrows that remind you of the fantastical portion of the story. The Dark Knight, on the other hand, just looks like it takes place in Chicago. I didn't get that fantasy feeling from it at all. I guess it is more just a personal preference, but I feel like Batman Begins had the perfect balance of reality and fantasy, without catering to either one more than it should.

Both Nolan Batman movies are exactly what Batman should be, but I just feel that this one got it MORE right the first time.",1246492800,,1332,4.4105691056910565
1566904,5,B00005JNJV,"That's a typical prequel. After a certain number of films about and with Batman and his adventures, the saga felt the need to have an origin, a beginning, and a prequel came out of the box. This prequel really has all the necessary qualities to make it interesting, plus a few extra kicks. Of course the childhood of the dear Bruce. He fell into a well, which was not a well but it looked like one and he frightened thousands of bats who attacked him on their way to some escape. That's his fear. Then he is the witness of the double assassination, or murder, of his father and his mother, and then we jump to his young age when he runs around the world and ends up in some Tibetan ninja-monk-hostel where he meets with some crazy guru who wants to make the world right by killing everyone in Gotham as an example to the world. Our Bruce refuses and comes back to Gotham and tries to set things right, to set crime right, to bring criminals to court and to have them severely convicted and sentenced. It's when the guru comes back and tries to put his plan in action. Batman will stop him of course, and at the same time he will settle his family business right by re-buying the shares of it and taking the control of it directly. Plus a crazy doctor, or mad doctor if you prefer, plus his girl friend from far away, Rachel, and a little bit of sentimental honey. You have it right. It must work if you create fear and panic. As for that the film is superb and the special effects are so special they nearly look natural though abnormal. Of course the formula is not new. I could quote films and books with the same elements, maybe not all at the same time in one book or one film, but all in Stephen King, Anne Rice and many others. The lessons that are behind that story is that you cannot make people happy if they don't want to be; that you cannot trust any unregulated free market economy because there are also some human beings who will negotiate all obstacles to make a bigger profit, and embezzling and corruption will bring the system down; that there is no justice if there is not a court, a trial, a conviction, a sentence, and the possibility of parole; that people need a dream, a symbol, a vision to be set on the right road and to stay on it. And a few other goodies, if you read between the lines and behind the punctuation. Quite great fun all together and if you don't like the philosophy, you can always get detached and fly to some kind of nirvana, even if it is artificial.

Thankfully before their death, they imbedded Bruce with good teachings to make him a good man when he grows up. Later on in life, as a young man, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) comes back to Gotham City seeking revenge on the man that killed his parents. When plans don't go accordingly, and also when he lets someone know what his intentions were, he realizes that his path for doing good for the city, isn't the correct path to do it in. So he leaves Gotham to escape and to find his way. And then a man by the name of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) finds Bruce and tells him of a secret place that will teach him to fight for justice, but he must get there alone. When Bruce gets there, he begins his training in martial arts, ways of the ninja, and fighting what he fears most. After 7 years, Bruce finally returns to a Gotham City that is slowly falling into the bad guys hands. And Bruce takes it upon himself to help rid Gotham of the bad. To make them fear what he fears. To make them face Batman. As Batman begins to clean up the city, he finds out about a plan that will destroy Gotham City schemed up by Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) and someone from his past. A toxin that will make everyone go crazy is about to be released in Gotham and Batman is the only one that can stop it.

After some really bad Batman sequels (4 and 5 in particular), the franchise seemed to have been shot like a race horse with a broken leg. How could you ever come back from nipples on the bat suit? And then Christopher Nolan steps up and says ""Hey yo, WB, I'm bout to hit you up the side of the head with a sweet Batman cause you know, I did Memento and Insomnia"". Ok he didn't really say that, but he did promise them greatness, and greatness was delivered. While at first you think Batman starts off a little slow, you have to realize that we are delving into the persona of Batman himself. The reasons why he became the bat. The way he learned to fight the way he does. And to realize the biggest thing of all... that Batman is just a man. He has no super powers. He gets hurt just like the rest of us, except his been in some rigorous training to help ignore a lot of the pain. And it's great to see the two separate entities when it comes to Bruce and the Bats. Batman is the true man now, while Bruce is just the disguise that hides him. While Batman is fighting crime and avenging justice, Bruce is the cocky and fun playboy millionaire that no one would suspect is Batman. Christian Bale was great as both. I still think Michael Keaton is my favorite Bruce though because he just has a `coolness' about him, but Christian was definitely great also and is my favorite Batman, even with his kind of weird Batman voice.

Christian Bale isn't the only awesomeness going on here in this movie either. Gary Oldman plays, perfectly, Detective Gordon. Even down to the look of him in the graphic novel `Batman: Year One'. Oldman usually plays bigger roles, but man I'm glad he played Gordon. Just perfect. And then you have Alfred, the butler/second father, played, well, once again, perfectly, by Michael Caine. Morgan Freeman is even here, playing Lucius Fox, a man that works in the `basement' of Wayne Tower inventing and making up some insane items for the military, that Batman eventually uses for himself. Think of `Q' for James Bond. Crooked smile Katie Holmes plays Bruce's best friend and love interest Rachel Dawes. She's also a woman that holds her own and tries to bring down the bad guys through the justice system. She's ok I guess.

Some of the extras on the 2 disc were great. I knew Bale just got done making `The Machinist', and was Ethiopian like skinny for that movie, so I was amazed he got huge again for Batman in such a quick time. I mean it's hard for me to just lose 10 pounds. What I didn't know what that when Christopher Nolan told him to get as big as he could, Bale did just that. He got fat. So fat that Chris was baffled and thought he'd never lose the weight in time. Some of the crew would tell Bale ""What are we making again? Fatman?"" So Bale had cut up the weight he regained. Crazy! Watching the scenes where he is learning to fight, you can tell he was still losing some weight, but he's still thick. They really didn't think the suit was going to fit him...hehe. Also the scene where Bruce and Henri Ducard are fighting on the frozen lake by the glacier was crazy. They had to rush that scene with almost no preparation. After they were done filming, the next day the lake became unfrozen and was a lake again. Talk about lucky. There was a lot of good stuff on those discs that will keep you busy for awhile. When you see what they did to make Gotham City, you'll be blown away. Talk about some work.

Even though the movie does have some hokey scenes in it, such as the rooftop Batmobile scenes, it really doesn't hurt the movie at all for me. Great movie. Plain and simple. I thought nothing could beat it, but I was wrong when Dark Knight came out. So make sure you watch this first before Dark Knight...heh. Own it. Own it. Own it. And make sure you own it in HD-DVD or Blu-Ray.

The plot and character development of this film are sorely lacking even for a comic based character- as it relies entirely on non- stop action.  I enjoyed action films when Arnold was the big star of the time, but Batman Begins lacks any real excitement and is incredibly over-serious and lacking in humour.
  Christian Bale lacks any personality as Batman. Michael Keaton was infinitely superior.  Bale has no sense of humour, is anything but handsome or physically imposing and someone who is certainly not suited for any leading role other than American Psycho.",1242950400,2,710,4.786885245901639

The television series entertained, as the early movies pacified my anticipation of bringing my favorite comic book hero to life.  And, along came ""Frank Miller"", giving ""The Dark Knight"" a Reality, and Life, we could only Imagine, and Respect.  A role, that seems to have been written for Christian Bale.  By far, the Best ""Dark Knight"" Batman.
And with a superb supporting cast; featuring:

Michael Caine, who does an excellent portrayal of Alfred, who is more than ""The Butler"".

Morgan Freeman, as Lucius Fox, a character who seems to be derived from the ""Batman Beyond"" animated series.  An essential element, to ""The Batman's"" creditability.

Liam Neeson, as Henri Ducard, indisputable Mentor? Nemesis?

In my opinion...  So long as this; ""Dark Knight~Batman"" Franchise, stays on track, not swaying to the whims of the minority of fanfare that urges ""The Batman"", as its predecessors (movie series), resorting to comic relief.  But, remain within the parameters of Frank Miller's Ideal Characterization.  ""The Dark Knight~Batman"" will survive.",1240790400,,1175,5.461111111111111

1567260,5,B00005JNJV,"Here's the conventional wisdom regarding the Batman film franchise: Sometime in the late 80s, Tim Burton made a brilliant masterpiece from the Batman mythology, followed it with an equally impressive Batman Returns, then left the franchise in the hands of Joel Shoemacker, who proceeded to give Batman nipples, a sidekick and tons of neon.  The audience rebelled; the lucrative franchise died.

Here's how I see it: The franchise was crap from the very beginning! Tim Burton had a vision, granted. But it was a vision that had nothing to do with Batman. The first film had some admirable art direction and some memorable moments, but it's no more a definitive portrayal of Batman than the `60s TV series was. Why? Because Burton didn't care about delving into the dark psyche of his main character, choosing instead to focus on the operatic villains and the mise en scene. I'll even go out on a limb here and defend Joel Shoemacker (one time only!) and say that Batman Forever was closer to a real Batman movie than either of the Burton films because it, at least, made some small effort to deal with the motivations behind Bruce Wayne's obsession.  And don't even get me started on the casting. Michael Keaton is a wonderful actor, but Batman. Come on!  Slight, un-athletically built, and wearing a hairpiece that somebody swiped from the set of TJ Hooker, Keaton didn't sell being Bruce Wayne, and Bruce Wayne is the key to the whole thing.

Well kids, that's where Batman Begins gets it just right. Christopher Nolan's low-key, realistic take on the mythology is a lesson on how to reinvent a franchise; First, throw out everything that came before and start fresh. Second hire a writer who knows something about the character (David Goyer, in this case). Next, cast it right. Finally, stick with what's important - your main character's story arc. The concept here is deceptively simple; how did young Bruce Wayne work up to becoming Batman?  And unlike so many superhero origins, this horse has not been beaten to death. In fact Batman Begins benefits greatly from being able to craft a new take on the events leading up to Bruce putting on the cowl for the first time. I've read my share of Batman comics; but the first act of the film is phenomenally fresh and inventive. Managing to be both familiar and utterly original at the same time.

As the film progresses, something even more interesting happens; the whole thing gets smarter, deeper, even more engaging. The film keeps deconstructing Batman; his past, his motivations, his psychology... and then reconstructs him fresh. So - for example - we don't simply get cool gadgets, we get the concept behind the gadgets, how they work, why they look the way they do. This is both clever and interesting. Batman Begins also benefits greatly from a wonderful cast: Liam Neesen, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, and the great Michael Caine. Wow! And nobody here is just collecting a paycheck either; the performances are great across the board. One of my favorite scenes is between little Bruce and Oldman as Jim Gordon. Bruce's parents were just murdered; he's in shock and the only kindness he gets is the look on one cop's face. That look, folks, is worth the price of admission alone, and it perfectly exemplifies the level of acting and drama in this film.  And, of course, most of it would fail if Bruce Wayne himself was not brilliantly rendered by Christian Bale. This is, bar none, the best lead performance in a comic book based film, ever (sorry Chris Reeve)! Bale is smart, brooding, and deep. There are levels upon levels to his character and as those levels are peeled back, we grow to relate to a man who, frankly, is difficult to relate to. And when he puts on the Bat suit, Bale is scary. That's right, really scary the way Batman is supposed to be. And that's the way the action is handled too: things happen mostly in shadow with lightening speed. This is both true to the comics and dramatically potent. Batman is a night creature who uses stealth and misdirection and this film is the first to capture that on screen.

There are minor problems here: some logic holes in the plot and some action set pieces are less than spectacular. For my money too, the romance between Bruce and Katie Holmes is bit dull. But these are minor qualms and every weakness is countered by consistent brilliance. Not everything works, but the important things do. You believe in Wayne, you believe in Batman, and you buy the whole thing. Kudos to Nolan, David Goyer and the cast and crew. Batman Begins is the best (live action) superhero movie ever made.",1233360000,3,4620,4.750623441396509

Prior to seeing this reboot I only liked Tim Burton's renditions, but more so for them being Tim Burton movies rather than actual Batman movies. I didn't see Batman Begins in theaters and never even considered watching it till the DVD came out because I was so embarrassed at the debacle that is Joel Shumacher's Batman & Robin (though I will say Forever was decent, despite its inclination for campiness). So I blind-bought this on DVD and was blown away by its epic storytelling, characterization, and wonderful production quality. The story starts out with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a Bhutanese prison meeting a man named to Ducard (Liam Neeson) who works for one Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe), the leader of the League of Shadows. In meeting Ducard, he recruits Wayne and mentors him in the ways of the League, instilling and debating philosophies of good versus evil, the power of will, and the arts of deception and theatricality. In becoming one of their finest students, though, Wayne must complete his rite of passage by taking the life of a man who murdered his neighbor in a territorial dispute. But in being who he is, Wayne decides not to take the man's life, and instead, destroys the League's base of operations. He then returns to his home of Gotham City deciding to transform himself into a symbol of justice to fight crime, protect the innocent, and bring down the corrupt, in which he dawns the masked persona of Batman. And through his initial journey, he's assisted by the likes of his long-trusted butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), an old family friend at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and the one good cop left in Gotham's police force, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman).

As many times as it's been done through Batman (or any other kind of comic book/fictional writing, really) what draws me to this film the most is its presentation and symbolism of Bruce Wayne, his inner conflict with himself over the responsibility of his parents' death, his willingness and fortitude to act upon that tragedy, and his continuing efforts to be Batman and live his life for a greater cause by continuing to fight for Gotham City. My favorite aspects of the film are its dark and gloomy atmosphere, the especially wonderful cast, and an extremely well-written script that manages to amaze and inspire for both the characters and overall narrative. For an origins story, I really like how it fills in the gap of Bruce Wayne's time away from home, the lessons he learned, and how it slowly molded him into the eventual persona of the Caped Crusader. In addition to some excellent plot development and character exposition between him and his one-time mentor, I also thought it made for a great climax and clashing of ideals between two similarly-minded people, but with completely different approaches. However, being only an origins story, there's just so much depth one can expose, as this is just the tip of the iceberg until the real meat of the story shows itself in The Dark Knight.

Some people say HD-DVD is to blame for the apparently weak presentation seen here on the BD, but I disagree. While it's true HD-DVD does have its technical limitations in terms of disc space and attainable bit rates, their have been some pretty good ports of other films including 300, Blade Runner, The Departed, I Am Legend, The Matrix, or Troy, just to name a few. This transfer for Batman Begins is more a result of video-tinkering from the people at Warner Bros. And after seeing The Dark Knight Trilogy in IMAX, I believe I can now give a more accurate assessment to how this BD faithfully preserves the theatrical presentation. To start, let's talk about detail. From what I saw in the theater and what we're given on the BD, it's not ""softness"" in the picture, so much as it is a""subdued"" look. Despite the image not having razor-sharp detail, Wally Pfister's photography is duly represented here and is as sharp as I saw in the theater. Very intricate weaving in the costumes and fine texturing in facial features and skin look excellent.

Colors are about as bold as they should be, while blacks are almost perfect. The problem, however, lies in two factors: contrast and saturation. In seeing the SD-DVD, the BD, and the IMAX versions of the film, I've determined that the main color palette is supposed to be somewhere around a ""Fall, seasonal orange."" The IMAX version looked best with a very balanced dose of orange/tan, whereas the BD appears to have a more reddish/pale appearance. And because of the slightly-boosted contrast and de-saturated skin tones, it seems as if everyone is either blushing, coming down with a cold, or just got angry and is trying cooling off. It's not a bad presentation by any means, but I distinctly remember (and admired) the darker, more dreary look the film had in its IMAX presentation. And as a result of the minor tinkering, colors aren't quite as striking, and blacks aren't as deep and inky. Nonetheless, it's a much better job than what they did to The Dark Knight. Unless Nolan just really feels the need to remaster this himself for some kind of anniversary edition down the road, don't let the stigma of ""HD-DVD port"" fool you. It's still a pretty good transfer.

The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track may not show much in terms of numbers averaging around just under 2Mbps, but the sound quality is deceptively top-notch. Dialogue is clear and never distorts through the center. Everything from the various voices of Bruce Wayne, to his Batman growls, to Lucius Fox's echoes down in R&D, to Dr. Crane's synthesized voice are reproduced perfectly. Separation is stunning from the get-go of the opening sequence with the immersion of bats flapping around, and especially later on during the discovery of the Batcave and breakout at Arkham. The Bhutanese prison fight does a good job of a ""silence and isolation"" effect between Wayne's beating up of the prisoners and when Ducard confronts him with the proposal for joining The League of Shadows. Directionality is also well-placed to the rears during action sequences in the form of (more) bats, a scene of rainfall where all the drops are nicely-divided, and of course the final battle sequence on the monorail.

The score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard keeps up great pace and mood between all the action and drama, though not nearly to the effect of their work in The Dark Knight, but that's for another review. Low Frequency Effects, by the way (as per the score), are booming. The crackling ice on the frozen lake is the first example of subtle, but good, bass levels, while the Batmobile chase, and the various explosions at the end of the movie all make for reference material with some excellent fidelity and dynamics in oomps and thumps. Part of the difference between what I thought I heard the first time and now, though, lies completely in the newer home theater setup I have. In fact, it makes a big difference in a lot of the movies I watch these days, so make sure you're somewhat up-to-date on your gear. My favorite scenes for reference are any of the bat immersion scenes (opening title, discovery of the Bat Cave, or when he's breaking out of Arkham), the training sequence on the frozen lake (awesome directionality and bass in the ice cracking), and the Batmobile chase (lots of booms and a great chance for the music to shine as well).

Extras - 4.5

- The Dark Knight IMAX Prologue (HD; 6:36)
Presented in MPEG-2 and Dolby Digital 5.1, this is easily the most attractive feature on the disc. Back when I bought this BD I must've watched the Prologue a good 7 or 8 times before the The Dark Knight even came out in theaters a couple of weeks later; it was that awesome. But yes, fans of the Nolan franchise had every right to be ecstatic, as the movie itself in its entirety is beyond any real description with this being just the opening sequence. And while it was only encoded in MPEG-2, the picture quality actually looks a lot better than what they give us in Begins (then again, it's an IMAX shot with absolutely zero tinkering, outside of the aspect ratio).

- In-Movie Experience
A rather chopped up Picture-in-Picture commentary that takes most of its content from the other special features and splices them into different parts of the movie. Some of the material is exclusive to this mode, but none of it is really that insightful as a lot of the interview segments are only 1 or 2 minutes apiece on average. The presentation of said material also feels very disjointed, 1) because the audio mixes in and out of the movie's soundtrack going from a 2-channel field for the commentary into the boisterous 5.1 lossless track of the movie (which can be a bit jarring), and 2) there's not even a lot of material in the first place.

Topics discussed include: the writing, Liam Neeson's emphasis on scripts, filming in Iceland, a brief interview with Ken Watanabe, the costuming of the opera scene, interviews with Katie Holmes, Tom Wilkinson, another Neeson bit about the sword training, a blurb with Emma Thompson on the ninjas being shorter than Neeson, an interview with Michael Caine about playing Alfred, Nathan Crowley and how he built the Bat Cave, an interview with Rutger Hauer, some character analyses on Lucius Fox, Jim Gordon, Alfred, and Bruce Wayne, an interview with Cillian Murphy and talk about the Scarecrow's mask, how Christian Bale approached the role of Batman, how the music was composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, and a couple of other things I don't care enough to remember. Overall, since Maximum Movie Mode wasn't around at the time I would've liked a full-blown audio commentary instead, as Nolan is very good on those. But the actual special features are still pretty informative about the production itself.

Note: The extras menu has everything lined up kind of weird with the ""Additional Footage"" being aligned on the left side all by itself for some reason instead of on the right where it should've been. The more important features (outside of the Tankman parody) are straight down the middle. Aside from the Dark Knight Prologue and theatrical trailer, everything else is presented in SD.

- Tankman Begins (SD; 5:12)
MTV's lame attempt at trying to be funny for their movie awards show thingy starring Jimmy Fallon, Andy Dick, and Jon Heder. A couple of parts are funny, but the rest isn't so much.

- The Journey Begins (SD; 14:16)
Shows how the concept and story were developed, then eventually written, and how they went about casting. Nolan actually approached Goyer, which I thought was interesting because Goyer said he was set to direct and I never even knew he did (actually, looking at his rsum I see he did Blade: Trinity... Yeah, he's a much better writer, definitely).

- Shaping Mind and Body (SD; 12:49)
A look at Christian Bale's preparation for the role of Batman. Previously, he had lost 70 lbs. for The Machinist (weighed about 120 at the time), but then had to gain around 100 lbs. back for Batman Begins the following year. He says he took Nolan's words to heart to just ""gain as much weight as you can,"" and apparently got a little too plump for the role. But they eventually toned him up by the time filming started. Big props to the guy for dedication, though I'm sure that kind of drastic change in that amount of time won't be good for his health later on.

- Gotham City Rises (SD; 12:48)
Shows how they made some shots of Gotham City from CG and others from scratch on a studio lot. Nathan Crowley talks in particular about how they built the Bat Cave, Arkham Asylum, and the Narrows from the ground up, which is actually pretty amazing when you consider a couple of those sets were right next to each other.

- Cape and Cowl (SD; 8:18)
A somewhat short, but informative look at the design of the batsuit by costume designer Lindy Hemming, who I'm just now noticing worked on a handful of James Bond movies (good for her!). In particular, she mentions how she wanted to make the suit more mobile in the neck and head area so as not to give it an awkward turning motion like previous the Batman suits had.

- Batman - The Tumbler (SD; 13:40)
A very interesting look at the Tumbler/Batmobile. It's pretty cool that they also built this from scratch after initially going though a few different designs in Christopher Nolan's garage. This feature focuses a lot on the actual design, mechanics, and practicality of the Tumbler itself and how they were able to get some great shots of it for the car chase sequence thanks to the amazing talents of stunt driver Chris Cottle.

- Path to Discovery (SD; 14:13)
Covers the filming in Iceland. This was actually around the beginning of filming and, interestingly enough, they had to shoot the training sequence on the frozen lake almost immediately because the ice was supposed to melt pretty soon after their arrival. And from the looks of the terrain, it's pretty amazing they got what they did with so little time to prepare.

- Saving Gotham City (SD; 13:01)
Shows the work they put into the final battle sequence on the monorail and how they wanted to make it look as real as possible with very little CG. The fight between Bale and Neeson was just the two of them with no stuntmen and really goes to emphasize the personal touch they wanted to put on it by getting the timing right. The derailment and explosion of the train itself was a miniature, and they show a few different angles of those shots.

- Genesis of the Bat (SD; 14:53)
A look into the comic book origins of the Batman franchise. Specifically, they attribute Batman Begins to a combination of the Year One and The Long Halloween graphic novels. It's sort of generic whether you actually read the comics or not, but it tells you enough that if you don't know about them, you should check them out anyway.

- Stills Gallery
Pictures.

- Confidential Files
Pictures with text.

- Reflections on Writing (SD; 1:57)
A quick story on David S. Goyer's writing endeavors and how the guy at the comic book store eventually busted him for writing a Batman movie after the large amount of graphic novels he ended up buying.

- Digital Batman (SD; 1:06)
Reveals that the Batman that dropped down and walked out of Arkham was, in fact, completely CG'd.

- Batman Begins Stunts (SD; 2:30)
Shows the Tumbler tests, wire work, and stuntman Buster Reeves being lit on fire.

- Theatrical Trailer (HD; 1:13)
A pretty bad trailer considering how epic the movie really is and how much of a better film-maker Nolan has become today.

Overall - 4.5

By now, I'm sure anyone that loves this movie already owns it. The thematic depth here is just the beginning; and the new direction Nolan takes the franchise in is truly a sight to behold compared to its predecessors. It's literally and figuratively dark with excellent writing from the screenplay down to the script, possesses an all-star cast of actors, and is arguably the best representation of the Batman mythos to date (well, outside of its sequels). While the video quality is a little short of excellent, the audio is reference and the extras are as meticulous as its director.

Well, they didn't disappoint.
This Batman Begins release comes in a very case that has a holographic cover. It comes with a USB drive (small memory though), a CD that contains teaser material for The Dark Knight, ""movie cash"" to see The Dark Knight (though it's probably long expired for those who want to purchase it now), along with several postcards.
If bonus goodies isn't what you're looking for (really?!), then you'll be pleased just with the 2-disc release. It is really loaded with extras, presented in a comic-book-form menu. I actually did not fall asleep during these extras; they were very fun to watch, with commentary from the cast and crew.

Don't know what else to say except...if you're still looking to buy this amazing reboot of the Batman franchise, don't let this one slip through your fingers!!",1232582400,2,1019,4.593406593406593
1567268,5,B00005JNJV,"I remember how this Batman film disappointed a lot of people when it first came out....but not me. I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn't have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and found it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman.

The first hour of this ""prequel"" dealt with his origins. If you're a fan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films, this part in the film should not bore you. It was like a documentary to me, about a topic I was interested in. In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more. The third look, a vew weeks ago, was on this Blu-Ray disc which is just almost too good for words.

Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman. With the success of ""The Dark Knight,"" let's hope Bale continues with this role, so we have some continuity in this film series.

It was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of ""Alfred."" He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story. Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role, or romantic one, as I expected. Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner.

After having seen all the Batman films several times, I now think is the best of them all....perhaps an unpopular choice, but that's my opinion. Don't let the naysayers keep you from watching this movie. You might be missing the best of the Batmans!",1232496000,,1424,4.423664122137405

The best thing about this movie is that it both invested time in showing us how the hero has evolved from the abandoned child in the alley to the masked justice warrior, and justified each and every detail of the gadgets Batman gets. This gave the movie a far more human depth and an unmatched closeness to reality.

1567387,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins discards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. As the title implies, Batman Begins tells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it.

Batman Begins is a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, of Spider-Man 2 (though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most ""first"" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane and Liam Neeson as the villain. Batman Begins is sure refreshing and is entertainment at it's best.",1231286400,,1541,4.904214559386973
1567388,4,B00005JNJV,"In this latest batman installment forget the past because it's dead. Director Chris Nolan takes this genre into a new direction. Batman Begins is full of batman's roots and the path that lead him to the cape and cowl. There is high caliber acting and a philosophy that everything should be possible despite it not being very probably. Batman isn't some skinny popular actor who can only adjust his voice to baritone or throw a phony punch. He's an intimating specimen that looks tough enough to handle Bruce Lee. Fighting isn't about show but about quick bone crunching to get the job done. Plus he does lower his voice a lot.
Christian Bale (batman) is spot on as a believable gritty force that literally puts fear into criminals. Michael Cain plays Alfred to the tee as an enduring figure of wisdom and strength for Batman. All the other actors' deliver honorable to exceptional performances except for Katie Holmes who is flat from start to finish.
No campy one liner's and cheesy fight scenes in this blockbuster. The fighting is hard hitting and visceral. The writing is thoughtful and full of laughs. This isn't a story where you can guess what is going to happen next. You're taken on a ride and when it stops you'll be begging for more.

Side Note: Isn't a comic book movie but a great action/drama based on a comic book movie. Good flick whether or not fans of the comic book.

Extra Features: This holds a lot of cool extras from Bale transformation physically to his fighting choreography plus much more. Batman Begins two disc is definitely worth the extra money for the special features.",1231200000,2,1600,4.710714285714285

This movie is by far the best Batman I have ever seen.  Christian Bale gives an incredible performance.  Katie Holmes as usual is so-so but she was better in this movie than most others I have seen here in.  This movie is 2 hours and twenty minutes and my interest was kept the entire time.

The movie by itself is groundbreaking for the Batman series.  This reboot really saved the falling franchise after Schumacher.  The combination of David Goyer and Chris Nolan writing the film really serves the most justice.  The story is so original and fresh compared to the previous films.  The acting comes at a close second.  The all-star cast really pulls through and delivers real mortal lives.  Christian Bale is a fantastic Batman and Michael Caine makes an even better Alfred.  Our villains are well rounded but I wanted to see more of Scarecrow.  I thought the idea was great to have him in this film and I was kinda longing for more.  However, the film is a blast and any normal human being should find some enjoyment out of it.

1567449,5,B00005JNJV,"This is one amazing film. There is no better fleshed out Hero then Bruce Wayne aka Batman the Dark Knight. Other Superhero films touched one deep feeling of the protagonist and carried that theme throughout the film. Best example is the first Spirder-Man where the main character has to protect his secret identity in order to protect those that he loves. Peter Parker was an interesting, easy to pull off character. But what Christian Bale does for Bruce Wayne easily surpasses even Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark. Bale gives such a performance, so much depth that he gives Bruce Wayne something that has never been seen before in all forms of Batman films, a real motive. We are given the best origin story of Bruce Wayne to really give him a meaningful backbone. He does what he does not for a loved one but because he believes in justice. Sure every Hero fights for that reason, but I have never seen so much devosion to ones work on film as Bruce Wayne's attempt to clean up Gotham.
What really suprises us is the fact that this is the first Batman film that focuses on none other than Batman. This film is given ao much life and so much hope that one might ask ""Why doesn't someone devote their life to fight crime?""",1228176000,,1221,4.504504504504505

So, to find something new, we have here a ""let's go back to the beginnings"", hark! hark! such a novelty this is, trying to explore what was purposefully left unsaid by the creators of the character.

There is the usual sticky-sweet story of the poor soul wronged by men and fate who after a long wandering in the dark discovers his real self, hark hark in the far east, among kung fu teachers.
There is the usual town corrupted to the core, where all people are desperate or desperately evil but where a group of righteous souls still works for the greater good (taking an airplane to some more reasonable resort?)

Ethics are trite and commonplace, completely uninteresting, so is character development and interaction.
Christian Bale is as intense as grated parmesan and so is Katie Holmes. The others are fairly good, each up to the not much required trying to give sense to the senseless lines they are given.

1567452,5,B00005JNJV,"I keep forgetting that before the Dark ('DORK') Knight and after the Keaton/Kilmer/Clooney crap there actually WAS a good Batman film made. Not only that, but it's one of the best movies centered around a superhero I've ever seen.

Batman Begins takes the usual trademark elements of the Batman mythos (cape/cowl etc) and gives everything an origin that to this point had never been done before. The story involves two underknown Batman villains, retells the origin of Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and knows how to balance seriousness and fun (something the second film FORGOT to do...).

The acting in this film is top-notch with Christian Bale making a terrific Bruce Wayne (and a fun over-the-top Batman). Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman take on the iconic roles of Alfred, Lucius Fox and Commissioner Gordan while adding a certain class to the movie that was severly missing in the other Batman films.

The special effects are great and includes some exciting action sequences (most memorably involving the tummbler through the streets of Gotham).

The DVD has the standard bells-and-whistles but nothing seemsto be able to over-shadow the movie itself. Again, to me this film is superhero perfection and more than worth the now cheap price on DVD.",1227657600,,1266,5.101449275362318
1567453,5,B00005JNJV,"I have doubts this movie (or its sequels) fit in with Warner Brother's previous Batman series of movies (though there are some similarities).  I also doubt it fits in with the TV series (which has far fewer similarities).

If there is a weak link, it is the time spent on the origins development.  The comic books give the impression that Bruce Wayne trained after his parents' murder getting physically prepared for his role as Batman.  The TV series didn't deal with the subject at all and the movie series barely touched on it.  (The excellent animated series did deal with the subject to a small extent.)  This movie dealt more with it, with some similarities to the Matrix in the process.

I will admit I had to adjust to Michael Caine in the role of Alfred.  Of course Caine did a great job with the role -- we're talking about Michael Caine, after all -- but looks wise he did not fit my image of the role.  Christian Bale did as good as anybody as Bruce Wayne, though Michael Keaton was my favorite Bruce Wayne.

One major difference is the description of Chill, who orphaned Bruce Wayne.  This movie made him believable as a thug, and not as cold-blooded as the comic book crook or the pre-Joker Jack Napier of the previous series (both of which contemplated killing the boy, which Chill did not).  I won't touch any more of the story to keep from spoiling it any further.

The one interesting thing was that it showed Jim Gordon in his pre-commissioner days.  It developed the relationship between Gordon and Batman that was basically ignored in the previous movie series and taken for granted in the TV series.  Another interesting thing was the insertion of the comic book/animated series villain Scarecrow as a minor villain.

In short, the acting was great -- in addition to Caine there are great performances by Liam Neeson (who I didn't recognize), Rutger Hauer, and Morgan Freeman.  The action started slow but ended up on pace.  The special effects were more spectacular than in the previous movies.  I probably would not take children nine or under (an arbitrary age) to see it, and would accompany any minor before seeing it.  To me, though, there seemed to be less sex than in the previous series, which was a plus to me.

This ended with a minor cliff-hanger (the introduction of the Joker, another sign of independence from the previous movie series), enough to whet a person's appetite for ""The Dark Knight"", but not enough to keep them from sleep.",1227398400,2,2472,4.662817551963048

Batman Begins is so cooooooool. It destroyed all those cheeeezy films made before about Batman, especially when each one is played by a different actor, (nothing worse than sequels that do that) and they were just s**t anyway.
Christian Bale is first class. Being English I shocked myself when I first realised he was English, (not American) he's an actor I'm not too familiar with but he is a true pro. Loved the movie, even Micheal Caine and I don't even like him, sorry Micheal, no offense. Morgan Freeman speaks for himself along with Gary Oldman, (Hhmm... an array of English actors here). All in all a first class movie. I especially loved the martial arts training scenes, it's one of those moments where you want to do it yourself. 5 star effort, no question about it.

It portrayed for the first time on the big screen the origins of the bat providing a good story and script, fine performances, excellent costumes, great sets coordinated with corresponding miniatures and CGI. The well presented martial arts sequences between the Bat and our favorite Jedi Master were thrilling.

The Blu Ray transfer from film to DVD was excellent and hours of additional features on the making of the film and its outstanding special effects are included on this reasonably priced DVD. This film is a must buy for fans of Batman.

This may have been the first time that picture real computer images were produced by mapping actual city photos onto wire frame models of Gotham City with breathtaking results. I had no idea how they achieved these images until I watched the interesting and informative documentary on the making of the film.

  I found this DVD a well contrived movie in which there was a well written orgin story about what happened to Bruce Wayne and why he choose to become Batman.  Furthermore, The editing of this movie seemed to be well done because the entire movie did flow well and as an audience member was able the follow what was going on without having to guess what was happening from scene to scene because of poorly done editing, which has been done before in other films not related to this one.  On another note, the acting in this movie was well done and gave more life to the storyline and the characters that were involved with it.

1567544,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman has been at the heart of three of the four comic book movie revolutions. In the 1960's, the original movie began the era of campy comic book movies. That era ended with the Michael Keaton Batman film which for the first time took the subject matter seriously and propelled comic book movies into a new phase. Successive projects marred the franchise and comic book movies effectively ""fell down"" until 1998 when Blade propelled comic book movies back on the right track. Finally, in 2005 Batman Begins became the greatest comic book movie of all time and created a new type of comic book movie that could only be described as epic in scope. The sheer scope of its plot, the depth of its plot, and the mythic nature of its presentation all give this film a majesty unparalleled by comic book movies before and to up to this date.

Why is this movie so great? David Goyer as always turns in a fantastic script. This is a man who understands logic when it comes to plot and he doesn't introduce an element unless he plans on using it later in the movie. There is always payoff in a Goyer script. Christopher Nolan as director is a man who understands structure. This is a movie about rising action and beginings. Batman's origins are interspersed between the beginning of his modern career and the traumatic events that shaped him in the past. This leads into the scenes in Gotham and his early outtings as Batman. Goyer and Nolan also give us a twist and play on our assumptions that movie creators do not care about the source material and will alter important elements to fit their vision. I can't say more without violating the ""no spoilers"" rule. Let it just be said that there is a revelation about Liam Neeson's character that is such a twist that plays on our assumptions and our lack of faith in comic book movies of other franchises that puts things back on track and makes a lot of sense.

Goyer and Nolan also show that they ""understand"" Batman. Basically Batman is the real guy and Bruce Wayne is just a persona that he puts on to take care of the minutiae of life. They also take us through all of the elements that we recognize about Batman and laying out logically why they exist and how they fit together. Why is Gordon the policeman that Bruce trusts? Why does Bruce trust Lucius Fox to run the business with such little input from himself?

I would be remiss if I didn't bring up the music. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score is just the right kind of music for this type of music. Its operatic and grand to give it the right kind of mytho-epic feel that this movie evokes. It can also be loud and quick giving us the kind of percussive beats that are necessary for the action packed sequences that rocket throughout the movie.

No commentary would be complete without bringing up the cast. Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce and Batman, able to tread the line between the greedy playboy and the tough as nails superhero. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Ducard and his early scenes with Bruce have a nice mentor/student element to them and you can tell that these two men respect each other even though they have chosen different sides of the moral spectrum. Cillian Murphy is great as the deadpan control-freak psychiatrist, Dr Jonathan Crane. All of these stellar performances with great direction and writing lead to a delightful synergy that culminates in one of the great cinematic masterpieces of that era. I gush because it's true.

The DVD comes with tons of great extras about the making of this film from the sets to the martial arts. It's a great set and I can't recommend it enough.

Batman begins shows that even when the movie industry falls it can pick itself back up again. Watch the movie. It'll probably be another decade before we see another comic book movie of this quality.",1224979200,,3823,4.565597667638484

1567727,5,B00005JNJV,"Around two years past it's debut in theaters, I finally decided to give Batman Begins a chance (despite diehard fans shunning it's realism).

I remember watching it during a late night, and liking what I saw, but my memory was fuzzy when I tried to recall specific scenes.

Another year passes - I am purchasing art supplies on Amazon when, by chance, I see Batman Begins now available in Blu-Ray. Having bought a PS3 over the summer, and wanting to test the supposedly superior audio/video capabilities of this new format, coupled with my curiosity concerning why I enjoyed this film in the first place, I decide to add it to my order.

---

$17.95, 140 minutes and The Dark Knight later, I am happy at the way Christopher Nolan has managed to elevate Batman and Gotham into the modern world and yet retain a grim tone that is undeniably fantasy in nature.

Begins starts off with a look at a child Bruce Wayne and his growth into the determined young man that becomes Batman. I didn't know anything about actor Christian Bale prior to his turn as the Caped Crusader, but I quickly respected his intensity and believability as Gotham's prince on a mission to rid his city of evil.

Some feel the first half is a little too drawn out, but, with this being an origin story, you can't expect the action to take center place throughout the entire movie. The pacing was handled very well: Nolan knows when to introduce a montage, and when to focus exclusively on one scene for an extended period of time.

After a crisis of conscience, Bruce leaves Gotham on a quest to find himself. Soon, we're introduced to Henri Ducard (masterfully played by Liam Neeson) - a mentor that takes Bruce and teaches him the methods of stealth and war which will eventually become a part of his Batman skills.

But not all is as it seems, and soon Bruce will have to make some difficult decisions regarding his once firm belief in black and white notions of good and evil. Once he returns to the states, we enter the second half of the film where we see him regain his position amongst the wealthy of Gotham...and slowly flesh out his Batman persona.

The action sequences here are generally good, though some are a tad *too* dark (there's a marked difference between representing Batman's use of ambushes and making all of the action we as viewers are supposed observe, obscured). Of course, we're introduced to a variety of new personalities.

Michael Caine plays Alfred, Bruce's loyal adviser and butler. Caine's portrayal is a bit more relaxed and casual than Michael Gough [of Batman (1989) fame], and despite not being entirely sold on this Cockney accented version, he manages to pull off the wise confidant to his master's secret well enough.

Next up is Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. She serves as the moral vehicle that spurs Bruce to reconsider his actions and leave Gotham until he's mature enough to return. I found Mrs. Holmes's acting to be rather lackluster and easily forgettable. Thankfully, her role isn't that vital later on.

Gary Oldman, as Sergeant Gordon, was one of the few actors along with Bale that managed to impress me. You'd never guess that he was English by his accent and mannerisms - and his believability as the morally unshakable officer that aids Batman never falters.

Morgan Freeman rounds out the good guys as Lucius Fox, Bruce's ""Q"" (provider of gadgets and various technology) and true friend within Wayne Enterprises. While Freeman's role in and of itself wasn't lengthy in terms of screen time, he does prove to be crucial towards the end  and delivers my favorite quip of the entire movie.

The score is proportionally moody and fast-paced to the visuals it accompanies. It isn't quite as memorable as Danny Elfman's work [Batman (1989)] but does an admirable job of never being intrusive.

My only real criticism is that we don't get to see much, if any, of Batman's detective side - he generally relies on contacts to get ahead. Still, I can't fault it too much given the amount of story we're supposed to take in.

On a technical note, I am exceptionally pleased with this Blu-Ray version. While I don't own an HD TV or an expensive speaker set, the image and sound quality is much better than comparable recent DVD releases. There's also a bevy of extras that were in the two-disc DVD version of Begins, though admittedly I haven't viewed any of them.

Entertaining, brooding and with morals that everyone can live by, Batman Begins is a keeper.",1220832000,4,4473,4.712820512820513
1567728,4,B00005JNJV,"Christian Bale is, bar none, the best actor to ever portray Batman onscreen, and only Guy Pearce, I believe, could have come as close to being as good. Batman Begins, by director Christopher Nolan, who made the classic Memento (starring Pearce) and the good American version of Insomnia, shows that he understands what has made Batman the most popular superhero in comic book history- yes, surpassing both Superman and Spider-Man. That said, as good a comic book film as Batman Begins is, that's all it is. It has no real depth, other than in the realm it occupies. But, that's more than enough for your average moviegoer. At 2 hours and 20 minutes in length, it also re-visions Batman, not as a psychotic loner who makes himself into an avenger, nor as the campy icon of the 1960s television hit, nor the last two installments of the 1990s film franchise, but as a Ninja warrior. This is good, in that it allows Liam Neeson, as the villain Ra's Al Ghul (who uses the alias Henri Ducard), to finally allow his penchant for wooden acting and spouting inane Oriental koans to be fully realized, unlike his turn in the second Star Wars trilogy, but bad in that it utterly undermines the psychological complexity of the Bruce Wayne character, for the Batman, in his purest original form, is a vigilante driven by vengeance, not a savior. Neeson has not had a role so suited to his Lurch-like acting style since Darkman.... The film lands somewhere between camp and grit, but could have needed a bit more camp, thus why it just misses out on being a great film- even if only in a comic book vein, like the first Batman film by Tim Burton. That said, this darker avenue bodes better for the future of this new franchise, even if it means enduring the grim-faced and dubious Oriental philosophies that even martial arts films are wise enough to wink at.",1220832000,3,1846,4.6310975609756095

He wanted to punish criminals and maybe even kill them which the movie touch base on between revenge vs. compassion.

1567735,5,B00005JNJV,"This review focuses on Burton's Batman (Batman89, Batman Returns), Nolan's Batman (Batman Begins, the Dark Knight), and 1992 original Batman: The Animated Series. I'm excluding Schumacher's Batman (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin), the 1960's Batman series, and ""The Batman"", simply because I believe they are the weakest representations.

To be perfectly honest, I love Burton, Nolan, and BTAS equally. All three interpretations are so different, that they cannot be compared. And it is really annoying that I find people on YouTube trying to see which one is better (most opinions are biased). So here it goes with MY opinions:

BATMAN: Michael Keaton, Kevin Conroy, and Christian Bale have given us excellent performances. Conroy (from BTAS) has the perfect voice for Batman, though the physical depiction seems a bit too much. Bale really acts well as Bruce Wayne, but his voice for Batman is too deep and goofy. To me, Keaton is the ultimate ""Bruce"". He has the awkwardness and the eccentricity of the character, and plus his hoarse voice for the Bat is far superior to Bale's. It's too bad that he doesn't get that much screen time in both of Burton's films.

VILLAINS: Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Clayface, Mad Hatter, Scarface, Killer Croc, Bane, Baby Doll, Penguin, Clock King, Harley Quinn, Professor Milo, Poison Ivy, and Rupert Thorne appear only on BTAS, and they are marvelous in their own right.

The Scarecrow was better portrayed in BTAS (voice by Henry Polic II) than he was in Begins. Cillian Murphy looked too young as Doctor Crane, and the actual villain was much underused in the film. Two-Face had the scariest appearance in TDK; Aaron Eckhardt was flawless. However, Two-Face in BTAS (Richard Moll) had a much better origin. Years of suppressing anger can do that, you know. Ra's al Ghul is much more interesting in BTAS (David Warner); Liam Neeson's performance in BB was just above average as he wasn't very believable to me. The Penguin, one of my favorite Batman villains, has been blessed with both BReturns and BTAS. Danny Devito and Paul Williams have done superb jobs with this antagonist. Same goes with Catwoman: Michelle Pfeiffer had the better dialogue and better catsuit, while Adrienne Barbeau was a better Selina Kyle, and her chemistry with Batman is deeper.

Finally, for the Joker we have Jack Nicholson (B89), Mark Hamill (BTAS), and Heath Ledger (TDK). All three of them are perfect. Nicholson has the best dialogue, Hamill has the best laugh and look, and Ledger has the best sadism. Three different worlds, three different performances. People on YouTube should understand that.

SUPPORTING CHARACTERS: I couldn't see Michael Caine as Alfred, so it's thumbs down from me. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Michael Gough are the ideal Alfred's. Aaron Eckhardt is truly a one-of-a-kind Harvey Dent. I Believe in Harvey Dent! Billy Dee Williams was great in B89, also, and he had the tough and virtuous personality, as did Richard Moll in BTAS. Gary Oldman and Bob Hastings are the definitive Commissioner Gordon's; Pat Hingle is the weakest, but certainly not at all terrible. He's just a bit too short. Morgan Freeman is the one and only Lucius Fox; Brock Peters of BTAS had the better persona, but Freeman had the better chemistry with Batman.

GOTHAM CITY: Burton captured the dark and gothic feel of the hellish city perfectly. It looks as if ""Hell came sprouting out of the concrete and kept right on growing. You gotta give credit to Anton Furst, the film's art director, for creating this atmospheric universe. Gotham in BTAS also has its advantages. The towering skyline, the dangerous alleys, and the red sky make it all more mesmerizing. Nolan's Gotham looks hellish, too, but it looks too much like Chicago (filming location for both BB and TDK). But other than that, it succeeds in creating a Faustian nightmare.

EVERYTHING ELSE: The gadgets in BTAS were the most realistic, while the Batmobile for B89 was better-looking. Keaton's Batsuit is classic, while Conroy's cape and cowl is ultimately frightening. The heroines (Basinger, Holmes, and Gyllenhaal) are lovely additions, although I wish Basinger would stop screaming throughout B89. And let's not forget the music: let's give it up for Danny Elfman, Shirley Walker, James Newton Howard, and Hans Zimmer. These are the composers who gave us those catchy Batman themes. We will never forget them or their work.

CONCLUSION: Burton's universe, Nolan's universe, and Timm's universe are near ideal. I love them equally, really. I can't wait for the next film.",1220227200,,4553,5.051930758988016

1567792,5,B00005JNJV,"The Batman film series since it began in 1989 has been on a rollercoaster ride.  It started out full speed with ""Batman"" and continued that way in 1992 with ""Batman Returns.""  Then in 1995 with ""Batman Forever"" and later in 1997 with ""Batman and Robin"" Joel Schumacher took that fun Batman ride to a very, very low point...he basically knocked the coaster off the tracks critically injuring the many Batman fans in the process.  So it's no wonder that the series was in need of an overhaul.

Eight years later, and thanks to Christopher Nolan, the rollercoaster is back on the tracks and once again going full speed ahead.  He revamped and  reinvented the Batman franchise with ""Batman Begins.""

Finally, we see why Batman became Batman.  We see what motivates him, where he learned those fancy kung fu moves, where he got his gadgets.  We see Bruce Wayne's transformation into his alter ego, Batman, and his battle against injustice in Gotham City.  It's always interesting to see why a superhero becomes a superhero.  That alone can place ""Batman Begins"" amongst ""Spiderman"" as one of the greatest comic book/superhero movies of all time.

That aside, what really gets this coaster rolling again is Nolan's vision of how a Batman movie should be.  Basing the film in reality, placing Batman in a realistic Gotham City, is ingenious.  Gotham is a city overrun with crime and corruption with realistic villains attempting realistic crimes.  Not the Riddler trying to read the minds of Gotham's innocent citizens via a TV box (""Batman Forever"").  Overall, ""Batman Begins"" has made the film series more mature, aiming at an older audience with a much more serious film.

""Batman Begins"" has truly marked a revolution for the franchise.",1220054400,,1733,4.9411764705882355

The only complaint I really have to stress out is the fight scene. The ""fight scenes""(not to be misunderstood with ""action scenes"" car chase,explosions, ect.)In comparison with the 1989 Batman the fight scenes were clean, and understandable(that i mean u can actually understand what batman did to his enemy and vice versa). Batman Begins fight scenes were absoulutely horrible!. All mention above between the 1989 version were complete opposite.
  Don't get me wrong i love batman im a batman fan i loved the story in ""Begins"" and the quality is nothing less than awsome. I simply can't stand the shaky camera, bad camera angles,you cannot understand what batman is doing to the enemy in close quarter combat(vice versa). I know alot of people are going to critisize me or probably totally disagree with me, or even say that ""fight sequence"" does not play an important role in story.
  C'mon It's BATMAN! I mean if batman fight scenes are going to be long as it is in ""Begins"" or emphasized that Batman knows some kind of martial art skill in close quarter combat it should be ""clean"" and executed Clearly. Going back to the 1989 movie, the fight scenes were kinda short but explosive and it surely shows what batman can do with the baddies. Batman Begins...fight scenes too long, horrid shaky camera(just like ""daredevil"") was enough to rate ""Begins"" 2 stars cuz believe me.. once you understand and compare the difference you will end up fast forwarding the fight scenes like a bad repetitive porn movie. Im glad to see that ""The Dark Knight"" the fight scenes were better but still not the best compared to the 1989 batman. In ""the dark knight"" batman is not ""flashy""(that i mean no simplistic explosive kicks or ducking and countering attacks) it was just one two hits and the baddies go down. better than ""begins"" but not as good as 1989. RIP Bruce LEE You standardized fight scenes in movies that america still needs to understand, Good JOB to the fight director for 1989 You definately did your homework...Batman doing streetfight lunging powerful backkicks and doing incredible jeet kune do ""intercepting"" attacks to a sword swinging crazy head? wow!! at least batman1989 will be in batman history books for memorable incredible fight scenes.",1219536000,,2392,4.884236453201971

1567888,5,B00005JNJV,"In Batman Begins, director Christopher Nolan gave us the most realistic and, at the same time, the most faithful-to-comic-book representation of Batman yet - or of any comic book hero, for that matter (at least until Iron Man). It is a great story of origins, as well as of character. The film is full of quotes that tell you who Batman is and what he is about: such as Alfred's ""Why do we fall - so we can learn to pick ourselves up;"" or Rachel's ""It's not who you are underneath - it's what you do that defines you,"" which Batman later repeats about himself; or Batman's ""I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you,"" which he speaks to Liam Neeson's character right before his demise. Batman Begins is a well-defined story about a well-defined character that is both uplifting and meaningful.

I also think Christian Bale is the definitive Batman. Batman is about the costume, the ""muscle,"" the eyes, the mouth and the voice. Christian Bale has all of that. Plus, he makes a great Bruce Wayne and has the best Alfred you could possibly ask for - Michael Caine; the perfect Rachel to be sweet on - Katie Holmes; a terrific Jim Gordon to work with - Gary Oldman; and the added character of Lucius Fox, played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman. Wayne Manor and the Batcave are both perfect. Only the Batmobile may disappoint some die-hard fans because it doesn't LOOK like the Batmobile - but it is fun. You've got the perfect nemesis in Liam Neeson, and the perfect Scarecrow in Cillian Murphy. Everything is perfect. I gave the film 5 out of 5 stars.

Now enter The Dark Knight.

Why is it that directors and producers think Batman is about the villains - it's not. They are merely the foils off which Batman plays. Tim Burton's series featured one villain in the first film - the Joker, played wonderfully by Jack Nicholson. Then he started stacking villains and super heroes, so that, by the end of the series, there was very little room left for Batman. In the fourth film, Batman And Robin, for which Burton was not actually responsible - he was canned as director after Batman Returns, and as producer after Batman Forever - there was Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and a host of others. Dark Knight has the Joker and Two-Face, and that's one too many, because it adds an additional 45 minutes to the film that kills the momentum and has the audience squirming in their seats. Dark Knight should just have been about Batman and his attempts to defeat the Joker.

The Joker is supposed to be funny, in a warped sort of way. In Dark Knight, he is not, nor does he even try to be. So, really, it is not the Joker but a Joker-like character that appears in the film. Since Nolan wrote the script, he can be blamed for that. He doesn't seem to understand the Joker. Heath Ledger is playing a psychopath wearing bad make-up. That is not who the Joker is. Jack Nicholson had a far better take on the Joker, more reflective of the DC Comics character.

Heath Ledger was not a great actor. But the fact that he is dead, and died at the end of this filming - probably because of the strain placed on him playing the Joker - makes him something of a curiosity. That, in my opinion, is the only reason Dark Knight is doing as well as it is at the box office and with critics. Once the DVD comes out, I seriously doubt if it will sell as well as Batman Begins because, by then, people will have had time to think about it. It's not a great film. It is a good film, but it has some major problems - besides the length, which is almost three hours. What does Ledger actually do in Dark Knight that could be interpreted as acting other than lick his lips so many times that it becomes annoying? He's playing a crazy man. How hard can that be? Mel Gibson made a career out of playing crazy people. It's not that difficult. The Joker character should be more than that.

Batman Begins was a straight-forward story about origins and character, and was full of memorable quotes. The Dark Knight is a convoluted story about what we can become if we focus too long on darkness. Duh. The only memorable quote from the film is Harvey Dent's comment that is later taken up by Batman: ""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" Dent actually fulfills his own prophecy, but Batman, luckily, does not. But it's an idiotic quote that history has easily disproved. And that is enough to hang a plot on? At the end of the film, when Two-Face has been stopped and Commissioner Gordon is trying to explain to his son, and to us, what has just happened, it is a tangled mess of meaningless ideas that is drowned out by the blaring music. Nolan dug himself into a hole and he could not, for the life of him, explain his way out of it.

In addition to the convoluted story and web of empty themes, the actress playing Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a poor and homely substitute for Katie Holmes. One wonders what Nolan and his casting director were thinking - even though she gets killed off, which is some consolation. I guess that opens the door for Catwoman. Everyone else in the cast is good; but Nolan gave them less to work with this time around than he did previously. Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent, who later becomes Two-Face, is the second major focus of the film after the Joker. What a mistake to have two scene-stealers in the same film, so that Christian Bale as Batman is really playing third fiddle.

Here's a clue as to how good Dark Knight is as compared to Batman Begins: when I came out of Batman Begins, people were excited and raving to each other about the film, like they had been to a wedding or a sporting event. I watched their faces as they came out of Dark Knight: they were solemn and quiet, like they had been to a funeral. THAT tells me a lot. Something died in Dark Knight. Was it the series? I'm not looking forward to the third film because I have a good idea what is going to happen. (I hear Bale has a three-film contract, so it is inevitable.) If Nolan's third film is as stacked against Batman as this one was, if it is as convoluted, if the themes are as meaningless and the story as empty, there will be no dead actor to draw people to the box office - hopefully. Nolan is going to have to do some soul-searching, in my opinion, if he is going to recapture the magic of Batman Begins.

1567889,5,B00005JNJV,"Christian Bale is  the best choice to play Batman so far. This is a much more believable Caped Crusader and less cartoonish take on a well known character that has been around some sixty odd years. As a young boy I was a fan of the television series with Adam West and found the premise aptly geared toward younger viewers. Today's Batman is a hero for all ages and this first installment will set the standard for quite some time. Having seen the Dark Knight and finding it equally as good if not better I can only hope that Bale will stay on board in the title role for at least a few more.

1567890,5,B00005JNJV,"In 2005's ""Batman Begins"", Director Christopher Nolan revives a franchise gone stale by reimagining Batman's origins.  An outstanding cast brings to life a solid, action-filled, but intriguingly introspective script, aided by a whole new family of gadgets and some excellent special effects.

Christian Bale is Bruce Wayne, orphaned by the murder of his wealthy parents and raised by the family's faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine in a genius piece of casting).  Driven as a young man to seek revenge on the criminal underworld, his first attempt fails miserably.  Bruce exiles himself to a lonely odessey that brings him to a prison somewhere in the Himalayas and to the attention of the mysterious Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers him a destination.  Bruce Wayne journeys to an isolated monastery, where a group known as the League of Shadows trains him in martial arts, cures him of a childhood fear, and provides him with purpose.

Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham City, to create his crime-fighting personna and to meet honest cop Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and genius inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman).  Bruce Wayne's cover life as a rich and idle playboy brings him back into contact with life-long love Rachel Dawes (a surprisingly effective Katie Holmes), who upbraids Bruce for his apparent lack of purpose in life.

The newly minted Batman confronts Gotham's criminal underworld, discovering a mysterious plot involving a psychiatrist with a dangerous secret and a deadly connection to Bruce Wayne's past.  Unraveling the plot places at risk everything that Batman and Bruce Wayne hold dear.  The movie's climactic action sequence is a breathless and original thrill ride.

The movie succeeds in part because the maturing Bruce Wayne gets as much if not more screen time than his caped alter ego.  The action sequences are dark, violent, and realistic, and the new Batman takes his share of lumps.  The family of gadgets includes an all-terrain batmobile, the usual Batman tool belt, and a thrilling way to fly.  Bruce Wayne's relationship with Rachel Dawes is handled with an admirable restraint that recognizes the reality of his competing responsibilities.

Heard there were problems with two-disc set but really doesn't concern me because I'm more interested in the movie than the extras.  This movie contains a great extra, namely the first scene of The Dark Knight.  I actually have to upgrade my dvd software to play that because it was so new and I'm glad I did because the picture was so sharp and clear.  Begins cannot even compare.

The key is what Bruce Wayne is told by the mob boss, ""you always fear what you don't understand.""

1568010,5,B00005JNJV,"Everyone reading this has probably already seen ""The Dark Knight"", the megasuccesful follow up to this, 2005's ""Batman Begins"".
While ""The Dark Knight"" is a truly great movie, it kinda is empty on being a Batman movie. Its more about its secondary characters than about the caped crusader.
Thats why this movie is my definitive Batman movie.
The movie follows Bruce Wayne from his childhood through til his training to become Batman, ultimately to his battle with the evil in Gotham City.

Its a REALLY great movie! Even though there aren't any iconic villains in this movie, Scarecrow and Ras Al Ghul are fantastic to watch as the evil in Gotham City! Scarecrow is one awesome freaky villain!
So if you are looking for the ultimate Bat-flick, check this one out! It takes awhile for him to eventuate, but once Batman hits the screen its a gripping, near-perfect (in my books) mix of Action, superhero, drama, thriller and a small bit of comedy!

The special features on the DVD are also very good, but annoying to access through the comic book navigation. There are no huge 'must see' features, just a few scattered here and there about the making of the film.
I'd love for Warner Bros. to release a Special Edition co-inciding with the release of The Dark Knight later this year including an Audio Commentary with director Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer to hear their thoughts and stories on BEGINS.

So all in all, I highly recommend this DVD to any comic book fan, Batman fan or anyone who's curious about all the hooplah surrounding Batman lately.

***** stars!",1217980800,,1579,4.772893772893773
1568011,5,B00005JNJV,"This movie is not the batman seen on the old TV series.  I think the old movies attempted to darken that old theme and came up with something in between.  I did enjoy the old movies with that quasi-dark drama/action and plenty of tounge-in-cheek moments.  Well, the first couple anyway.  The new movie though just fits the character so much better.  We knew his motivations for being Batman, but now finally Bruce Wayne acts like the product of his childhood.

Without discussing plot, this movie is superior to all other Batman films.  Those who say it is slow maybe just want to watch 90 minutes of explosions and car chases.  I think this movie has the right amount of action mixed in with pretty deep character development.  It isn't just Bruce Wayne, all the characters are important.  That is a rarity for movies now.  I was reading an interview by the director about shooting of the sequel and he talked about not using a second team for ""unimportant shots"".  He replied that if a shot/scene is truly unimportant, than it should not be in the movie.  He's right, watching the movie again just recently, there wasn't a single time where I tuned out due to a scene I didn't like.

The acting was top notch across the board.  The script was good as well.  The League of Shadows was a bit over the top and cliche at times, but it needs to stay true to Batman now.

Blu-ray looks great.  I did not notice any grainy shots.  It isn't the bright vivid HD experience you may see in other movies, but pausing the disk as looking at the detail on the bricks in the background or the swirling smoke really gives you a sense of the picture.  When I first put 300 into my HD-DVD player I was dissapointed that they kept it so blurry for the HD transfer.  In this film they were able to give detail and sharp edges without loosing that dark feeling.  Very good video transfer.

The sound is good.  I've heard better sound effects in action movies, but I didn't end the film thinking that the sound was lacking here either.  The explosions were not overpowering and it was mixed well so you weren't struggling to hear the quiet dialog one scene then trying to keep your glass from shaking off of the table the next. Too often in action movies today the explosions are too loud for those quiet scenes and you have to artificially crank that center channel to make it watchable in a home environment.  The music was well done and added to the movie without it taking center stage.

Overall, this is a movie where you can watch it realize that it is complete.  No ""director's cut"" is needed.  There are no extra shots.  Everything just fits well together.  From a movie lover's standpoint, this movie should be appreciated for that even if you don't like the plot or premise.",1217894400,,2764,4.478957915831663

  This movie not only filled in the background story with the Batman series; it also touched me in a very personal and psychological fashion. I have my own ""issues"" as most people do.

  There are parts of this film that really and truly reach in and pull at your guts. How can an action film do this? By tapping into many of our fears and displaying them in hard-to-ignore eye burning method.  There were a few times that I was actually brought to tears watching this film.

1568015,5,B00005JNJV,"I guess the reason I've always loved Batman, the character, is because he is not really a Superhero. He has absolutely no 'super' powers and really has to get by on skills and training. That is why, when this came out, it was extremely exciting. How did Batman come to be? You will find out if you watch this. It is quite interesting and entirely plausable.

Of course, credit must be given to Christian Bale, who can do just about anything. He molds himself into this role perfectly, It was like he was always suppose to be Batman. His alter ego, Bruce Wayne reminds me of his character in American Psycho. There are glimpses of snobbery that you can't really but compare to the other film. As Batman, he is truly perfect. The voice can get a tad grating at times, but he doesn't really talk all that much for it to be an issue.

The supporting cast is great as well. I love Michael Caine as the ever-trusty Alfred. He brings a great balance to the film, with wit, charm and just the right touch of humour, when the film calls for it. And his empowering speeches are something to behold.

My other favorite character is Gorden, played by the always brilliant Gary Oldman. He is spot on in this role. I always enjoy watching his scenes, especially between him and Batman. He is probably my favorite character in this, save for Batman.

Liam Neeson has a nice juicy role as well, though he is barely in the film. He always has great presence.

The visuals are all spectacular, as are the costumes, and the Batman car is pretty darn cool. All in all, it's a great re-invention of the Batman franchise. Just pretend the others don't exist (well, except for the first 2 maybe).",1217808000,,1673,4.454248366013072
1568016,1,B00005JNJV,"Boy, am I ever glad I saw this film without paying for it... I think I would have felt ripped off if I did. It was almost laughable the extent to which the film went to insult Asians. First, it begins with a young Bruce Wayne in a Chinese prison camp, fighting off about a dozen attackers. He does so easily, because he is a mighty white man, of course. Yet, the Asian guards are even wary of him. He gets out of jail after a debonaire older white man visits him, and tells him to visit a remote Asian monastery. On the way up to the monastery, he passes through a village -- where everyone he encounters happens to speak English in that funny little Asian way. The monastery is ostensibly a ninja school, run by an old mystical Asian man. Yet, none of the ""ninjas"" are Asian! They're black, they're white, they're everything but Asian! The debonaire white man who visited him earlier turns out to be his trainer, and they forge a bond. Bruce soon fights the Asian ""master"" of the school, and wins. Later, Bruce  finds out that Asian ""master"" was a dupe, and the real ninja master was that debonaire white man. So how improbable is that? A ninja school run by a white man, out of a remote monastery in Asia. Hollywood cuts out all the Asians altogether. They don't count, in the matrix of Hollywood, or in this film. They're just punching bags for the mighty white man. Oh yeah -- and the film was just so boring, overly long, and the fight scenes more than a little pathetic, a bunch of choppy shots.",1217721600,6,1501,4.341637010676156

I own the single wide screen version of the film on DVD, but if you have a 1080p tv go for the blu-ray version.  I honestly believed that Christian Bale was the wrong actor for the role and boy was i dead wrong.  I must say he is the best Batman hands down.  Now that would be a big statement coming from a huge fan of the comics.  I base my decision on Bale's incredible skills of performing real moves of martial arts.  for the first time i finally see batman actually use his elbows as well as his knees to take down some of his foes.  It's funny to see in the 1989 Version how Michael Keaton could just do a back hand punch on somebody and knock him out instantly.  I also find him to be a bad shooter as he literally aims at the joker with his arsenal on the bat wing and still misses.  I believe Christian Bale is the real deal and now that the ""Dark Knight"" is out, it's official that no one else is capable of beating him as Batman.  This movie makes you forget that there was ever a Batman film before it.  I recommend this film for hardcore Batman fans and those who are just introduced to the franchise.

1568060,5,B00005JNJV,"This is a darker, more realistic Batman movie.  For comic book fans who have read the earliest stories, this movie series should be heaven.
Christopher Nolan is taking audiences back to how Batman was intended to be: a dark master detective who is HUMAN.  His ""villians"" are crime bosses and mobster, just like in real life.  But Batman must also face madmen like Scarecrow.  The villians are more realistic (Nolan said you will never see the Penguin in his film series because it is too unbelievable and far fetched to be real).

Begins is the beginning (which is refreshing given the slew of poor quality prequels that seem to be coming out lately).  We learn how Bruce Wayne altered from poor little rich boy into the vigilante of justice.  This film introduces the long standing comic villian of Ra's Al Ghul to film.  And Nolan (mistakenly) creates a love interest for Batman/Bruce Wayne in Rachel (played poorly by Katie Holmes).

The story and the action are truly inspired.  And the direction this series is taking is from the original comic icon, not from the 4+ decades of camp and overacting.

It's darker than Burton's, better than Schumacher's (but what isn't?), and true to the original.  What more could fans ask for?

Teens may not like it as much because it explores the broader themes of law, justice, ends justifying the means (or not), and what it really means to be good vs. evil. It does not do this just from a few tossed off lines (such as the new DK movie does), but through the story arc itself.

*Some good action scenes, especially at the end.  Special effects are very unique.
*Excellent filming style and cinematography.  It's a little choppy and weird, but also very detailed and vivid.  Also very dark, moody, and realistic.
*Storyline is great, and makes perfect sense as long as you pay attention.
*Less emphasis on outlandish bad guys and gadgets and stuff and greater emphasis on fighting crime on the streets and doing actual police-type work.
*What gadgets Batman does have are realistically introduced.  There is a logical explanation for everything he has and where it all came from.
*Characters are phenomenal.  Bruce Wayne's evolution from a fightened boy to a hardened fear-inspiring crime fighter is very convincing and deep.  Acting is good.
*In conjunction with the characterizations, this movie also has very strong themes about fear, destiny, and human preserverance.  This film was way heavier than I would have ever thought.
*Excellent music.

The Bad Things
*A little slow for the first hour or so.
*Some fight scenes are so choppy and fastly-cut that they are hard to really see (but it is a more intense style).
*If you're looking for the classic campy Batman, this is definately not it.  May be too dark and serious for some people (but this is probably more closer to what Batman was originally like).

This is the darkest, deepest, most serious version of Batman yet.  It is also closer to what Batman should really be like, and above all, has some very deep meaning in the character that I would have never caught onto before (Bruce using his own fear to instill fear into others; fear is a very strong theme throughout).  It is surprisingly complex, but the dialogue and acting makes it all very understandable.  And of course, the plot is great and ties everything together into one complete circle.  Combined with a strong visual style, this is definately one of the best superhero movies made to date.

If they keep this up, I seriously hope that they will turn the ""Knightfall"" comics into a movie too...

All versions of this movie have good video and audio quality (great on Blu-ray, naturally).  The one-disc version has a trailer.

1568122,5,B00005JNJV,"8 Years after the abortion of Batman & Robin, Christopher Nolan decided that he must bring back the dignity of Batman. In order to do that, he must forget anything even portrayed in the previous films. He must recreate the character and place him in a real world where everything isn't just cheesy puns and costumes with nipples. He did all that, and more with the help of some of one of the best movie actors today. Christian Bale, in my view can play almost any role but even I had my doubts about his ability to play the Batman. My worries were quashed when seeing the almost destroyed soul of Bruce Wayne portrayed brilliantly in the very first scene. My review will be separated into three sections, which I do for most movies that give me a lot to talk about. Those three sections are the story, the characters and the review.

The Story: One day whilst playing with his friend Rachel, a young Bruce Wayne falls down a well disturbing a swarm of bats. The bats become the ultimate fear of Bruce's and eventually become his inspiration for wanting to strike the fear in others. While at the opera, Bruce asks his parents can they leave. After leaving through the back of the theatre, Bruce and his parents are encountered by a thief wielding a gun. His parents are shot which leaves Bruce angry, bitter and out for revenge. Through a series of events Bruce ends up in the Far East. He is approached by a man named Ducard (Neeson) who's employed by the ninja cult leader, Ra's Al Ghul. Ducard approaches Bruce with an offer to teach him how to fight and to overcome his fears. Bruce accepts the offer of Ducard. We are taken through the training sessions and given a further insight into the tortured soul that is Bruce Wayne. Bruce eventually finds his way home and endeavours to rid Gotham City of the criminal underworld. He must find a symbol which would help strike the same fear into the criminals that the bats did to him. The Bat becomes his symbol and with the help of Alfred (Caine) and  Lucius Fox (Freeman), Wayne starts to put together the first bat suit. There is corruption within the police force thanks to mob boss Carmine Falcone (Wilkinson). Falcone employs the help of psychologist Dr. Jonathan Crane (Murphy) who finds Falcone's men clinically insane in order to prevent them going to jail. Falcone can't trust Crane, however, as we find he's employed by someone else and is producing an inhalant toxin which strikes fear into those who inhale it. Crane, when spraying his enemies in the face with this toxin places on a mask and becomes one of Batmans biggest foes. The Scarecrow. Bruce Wayne must not only fight to find out what Cranes plans are, but he must also try to find out who he's working for before it's too late.

The Characters:
Bruce Wayne: Played by Christian Bale, I think most Bale fans will agree that this is one of his best roles. He not only plays the tortured soul of Bruce Wayne brilliantly, but he also plays the Batman incredibly well.
Ducard: Played by Liam Neeson, I've never been a fan of Neeson's work but have to admit he surprised me. At 53 years of age the man is in great shape and if he didn't use a stuntman for most of the fight scenes, then I applaud him. The character is the one that creates Batman and it actually becomes quite ironic as Ducard turns on Wayne at the start.
Rachel: Played by Katie Holmes. I must be honest and say that the Rachel character altogether was instantly forgettable and I think the whole movie could have been just as great without her. I think they were aiming to create an unrequited love story, in which the movie goers would root for the characters to come together. It didn't work, and quite frankly was the only drag on this movie.
Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow: Played by Cillian Murphy. Murphy is someone else who's work I've never really been fond of but he really turned my opinions in his role as Crane. He gave a truly menacing facade and was someone who really made the hairs on your neck stand upright.
There are obviously a number of other characters that I could talk about but it would honestly give away the entire movie plot.

The Review: Well. What can I say? This movie is incredible. I don't think I could put it any more plainly. Nolan set out to give us a Batman re-invention, some people were skeptical and some people were optimistic. I, simply loved the entire thing. The film kept its pace throughout, it told the story of Bruce Wayne in detail and made us understand the torment the man was going through.

I mean really this batman(which is the best)is how he really is. Batman has always been a dark character who has anger,wants revenge,whether is to kill or bring them to justice and truly this is not a character children want to look up to.

1568168,3,B00005JNJV,"The movie is excellent, the High-Def transfer is great, and while the extras aren't new, getting to watch them in a picture-and-picture commentary mode is very nice, presentation-wise.

However, the collectibles are lame promotional items for the new movie ""The Dark Knight"".  The packaging says a ""16-page comic book prologue"" is included, but this is simply a poor adaptation of the first six minutes of new ""The Dark Knight"" movie.

But, the packaging also says there is a ""32-page booklet"", but this, again, is another adaptation of the SAME six minutes of the new movie, only with excerpts from the screenplay, side-by-side with photos.

And the only NEW feature (as compared to the SD DVD release) on the Disc itself is the SAME SIX MINUTES OF THE DARK KNIGHT from the comic and the booklet, admittedly in gorgeous 1080p and full 16x9 aspect ratio.

A 32-page booklet would have been better used to show stills from the behind-the-scenes of the FIRST Batman movie, or showing promotional posters, or re-printing the original marketing info, like I've seen on many other DVDs.  And a comic book is useless if it is an adaptation of the movie, since the movie will always be a better experience.  Better to reprint comics that inspired the movies, like the ones that were re-printed for the SD DVD edition of ""Batman Begins"".

Also, you get a movie pass for the new Batman film, but it is only worth $7.50! That's not even half the cost of a non-matinee ticket!  And I bought the special edition thinking the cost of the movie ticket would reduce the added cost of the Limited Edition versus the standard Blu-Ray, but with these paltry collectibles, it was not worth the extra money.

1568173,5,B00005JNJV,"After the first Batman franchise was driven into the ground by a succession of terrible sequels, it seemed unlikely that there would ever be a respectable Batman film again. But then there came a hope from an unexpected source. Christopher Nolan (director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Following/dp/B00000F3CD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Following</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memento/dp/B0000640SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memento</a>) wanted to reinvent the character in a more realistic and epic way. He teamed up with screenwriter David S. Goyer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blade-Trilogy/dp/B0007WFX62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blade Trilogy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City/dp/B0018O4YT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City</a>) and together they wrote an exceptionally smart screenplay. The filmmakers have thoughtfully evaluated the mistakes made in the previous films (mainly poor acting, shallow characterization, campy humor and mindless action) and avoided repeating them.  They've brought a new level of depth to a genre that has recently been overexposed and streamlined. This is an intellectual superhero film. It deals with dark thematic subject matter, which is only appropriate considering that Batman is essentially a guilt-ridden vigilante who symbolically avenges the death of his parents.

The story looks at the origins of Gotham's Dark Knight. As a young boy, Bruce Wayne fell into a dilapidated well where bats attacked him. The incident would haunt him much of his life and helped to shape who he was to become. His parents, the wealthy Thomas and Martha Wayne, are altruistic and philanthropic. His father owns Wayne Enterprises, a large manufacturing company but he spends most of his time volunteering at the hospital. But one night when the Wayne family was leaving the opera, they were approached by a desperate criminal who shoots Bruce's parents. Years after their death, Bruce tries unsuccessfully to get revenge but ultimately learns that it wouldn't solve anything to perpetuate the cycle of killing. He attempts to infiltrate the criminal underworld so that he might better understand what drives people to ""prey on the fearful"", but he is caught stealing from his own company. He's thrown into a prison in an unnamed Asian province, where he daily fights the other inmates for ""practice"". A man calling himself Ducard visits him unexpectedly. He offers Bruce a ""path"" and suggests he joins a secret fraternity, The League of Shadows, which seeks to bring balance and sanity to the world. When he agrees he is subjected to a brutal training regiment that takes him to the breaking point. Mentally and physically exhausted, he is accepted into their ranks providing that he display his devotion to justice by executing a criminal. Bruce refuses to knowingly take a life and a great battle ensues. After barely escaping and saving Ducard from a fiery demise, he heads back to Gotham alone. He is reunited with his former girlfriend, Rachel and his parental butler, Alfred. He secretly assumes the identity of Batman. When Alfred asks, ""Why bats, Master Wayne?"" he responds, ""Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread."" Soon Batman uncovers corruption within the police force, the legal system and even within Wayne Enterprises. But at the heart of this new crime wave is an insidious conspiracy being carried out by a psychotic psychiatrist and an old acquaintance. Ducard returns and reveals his intentions to destroy Gotham City by releasing a ""fear-inducing toxin"" upon the population. And only Bruce, his former apprentice can stop him from succeeding.

The film features an excellent cast featuring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, Liam Neeson as Ducard, Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, Gary Oldman as Police Sergeant Jim Gordon, Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane / The Scarecrow, Tom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone, Rutger Hauer as Earle, Ken Watanabe as Ra's al Ghul, Linus Roache as Thomas Wayne, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.
Arguably the best ""comic book movie"" ever made, Batman Begins resurrects the Dark Knight with style and sophistication. Rarely do these kinds of films touch upon philosophical beliefs, psychological disorders or social corruption and yet this film does so with ease. Batman Begins breathes new life into the legend and is the first chapter in a thrilling new Batman saga, which will be continued in 2008's The Dark Knight.

1568176,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman and Batman Returns were two of Tim Burton's finest work. After Batman Returns, Tim passed the torch to Joel Screwmacher who drove the franchise into the ground with Batman Forever and the absolutely dreadful Batman & Robin. in 2005 Christopher Nolan breathed life into the series with Batman Begins.

Plot: The movie details the origins of Batman as well as Bruce Wayne(played by Christian Bale). It tells the story of a young boy who loses his parents to some punk and has a fear of bats. It details plot to destroy Gotham by the same rogues headed by the same guy who taught Bruce how to fight so well. It details crime and corruption caused by a crime lord and a neurotic psychologist named Scarecrow.

Opinion: Batman Begins has a great storyline as well as interesting characters. Christian Bale is perfect as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He gives Batman more edge than the Batman of the Schumacher films ever had. Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Ra's Al Ghul and the Legion Of Shadows are interesting villians as well as Scarecrow(who uses a hallucinogenic gas that causes its victims to have a illusions about their worst fears). And I LOVE the new Batmobile. Nobody seems out of place in Batman Begins and the storyline grabs you and never lets go. Its is a definite improvement of the last two Batman films and is worth the bucks. Does it make up the the Schumacher disasters? I don't know, those wounds run pretty deep but I can say that it is great step in the healing process and is an excellent installment to one of the best superhero movie series ever made. I cant wait for The Dark Knight. Two thumbs WAY up.",1213056000,6,1626,4.603448275862069

1568218,5,B00005JNJV,"It used to be Michael Keaton's version that was the ultimate Batman for me: dark, brooding and troubled... until I saw ""Batman Begins"". Scrapping all previous Batman story lines, Christopher Nolan starts all over and brings a unique background to the Batman character - one that is more believable and convincing. The creation of Batman is laid out without patronizing the audience; the back-story is gritty and realistically (enough) explains how Bruce learned to do all his stunts and terror tricks. Nolan's treatment of Batman allows Bruce Wayne's true identity to be completed obscured, something other Batman actors didn't fully achieve. There are no comedic alter-ego slip ups in this version; Bruce Wayne has no bumbling moments that would cause anyone to suspect that he had a secretive heroic night-life.

Additionally, while Keaton's, Val Kilmer's and George Clooney's Bruce Waynes were very obvious under the batman mask, Bale and Nolan created a twist by having Bruce Wayne distort his voice as well as hiding his face behind a much more concealing mask than previous Batman incarnations, enough so that you really can't tell it's the same person. The terror Bruce Wayne learned to instill in his opponents works impressively in this version, seen especially in Batman's first encounter, with the crooked cop, which is convincingly frightening ... with great lines.

Fun elements are brought to the story by Lucius Fox, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman, who works at Wayne Enterprises and supplies Batman with his arsenal of awesome military toys, my favorite of which is the new ""bat mobile"", which is probably the coolest tank ever created for the screen. It is a refreshing change from the outlandish and over-the-top batmobiles which worked just fine in the other films, but would simply be too cartoonish for this one.

Many fans complained that the character of Bruce's best friend Rachel Dawes is the weak link in this film. I didn't mind her character so much, but felt she was rather under-used and not as strongly acted as she could have been. I saw the role of Rachel Dawes as a humanizing element that added some vulnerability to Bruce and Batman without being a shrieking damsel-in-distress like Vicky Vale was, or a desperate hero-chaser like Dr. Chase Meridian.

Notable performances come from Michael Cain's Alfred, a capable man and lovable old friend, truly concerned for his master's well-being and not just a buffoon full of one-liners, Gary Oldman as the good-hearted office Gordon, and Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane, a sinister psychiatrist that never falls into the cackling, maniacal cartoon villain role. Liam Neeson's mysterious Henri Ducard even proves to be more than a two-dimensional character and there is a reason for all he does.

Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard majestically reinvent the score, with no traces of the classic comic book hero march created by Danny Elfman, creating instead a pulsating, dark score with occasional rays of lightness.

If the Joel Schumacher treatments (shudder) turned you off from the Batman series, you'll find this one will greatly surpass your expectations and may just become a favorite. Batman Begins is a wonderful blend of its comic book sources with realistic elements. It is slow to start, because it's starting over, but there's plenty of solid action, a great storyline and some witty and memorable dialog. This film is a gem in the Batman canon.",1212364800,3,3450,5.108156028368795

1568302,5,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" is Christopher Nolan's version of how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) became Batman. It explains how his parents were killed, his fear of bats, and some of the extremities he went through with some of his training; along with every other personal and physical obstacle Bruce must face on the way to finally becoming The Dark Knight. Gotham City is dying since guys like Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) are able to get away with just about anything because ""he keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared,"" as Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) would put it.

Bruce Wayne trains with Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), the right hand of Ra's Al Ghul, and The League of Shadows before things turn ugly. The League of Shadows believes in justice, but doesn't think people who have committed such crimes deserve to live while Bruce Wayne believes in compassion and thinks criminals should have a fair trial before passing judgement. Leaving The League of Shadows in shambles, Bruce Wayne makes his way back to Gotham after a seven year absence. As Bruce Wayne said, ""As a man, I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, I can be destroyed. But as a symbol...as a symbol I can be incorruptible. I can be everlasting."" This is the story of Batman's uprising and the criminals he encounters along the way.

This is the beginning of the best version of Batman to hit the silver screen, boys and girls. Tim Burton's original film is really the only competition, but ""Batman Begins"" surpasses Burton's ""Batman"" in almost every way. This film has a lot of strengths that start with the storyline. It doesn't stray too far away from Batman classics like ""Year One"" and is just as dark in tone. The screenplay is also incredibly well-written as the dialogue feels natural and everything takes place in realistic fashion. The acting is very impressive as the main cast is filled with excellent actors; Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Rutger Hauer, and Ken Watanabe. This cast is beyond ridiculous if you stop to think about it.

With films like ""28 Days Later"", ""Sunshine,"" and the Christopher Nolan directed ""Inception"" under his belt, Cillian Murphy should be on your radar of actors you should always keep your ear to the ground for. He makes the most of his screen time as nearly every one of his scenes is memorable in some way or another. Liam Neeson isn't so much under-utilized anymore as much as he's underappreciated. The Henri Ducard character is a fascinating one whose enigmatic personality unravels more and more as the film progresses. Gary Oldman, who is perhaps one of the greatest actors to never win an Oscar, is just as fantastic as ever. How rare is it that the supporting cast is just as strong as the lead actors in any film? That's something Christopher Nolan is always able to accomplish.

The impressive cinematography is also something to take note of. The film mostly takes full advantage of the darkness as Batman is always utilizing the shadows to fight crime, but it only makes the sudden shifts to color that much more sharp and vibrant. The camera being in Batman's face as he tells Flass (Mark Boone Junior) to, ""Swear to me!"" in the rain is so memorable thanks to how it's filmed as is every time Jonathan Crane puts on his mask and uses his fear toxin.

If there is one Batman film anyone should see, this is it. It's a superhero film with a dark tone that's very well-written with nothing but incredible actors involved. In a world where most movies these days are usually either remakes or films that are made as quickly as possible to cash in on the latest trend in Hollywood, a reboot that is not only worthy of your time but tends to make you forget about every other version that came before it says quite a bit. If there was one film that could change someone's mind about disliking the Batman character, then this would be it. This is a good enough film to stand on its own regardless of how the viewer feels about Batman going into it.",1209513600,7,4027,4.682203389830509

Enough has been said about the excellence that Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) brought to this film and of course the fine cast (Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, etc).  The only weak member of the cast would be Katie Holmes (Sorry, Tom!!), she is just too wan and detached for us to root for her as Bruce's love interest but thankfully Maggie Glyenhaal will be better in the sequel!! This disc along with ""King Kong"" and the recent final cut of ""Blade Runner"" will definitely show off the benefits of HD. Plus you could probably get this much cheaper than the Blu-ray edition when it comes out perhaps as low as $10 or $12 used and $14.95 new!!

I have seen every Batman movie a number of times and even though they were campy and  fun, I wasn't completely satisfied with any of them. I wanted Batman to be darker, sinister and more complex, more like a vigilante outside the law, and I didn't want Robin and Batgirl tagging along either.  When I saw ""Batman Begins"" on opening day in the theaters in 2006, I was  pleasantly surprised.  Christopher Nolan had given me the perfect Batman portayed by Christian Bale. The supporting cast was outstanding. Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Gordon, Katie Holmes as his childhood love, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman to round out the cast and all gave superlative performances. The story was fitting for a superhero, and the Batmobile was an added bonus. Even the background music track was excellent. This movie surpassed all my expectations.  My only criticism is the editing; all the rules of continunity were broken and some of the shots were so brief that it was hard to grasp what just happened, but somehow they made it all work.

1568306,5,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" is an interesting movie not only because of its storyline, which adopts a more ""real and crude"", free of villains in disguise approach than the so-called anthology (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Motion-Picture-Anthology-1989-1997-Batman-Batman-Returns-Batman-Forever-Batman-Robin-Two-Disc-Special-Editions/dp/B000B5XOYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology 1989-1997 (Batman / Batman Returns / Batman Forever / Batman & Robin) (Two-Disc Special Editions)</a>) and its state-of-the-art production (that wasn't possible in the early 90's, probably), but the story on how Bruce Wayne, driven by fear and guilty, came to be Batman.

For those like me, who have never followed Batman through comics, the existence of such mysterious figure was always an unanswered question until this movie came out. Taking another comics-based sequel like Spider-Man (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-The-Motion-Picture-DVD-Trilogy-Spider-Man-Spider-Man-2-Spider-Man-3/dp/B000UR9T8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man - The Motion Picture DVD Trilogy (Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 / Spider-Man 3)</a>) one can realize that the history of a hero was told from the beginning, which is the correct approach.

By following a logical reasoning, one can easily tell that ""Batman Begins"" should be the first movie of the series and it's sad that it came so late. Looking on the bright side, it was good that this movie was produced last, taking advantage of greater and better special effects available today.

With that being said, Christopher Nolan, did a fantastic job with this film.  For my money, this is the best Batman film I have ever seen.  This film goes more deeply into Bruce's past.  His relationship with his father and his life before all the tragedy.  It also goes more deeply into Gotham City itself and how the criminals and the corrupt more or less run the city.  And there is an underlying theme of what is  the right way about and wrong way with fighting crime.

It's intriguing, this film, with plenty of good acting and casting. Liam Neeson is, as always, phenomonal. His voice alone is enough to make me shiver with fright.

Christian Bale is also very good. While I cannot compare him with any of the previous Batmans, I'll go and guess that he couldn't have been much of a let down. He is a very good actor.

Michael Caine positively ROCKS as Alfred.

Something that appealed to me, opposing popular superhero films, is the fact the Bruce Wayne doesn't actually have super powers. Not only does this saves us from a corny ""scientific"" explanation (cosmic radiation, more than likely) for why he can do this or that, but it also helped me connect with the character more.

It's a good start for what should be one heck of a series. I can't wait for the sequel.

1568361,5,B00005JNJV,"I've loved almost every Batman movie that's come down the pike. Being a fan of the comic for years, having grown up with it and the camp TV series, watching it change, reinvesting in it when my son was old enough, I've seen the caped crusader in all his incarnations. But the last two films twisted what started as an interesting concept and directed them back towards camp and not in the best way possible. This films makes up for all of that.

The film opens with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a prison in some Asian country. Fighting among the prisoners with a sort of jubilation, Wayne is visited by a mysterious man (Liam Neeson) who discusses with him the where's, why's and how's of what led him here. They discuss his need for revenge. And then he offers him a chance to find the answers that he seeks, if he will complete the simple task of bringing a flower to the highest point in what appears to be a mountain monastery.

Wayne follows this course and becomes a disciple of a man named Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe), the leader of a select group of ninja warriors trained to root out evil. With Neeson as his instructor, Bruce begins to hone his natural born skills. But when push comes to shove and he is required to kill someone, he revolts, strikes out against his masters and torches the building in the process. But before he does so, he rescues Neeson.

Returning home to Wayne Manor in Gotham, Bruce sets out to rebuild his life and confront his demons. In the process he makes plans to save Gotham from the downhill slide it has taken since his departure. In discussing it with his long time friend and butler Alfred (Michael Caine) he realizes he must do so from a position of secrecy.

Throughout all of this we are given glimpses into the past of young Bruce, from the time he fell into an abandoned well that was filled with bats and caused him his deepest darkest fear to the day that his mother and father were cold bloodedly shot in an alley after he asked them to leave the opera they were attending. All of these things have left emotional scars upon young Bruce. And all of them will help to develop the man, the legend that he will soon become.

As Bruce returns to life in Gotham he is reacquainted with the girl he grew up with, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes). Now a member of the district attorney's office, she remembers the Bruce she knew long ago. She struggles with the world that Gotham has become and regrets the fact that Bruce is not the man about town playboy socialite only concerned with the next party instead of the great city his father helped build. She is completely unaware of the man that Bruce truly is and the plans that he has.

As Bruce considers his options, he also has to take back control of the company his family helped build. Now run by Erle (Rutger Hauer), it is about to lapse into open the open market since Bruce was thought dead. And may yet do so.

All of this progresses without an ounce of boredom for the viewer. The thing that separates this film from the rest is the amount of rich storytelling involved. The plotlines weave in and out of each other as the motivations and backdrop for this hero become evident.

While he adjusts to Gotham and the false lifestyle he must portray, Bruce also makes the acquaintance of a member of the family business, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Directed this way by Alfred, Lucius now spends his days in the basement areas of the Wayne building harboring the creations he has come up with over the past years. Everything from body armor to grappling hooks to transportation is there. Upon seeing these items, Bruce knows just the way to put them to use.

Going back to the long lost bat cave he visited as a child, Bruce turns it into a secret lair where he creates a costume and then goes forth to fight evil doers. Yeah it sounds hokey but isn't that what Batman did? And along the way he confronts a new evil, one that intends to turn Gotham into a town brought down by madness.

Gangster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has aligned himself with a psychiatrist named Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) and a benefactor unknown. Crane has developed a highly toxic hallucinogen that transforms those infected with total fear and madness. Upon infecting someone with the drug, Crane puts on a mask and becomes the evil Scarecrow, inducing nightmares beyond belief.

A face off between these three is inevitable and as Bruce aka Batman grows accustomed to his new persona, more comfortable in it, the chances of his survival increase. Along with one single policeman he trusts, James Gordon (Gary Oldman), Batman sets out to stop the plan that has been put in motion. But even he has no idea who the real foe he is confronting is. And the revelation of that is a surprise not only for him but for viewers as well.

The movie does two things with ease. It makes the story of Batman just that, a story rather than a framework with which to place characters and toy designs around. It fills it out like it has never been done before and makes you think it all plausible, if not possible.

The other thing it does is offer a movie that is filled with action and romance and adventure and it does so in spades. This is a fun movie that kids, perhaps not too young, can enjoy as well as grandma who may remember the old sixties show.

The movie features excellent acting all round with no one person taking the full credit. Each and every actor stands out. The special effects are eye dazzling and they compliment the character and story rather than become the main feature.

This film opened big at the box office and deservedly so. If you're looking for a movie that tells a tale and entertains from beginning to end, then this is the one to see.",1205366400,2,5744,4.472779369627507

Bale is quite an underrated actor. From the Empire of the Sun, American Psycho, Reign of Fire, Equilibrium, to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Bale has done a superb job in each film. I am actually thrilled to see him being cast for the role of John Connor in Terminator 4.

Bale's Batman reminds me of Kevin Conroy's voice acting for the Animated Series. Batman is supposed to be a figure of the night, striking fear into the hearts of evil doers. That includes voice acting that would give the darkest of souls goosebumps in an alley at night. I never understood how the other Batman costumes could realistically do that, especially with nipples molded into the chest plate.

One of the more memorable scenes in Batman Begins include the Tumbler chase scene. The Tumbler is a welcome change from the more traditional representations of the ""Batmobile"" and looks more like a candidate for the next military tactical vehicle than a superhero's car.

I look forward to viewing The Dark Knight as many of the trailers show a similar amount of professional acting and a solid plot.

I am not a fan of the Dark Knight. While I have read some of the comics and seen the earlier movies the overall storyline never snagged an interest in me UNTIL BATMAN BEGINS!
This film is so impressive that I am simply dumbstruck. The director deserves a medal for one of the most telling storylines of the entire saga, comic book or other media, ever. Within the narrow window of the
movie's timeline the evolution of the character is very well presented and provides an excellent introduction to the inherent attitude that drives Batman, a man possessed.
It is the nature of that possession and its power which enables and emboldens the character and which is so well defined within this movie.
I can only summarized this film as a Tim Burton meets Rambo extravaganza!
Definitely watch it several times!",1204502400,2,817,4.76056338028169
1568367,4,B00005JNJV,"Let me say first up, I love this film. Other superhero films have a tendency to be subject to the whims of their filmmakers (I'm looking at you, Tim Burton). As a result, I feel they don't totally embrace their comic book roots. That's not the case here.

The film borrows heavily from the Denny O'Neil era only adds to its appeal, as this was my favourite perios of the Batman comics. This is also the first live-action Batman film where Ra's Al Ghul is the main villain. It's delightful to finally see such accomplished filmmakers pay tribute to one of Batman's greatest enemies.

And now onto the DVD itself. I bought the Special Edition which consists of two discs. The first disc contains the film. My untrained eye makes me the worst person to judge film transfer quality, but it looks pretty good to me. The biggest dissapointment is the lack of a commentary track from director Christopher Nolan, or the other main cast members.

The 2nd disc contains documentaries on different aspects of making the film. Unfortunately, the docos are buried within a rather lackluster comic book. My suggestion? Just scroll to the very end and click on the page icon. You'll get a list of all the documentaries, which is much easier to navigate through. The docos don't quite reach the heights of the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions, but they still make for interesting and informative viewing.

In summary, if you loved Batman Begins then I strongly recommend buying this Special Edition. I'm taking one star off for the ridiculous comic book on the 2nd Disc. But this disc is worth buying based purely on the film alone.",1204502400,2,1619,4.710247349823321

That is the intent of the fight scenes and it is very accurate.

Other then that the major complaint is that this is not a brain dead movie. There are plenty of movies to keep the mouth breathing, knuckle-dragging Budweiser crowd happy. Not every movie needs to be mindless. Go watch Die Hard or  something.",1203811200,3,663,4.593220338983051

The final straw was when Joel Schumacher decided it was best to include nipples on the bat-suit, and light up gotham city with flourescent lights.  I honestly don't see how that movie made it past test audiences.

anyway, Batman Begins completely takes away the cheese of the other batman sequels and starts anew with an amazing cast, director, and story.  Christopher Nolan deserves the most praise here, weaving together a movie that flat out makes you believe a 6'2"" billionaire playboy can run amok in the streets in a halloween costume, beating up bad guys.  Christian Bale has always been one of my favorite actors, ever since seeing him in the criminally underated Equilibrium (see it!).  His performance as both batman and Bruce Wayne is spot on.

The villains in this movie were great as well.  the Scarecrow has never been more terrifying, and Ra's (batman's oldest enemy, and teacher) offered more than enough trouble for batman to deal with.

1568431,2,B00005JNJV,"I am a diehard and long-time Batman fan, and waited all my life for someone to make a `serious' Batman film.  Now that someone has done this, I realize I was better off without one.

At least, I was better off without this serious Batman film.  `Serious' is the essence of the problem.  The film goes overboard and worse yet, overlong trying to show just how Bruce Wayne got koo-koo enough to dress as bat, trying to convince us that one man could master all known martial arts and detective skills, and trying to convince us that someone could really fight in a bulletproof batsuit , and trying to convince us that a batmobile could really exist.  There is no subtlety, and nothing is left to the imagination.  But this flaw alone would not be fatal.

What kills this movie are, in my mind, 5 unpardonable sins:

1) Katie Holms is horribly miscast as a `hardnosed' deputy DA and love interest for Bruce Wayne.  She is the very definition of unconvincing in this role.  She comes off more as a barista.  Compared to Katie Holms, Kim Basinger is Meryl Steep and Lee Merriwether is Vivian Liegh.  And there is absolutely zero chemistry with Christian Bale.
2) Speaking of Christian Bale: I've seen this guy in other stuff and I had high hopes.  But, while generally competent, I did not find his Batman/Bruce Wayne as nearly compelling as Adam West or even Michael Keaton. Perhaps his acting is too good: perhaps he does not leave enough for the imagination?  West and Keaton both seemed to convey a sense of keeping their cards close to the vest.  Also, why in heaven's name did Nolan let Christian Bale imitate Michael Keaton's rasp when in the Batman drag?  Silly, silly, silly.
3) [Spoiler Alert:] It is the height of heresy for Batman to voluntarily reveal his secret identity, even to women he is hot for.  Even when he is trying to sleep with the woman.  Within the context of this movie, it is inconceivable that Bruce Wayne would spend 18 years of single-minded obsession turning himself into the fearsome Batman, only to risk it all just to impress Katie Holms.  She is with the fricken DA's office!  The real Batman would know he could never trust a civil service employee or political appointee with the secret of his true identity!
4) The final, cataclysmic battle, rather than being satisfying or cathartic, is yet another silly, over-exaggerated CGI mess.  Just because you can use CGI does not mean you should.  Batman should never emulate Spiderman or Arnold Schwartzenegger.  The climactic sequence, like virtually all modern action movies, is more a Roadrunner/Coyote cartoon than a fight scene.  The idea of a grown man dressing like a bat requires enough suspension of belief: the CGI stuff overloads it.  Adam West and Michael Keaton didn't need CGI.
5)  Rubber muscles.  Didn't like them in 1989, hated them in the 1990's. I guess Time/Warner figures that rubber clothing fetishists are a key demographic. Auto-erotic thrills galore. Can't wait for the sequel to see the rubber nipples of the 21st Century!!!

Christopher Nolan had all the money in the world to make this movie, and had plenty of time and creative control as well.  These are the reasons for my fierce criticism and low rating of this film.  Although they have inferior special effects, judged as cinema and as pieces of heroic adventure, both the 1966 `Batman, the Movie' and the 1989 `Batman' are far superior to this film.  In the earlier films, the ridiculousness is intentional and drives home a point, whereas `Batman Begins' is often unintentionally ridiculous.",1200268800,3,3556,4.789819376026273

I can't think of one bad thing to really say about this film.  Unlike some comic book movies, this one takes itself very seriously (yet still holds a certain amount of humor too).  The 1989 Batman had a bit of serious edge to it, and its followers disregarded that.  Begins is like the 89 version, only more.  The story goes deep.  We not only learn of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, but we literally follow him step by step and get into his mind.  There are complications that go beyond simple revenge of his parent's death.  Bruce must administor justice, but how can justice be properly used in such a corrupt society as Gotham?  Its a very intriguing story, and the characters are fantastic, adding to the depth.  An incredible mixed cast of Liam Neeson, Micahel Caine, Morgan Freeman and Katie Holmes are a few of the actors that shine in this film.  Then there is Christian Bale, who brings a dark toughness to the role of Batman we have never seen before.  Indeed, the movie as a whole is very dark, but with enlightening messages.

The action is pretty tough in this film too.  The fights aren't too flashy, but more realistic than in prior films.  The new batmobile is actually more like a tank, called the Tumbler.  Unlike the previous batmobiles, this one is a little less flashy, but fully armed and can crush anything.  One of the most exciting parts of the film is when the Tumbler is being chased by cops throuhgout the town, and creates quite the wreckage along the way.

I could go on and on about the great things about this film, but it is honestly worth seeing.  If you are skeptical about remakes, like me, this one will probably win you over once you realize how good it is.  Especially since they are coming out with the sequal the Dark Knight which appears to be on the same level as this film, I can easily dismiss the older Batman titles in favor of the new series.

1568478,5,B00005JNJV,"Award winner and Oscar nominee for his 2000 screenplay, Memento, Director Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful punch and a believable plot set in a very realistic Gotham City. Nolan brings the audience back to basics and returns to the original concept of Batman as a crime fighter putting down thugs, gangsters and thieves. Christian Bale performs admirably as the sometimes Bi-polar Bruce Wayne, brooding and sullen while at the same time trying to laugh through the pain.

Mixed in with the mobster villains are two distinct antagonists who will be familiar to fans of the comic. Cillian Murphy masterfully plays the Scarecrow, a.k.a. Dr. Jonathan Crane, and stays true the psychotic, fear inducing character created by Finger and Kane for the original Batman series. The Ra's al Ghul storyline serves to condense all of Bruce Wayne's training into one easy to view montage. It is also the first time in film that Ra's makes and appearance. The scenes illustrating Bruce in training with the League of Shadows, remind us that unlike other mutated or alien superheroes, Wayne is just a man; but a man with extreme intellect, physical power and a never-ending supply of money to fund his crusade. In opposition to Wayne's agenda, is the powerful Ra's who believes the best way to create balance is to destroy most of humanity. The two grapple, one believing in the overall goodness of man and the fairness of the system, the other judging man to be inherently evil using a flawed system that will never lead to true justice.

The downside to this film is the forced romantic line between Bruce Wayne and contrived character Rachel Dawes. Holme's acting is not superb in this role and one wonders if she were given a more poignant character from Bruce Wayne's list of loves such as Talia al Ghul, or even Rachel Caspian, would there have been more emotion in her performance. Rachel Dawes is such a flat, one dimensional character that it seems likely that even the finest actress would have difficulties bringing her to life. There is nothing at stake in the relationship and while at one point she appears to be Wayne's better angel, it is Alfred who truly acts as his conscious. When will screen writers learn that women will still go see a sci-fi action films without obligatory romance!

The ever-brilliant Michael Caine as Alfred, was a superb casting choice. Charming, father-like and sometimes heavy handed, Caine delivers the best portrayal of Wayne's caretaker since Alan Napier.

As for the gadgets, the movie takes great care in showing the origins of the bat cave, the suite, and of course the bat mobile. Fan-boys/girls will enjoy the ""new"" look of the Caped Crusader's ride based on the art of Frank Miller (The Dark Knight Returns).

It has been a long time since the public had the opportunity to see Batman as he should be: dark, pining, credible and absolutely fantastic!",1198022400,4,2891,4.879837067209776

As a fan of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One, this film has been the most rewarding installment that's truest to the source material.  I liked Tim Burton's films, disliked Schumacher's light hearted direction, but loved that Nolan did what was missing from all the previous films that made this film so special, and that was Batman's origin story.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a good story that's entertaining enough to leave you wanting more whether your a bat fan or not.

1568532,5,B00005JNJV,"So that we can learn to pick ourselves back up.

As many know, the Batman franchise tumbled after Schulmacher took over.  That's not to say Tim Burton was absolutely fantastic either, but at least the first Batman film made in the late 80's, despite not being true to the comic, was still a fairly good film.  Unfortunately, all the Batman's to follow didn't have the same flair.  Once Batman and Robin came, however, that was the end of Batman as we knew it.  Or so we thought.

Christopher Nolan, the man behind such films as Memento, decided to revive Batman.  Just about everything done in the movie is right, with only a few minor issues that some probably won't be too upset about.

The movie, like many of Nolan's films, beings by jumping around a bit.  We alternate between Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) as a child and as an adult a little bit in the beginning.  Most of you know the story of Bruce Wayne.  His parents were murdered, and its a moment Nolan and crew capture extremely well.  As well as why Bruce Wayne becomes Batman in the first place.  The plot itself centers around Gotham City.  A city Bruce Wayne believes isn't beyond saving.  Years after Bruce Wayne was declared dead, he resurfaces after having gone undergo some training.  With the help of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) he soon gets all the gadgets and gizmos he needs to become the dark knight.

At first the movie centers on Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) and the corrupt system of Gotham.  Falcone has been able to get his thugs into the asylum because of the helpful Dr. Crane (Cillian Murphey) who makes everyone believe they are merely insane.  This upsets Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) who will stop it nothing to put him behind bars.  Wayne decides to clean up Gotham and to do that he becomes Batman.  But he'll soon discover that there's much more going on in Gotham City than Falcone, and that Falcone himself is nothing more than a puppet.

The movie is dark and intriguing.  Put simply, this is one of the finest super hero movies ever produced.  Bruce Wayne, in particular, is built up extremely well.  The way everything comes together in the end is nearly flawless.  With some other fine and believable performances by the likes of Liam Neeson and Gary Oldman, Batman Begins is fantastic.  In part because the story manages to be extremely well fleshed out without overdoing too much.

The only real problem the movie suffers from is that it takes nearly an hour before Christian Bale dawns the bat suit.  It's forgivable considering the absorbing story, and it surely won't upset too many folks in the long run.

This is Batman done right.  A fine movie with a fine director and an unbeatable cast.",1196380800,3,2686,4.639065817409766

1568536,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is the best Batman film made to date. Easily eclipsing the many previous versions. Christian Bale is as always excellent in the leading role and he is supported by a first-rate cast including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman.

The film starts by covering his early years as he travels the globe studying different types of criminal and the ways in which he can fight them. The culmination of this is the training in the temple with Ducard (Lima Neeson). This is a marvellously well done sequence and probably the highpoint of the film. Its also in this sequence that you will realise that the film is really not for young children (it has a 12 rating anyway). There are disturbing images and sequences in this film.

At a little over two hours, the film does remarkably well in holding your interest, and it is only in the last section of the film that it lets itself down at all. The ending was a little too blockbuster oriented for my liking and slightly out of place with the brilliance of the rest of the film.

1568539,4,B00005JNJV,"I must be in the minority of thoroughly enjoying this film, keep in mind that this was before I saw the Dark Knight, so my opinion may seem somewhat dated. Lets not forget, the story of Batman has been done in several different ways, but director Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer, in my personal opinion, nailed it.
It does drag in parts, but the actors do what they can to move it along. Director Tim Burton tried to make his version too dark, still good, but not great. Joel Schumacher tried to make his too goofy, it worked part of the time. With this version, Chris Nolan and David S. Goyer made it dark, but nearly realistic. The actors couldn't have been better choosen, Christian Bale does a handsome Bruce Wayne, Gary Oldman plays a very convincing Jim Gordon
Morgan Freeman, whom I've always liked, introduces Luicus Fox very well, Michael Caine does a very compassionate Alfred, the list goes on.... The backstory on the Wayne family is still very done, and Katie Holmes playing Bruce's love interest, proves that she can do grown-up roles.

1568541,5,B00005JNJV,"Tim Burton's original Batman was truly groundbreaking and did deserve the huge amounts of praise it recieved (I never really cared for any of the sequels. While the Joker was surreal, at least he was accetable. Batman Returns carried the unreality a little far). However, it was flawed. Mainly, it was small things that caught my attention, such as the fact that Batman's suit was so stiff that he could hardly fight in it (did it bother anybody else that he couldn't even turn his neck?) and the movie made me wonder how organized crime could realisticly be so obvious in a city and no one do anything about it. Batman Begins makes the corruption of Gotham's judicial system and police department very real and makes you realize that an independent like Batman, as unlikely a hero as he is, is badly needed. And instead of skirting around the issues with the batsuit we finally see every part of it explained from the horns on his head to the reason for the design of his cape and(GASP!)it actually seems plausable, even almost likely. Other pluses include:  Unlike in so many other movies, the special effects are not just there for themselves, but really add to the story. Other portrayals of Batman make him seem unstable and even dangerous to those he is supposedly protecting, while here he is an immovable, if dark, force for good with solid, sane reasons for doing what he does. (This movie just goes to show how adaptable Batman really is. There are so many good ways to portray him!) The villains, too, are unbelievably lifelike considering their origins (like Batman, the comics), good acting (by not only Christian Bale but Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman too)and a well devised plot draw you in and keep you wide-eyed, and, though some may say the movie was just too long, I loved every minute of it!",1189036800,2,1814,4.686520376175548

1568583,5,B00005JNJV,"When I was a kid, I'll admit that I kind of hated Batman, thanks to reruns of the 1960s television series.  On TV, Batman was sanctimonious, shallow and corny.  In 1989, however, the advent of Tim Burton's Batman movie exposed me to a whole new side of Batman: a flawed, moody outsider who lived in a corrupt, gothic metropolis, and who was more than willing to act lethally if he felt it was needed.  Batman became a huge success, and was one of the first ""summer megahype movies"" to benefit from the new Hollywood press machine.  While the movie may have emphasized style over substance, seeing Michael Keaton's Batman (using an arsenal of high-tech vehicles and gadgets) take on Jack Nicholson's deformed Joker was pure entertainment.  Batman fever reigned high at the time, but Burton's sequel, ""Batman Returns"", couldn't match the freshness of its predecessor, despite being a quite solid effort.  Keaton and Burton left the franchise, leaving Val Kilmer in the unenviable position of tackling the role of Bruce Wayne in Joel Schumacher's inordinately campy ""Batman Forever"".  Val Kilmer's almost psychadelic take on Batman wasn't enough to overcome the gaudy neons and cartoonish portrayals which plagued the movie; nonetheless, the movie was financially successful.  With George Clooney as Batman, 1997's ""Batman and Robin"" was the inevitable straw that broke the camel's back, and was so terrible that it stalled the careers of Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone, and led Clooney to admit that he ""was the guy who screwed Batman up"".  It looked like the franchise was dead, and the Batman movie license languished for years in development hell.  After some false starts, ""Memento"" director Chris Nolan was the guy who was to revive the Batman franchise with this movie, which chronicles the very beginning of Batman's career.

  While it has become fashionable to subscribe to the revisionist position that Tim Burton's ""Batman"" was a bad movie, the truth is that Nolan was clearly inspired to some degree by Burton.  The look of Batman's armored outfit, the militaristic motif of the Tumbler (aka the Batmobile), the gritty take on city corruption- these are all clearly derived from Burton's work.  However, Nolan's Gotham, while still dark and menacing, is not steeped in gothic fantasticism, but rather in a slightly more modern take on the classic noir urban setting of the mid 20th century.  The characters are all portrayed and explored much deeper than the 1989 movie, and both the hero and villains behave more realistically.

  The storyline hews closer to the various Batman comic books as well.  The movie begins with Bruce Wayne (played by ""American Psycho"" star Christian Bale) locked in an Asian prison, being recruited by the enigmatic Ducard for the League of Shadows, a mysterious organization of vigilantes run by the even more mysterious R'az Al Ghul.  Wayne trains to become a crime fighter, and through flashbacks, we see Bruce Wayne's childhood shattered when his wealthy and well-intentioned parents are killed by a desperate mugger.  After college, he returns to Gotham City to kill the mugger, who is about to be released in return for testimony, but is beaten to the punch by Carmine Falcone's mob organization.  Realizing that mere revenge is a doomed path, Wayne disappears to live life as a criminal, and gain insight.  Back in the present day, Wayne is about to be inducted into the League, but things turn sour when he learns their true plans.  Barely escaping with his life, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham with an idea in his head- to create an alter ego which will strike fear into the hearts of criminals.  Back in Gotham, he finds his father's company is in danger of losing its way, and is about to go public, thanks to the machinations of Earle, who was trusted with the company.  Wayne finds allies in family butler Alfred, Lucius Fox, a former Wayne Enterprise executive who was demoted to a dead-end job in research, Rachel Dawes, his childhood friend turned idealistic assistant D.A., and Sergeant Jim Gordon, an honest cop in a district overrun by corruption.  However, things are about to get ""complicated"", with both Carmine Falcone and corrupt Dr. Jonathan Crane (whose alter ego is the Scarecrow) acting as pawns for an even more sinister force preparing to unleash hell on Gotham.

  First off, with the exception of Katie Holmes' flat portrayal of Dawes, the acting is top notch.  The cast is a treasure trove of outstanding actors, including Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Tom Wilkinson, Cillian Murphy, and Linus Roache, to mention a few.  While some may object to the slower pacing of the movie, it works well, and creates tension.  The movie is saturated with browns, yellows and oranges, creating a warm glow to contrast with the sinister atmosphere brought by the story, while the minimalist soundtrack is appropriately gothic when needed.  The movie seems busy at times, with not one but three main villains, and the requisite goons.  The action sequences are presented at a frantic pace, and some may take issue with Nolan's filming of fight scenes in such an ""indirect"", chaotic manner.  But in the end, this is a superhero movie of the highest order, which tries to balance the fantastic with the realistic, and usually succeeds.  The movie viewer has been pretty fortunate with comic book movies as of late, with Superman Returns, the X-Men movies, and the Spiderman movies.  By returning to the noir roots explored by Tim Burton, yet filming things his own way, Chris Nolan managed to restart the franchise without disrespecting what was done well in past iterations.

The single disc DVD version has literally no extras, whatsoever.  However, the movie was so good I'll overlook it....this time.  Whichever version you get, the movie is outstanding.",1187827200,,5862,5.019648397104446

It goes a little over the top at the end, and someone should tell star Christian Bale that his imitation, intentional or not, of Clint Eastwood's voice sounds more like Kurt Russell in those ""Escape from New York"" movies than the man himself, but the movie is ambitious in ways that 1989's Batman was not, especially in detailing the origins of Bruce Wayne's altar ego.

 And the cast...whoa, the cast: Gary Oldman as Gordon before he became Commissioner, Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as the inventor who supplies Batman with his hi-tech gadgets, and Liam Neeson as an early mentor. This is the fifth ""Batman"" movie from Warner Bros., but it's not a sequel. It's a fresh start.

1568655,5,B00005JNJV,"Prior to this movie, I had always wondered why they didn't adapt the frank miller versions of batman comics into movies, they always seemed to sinister, dark, the way i felt batman should always be portrayed.

Finally they did so. I admit when i went to the movies for this I didn't expect much considering the previous abomination of a series with george clooney and val kilmer involved but I was so wrong.

It held very close to the theme of the books and kept true to the dark nature, i believe was best intended for this character.

I cant wait for the next one with heath ledger as the joker, this is going to be exceptional!",1183939200,,630,4.367521367521367

1568657,5,B00005JNJV,"One of the biggest surprises in cinema that said year, `Batman Begins' proves to be everything one could ask for in a superhero movie.  It's got some breathtaking action scenes, some great fight scenes and some amazing special effects.  What takes this film over the edge though, making it far removed from the previous efforts is that the script is tight, the acting is superb and the characters are so well fleshed out that they become three dimensional.  We, the audience, feel like we know Bruce Wayne inside and out and we understand where he's coming from.  We don't get that feeling from the previous films.  Christian Bale does such a brilliant job with his character that I'm tempted to say he was snubbed come awards season.  He truly did deserve some recognition for his work here.  He took a character that has been played before with no real depth and transformed him into someone we could relate to and cheer for.  He did for Batman what Daniel Craig did for James Bond.

The film may start on the slow side of things as has been commented on before.  It's a general retelling of The Dark Knights origin so it's bound to be a lot of story telling versus an over abundance of action.  The action does come, just not right away.  I actually enjoyed watching Wayne's story slowly unfold.  It's very interesting to see where he got his start since the concept has not been pursued in any of the Batman films before this one.  The film explores the training Wayne undergoes after his parents are murdered and he flees the country.  Upon returning some years later to a city overrun by criminals Wayne makes it his personal agenda to rid Gotham City of the waste and filth that permeates the streets.  After returning though, and donning the cape, Bruce finds that struggling to keep a firm grasp on his two personas may be his biggest challenge.

Like I mentioned, Bale does a fantastic job with tackling both Bruce Wayne and Batman, two separate characters who both need delicate attention.  He's cocky and self-sure, doubtful and reserved, distant and egotistical, responsible and afraid, all of these things and sometimes all at once, and he handles his emotions so effortlessly he completely sinks into his character and becomes the Bat.  Another standout performance comes from rising star Cillian Murphy who devours his role as Jonathan Crane or better known as `The Scarecrow'.  He's splendidly evil, the type of character that gets right under your skin and festers.  He's perfectly cast.  Michael Caine is perfectly cast (and I was skeptical) as Alfred, the family butler and Liam Neeson is always good, and as Wayne's mentor Henri Ducard he's especially effective.  Katie Holmes is decent, but her role is somewhat thankless, as is Morgan Freeman's but he still delivers.  And let's just say that while Ken Wantanabe kicks butt as Ra's Al Ghul he's no where near as awesome as Neeson as the film comes to a close.

So, with all this talk of actors pulling out the stops I need to mention the brilliance that was and is Christopher Nolan who was, I'm sure, very close to Oscar consideration for his direction here.  He effortlessly staged this entire film and delivers wonderfully, from his script to his finished product.  The set pieces are fantastic, the action scenes are well choreographed and the pace of the film, the editing is all fantastic and close to perfect.  The props, everything from gadgets to the new and totally improved Batmobile, are brilliantly modernized and dare I say ""oh so cool"".  The film deserves our attention and will garner repeat viewings.  I'm tempted to say it's better than Sam Raimi's `Spider Man' Blockbusters, but that's open to speculation.  With a cast this huge, and equally impressive, and a director this in tune with his subject, `Batman Begins' never falters and remains one of the best films of 2005.",1183593600,,3865,4.784313725490196
1568658,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is one of the best super-hero movies of all time. I'm a fan of superhero movies and I've seen all the Superman, Spiderman, and Batman films. But I'm not a fanatic. I don't read the comics or know about the ""true"" stories of these characters. I don't care about that. I just want to see a good movie. Batman Begins was a summer blockbuster in 2005  and it actually tried to do something none of the other summer blockbusters ever do. It tried to tell a story.

From the title, you learn this is a story of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. Probably the first hour of the movie is spent developing the character of Bruce Wayne, showing how he suffered after his parents were murdered, how he abandoned the privelege of his birth for a live of crime and self-inflicted punishment. The first part of the movie works in part because of the great cast. Christian Bale as Wayne is incredible. Other greats such as Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and a menacing Cilian Murphy make every moment on screen enthralling.

Equally enjoying is the transformation of Wayne into Batman. It is portrayed as realistic as it can considering it is a superhero movie. Wayne uses the recources of Lucious Fox at a secret R&D section of Wayne Enterprises. There, he finds all the tools he'll need as Batman, including an incredible Bat-Mobile.

If you are like me, the George Clooney batman movie kind of soured you on the story of Batman. If so, you must watch this movie. The acting is great, the story is crisp, the action and characters are gritty and real. I can't wait for the upcoming sequel in 2008.",1183593600,,1603,4.555555555555555

1568694,4,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" or more likely, ""Begins Anew"".  We already know Bats's origins - driven to become a costume vigilante to save Gotham City but also avenge the years-past murders of his parents, Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.  Glanced briefly in the 1989 movie, this film actually shows the murders, then follows Wayne across the world in self-imposed exile.  Rescued from a horrid Asian prison by the mysterious Ducard (Liam Neeson), Wayne finds himself recruited into Ras-Al-Ghul's League of Shadows, a small vigilante army.  In the frost of some unnamed eastern wilderness, Wayne learns the ways of the warrior while confronting personal demons harbored since his parents' murder.  Successfully earning his way into The Brotherhood, Wayne learns of its merciless approach to criminal justice and its plans to restore order to Gotham City, and betrays it.  (The Brotherhood proves to have a longer memory and reach than Wayne had anticipated, using mass destruction to stave off chaos throughout history - they sacked Rome, brought diseased rats to medieval Europe and burned London to the ground.)  Escaping the Brotherhood, Wayne returns to crime-ridden Gotham, beginning an anti-crime campaign that puts him at odds with both criminals and cops.  Meanwhile, Jim Gordon, Gotham's last-good-cop pursues his own investigation.  While the city is apparently ruled by crimeboss Carmine Falcome, the script hints at an even darker power lingering in the shadows, ready to strike.

This was a pretty good film, though at times it took itself a tad too serious, hoping to escape the self-conscious dark camp of the older movies with their storybook and cartoonish settings.  At times the movie seems unsure of how it wants to look, alternating between conventional looking settings and some mix of Bladerunner and Steampunk.  It is perhaps a bit too dark for its own good, and the action was often hard to follow.  Though showing Batman from his origins, the script begins with Bruce Wayne already having the motives of Batman to take on crime - just looking for the gadgets and Kevlar to facilitate his caped crusade.  We never find the source of Bruce's heroism, though we're supposed to assume it just runs in the family.  The story isn't that well defined either, as if they decided that all they needed was to toss Batman into a city of crime, come up with some plot to destroy the city and the rest would write itself.  Of the characters, Alfred and Lucious (Morgan Freeman) are the only fun ones.  Cillian Murphy is the forgettable Scarecrow, a psychiatrist who rules by fear.  Tom Wilkinson is actually well cast and plays Falcone like some 40's era crimeboss, but the story gets rid of him quickly.  The best role here is actually Neeson's - he's much more interesting as a morally-questionable killer.  In short, it doesn't match the '89 Batman, but easily beats everything that followed it.",1181779200,2,2893,5.03781512605042

1568697,5,B00005JNJV,"If you've watched Tim Burton's wonderful 1989 interpretation of ""Batman"", then you probably know that almost none of the other films in the franchise lived up to that film, especially Joel Schumacher's turkey ""Batman & Robin"", a film that was more like a commercial for Happy Meals than an actual movie. ""Batman Begins"" is something completely different. No, really it is; It has absolutely nothing to do with any of the four other films, and it is the first live-action Batman movie to actually explain his origin. While the Burton/Schumacher films focused more on the insane villains rather than on the hero, ""Begins's"" focus is on Batman's story. Speaking of villains, there are about three: There's Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist who, under the guise of ""The Scarecrow"", poisons people with psychotropic drugs in order to make them have terrifying visons. Irish actor Cillian Murphy plays the character with unnerving calm, menace, and sardonic wit (At one point, he lights Batman on fire, telling him to ""lighten up""). Tom Wilkinson plays Carmine Falcone, a ruthless crime boss who has the city of Gotham ""bought and paid for"". And then there's another mysterious figure who poses an even bigger threat to the city, someone who Bruce Wayne himself once had as a mentor. I will not give the indentity of this character away, as it will spoil one of the biggest plot points of the movie. A huge theme of the movie is how screwed up the criminal justice system is. At one point, we see a judge who apparently is associated with Carmine Falcone, even eating in the same restaurant with him. Overall, this is a story about the life of a man dissillusioned with the way justice is handled in the city and decides to take it into his own hands, and it is not about cartoonish special effects or over-the-top villains.",1181520000,,1827,4.821656050955414

Visual: Obviously the HD is a better image but not as much as you might expect. I kind of thought this might happen considering the movie has a pretty dark layout throughout. In the original Rachel's face has a hint of some colors that shouldnt be there a slight greenish blue-ish. In the HD version the color of her face is completely natural almost perfect. I also notice more detail on the bat suit in the HD than the original. Although I do notice a difference I don't recommend double dipping this film because its not such a drastic improvement as you see in other films. I plan on renting dark movies (v for vendetta) before I double up because I have a feeling this will remain consistent.

Sound: Once again, the sound is better but I expected it to be much better. The rumbling of the engine wasn't that much stronger than standard DD.

1568700,5,B00005JNJV,"When the film technology finally caught up to the imagination of comic book writers many movies were made that showed off the visual effects a movie has to offer.  While these movies have gone on to becoming blockbusters, comic book fans (like myself) have often complained about the story.

Batman Begins is one of the few exceptions as the story not only grips you to your seat hanging on every word, but blowing your mind by the visual effects.

And to make things even better, we the high definition (HD DVD) edition is even BETTER.  Every scene is crisp and makes you feel like a participant of the movie.

Of all the Batmans, Christian Bale captures the dark, tortured side of our dark-winged hero better than the others.  His acting is amazing and does a fantastic job of showing how Batman became Batman and how he overcame his biggest enemy: his fears.

The choice of enemies was surprising but it looks like if they are going to do a sequel they will be returning to his biggest nemesis: the Joker.  If Bale can surpass Keaton as Batman, they are going to have an uphill battle finding a better Joker than Nickleson.  But if the caliber of movie making matches this movie, I'll catch it even if they cast Ben Stein into the part.

It has several things that were missing from the previous films allowing this to be a complete story. It's all right to keep Tim Burton's films for good artistic expression and value, but if you want to look at a more character driven piece, then this is it.

In Batman Begins we delve into the psychological or zen like as well as the physical shaping of Batman. Bruce Wayne goes from a frightened child to an angry collegian whose rage must be focused into fighting injustice. Recieving the ""Superman"" treatment, this film has a delightful cast (Holmes being the only exception) that gives rousing performances all around. The blend of action and humor is there. In addition, the story is well rounded and interesting, leaving everyone to wonder about the upcoming sequel. The only thing that can stop Batman now is Warner Brothers.

1568756,5,B00005JNJV,"Definitely spend the extra bucks for the 2 disc set This set comes with a really cool bonus disc and a great digest sized comic compiled with some of the great comic book stories that inspired the writers on the film. The bonus features are great, but I'd have liked some of them to be a bit longer--such as the history of Batman featurette. Great documentary on the pre-production and stunts as well as the fight choreography. Unfortunately the only cast member they interview in any depth is Christian Bale (such a shame considering the enormously talented cast this film has) and NO director's commentary or any commentary for that matter. Personally I'd have loved a commentary with the cast and writers.

As for the film: this is most certainly a film about Batman. Who he is, how he came to be, and why he believes what he believes. Basically this film is blissfully nothing like the last two Batman films starring Val Kilmer & George Clooney in the title roles. I loved how the relationship between Gordon & Batman grows over the course of the film and the explanation given for their friendship/partnership is pitch perfect. A very important character to the comic book universe is introduced (Lucius Fox) and Alfred is given new life and a more sardonic sense of humor by actor Michael Caine. I'm not sure why every single Batman flick has him revealing his secret identity to at least one person (a sad tradition started in the first Burton film), but at least here it's much more plausible. The only disappointing aspect of the film is that Batman's detective skills aren't really shown to exist let alone given a chance to shine. Hopefully that's something they'll rectify in the sequel. And hopefully that sequel will be made with the same talented cast and crew. I'd love to see a true Batman onscreen trilogy. It would be wonderful to see Batman start out at one place and have him end in another over the course of 3 films with the same actors in key roles. It seems to be what Raimi is doing with Spider-Man and what Singer almost did with The X-Men. I think the Batman character deserves to be handled with respect and a truly definitive cinematic saga shouldn't be too much for fanboys to hope for. If such a saga is to come, then this film is the perfect place for it to begin.",1177804800,3,2297,4.588807785888078
1568757,4,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" (2005) directed by Christopher Nolan, takes us to the origins of Bruce Almighty aka Dark Night aka Batman. I have to admit that I have not seen any Batman's movies; so it made sense to explore the beginning of the legend, to find out how the billionaire Bruce Wayne ended up as a masked crusader who fought restlessly against the sinister forces that prey on the innocent and threaten to destroy Gotham City.

Never been able to forget the murder of his parents before his eyes for which he felt guilty and responsible, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)  traveled the world fighting injustice with small-time criminals until one day mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) finds him and offers him the training with a mysterious and powerful League of Shadows, the organization presided over by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). The League of Shadows is dedicated to restoring ""balance"" to a world in which ""criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding."" Part of Ra's Al Ghul and Ducard plan was the total destruction of Gotham City. Bruce refuses to participate in it and returns to Gotham City where under the mask of Batman, he fights the corrupted city officials, the powerful mafia boss (Tom Wilkinson in yet another memorable performance), and the villainous Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, the show stealing performance from a young actor).

By the end of the movie, we will know why Bruce chose Batman as his alter ago, we will see the original bat-mobile and will meet his friends and allies for the first time that include his trusted butler who has been always more than butler but a family member, Alfred (Michael Cane), the head of the science department in his corporation, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman plays a combination of God and Q) who can or have already invented anything, and honest police officer, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman is very believable in his rare good-guy role. He also has the best quote in the movie. When watching bat mobile in action, he exclaims, ""I've got to get me one of these!""

1568759,4,B00005JNJV,"Aside from setting a benchmark for other franchises (perhaps most notably 007) to follow, Batman Begins is a remarkably ambitious and mostly successful attempt to bring some real substance to the comic book genre beyond mere mood. It has a sense of the epic to it, as well as an awareness of the escalation of moral quandaries that come with taking the law into your own hands that haven't been seen in a big-budget summer picture since Clear and Present Danger. It's not just a case of a superhero fighting a supervillain either: the various mobsters, evil geniuses and crooked businessmen are all part of a much larger corruption that ensures that even a semblance of moral balance cannot be restored by the end credits as per other superhero flicks. Christopher Nolan even manages to get strong performances from actors who had long ago drifted into ham and volume like Gary Oldman and Rutger Hauer. It also has a few problems, not least the lack of depth in the photography or Nolan's deficiencies as an action director (not Michael Bay bad, but not particularly good either), but they're outweighed by the pluses.

The 2-disc set boasts an impressive array of extras (including numerous Easter Eggs), although the lovingly crafted comicbook art menu pages can get a little annoying to work your way through at times and it's a shame that only the brief teaser trailer has been included.",1176422400,,1391,4.84453781512605

1568823,5,B00005JNJV,"What can I say that others haven't for me. The movie is just a stunning revivement of the once-maligned Batman franchise, which took a nose dive with the one-two punch of Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin"" in 1995 and 1997, respectively. After B&R bombed at the box office (though it made over $100 million domestically) and the wannabe Batman revival film ""Catwoman"", the franchise seemed doomed to wallow in development hell. In 2003, newcomer filmmaker Christopher Nolan (who blew audiences away with his first feature film ""Memento"") and veteran screenwriter David S. Goyer (who penned all three scripts for the ""Blade"" series, which were also based on a comic book) approached Warner Brothers about doing another Batman movie, only this time taking the hero back to his roots and making it more realistic and believable. The film began production in early 2004 in London, casting Welsh actor Christian Bale as the titular hero Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth.. When the film finished principal photography, Warner Brothers decided not to pull a big ad campaign like they did for the previous four films, but decided to mute it and let the film sell itself.

The film opened with a good $72 million opening weekend and with ecstatic critical acclaim by critics nationwide. In a year that was filled with big blockbusters (including the highly anticipated ""Revenge of the Sith""), ""Batman Begins"" demonstrated long legs at the box office, finally ending its theatrical run with a tidy $205 million profit domestically.

One of the reason ""Batman Begins"" did so well was the good word-of-mouth. People came back for repeat viewings (I did go and see it in theaters twice) and truth be told, it's an excellent movie to boot. It jetissons the campiness of the Schumacher entries and the excess Gothicism of the Burton entries and goes for a low-key realism. Sure, there are still minor elements in the film that recall other Batman films (the poison gas plot is redone from ""Batman"" and there are two villains), but they fit in with the surroundings. And it delves into Bruce Wayne's backstory via flashbacks and flash-forwarding to the present (it is non-linear, so one has to pay attention to the film right from the start) for a good bit of running time before remaining firmly entrenched in the present future. The Oscar-nominated cinematography is just stunning and while it still captures the darkness of the Burton films, it does so in a subtly different way. Every actor is well-cast, particularly Christian Bale (""American Psycho"", ""The Prestige"") as the title character and balances Wayne's duality naturally. The movie also strikes a balance between exposition and keeping the action moving, and never loses focus. From the beginning right to the end credits, the movie is riveting and never boring. It stands well by itself, but the ending is purposefully wide-open for a sequel. (The sequel, ""The Dark Knight"" is currently in production and will have a July 2008 release date.)

The movie is available on DVD in two forms: separate single-disc full-screen and anamorphic widescreen formats and a widescreen-only 2-disc edition. It is also available in a out-of-print VHS format as well as on HD-DVD (the Blu-ray edition has yet to be released). As much as I'm a sucker for extras, I'll be reviewing the single-disc widescreen edition (which has a much better cover).

The film is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen and it looks absolutely spectacular from start to finish. (Nolan has said that he worked with the WB to make sure the film looked and sounded as good as possible on home video.) The film has a natural, more earthy tone than the simply Gothic and gaudy looks Burton and Schumacher imparted in the previous movies, and it handles contrast with ease. Black levels are smooth and inky, and compression is very well-done. There's no unwanted grain (other than just enough to impart a more film-like presentation), and no dirt or digital artifacts. For standard defintion DVD, this is one of the WB's best-looking titles.

While the 2-disc Special Editions of the previous ""Batman"" movies all get DTS audio, ""Batman Begins"" is excluded from the DTS treatment. Nevertheless, the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track is phenomenal. Dialogue is clear and placed in the center channel, while the surrounds are constantly in use, even in dialogue-driven scenes, where the ambience really helps draw the viewer in. But it certainly amps up the volume in the action sequences, with deep bass that'll shake the rafters and pinpoint surround activity (particularly the Tumbler chase and the climax on the monorail). Dialogue is never lost during the action sequences, and the score co-composed by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is always clear and detailed. A French 5.1 dub is included, and the film has optional subtitles in English, French, or Spanish.

As this is a single-disc release by Warner Brothers, there are mainly no extras on here save for the movie, the theatrical trailer (presented in anamorphic widescreen with stereo audio), DVD-ROM material and two skippable previews at start-up for ""Smallville"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". The main menu and almost all of the submenus are animated (the scene selection has animated previews) and the film is divided into 40 chapters. The disc is placed in a regular Amaray case and no chapter insert is included.

If you haven't seen this movie due to the hype, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out. Both editions of the film (as well as the HD-DVD) present the movie in flawless digital clarity and stunning surround sound, so you won't lose quality either way in terms of presentation. Highly recommended and can't wait for the sequel.",1175299200,2,5782,5.029227557411273
1568824,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman has had his ups and downs in cinema, beginning with a 1940's serial to a campy 1960's series.  Batman got a remake from Tim Burton in 1989, but the remake deteriorated over the course of three sequels.  Director and writer Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer have re-envisioned Batman along the lines of The Dark Knight, reinvigorating a franchise headed in the wrong direction.

Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, ""Reign of Fire"" and ""The Prestige"") had a nasty experience as a child involving bats; lots of bats.  We soon learn that young Wayne may be a bit of a wimp, partially because of the bat experience, but perhaps also because he blames himself for getting his parents killed.  Eventually young Wayne turns his guilt to a source of strength for revenge, and focuses his life on revenging his parents, and then anyone who is defenseless.

Bruce heads abroad to study with a society that has mysterious purposes.  Bruce believes that this society could channel his need for revenge into useful directions, until Bruce finds out that the society will control him more than he controls the society, and Bruce and the society part ways.

The transition from Bruce Wayne the guilt-ridden young man to vengeful Batman is the goal of this movie, and Director Nolan keeps that focus from beginning to end.  The transition starts out slowly as Bruce becomes a young man, but speeds up as Bruce begins to focus his life into a purpose.  The final quarter of the movie is spectacular and not only provides a worthy end to this movie, but makes a great beginning to the next film ""The Dark Knight.""

Several factors that help make this movie a joy to watch for fans of the Batman.

First, the technology is somewhat accessible and logical.  There are technologies that are rooted in science fiction, but much of what we see in the movie either exists or could exist.

Second, the special effects are phenomenal.  I knew when the movie relied on digital effects, but the detail was so exquisite that I was unable to tell when real life ended and digital began.  Incidentally, residents of Chicago will likely recognize many of the locations used for this film.  Though Chicago is a bright and open city, several lower level areas in Chicago provided excellent background shots for Gotham City.

Third, the villains in this film were non-costumed and generally ""normal"" as compared to the Penguin, the Riddler, and others of that ilk.  This movie contains hints regarding future villains, but we must await the next movie to see how Nolan evolves them.

Last, the actors in this film are excellent choices for their roles.  I always worry about the selection of an actor for a character like Batman.  Christian Bale is excellent and believable as the Dark Knight.  Michael Caine is the imperturbable butler Alfred (Michael Caine and Christian Bale made another memorable appearance together the year after this film in ""The Prestige"").  Liam Neeson has a lock on the role of mentor.  Many other great actors helped make this movie seem very real, including Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, and Katie Holmes.

Batman may have had his ups and downs in more than six decades of cinema, but he has never looked better than he does in ""Batman Begins.""  This movie sets a standard for future Batman movies and for super heroes transitioning from illustrated soft covers to live action.  I hope the films that follow will get the hint.

Enjoy!",1174780800,4,3450,4.819727891156463
1568825,5,B00005JNJV,"Christopher Nolan single-handedly demolishes the 80's and 90's Batman movies by re-imagining The Dark Knight from the ground-up. He assembled a first rate cast, with every member at a perfect pitch. Christian Bale is spot on as the troubled billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. When you view the series, it has always been how the actors play Bruce as the straightman, and not as a caped crime fighter. Michael Keaton was terrific in his fashion, while I was always of the opinion that Val Kilmer was the smoothest of the bunch and George Clooney could have been perfect had he not been saddled with the horrific script dumped off as ""Batman And Robin.""

More to the point is that the supporting cast also carries through on their characters. Of particular note are Liam Neeson as Ducard and Gary Oldham, almost unrecognizable as (not quite Commissioner) Jim Gordon. There's enough light moments in the script to match the darkness, and Morgan Freeman's inventions make for good action.

The reason I picked this set up, however, was the special booklet. With three stories to choose from, it is a load of fun. One is from 1989, the second is the Bob Kane introduction from 1939 Detective Comics, and the third an introductory chapter from ""The Long Halloween."" It made the extra bucks (and the five star rating) worth adding on.",1174780800,3,1325,4.832599118942731

1568827,5,B00005JNJV,"This is Batman as it should be. Dark, sinister from beginning to end, and the hero wins only to lose after all. The movie is dark and selfish, like the town that Batman protects. There is no sequel. There is only delay, while we wait, and wonder whether we will be treated to another helping, this time with Batman's most infamous (and dangerous) of enemies - his nemesis, the joker.

The previous Batman movies were bright and colorful, much like the old Batman television series, with interesting sets and villains, but with each movie (and each new Batman) it became more of a Sunday cartoon and less a cinematic vision of the Dark Knight. With the return of the bat (Batman Begins) we have seemingly wiped the slate clean. Here is the new prince of (darkness) the city, the forlorn and brooding hero who hides his identity through his alter ego: the charming, friendly, and somewhat arrogant Bruce Wayne. Batman is once again the star of the movie, not the costume, the sets, or the celebrity villains. Batman (even before there is a costume) evolves before us, a man filled with rage and disgust with his home, a warrior seeking to become much more than a single soldier in a war that transcends his lifespan. This is as it should be. Dark, unpleasant at times, and morose. There is no happy ending - only an acceptable one. That is what makes this movie so perfect. I only hope that they have finally started filming Batman Two (whatever it will be titled) while we still have Michael Caine with us as Alfred.",1174521600,2,1515,4.590405904059041

1568881,5,B00005JNJV,Good movie .. and best actor for this character to date.,1172793600,2,56,4.181818181818182
1568882,5,B00005JNJV,"The idea here--and it is an admirable one--is to account for in a realistic way how the fictional character Bruce Wayne became Batman the superhero.  Why did he become a crime fighter?  How did he become so skilled, so tough and so motivated?  How was he able to come up with such effective gadgetry including the super hi-tech Batmobile?  And why did he chose the bat as his motif?

From what I can tell it was screenwriter David S. Goyer who asked himself these questions and saw that answering them could be made into a kind of blockbuster prequel to the Batman movie phenomenon.  But it was director Christopher Nolan who made it work.

Nolan also directed the sensational Memento (2000) a story about a man who is only able to remember what has happened during the last minute or two and has no memory of anything before that up to the time he suffered a head injury.  He has to write down where he parks his car so he can find it later, and he keeps pictures with notes on people he sees regularly because he can never remember them or any interaction he has with them.  Memento is a stunningly brilliant film that skyrocketed Nolan to fame.

Goyer wrote a number of screenplays before Batman Begins, none of them of much importance.  I happened to have seen the film Arcade (1993), for which he wrote the script, a harmless, undistinguished scifi for teens but nothing else of his.  Nonetheless, Goyer is a natural for something like Batman Begins because he is a writer of comics who attended the USC film school and (or was) a collector of comics.  He cares about comics and comic book heroes and he knows enough about film to write a script that might work.  He and Nolan share credit for the script.

The story begins in Tibet where a young Bruce Wayne learns how to fight like a ninja and gains insights into himself and who he is.  There are flashbacks to his childhood in which he falls into a dry well and is terrified by the bats that fly out over his head as he lies trapped.  He sees his parents murdered in a holdup.  This motivates him to become a crime fighter.

The later part of the movie shows Bruce Wayne discovering a cave under the Wayne Mansion, interacting with the loyal family butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and getting help with his crime-fighting inventions from tech and forensics expert Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman).  Katie Holmes plays Bruce's childhood friend who has become a prosecuting attorney fighting bravely against the crime and corruption that have become rampant in Gotham City.

There are an number of nice touches and the visuals are really arresting.  The Batmobile itself is fascinating to watch in action, especial during one of the most spectacular chase scenes ever envisioned, as Batman directs the vehicle up a ramp to the top of a building and then leads the cops on a chase as the Batmobile leaps from one building to another!

Some of the early action is a bit beyond belief (although the intent is realism), most notably when Bruce Wayne manages to fight his way singlehandedly out of the ninja mountain training camp and has the strength in one arm to stop the fall of ninja leader Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and hold himself and Ducard at the precipice of a cliff and then pull Ducard up.  Near the end of the film as Batman shoots up from the ground on wires and glides and springs from rooftop to rooftop with the greatest of ease, the action becomes clearly comic book like.

Regardless, this is without question the best superhero movie I've ever seen.  It is not only a commercial triumph for Nolan and everybody connected with the picture but, given the genre, an artistic and creative one as well.

See this for Christopher Nolan who is quickly becoming one of Hollywood's most successful directors.",1172188800,2,3766,4.607196401799101
1568883,3,B00005JNJV,"They FINALLY got somebody who can do a good Bruce Wayne AND Batman! (And no eyeglasses!) Christian Bale looks exactly like Bruce Wayne ought to look: blandly handsome and spiffy...the way ol' BW's been portrayed in the comics since I can remember. Keaton wasn't quite right for the role, (though he did make a passable Batman,) and, while Kilmer was closer, he STILL wasn't bang on the mark. Bale is! However, as to whether this movie is as good as the best of the Tim Burton produced films is another matter. This film is NOT better than ""Batman Returns"" or ""Batman Forever""! Both of these movies had incredible, tour-de-force portrayals of at least one character....Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in ""Returns"" and Jim Carrey's Riddler and Chris O'Donnell's Robin/Dick Grayson in ""Forever"". Schumacher's Gotham City was a little more dazzling, as well. This version is TOO dark, and Batman comes off as a bit of a maniac. The character ""Ra's Al Ghul"" is also misrepresented here as well. ""Ra's"" is not oriental nor did he WORK for one, but was of some sort of aquiline nosed/Arabic-English background in the comic books, working entirely for himself. And he's a relative newcomer to the BM rogues' gallery, even though this film delineates the early days of Batman's career. ""Ra's Al Ghul"" is also a middle-eastern name, meaning ""The Demon's Head"". Where's Talia, his daughter?! The rejuvenation pool? He's also supposed to be a few hundred years old, something never covered in the movie! Scarecrow is ALSO a relative newbie! What gives?!

I also take issue with using Gary Oldman for Commissioner Gordon. OLDMAN DOES VILLAINS...&nbsp;heroes or friends of heroes! Just like they should have saved Keaton for The Riddler or Catman or someone, they should have saved Oldman for The Joker, or Deadshot or somebody...someone like Tom Selleck or Sam Elliot should have played Gordon! And when are they going to get Alfred right? Since the fococta TV show, Alfred has been portrayed as tall, white haired, old as the hills and bespectacled.... he's actually supposed to be about average in height, bald with dark haired fringe, mustachioed and proper-Brit-city, with 20/20 vision! Granted, Michael Caine is a decent actor, but it's hard to buy him as Alfred!

The plot for this movie seems confused, as if Nolan's still getting his sea-legs with the franchise...the first Burton movie suffered from this same problem, differently: IT looked hurriedly slapped together...this one looks like they just made a stew of every element they could think of! In fact, there were elements of the first Burton movie in it, re: the mixing of separate elements to get a viable poison eventually. None of this really seems to tie together as a coherent whole. For instance, why does Ducard become a villain, after initially TRAINING Bruce in the ways of the ninja? Why was Wayne Manor burned down? I also might add that Batman has NO bulletproof, Kevlar civvies in the comic book...never has had it! Just his utility belt, cape, cowl and leotard! Here, like in the Burton movies, he's outfitted like a S.W.A.T. team member! Makes sense, of course, but on the other points, why don't they stick to the source material?

AND THAT CAR!! The new Batmobile looks like a cross between a Lamborghini Countach, a Meyers Manx dune buggy and a Humvee! Whose bright idea was this? The danged thing looks like some device from the ""Half-Life"" computer game, not something you'd expect a millionaire crimefighter to be driving in deepest, darkest Gotham....Get an old boattail Riviera from the 70s out of mothballs, or the one Val Kilmer drove in ""Batman Forever""....

All in all, it's a nice diversion, but if you could re-inject SOME of the jocular quality of the two excellent, middle Burton flicks into this new series, (and I'm sure there's going to be a sequel,) it would do the character a service.

1568885,5,B00005JNJV,"There were and are a few grumblings from critics here and there but ultimately this film garnered near unanimous applause and a huge sigh of relief. Batman Begins is not perfect by any measure but is easily the best Batman movie ever, not that it had serious competition from it's predecessors. The first thing director Christopher Nolan does is say the hell with the neon colors, the over the top comic book sensibility, the freakshow circuses, let's take Batman back to his roots. Strip him of all the tarnish and the villians and the crazy gadgets. Let's go to the core of who he is. Who is Batman? Who is Bruce Wayne? How did Bruce Wayne become Batman? Everyone knows the answers to these questions but we never saw these questions answered vividly before our very eyes on the cinematic screen before Batman Begins. One of the genius strokes of this movie is the fact that Batman is not even shown onscreen for the first hour of the film! Unbelievable! That had to have Warner Brothers executives biting their fingernails incessantly. Will those pesky teenagers in the audience sit still as the story of Batman is allowed to unfold at an unhurried pace? Apparently those pesky teenagers weren't so dumb after all since the film was quite a hit. Hey, even adults liked this movie, two birds with one stone.

Christian Bale is the best actor to inhabit this character, ever. Some may have their nostalgia for Michael Keaton but Keaton was very low-key and let the freakshow villians dominate his movies with their antics. Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman is a marked difference from previous actors, he is involving and fascinating as a character. From the tragedy of his past to the glory of his future, the whole path of this character makes perfect dramatic sense. Michael Caine does his job as Alfred, Liam Neeson is an intelligent villian, Cillian Murphy gets a bit on my nerves, but anyhow, the only person who lets the cast down is Katie Holmes. She's just there to be a pretty face and she's not that pretty! Gary Oldman as Gordan is right on the money. Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson and even Rutger Hauer are terrific supporting characters. Ken Watanabe's short appearance is significant too. That's a lot of name actors!

The script and pacing are terrific, however Batman Begins does have it's faults. Let me list them. There seems to be too many characters and plot points as if Nolan wants to ram a far more epic story into the running time. Then there is the question of the action scenes, Nolan's directing of action is still in it's infancy and there is no action set-piece to take your breath away and go, ""Wow, that's amazing!"". So the action scenes leave something to be desired and the Batmobile looks like [...] to be honest, but it's design makes sense in light of Nolan's more realistic take on the whole Batman mythology. ( The Batmobile still looks very derivative, admit it! ).

Overall, this film was a joy to watch. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen and was very happy to finally be witness to the Batman film we all rightfully deserved. In light of the box-office victory and the critical triumph, this film should not have been called Batman Begins, but instead Batman Redeemed!",1171584000,2,3212,4.701598579040852

I love Batman as a character as he is NOT super, gamma-ray blasted, a mutant, has not had a nasty encounter with arachnids etc, he's just a guy. The only thing that makes him different from us is his wealth, that aside, he a man. A rich, revenge crazed, power dresser - now that's a place to start a character off at.

The story is very believable and Chris Bale covers the aspect of his tortured psyche very well. Whilst the story does intially seem to be a bit of a slow builder, it does pop along at a decent lick until the time when BATMAN in on screen non-stop for the final reel.

2. Sound transfer  - 8 (1/10)

3. Movie Content  - 8 (1/10)

This was, in my opinion, the best of all of the Batman series. The action was far more believable and the fighting scenes were much more true to life - sloppy and random with pushing and rolling. The scenes and/or locations had a good range from dank and droopy city shots to bright and gorgeous mountain range footage. I rate this movie a solid 8, which to me means I am glad I bought it, but yes there is better. For the price however I would say that this disc is exactly as advertised, a good first HD DVD to own.

PS. Take my advice the only way to win a war is to recieve benefit from both sides victories (ala Switzerland). If you have the money purchase both an HD and a Blu-ray and let them out do each other. If you must purchase one I would go with the Blue-Ray, - much more stable platform(Toshiba dominates the HD DVD market and my experience is that Toshibas are very unstable, regardless of firmware) and anyone who says that one has a way better picture or sound is either lying or is trying to compare apples to oranges(different movies cannot be compared). Also be very carefull when you buy a Blu-ray player, I would wager that all pretty much supply the same quality picture, but alot of companies have extra sound options, such as Dolby True HD or Digital Plus, as well as DTS HD. Now all of these names sound cool but in reality all you need is an uncompressed PCM sound track. I bought a Samsung as compared to a Sony because of the price difference and I'll never care or think twice about some of the sound ""options"" I ""passed on"".",1170633600,3,1649,4.269230769230769

1569040,5,B00005JNJV,"There were and are a few grumblings from critics here and there but ultimately this film garnered near unanimous applause and a huge sigh of relief. Batman Begins is not perfect by any measure but is easily the best Batman movie ever, not that it had serious competition from it's predecessors. The first thing director Christopher Nolan does is say the hell with the neon colors, the over the top comic book sensibility, the freakshow circuses, let's take Batman back to his roots. Strip him of all the tarnish and the villians and the crazy gadgets. Let's go to the core of who he is. Who is Batman? Who is Bruce Wayne? How did Bruce Wayne become Batman? Everyone knows the answers to these questions but we never saw these questions answered vividly before our very eyes on the cinematic screen before Batman Begins. One of the genius strokes of this movie is the fact that Batman is not even shown onscreen for the first hour of the film! Unbelievable! That had to have Warner Brothers executives biting their fingernails incessantly. Will those pesky teenagers in the audience sit still as the story of Batman is allowed to unfold at an unhurried pace? Apparently those pesky teenagers weren't so dumb after all since the film was quite a hit. Hey, even adults liked this movie, two birds with one stone.

Christian Bale is the best actor to inhabit this character, ever. Some may have their nostalgia for Michael Keaton but Keaton was very low-key and let the freakshow villians dominate his movies with their antics. Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman is a marked difference from previous actors, he is involving and fascinating as a character. From the tragedy of his past to the glory of his future, the whole path of this character makes perfect dramatic sense. Michael Caine does his job as Alfred, Liam Neeson is an intelligent villian, Cillian Murphy gets a bit on my nerves, but anyhow, the only person who lets the cast down is Katie Holmes. She's just there to be a pretty face and she's not that pretty! Gary Oldman as Gordan is right on the money. Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson and even Rutger Hauer are terrific supporting characters. Ken Watanabe's short appearance is significant too. That's a lot of name actors!

The script and pacing are terrific, however Batman Begins does have it's faults. Let me list them. There seems to be too many characters and plot points as if Nolan wants to ram a far more epic story into the running time. Then there is the question of the action scenes, Nolan's directing of action is still in it's infancy and there is no action set-piece to take your breath away and go, ""Wow, that's amazing!"". So the action scenes leave something to be desired and the Batmobile looks like [...] to be honest, but it's design makes sense in light of Nolan's more realistic take on the whole Batman mythology. ( The Batmobile still looks very derivative, admit it! ).

Overall, this film was a joy to watch. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen and was very happy to finally be witness to the Batman film we all rightfully deserved. In light of the box-office victory and the critical triumph, this film should not have been called Batman Begins, but instead Batman Redeemed!",1169596800,3,3212,4.701598579040852

The director's dogmatic insistence, ""Make it real...make it real,"" paid off. This telling makes the story of Batman real and believable. Of all the ""hero"" genre films I've ever seen this one is my favorite because of the aforementioned statement. The acting is top notch -- and I'm no fan of Katie Homes and think someone else could have done it better, but alas... -- Michael Caine is a great ""Alfred"" and Lucias Fox's (Morgan Freeman) lines are great. The casting was well done and I am glad they included Rutger Hauer (a personal favorite because of his work in Blade Runner).

But above all, this is the best telling of the Batman story -- even better than in the comics -- and better than other genre films (even the original Chris Reeve ""Superman"" which is a close 2nd).",1169251200,5,824,4.598639455782313

1569044,2,B00005JNJV,"What an overrated flick! Batman, as a movie, has been done to death. I found this version to be pretty boring.

The beginning of this movie, when Bruce Wayne is doing some martial arts training, was pretty interesting. He develops a mentor relationship with the guy that ultimately becomes his foe.

Once he becomes ""Batman"", the movie was pretty boring. While I appreciated the attempt at making the story less campy and more gritty, the concept has been so overdone that I think it is not possible to go any further with the character.

Tim Burton's first Batman was also dark and gritty. Omit the over the top Joker bit and he also made a similar dark, moody Batman.

A problem is that if the premise of the movie was to get away from fantasy and making it more believable, the movie was nontheless... not believable. Especially the ""Sandman"" character. A wormy, wussy, wimpy shrink becomes tough as nails once he has his outfit on? Come on!

Katie Holmes is simply not a big screen actress. She has no charisma, no star power, and I felt that she was a non believable distraction to the film. She's merely a secondary TV actress.

Lastly, I did  not like the ending. It seemed anti-climactic.

This franchise should go in either the direction of making a film purely from the ""Bruce Wayne"" point of view and omit any fantasy aspect or emulate Raimi's ""Spiderman"" or the first X-Men since those films have very effectively captured the magic of the superhero film.

If you compare this to the newest Superman film, while that film was flawed also, at least it employed tremendous special effects, and most importantly, examined Clark Kent's desire for love. It employed a fresh, contemporary attitude.

Batman Begins seemed like a rehash of the Burton movie  with the same formula yet different costumes, actors and film crew.

This was a gallant attempt but I feel that Batman has been exhausted. In the last 20 years there have been too many batman movies.",1169251200,5,1961,4.718475073313783

1569046,5,B00005JNJV,"After the disaster of Batman and Robin in 1997, it took almost nine years to get the nasty, foul taste out of mouths and appreciate the next generation of Batman movies.  Finally, Warner Brothers takes their cash cow seriously and appoints a smart and respectful director, writer and actor to create the newest version of the Dark Knight.

Christopher Nolan, well known for directing intelligent, serious movies [...] turns his attention toward making this movie about Batman's origin.  Thankfully discarded are all the previous Batman movies, despite any good aspects they may have had, this movie says `Forget it all, this is one that matters'.  And it really does.

The movie is efficient in it's story telling, starting somewhere in the mountains of Asia (intercut with flashbacks) where Bruce Wayne (played with great tension by Christian Bale) is in a prison camp, effectively fighting off any attempts to kill him.  He gets locked up to keep the other prisoners from being hurt.  He is visited by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), and offered a chance to learn everything he needs to know to become that which he needs to be; a weapon to avenge his parents who were killed when he was a child.  Wayne accepts and spends more time in a remote location learning the arts of Ninjitsu and stealth.

Upon his return to Gotham City, the movie starts to focus on how Bruce plans to be the Batman.  It's a painstaking process, and extremely believable.  Luckily he has the resources through his Father's Enterprise and turn-a-blind-eye science executive Lucius Fox (well played by Morgan Freeman) and the faithful butler Alfred (the always welcome Michael Caine) to help.  As the current CEO of Wayne Enterprises Earle (Rutger Hauer) continues to make unwanted to changes, Bruce slowly finds ways to create the personality he wants to instill fear into the scum of Gotham, believing the city can be saved from it's downfall into debauchery.  With his childhood sweetheart (Katie Holmes) trying to figure him out, a madman Psychologist (Cillian Murphy) sending criminals to Arkham Asylum for seemingly no reason, the new vigilante finds himself bonding with James Gordon (underplayed brilliantly by Gary Oldman), one good cop surrounded by many corrupt ones, and getting more out of the relationship than he ever thought he would.  Thankfully they are giving this relationship it's proper attention that was lost in the other movies.

As you can see, the casting of this movie is brilliant.  You may not know who Christian Bale is, but Michael Caine?  Gary Oldman?  Morgan Feeman?  Rutger Hauer?  Liam Neeson?  Katie Holmes?  If you don't know who any of these people are, you shouldn't be going to the movies.  Front and center is semi new comer Christian Bale playing the part of Bruce Wayne and Batman so well.  When in the costume, he's intimidating and frightening.  When playing Bruce Wayne, he's a pompus, arrogant playboy, although that does not come about right away.  The genius of this movie stands in the discovery; as Bruce Wayne finds the difficulties in being a masked crusader in a huge city, he has to find solutions to those problems.  The realism that goes into the creation of this dark obsessed person focusing his energy on becoming an outrageous character that preys on the criminal element is sublime and spot on.  This movie far outreaches it's predecessors in ambition and makes them look like kindergarten efforts compared with the PhD level of intelligence put into this film.",1168905600,2,3496,4.970740103270224

1569092,5,B00005JNJV,"As a fan of the Batman character, one of the strong points of the Batman persona is how realistic it is, or at least how realistic it could be. I once read a quote stating that, 'Superman is the American dream, Batman is the American reality.' How true. There is nothing fantasy-related like Spiderman, Superman, etc. in this film. Bruce Wayne and the characters he encounters exist in the world we live in; thus, Batman exists as though he were real. For those who aren't aware, Batman is not a ""super"" hero in the true sense of ""super heroes"" because he is simply a man, or as director Christopher Nolan aptly put it, ""He makes himself extraordinary through force of will."" Batman Begins is not only the best Batman film ever made, but as a longtime fan of the comic books, I am convinced it is the greatest Batman story ever told.

 One of the great elements of this film is its great character arc. Whereas in the previous 4 Batman films, Alfred was more a minor point in the story: an old man in a tuxedo who served as Bruce Wayne's butler, in Batman Begins, the Alfred character is given much more depth as not only the connection between Thomas Wayne and his son, Bruce, but also a friend and a father figure. Likewise with Commissioner Gordon. In the previous films, he has spoken but a few lines and we are not given any background into his character (for that matter, the previous four films did not give much background into Bruce Wayne/Batman's character, either). Here, we see James Gordon prior to being a police commissioner and we understand his motivations as the one good cop in a deteriorating city. Also, the love interest in Batman Begins, unlike the previous four films, is no damsel in distress. She is an assistant district attorney and a childhood friend of Bruce's who is more than capable of taking care of herself. Every character in Batman Begins has a purpose- it is really very well written.

 Most importantly, we see a very realistic and plausable explanation on the formation of the Batman persona: motivations, mistakes, and challenges ahead. Whereas Batman served as somewhat of a talk-show host in the previous 4 films, inviting more celebrated villains to take center-stage, Batman Begins is a film about the tragedy, loss, and re-invention of Bruce Wayne and his one man war on crime.

 This film is truly a modern-day classic. It is dark, psychological, haunting, beautiful, well-written, well-thoughtout, and well-acted. I have heard people complain about the action sequences with Batman being shot too tight, but there is an explanation for this as well. In the comics, Batman is somewhat of an urban legend- not many people have seen him, though those that have said his speed in combat was blindingly fast. Therefore, Christopher Nolan shot his action scenes as though those who encounter the Batman don't know what hit them.

 Upon watching Batman Begins, one can see that the four previous Batman films (they got progressively worse in my opinion, though the first 3 can be described as good)not only have not aged well, but really missed the forest for the trees in terms of story-telling. They spent too much time developing over-the-top villains and their backgrounds while failing to develop Batman or Bruce Wayne as a character. They also failed to stay true to the comics in a number of instances: in the first Batman, the Joker was killed off in the end. In the second Batman, the Penguin was made to be a gross, black-spewing monster. In the third and fourth films, Batman had nipples on the Batsuit.

 The ""new"" Batman franchise, directed by Christopher Nolan, will be a trilogy, with the next film, The Dark Knight, to be released in July 2008. It will include Heath Ledger as the Joker in what will prove to be a very different (read: not funny like Jack Nicholson's portrayal) depiction of the character. If the Dark Knight is even in the ballpark of Batman Begins, we're in for another treat.",1168387200,3,3952,4.747813411078718

1569095,2,B00005JNJV,"I really wanted to be awed by this movie after reading the rave reviews. Finally, a great Batman movie, but it was not to be.

I found the plotting predictable and formulaic.

Aside from the always wonderful Michael Caine, the acting is lackluster. I love Gary Oldman but he was given little to work with.  Bale's portrayal was stiff and forced and the overly-fake dark, tough-guy voicing was unintentionally funny.

If fear is a central tenet of the movie and the character, the movie did little to evoke that emotion.

The scenes early in the film with Liam Neeson reminded me so much of the old Kung Fu TV series, I half expected Neeson to refer to Bale as ""grasshopper"".

Aside from some interesting outdoor mountain footage, the cinematography is not particularly exciting. Whereas movies like Dark City and Sin City broke new ground with their distinctive looks, Batman Begins' Gotham City doesn't have any distinguishing characteristic beyond that really cool overhead train.  There is nothing particularly dark and ominous.  For a city that's supposed to be like a modern day Sodom, it looked better than most American cities.

If you are a fan of the comic, you'll probably love the film as it is much more true to the spirit of the series than the silly ""sequels"".

1569096,2,B00005JNJV,"This movie is a futuristic Bat-Man, unlike the original, which took place in a 1930s big city. Gotham is futuristic and Batman's new gizmos are also, including the new Batmobile, which I thought was the biggest flop. The original Batmobile at least looked somewhat good, this one is some sort of an army ""tank"" vehicle that looks like a kid's radio toy -- bulky, with huge wheels and plain ugly. The first half of this film is visually pleasing, as Christopher Nolan no doubt can do (the opening scenes of a Tibetan-like snowy landscape is stunning). But then the novelty wears off and the second half is boring due to endless explosions, fires, fighting, and typical action sequences, where the camera moves so fast, you can't even see what's going on. This movie turned out to be one of the usual Hollywood action-packed films that constantly throw one-second action footage in your face, decreasing still further your attention span. I fast forwarded the end of the movie. It was interesting to see Katie Holmes on screen, but I though she was the weakest character -- she was too cutesy for her role as a serious DA prosecutor. Give me a break. With her big brown eyes, she looks like she wouldn't hurt a fly and she is in a role trying to send criminals to prisons. The themes presented in this movie are not original at all -- the idea of whether sacrificing some people for the benefit of all is morally justified, about who you are on the inside vs the outside, and the eastern philosophy of mastering yourself. Just some good old ideas which are given one more round in this movie. When is there going to be a worthwhile movie that will make you think for yourself?",1167696000,3,1674,4.583333333333333
1569097,4,B00005JNJV,"I thought that this was a very good adaptation of Batman. It is definitely the best of the ones that have been done. The cast was excellent and Christian Bale does and outstanding job. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson are all solid as usual. The only glaring weekness in the cast is Katie (oops sorry Tom! I meant KATE) Holmes. She is totally miscast and like in Thank You For Smoking I believe she got the part because of her relationship with the ambiguous sudo husband Tom Cruise because she is not a great or good actress and she certainly is not attractive enough to be playing the fem fatale or sexy leading lady. But enough of the bashing of TomCAT. One of the reasons I like this movie is that it started out digging deap into the character and how he became Batman without waisting too much time rehashing the whole story of when he was a kid that we saw in the Michael Keaton Batman. This tells of the teenage Bruce Wayne and how he learns his fighting skills. Also, you have the whole development of the character and all his weapons and gear. The Batmobile just plain ROCKS! Like other Batman movies they seem to think you  can't just have one villiam so you get The Scarecrow who was good and plaid by a really creepy guy that was in the movei about the really creepy guy on the airplane. And Ra Sa Ghul who is done just perfectly. But why they can't just have one villian in these movies just amazes me.

If you have to go out and spend $1500 on a good HDTV and $1000 for a HD DVD player (or Blu-Ray for other titles), my answer is ""no.""  In all other cases (you already have some of the pieces e.g. HDTV, Xbox 360 + HD DVD) then assuradely ""yes!""

There are several scenes that are just jaw-dropping, including my favorite scene in Gotham near the end (no spoilers here).  The quality is as good as others have hyped, both for the Title and for the format.

But in the stunning high definition I felt Gotham was a city I've been to, its details were so sharp, but without losing the darkness and moodiness the movie needs.

My only complaint with this, and the other HD titles I've purchased so far, is this..

Where are all of the fantastic extras we were promised?  Part of the technology is the storage capabilities, so they should be able to just pack these discs with hours and hours of HD extras.  High tech extras that have more interaction with the disc.

In some cases with the HD movies I've purchased so far, there aren't even as many extras on them as the DVD versions of the film, much less more.

I know they're trying to build this new technology and get some momentum, so why not take advantage of all the new technology has to offer and stuff these things with extras, the very types of things that DVD enthusiasts already enjoy?

Great movie and I recommend the technology to everyone, just hoping that they start making something bigger and better out of these discs than just a higher resolution and sound.",1165104000,6,1386,4.526104417670683
1569151,4,B00005JNJV,"I had done a review on this some time ago and I must admit I'm ashamed to say I gave this film a really bad review. I actually fell asleep the first time watching this movie. I was with friends and we had a few drinks and we were not expecting such a deep film. So with that in mind we were all waiting for this film to get going. I decided I needed to give this film another chance and I would watch it in my home theater(which was not built the first time I watched this movie).

This film is a comic book geeks dream come true. There is so much attention to detail in this movie that it takes an hour before we see The Batman. I am sure this is what put some people off who didn't like this film, but I found myself engrossed in this man's personal journey. To be fair to mainstream movie goers, I was a big comic book reader in my youth and I still love super hero films and collectables to this day, so this film might be a tad bit tedious and dark for a person who really isn't into comic book heroes.

1569154,1,B00005JNJV,"To me, Michael Keaton will always be Batman, even though he is reluctant to accept it. Just as Christopher Reeve will always be Superman. I felt this movie was wrong on so many levels.
1. The fight scene-For a guy who's suppose to know like 50 kinds of Martial Arts, Batman/Christian Bale certainly didn't display it.
2. Lucius Fox-I'm confused here. While Lucius Fox is a quintissential character and some sort of master inventor, how could he be so stupid as not to know Bruce Wayne and Batman are the same person? Also, it seems he was more like Q in the James Bond movies, where as he's basically a Financial Wizard at Wayne Enterprises. Plus, doesn't Batman build his own stuff anyway? Not showing much intelligence for the world's greatest detective.
3. The Vaporizer-The big one on everybody's list. If a machine could vaporize water, wouldn't people be dying right and left anyway?
4. Scarecrow's costume-What a waste. Scarecrow is one of my favorite villians. Why'd they have to ruin him by making him a second hand villian like ""Firefly"" or ""Killer Croc"" or ""The Mad Hatter""? His costume reminded me of the old CESAR ROMERO JOKER, same concept. Throw on some makeup over a moustache, and boom, instant cheesy supervillian. Only in Scarecrow's case, it's a mask and straightjacket.
5. Repetitious line-""It's not the Fear I fear, it's the fear of not being feared"". How can you have so many different conversations about the same thing? Every 10 minutes, someone was talking about FEAR. ""Fear this"" and ""Fear that."" O.K. I get it, Criminals are a Cowardly, Superstitious Lot and in order to fight crime, I need a scary costume.
6. The Batmobile-Enough said.
  There's my review. Yes, out of the 1% of raving, lunatic fans I hated this movie. For those of you, blinded by all the hype and thought this movie was the greatest thing since, I don't know, ""The Janet Jackson incident."" I await your criticisms.

First, the picture quality. There is NEVER any blockiness that you sometimes see in fast-motion HDTV broadcasts. The colors are perfect. The blacks are pure black. When not in the dark, the colors are rich and full.

The movie features lossless Dolby TrueHD. Even if you have the XBox 360 HD-DVD drive, you'll notice an improvement in sound. The sound is clearer and has more definition. It is hard to describe, but the sound is just better.

1569157,5,B00005JNJV,"All the press releases to the first Batman by Burton alluded to how different the character would be older, darker, at conflict with continuing role as a crime fighter. What we got was a semblance attempt by Michael Keaton, brow furrowed thru most of the film, to deal with his dual identity which came off shallow and unconvincing and of course being outclassed by Nichcolsons Joker didn't help either.

Well finally Christian Bale, working with an excellent script brings us the darkside of Batman and what makes him tick. This movie makes great effort to unfold his story, not rushing thru his metamorphises from Bruce Wayne to the Batman and allows us to follow a delightfull, errr, reimaging of how he got his clothes, weapons and Batmobile and how he had to strive to better what he got to suit his purposes.

  Gary Oldman, that wonderfull chameleonish actor now puts on the threads of Jim Gordon, before he became commisioner and he does a fantastic job of  making choices between what Batman might be, just another thug jockeying for position in gotham by eliminating the Falconi mob and what he really is, someone who wants to help.

  Michael Caine as Alfred? I won't insult this genius by trying to say  anything, positive though it may be, about a role he was born to play.

  Liam Neeson, I didn't feel for his character, I never thought he played the philosopher warrior well anywhere. Neither as Qui Jon the Jedi nor as the man who tries to induct Bruce into the league of shadows.  It all sounds like he was reading directly fromt he script in monotone.",1164326400,,1570,4.665454545454545

1569211,5,B00005JNJV,"I purchased an HD-DVD player with this title in mind and it doesnt disappoint. This is by far one of the very best HD-DVD's on the market to date and even tho the brand is somewhat new, that is still saying something as there are a bunch of beautiful releases already. This is without a doubt a reference quality disc both in terms of the picture, Audio and in terms of extras and what the HD format can do that regular DVD's cant.

First the picture and what a picture it is. It is a flawless transfer with absolutly stunning detail. The amount of grain is perfect with no noticable noise & no edge enhancment was visable throught the entire film. The skin tones are beautiful and the colors accurate. One of the most impressive aspects of the picture is the rendition of the color black. Black levels are perfect with plenty of detail seen in the shadows. The scene where he is spraypainting his batsuit with the black spraypaint has to be seen to be believed. I don't think I have ever seen the color black presented so perfectly in a home movie before and there are alot of dark scenes in this film so that is one of the reasons why this transfer is so beautiful. There isn't a single thing I would change with the picture. My hats off to the people that were in charge of this transfer, its one of the best I have ever seen.

As for the audio, the Dolby Digital Plus track is amazing but the TrueHD track is where this baby really takes off. if you own the Toshiba A1 you need to update to the 2.0 firmware udate to be able to use the TreHD and its everybit worth updating. The Batman begins soundtrack is an awsome one in general, very heavy in bass it just a wonderful mix that adds an extra oopmh to the action scenes like any good soundtrack should. On the TrueHD track it sounded simply stunning. Dialogue was easily heard without sacrificing any of the other sounds and effects. Overall its the best TrueHD track so far and that again is saying something as Training Day had an awsome TrueHD track, it just couldn't beat out the power this soundtrack had.

As for the extras, were presented with all of the extras from the 2 disc special edition plus the HD-DVD exclusive IME track (In-Movie Experience). There were some people who complained that this IME track wasn't as good as some of the others because some of the pauses between speakers were fairly long. I have to 100% disagree with this. When people on the IME track are speaking non stop and the IME track runs non stop you are never really given a chance to get into the movie as all of your attention is focused on the IME screen. With Batman Begins they made it so the IME track was active during the less important and less exciting scenes and inactive during the exciting and important scenes. What this did was allow you to actually get involved with the movie while at the same time get information from the IME track during the more boring and less important parts of the movie. They absolutly did this on purpose and you can tell alot of thought went into when the IME should be active and when it shouldnt. In the end it was unlike anything I have ever experinced before with a commentary track and when the movie was over I had felt like I had not only just seen the IME track but I had also watched the movie. It was awsome and really has me sold on IME. I thought that IME might be kind of gimmicky when Ifirst got into HD-DVD but it couldn't be farther from the truth. IME is the future of commentary tracks and there really is no comparison between IME and the old style of commentary.

So to sum this up, Batmen Begins is a must buy if you own a HD-DVD player. Its one of the best super hero movies ever made and this HD-DVD transfer is the best it has ever looked. Put a big dose of amazing sound and a big dose of IME on top of that and you have what is arguably the best release so far for HD-DVD.

Its releases like this that make me happy I got into HD-DVD right off the bat without worrying about the damned format war. as long as HD-DVD keeps performing at this level, I will be an HD-DVD supporter till the end.

1569212,4,B00005JNJV,"This is Batman in contemporary turn of the 21st century, not the Batman serial of the 1930s, the campy (but charming) Batman TV show of the 1960s or the more recent Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher abominations that can't be placed in any specific time setting.  You will not see Tim Burton's Halloweenesque macabre eccentricities or Joel Schumacher mindlessly colourful spectacles.  What you will see are Christopher Nolan's psychological (and if somewhat ponderous) analyses into the nature of guilt and fear.  Nolan's Batman is Batman for mature people who want to see a humanized Batman suffering from guilt and fear and venting anger and fear against a corrupt Gotham City.  This movie is really about Bruce Wayne as much as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies are really about Peter Parker.  By focusing on the emotional man behind the costume rather the cold costume and lifeless gadgets, Nolan has made a realistic superhero film whereas Tim Burton (who has his cult following) merely redid his Halloweenesque ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" films with a bat costume.  Whereas Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne is a cold and distant robot with a small body frame, Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is way better by bringing more physical stature and bringing more drama with his emotional suffering.  Like the much-lauded Spider-Man and X-Men films, the pain is psychological, the conflict is internal, and display of physical violence is not the point.  Yet, I take 1 star off because Katie Holmes is the movie's weak link and because Michael Cain's Alfred is a bit too proletarian compared to Michael Gough's Alfred.  Further, why does a villian with an Arabic name speak Japanese in a Himalayan fortress and why do we have to see another runaway train scene after one was already done in Spider-Man 2?",1162166400,2,1802,5.0608108108108105

I wasn't that big of a fan of Ra's Al Ghoul before this movie, but he was the best villain for it. Cillian Murphey was also the perfect choice for Scarecrow. Overall, everyone was right for who they portrayed in the movie.

When I heard that Christopher Nolan was making this, I had hopes that it would be a quality film. I was equally intriqued when they cast Christian Bale. They understood that an actor has to be convincing as Bruce Wayne AND Batman, and Bale is an inspired choice. I read that they wanted to make a great, timeless adventure movie (as in Star Wars, the original, and Indiana Jones) with this, and they have. You have lots of great stuff going on here, archetypal characters such as Liam Niesan's Obe Wan Kinobe-type teacher character. They also finally get Batman's origin correct, and no, the Joker didn't kill Bruce's parents, as in the original film. The scene where Lt. Gordon is comforting a young Bruce after his parent's murder is really emotionally charged. Great casting, great attention to details all around. This isn't someone's interpretation of the source material, this IS the source material, collectively on film, and it even enhances the source material (as there is no one true definitive ORIGIN story for Batman because DC Comics rejiggers their continuity all the time).

Also, we finally get to see The Scarecrow, one of my favorite villians, on screen for the very first time in live action. And luckily the filmmakers understood that he should actually be scary, and not silly looking, as his schtick is fear.

Really, this is what Batman is supposed to be. Not a bunch of gadgets, neon, camp, and silliness. This is more believable. I really hope that they can keep up this momentum for the next film, The Dark Knight.",1160870400,7,1818,4.743670886075949
1569268,5,B00005JNJV,"At last, there is a film worthy of DC Comics' second great superhero.  When Tim Burton's 1989 film came out, I was very impressed, and enjoyed the film immensely (even if I never was completely sold on Michael Keaton as Batman).  I remember leaving the theater thinking it was a really good film, but disappointed that it didn't prove to be as stirring as ""Superman: the Movie"" had been in 1978.  It's interesting how the passage of the years, and the appearance of numerous other superhero pictures, has affected my perception of both films.  Even if the special effects are a little dated, Richard Donner's Superman film remains a powerful, thrilling, entertaining movie, and is still the definitive movie treatment of the character.  Burton's Batman, however, has not aged so well.  In fact, after recently watching my old VHS copy of Burton's movie, I wonder what I ever really saw in it.  The gothic/art deco Gotham seen in the film is a visual feast, but comes off seeming a bit too much.  Keaton is physically just all wrong for the part, and while he acts the part of Batman well enough, his Bruce Wayne seems like a clueless, socially inept geek, not a billionaire playboy.  Most of the supporting characters (Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, et al.) are unmemorable.  And finally, the focus seems to be more on the villian (the Joker) than on the title character (indeed, this was a problem with all the four films in this series).  When I recently re-watched Burton's take on the character, I found the Batman looking inexcusably hokey in his first onscreen appearance, a rooftop fight with a couple of muggers.  He doesn't look scary at all, and when he walks toward the muggers ""flapping"" his cape downward once like wings, it looks so ridiculous that you just can't buy the reaction of one of the crooks a few moments later when he wails: ""what are you?""  You just can't believe a hardened thug would be so frightened of what is obviously just a guy in a weird-looking rubber suit.

Fortunately for Batman fans, Christopher Nolan does it much, much better.  He clearly took a page from Donner's book, making this an origin story that doesn't give us a look at the character in his superhero guise until halfway into the picture.  And like the 1978 Superman movie, the story of the character's journey is told so well you don't mind waiting that long.  Moreover, when the hero does appear, the wait is well worth it.  This Batman, unlike Burton's/Keaton's, is actually scary and menacing.  He stays in the shadows, taking out criminals without ever giving them a good look at him.  Christian Bale is far better for role physically than Keaton was, and makes a much more imposing figure.  Not only does Bale make a better Batman, he makes a superior Bruce Wayne.  He portrays the real Bruce Wayne in his scenes with Alfred and Rachel, and the Bertie Wooster playboy Wayne becomes for the public, making him far more true to the comic book character, and also giving him far more depth than Keaton's maladjusted geek, or Val Kilmer's angst-ridden nice guy (I won't even go into George Clooney's attempt to put a stake through the heart of the character).  The supporting characters are much more interesting than in Burton's film, as well.  I was leery of a cockney Alfred, but Michael Caine does an outstanding job, and you can really see how Bruce Wayne would see him as a father figure, not just as the hired help.  Gary Oldman is superb as Commissioner-to-be Gordon (he's just a sergeant here).  And Morgan Freeman is great as Lucius Fox.  Katie Holmes is the only weak link in the cast, but she's not so bad as to hurt the film.  I really hope they can follow this movie up with sequels that are worthy of it.  Bad sequels killed Christopher Reeve's Superman franchise, and Batman was already sliding downhill when Joel Schumacher made his 1997 abortion with George Clooney - film so staggeringly bad it might easily have put an end to Batman on film for all time.  Fortunately, Christopher Nolan rescued a great and enduring character from the hands of those who almost destroyed him.  For that he is to be congratulated.",1160870400,5,4134,4.707927677329624

  SUMMARY:

  ""BATMAN BEGINS"" is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. Concieved in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's orginal comic book owes its

power and pleasures to Christopher Nolan, a director who takes his material seriously, and to Christian Bale, a star who shoulders that seriousness with ease. What Nolan understands better than any other previous director that without Bruce Wayne, Batman is just a rich wacko with illusions of grandeur and a terrific pair of support hose. Without his suave alter ego, this weird bat man is a superhero without humanity, an avenger without a conscience, an id without a superego. Which is why, working from his and David S. Goyer's very fine screenplay, Nolan more or less begins at the beginning, taking Batman back to his original trauma and death of his parents. It's amazing what an excellent cast, a solid screenplay, and a regard for the source material can do for a comic book movie.",1160870400,,1588,5.445378151260504
1569270,5,B00005JNJV,"After years of believing 1989's Batman with Michael Keaton was the best Batman movie out of the four Burton/Schumacher films, there is now a clear cut winner, and those four do not make the final cut.  Not even close.

Batman Begins is the movie fans of the franchise have been waiting for.  It is dark, exciting, and gives a real feel to the man behind the mask, Bruce Wayne, as well as Gotham City overall.  The best thing about this movie is its plot and its acting.  Christian Bale is great as the Dark Knight (which will be the title of the 2008 sequel), Liam Neeson is a cruel villain as he should be, and Michael Caine is fantastic as Wayne's  witty and supportive butler, Alfred.

This movie captures what the previous films of the Burton/Schumacher films failed to capture, and that is Batman's hard fight for justice in Gotham, no matter what the cost.  In addition, this film is basic with regard to Batman's gadgets (batmobile, grappling gun, cape etc.) and makes Batman's character believable.  Some may say that the Batmobile jumping off roof tops was farfetched, but that's how it was in the comics.

Overall, Batman Begins was a great movie and brought credibility back to a franchise that had absolutely none thanks to Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman's disastrous ""Batman & Robin"".  The movie reminded me very much of the Fox Kids animated series that aired in the early to mid '90's, which was an excellent series and really not meant for kids under the age of 10.  Many adults even argued that it was for them.

Bottom Line: Great movie.  Buy the 2-disc Deluxe Edition DVD.  Has lots of features and commentaries about the movie.  Very cool stuff.",1160784000,4,1669,4.664383561643835

1569272,4,B00005JNJV,"Being a longtime fan of the Batman comics, I have definite ideas about what a Batman movie should be.  I am pleased to report that Batman Begins is pretty close to my definition of a good Batman movie - it's certainly the first incarnation of a live-action Batman that I would recommend to friends.  The story - millionaire heir Bruce Wayne witnesses his parents deaths at the hands of a mugger.  He ends up wandering the world looking for a purpose and comes across the formidable and enigmatic Ra's al Ghul, head of a centuries-old organisation dedicated to cleaning up corruption and decadance (they claim to have caused the sack of Rome, for example).  He trains in a variety of martial arts, returning to Gotham City (a fictional city ""between NYC and NJ"") to start his life of crimefighting.  His first target - mob kingpin Carmine Falcone.  His second mission - to save Gotham from Ra's's mad plan to raze the city as an example to the world.

To a true Batman fan, the plot is not so important as the execution.  Luckily the designers of the Batsuit understood that Batman is not a tank that plods through badguys, but a stealth fighter than surgically picks off baddies one-by-one, maximising fear by remaining undetectable.  By the same token, this Batsuit is flexible enough that Bale can use martial arts moves and not look awkward, unlike his film predecessors.  Similarly, the new Batmobile is a Humvee-like military vehicle that can obviously take the damage thrown at it (as opposed to a suped-up Corvette).

Also of vital importance to a Batman story is the incorporation of his origin and the surrounding minor characters.  Just as the recent Spider-man films incorporated a large cast of supporting characters and pinned his personality on his origin story, so too does this Batman film.  This gives it a richness and depth that is vital to its believability (if such a thing is even possible for a superhero film!).  I was especially pleased to see the big-screen debut of Lt. Gordon's corrupt and bullying partner, Det. Flass.  Similarly, Gordon himself, Alfred, Ra's, Scarecrow (Jonathan Crane), etc. are all used to good effect here.

Unfortunately, there are some nitpicking problems with the film.  For starters, where did this character of Rachel (played by Katie Holmes) come from?  There is a perfectly good D.A. in the Batman mythos (Harvey Dent), why invent a new one?  Similarly, if a female character was needed to be endangered, why not Vicki Vale?  Surely an investigative reporter can get into as much trouble with a crime lord as a D.A. could.  Another missing character is Ra's's daughter Talia.  Finally, (SPOILER ALERT!!) Batman fans will be very upset that his greatest nemesis (except possibly the Joker) dies at the end of the film.  Fans of the comic know that Ra's is immortal - perhaps Talia will drag his body back to a Lazarus Pit and revive him?  Will we actually see Liam Neeson again?

The biggest complaint I have, though, is the balance between the action and the detective work.  To me, Batman is sort of a cross between Bruce Lee and Sherlock Holmes.  This film has gone entirely to the Bruce Lee side and left out the Sherlock Holmes.  Granted, a young and impetuous Batman would probably prefer busting heads to careful CSI-like forensic investigation.  I only hope that the overseers at Warner Bros. don't fall into the trap of making an unending series of action films, which would quickly get boring.  The detective work, if well done, would be a welcome and necessary aspect of maintaining interest in the franchise.

This Special Edition set is most interesting due to the inclusion of the comic book.  It contains a few stories from different eras of the Batman comics, to give the reader an overview of the evolution of the comic and character.  The DVD extras themselves are pretty standard and only mildly interesting.  They include featurettes on the new Batmobile, the development of the Batsuit, etc.",1160438400,4,3968,4.846953937592867

1569334,5,B00005JNJV,"Personally, I would easily choose to re-allot the hours of my lifetime spent watching previous ""Batman . . ."" films to sitting at red lights, standing in elevators, and waiting in line at the post office.  They never, ever tell the story as it originated, instead choosing to do remakes of the television show--only not as good--with a slight edge on them.  The more recent Batman cartoons have been rather good, and that only added to the mystery as to why an even decent Hollywood film couldn't tell the story half as well despite their many attempts with big budgets and great actors.

Until now.

This movie actually enhances the original story of Batman, filling in many of the holes--like how in the hell you get the Batcave built without letting anyone know about it or killing all the builders, and manufacture all sorts of specialty armaments with the knowledge and skills of a pampered billionaire and an English butler.

Batman is about doing the wrong thing for the right reasons; and an inner struggle to resolve regret and remorse with a genuine and righteous vengence.  It amazes me that a cartoon artist thought up even the basic elements of this story--and perhaps even more so that it was handed off to several other storytellers who couldn't manage even its initial syllables.

This is the Batman movie you were always hoping they would make.  It would probably have been a much bigger hit if it weren't preceded by such bad versions of the same story.

They don't overplay Morgan Freeman, get campy with Alfred, or have people falling into vats of radioactive waste and raising armies of crime syndicate costumed flunkies overnight and in record numbers.  The story--the epically dramatic, non-cartoon version--is the star here, and its excellently told without getting overshadowed by big name movie stars.

Bottom Line: I'm thrilled I finally saw this film despite my hard belief I would be horribly disappointed.",1158537600,5,1935,4.923076923076923

1569337,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins reivents and restarts the Batman movie franchise with an excellent story concerning Batman's origins and how he came to be.

Bruce Wayne's journey to becoming Batman starts in Tibet where he meets a man named Henry Duccard.  Henry offers him a purpose and Bruce trains with the League of Shadows only to discover their pursuit of ""True Justice"" clashes with his beliefs.  Saving his mentor's life, Bruce returns to Gotham.  There, he gathers the tools needed to take his war on crime to the streets.

As Batman, Bruce stands up to Gotham's notorious mob boss, Carmine Falcone, leading him to discover a plot to destroy the city...

Excellent acting, Christain Bale IS Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Completely believeable and very real.  Batman is placed in a world where he can exist, without making the audiece feel like they're watching a fantasy movie.

Katie Holmes is good as Bruce's childhood frined Rachel Dawes.  I've never udnerstod why fans disliked her.  She wasn't in the oomics, and for creating a character from scratch, David S. Goyer did an excellent job.

Michael Cane, Alfred Pennyworth, a wonderful performance, with the charm and witty humor that is perfectly associated with Alfred Pennyworth, love watching him.

Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox is just plain and simply put, spankin' awesome.  His role as Lucius is perfect, they couldn't have cat anyone better than him for the role.

All in all, a wonderful Batman movie, the story's top notch.  The cinematography is fantastic, the action sequences will blow you away.  All fans of Batman who were bitterly disappointed with Batman and Robin, you have been vindicated with a movie worth of the title ""Batman Begins"".

About the Extras:

The second disc contains documentaries regarding the origins of Batman, the making of the movie, the comic books and how they made the Tumbler for the movie.  If you're a sucker for special features, wich I am, you'll love this disc.

1569338,5,B00005JNJV,"First, a recap - after the success of the 1978 Superman film, Warner Brothers was eager to bring another DC Comic book character to the big screen, so naturally, they turned their eyes to the only other DC character who could rival/match Superman for pop culture icon status, Batman (although Wonder Woman is in third place). For ten long, seemingly fruitless years, Warner Brothers and DC struggled to bring Batman to the big screen in hopes that the Dark Knight could have back-to-back success with his big brother the Man of Steel (at the same time, sadly, Superman's film franchise went into a slow, steady decline), with various writers, directors and actors coming, going, jumping on, jumping off, jumping back on, jumping back off again, etc. But then Tim Burton, then a new visionary talent on the rise, came along with just enough familiarity with Batman and just enough strength of will and vision to make it happen, and with the backing of the success of ""Beetle-Juice"", Warners Brothers were just crazy enough to let Tim have a go at it, even if it meant hiring the seemingly less than ideal but in the end very effective Michael Keaton to play the title character. Then in the summer of 1989, with Superman's never ending battle for truth, justice and the American way having died on the big screen, Batman stepped in to fill the void, and a phenomenon of epic proportions so rarely seen before or since was born. Then came 1992's ""Batman Returns"", which was also a mega-hit but inspired a backlash from parents who found the film to be too dark and mean-spirited for their kids (parents reportedly had to drag crying children out of the theater that summer). In response to this and speculation that Batman couldn't hold the fort, Burton was politely asked to step aside and his friend Joel Schumacher came on board with a new Batman, Val Kilmer, stepping in for an MIA Keaton, with the flashier, more light-hearted ""Batman Forever"", which was also a hit despite taking a great deal of flack over stuff like rubber nipples on the bat suit. But then everything came falling down with ""Batman & Robin"", which many complained was too campy while the 2nd film had been too dark, and which featured another new Batman, George Clooney, playing the Dark Knight as a light-hearted scamp (Kilmer at least tried to capture the essence of Batman) in a film that proved to be too much of everything - too garishly bright, too over the top in spectacle, too overly produced and over-exposed it forced the WB to give Batman a time out, leaving Joel Schumacher with a long and bitter battle on his hands as he fought to rebuild his reputation as an actually good director while Clooney went on to bigger, better things.

But Warner Brothers wasn't quite done with Batman just yet. After all, he's one of the great iconic comic book characters alongside the X-Men, Spider-Man and of course, big brother Superman. And once again the WB and DC struggled to get the movie Batman back on his feet, but it would require slimming/trimming/toning it down and going back to basics. Once again, writers, directors, and actors came and went in the seven years between now and then, but finally things came together with director Christopher Nolan, writer David S. Goyer and star Christian Bale. But how to make it fresh, appealing, new, not simply a rehash of the previous films but still undeniably Batman? By going back to the beginning, delving into what the earlier films only hinted at or lightly touched upon, so much so to the point that in the beginning it doesn't even feel like a Batman film.

The result is the familiar but well told origin story of how Bruce Wayne lost his wealthy and warm-hearted parents to a random mugger, Joe Chill, but still in connection with criminal kingpin Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). Years later the conflicted, spiritually lost adult Bruce (Bale), torn between a genuine desire for justice and his thirsting for revenge, embarks on a journey unto which he confronts his deepest fears, trains and hardens himself to his very limits and then, coming back to Gotham City to become symbolic avenger of injustice, the Batman, aided by loyal man-servant/surrogate father figure Alfred (well played by Michael Caine). Additionally, Batman must fight not only Falcone but the Scarecrow/Dr. Jon Crane (a lightweight Cillian Murphy), and Ra's Ah Guhl (played by Ken Watanabe and Liam Neeson, the latter in a rare villainous/anti-hero role that he plays very well), and he must reclaim his father's company from the unscrupulous Rutger Hauer with help from Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox, make an alliance with Gary Oldman's Sgt/Lt./eventually Commissioner Jim Gordon, and rescue his foxy/sexy childhood friend turned lawyer brunette Rachael Dawes (Katie Holmes at the beginning of the Tom Cruise fiasco).

Batman/Bruce Wayne is well played by Christian Bale. At times reusing his ""American Psycho"" performance, Bale hits a few flat notes but on the whole he's the best new Batman anyone could hope for: 6-feet tall, good looking, muscular, and actually possessing good solid acting ability, here's hoping they don't lose him.",1156636800,2,5141,4.893348623853211

1569411,4,B00005JNJV,"Well - you could label me a little biased - seeing how I am a die-hard Batman fan; however here's what I think of the movie...

1 - The original movie, is, no-doubt, as people dub it - 'the definitive Batman film', and a masterpiece, and without any second thoughts - thee BEST movie of 2005, speaking of ALL movies of 2005. It's story can touch anyone, since it's an origin film, and people don't need to know a thing about Batman, and still discover him in this movie.

2 - The deluxe edition - yeah, there are loads of special features, which I watched all in two to three days; and it's all interesting, amusing (in some cases), and worthwhile. The reason I dock a star off, is because I wish they had more cast interviews about the story, they often talked about stunts in the movie, talking with the Director, but you never really hear all that much what they think of their character, or how they tried to ""tap into"" an already previous made character...

3 - Another reason for docking a star, is because there's no commentary; I don't listen to commentaries that much, but seeing how Batman Begins is my ""NEW FAVORITE MOVIE"", I'd like to hear at least Christopher Nolan's (and perhaps David S. Goyer - a screenwriter, and Christian Bale, or another actor) comments on scene to scene...

However, Batman Begins is worth the buy - if you aren't as die hard as a fan I am, at least just buy the standard, trimmed DVD with the movie...

1569413,3,B00005JNJV,"I came to this movie expecting to be blown away. I was. By the dreadful editing which made the action sequences totally unwatchable. The Matrix set new standards for action movies and what is to be expected of stars - gone are the days of a stuntman jumping in just to open an envelope in case the star gets a paper cut - now they can expect to spend months training to pull off realistic action choreography. Well, only if the editing lets you see that action and doesn't jump around so much you can't follow a single thing. So, I don't know if Bale learned to kick butt or if he used a stand-in, but it doesn't matter as you can't tell what's happening anyway.

As if that isn't bad enough, they then reveal Batman's back story - some screw loose loon saved by Tibetan Temple, Ninja-style training and philosophy. I don't know the comic genealogy to know how close this is to the origins of Batman, but it just didn't work for me. The temple and philosophy? Maybe. A ninja? Get out of here.

The Batmobile was cool. Caine and Freeman delivered as they always do, though they didn't have a great deal to work with. The plot had holes. The story was passable. The sets impressive. The action sequences just blurry mush. See it or don't see it, but it's not a movie to cry about if you miss it.

1569414,5,B00005JNJV,"my prayers have been answered. after the Batman series was left a smoldering corpse after Batman & Robin it looked like the dark knight would never rise again. then Christopher Nolan and David Groyer picked up the project. jump starting the series all over again getting ride of those neon lights, cheesy dialouges, and thos ridiculous bat nipples, this new Batman flick erases the events of the first four films and take us way back to Batman's origins. we find our hero Bruce Wayne in some prison were he meets the mysterious Ducard (Neeson in another mentor role) who takes him to the league of shadows ruled by the mysterios Ra's Al Ghul. after his training he returns to Gotham City to find it a mess. criminals roam the street, people in power are corrupt, and no one has the guts to stand up and take action. its then Bruce becomes Batman, fighting to save Gotham from the corrupt crime bosses to the vile Scarecrow. Christian Bale is perfect as the dark knight, almost as perfect as Micheal Keaton, who most remembered as the lunatic from American Psycho but he brings the Batman's hurt and pain and some light hearteness that made Keaton so good. Katie Holmes is surprisingly very good in her first grown-up role. Micheal Caine as the good butler Alfred brings some well needed comic relief. not just those three but the other cast memebers are great from Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, and Ken Watanabie in his fairly small role. this movie really saved the franchise and i can't wait until the sequel titled ""the Dark Knight"" (pretty nicely fitted) comes out, ecpecially when Heath Ledger (the guy from Brokeback Mountain) will be playing the Joker. i know, a bit of an odd choice but still we thought Nicholson was an odd choice for the original Joker and look how that turned out. so, if your a true Bat-aholic this is the film we've been waiting for.",1154908800,,1877,4.656626506024097

The unique and great thing about the Batman mythology is that he is not a Super Hero; other comics heroes have some super natural power butBatman is a regular human who suffered and continues to suffer and who is trying to avenge his suffering.

1569417,5,B00005JNJV,"I don't know where to start to even say how awesome this film is. I will just say this is what Tim Burton COULD NOT do back in 1989, nor could he really do it now either. I do like Burton's take but it was very shallow in terms of what makes Batman tick (Tim has always been all style and no substance), Nolan on the other hand gives us what we all wanted and that is the man behind the cowl, the motivation and lessons learned to make him the Knight that he is. Nolan delivers a great cast with a great scrpit, all told with great direction. The years spent making taunt psychological/film nior films like Memento and Insomnia have all lead up to this and Chris did not fail in the least bit. Bale makes the most promising Batman and Bruce Wayne since the casting news of Michael Keaton, whom would go on to drop the ball as Batman in the Burton films along with Jack Nicholson dropping The Joker too (sorry Jack DID NOT KNOW how The Joker should be). Along with Bale there are some very good actors fleshing out, and I mean fleshing out the roles of some of Gotham's citizen such as Micahel Cain(Alfred), Gary Oldman(Gordon) and Cillian Murphy(Dr. Crane/Scarecrow) just to name a few. The use of actual sets and stunt scenes are most welcomed instead of being once again exposed to CGI.

I know there are people that will argue that this movie was too long or boring, and if they do they just don't get it. And if they are like me and have read the comics of Batman and still say they don't get it, then there just might be a room in Arkham for them.",1153612800,,1552,4.225589225589226

I was still completely cynical and was completely blown away with my reaction to the movie. I loved it not only that I bought the DVD. That's right a self-proclaimed Batman hater actually loved a Batman movie and bought the DVD. Batman Begins is so good. It peels away all the colorful villians and over the top stunts and put together a very well written story that's a very believable human story. There's so much going on in the movie and its all actually very relate able. Christian Bale plays the role of Batman so well showing the more human side full of faults, dreams and the need to avenge his parents' deaths. Liam Nessiam was is usual awsome self and his charactor awsome. I enjoyed how they introduced the villain of the show the Scarecrow was well done.

1569511,5,B00005JNJV,"Like a lot of others I wasn't sure if another Batman movie was necessary, with the Burton masterpieces and the Schumacher disasters still fresh in everyone's minds. But like those people, I was wrong. This was the Batman movie that surpassed my expectations, an experience so rich and entertaining that I didn't think it could be done as live-action. Really, it's the tale of a man obsessed with darkness, trying to find a way to fight the shadows without being consumed by them. A man who takes the law into his own hands against a much greater evil than he could've ever imagined. And oh yeah, the man just happens to call himself Batman.

Performances are spot-on all around, and Christian Bale easily makes Batman/Bruce Wayne his own. The cast is fairly star-studded, and each one contributes their share without putting their ego in, for a true ensemble piece. All the little origin details are here, from why Batman takes bats as influence, why he needs a cape, and what a practical Batmobile would look like. Two things feel off: Katie Holmes, who is generally good but not given a lot to do, and the ending that ties everything neatly together with a ""destroy Gotham"" plot. It takes a bit of suspension of disbelief, but it's worth it for an otherwise flawless film.

Warner Bros. released Batman Begins in single and deluxe dvd editions. The bonus materials on the deluxe set are good, though there needs to be more, and the menu is a stylized comic book presentation that loses all sense of functionality. Early editions came with a free comic book featuring a sampling of stories the film draws influence from. It was a nice bonus, but as the stories can easily be found elsewhere, you're not missing much if your copy didn't come with it (the ""Long Halloween"" story in particular, is only chapter 1 of a story that deserves a purchase on its own).

The Burton films are still excellent interpretations of Batman, but Batman Begins will probably be remembered as the most authentic screen-telling yet. A great film for fans, and great for converting non-fans.",1153008000,4,2070,4.7604456824512535

Yes, I'm referring to his role in American Psycho. A role he will never be able to escape, in my opinion. He has looked menacing in everything since that movie. And Batman Begins is no exception.

I miss the interpretation of Michael Keaton. Before 1989, no one would have fathomed Keaton as Batman. He was predominately a comedic actor. But he made it work. He was slightly off-kilter and bumbling, but could still kick butt when it was time. He understood the balance and the difference between Bruce Wayne and Batman. Something none of the others could.

I'm not going to even comment on them casting Katie Holmes, a girl just barely in her mid-twenties playing a D.A. We seem to be witnessing the same problem in the latest Superman movie with Lois Lane. Hollywood, there are women in their thirties around.",1152662400,3,955,4.644970414201183

Aside from that, there was only one flaw I really had a problem with in this movie.

The machine meant to ""fog up"" the city is described in the film as originally being a military weapon designed to shoot microwaves to diminish enemy water supplies in desert combat from long distances...

You can't focus microwaves from long distances. They need to project into a cone after a certain amount of travel, which would make it mighty ineffective for combat, as it would probably spread the beam out and hit our guys too (Wheee!).

So, HA! Try to look intelligent by complaining about the film now, all of you whiners! You didn't even know that microwaves can't be focused into a consistent beam, which is the most important premise to be taken into consideration, as the whole film revolves around it.

I mean, seriously! How could you NOT know that about microwaves?! That's the first thing anyone would know!

Ahahahahahahahahah!

I mean, how stupid do you have to be- hahaha- not to know that microwaves do not have a single-ray projection dynamic- hahaha, how insidiously insipid of you!

Anyhow, the film was pretty. So I was able to let that slide and pretend the machine did something else to diminish water supplies.

It is jam-packed with so many great performances that it's a treat to watch over and over again. There is Christian Bale's pensive Bruce Wayne..soul searching through mysticism to become Batman.  Michael Caine as the intelligent save-the-day butler Alfred.  Liam Neeson, who always lights up the screen whenever he's there, as Ducard.  Gary Oldman as the skeptical Officer Gordon.  Cillian Murphy as the creepy Dr. Crane.  Katie Holmes as the inquistive Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes.  Rutger Hauer as the ""didn't you get the memo"" Earle and the always good Morgan Freeman as the scientist technical advisor Lucius Fox.

If only the folks involved in the writing process had tried to come up with a stronger, more seasoned script.

First, I felt very bad for poor Liam Neeson, who was left to spout a few forgettable Yoda-style lines.  What a waste...when you have honest acting talent like Neeson, USE IT!  And Christian Bale did a good job with what he'd been given, however, I've never seen a Bruce Wayne who was as clueless and stupid as the one this movie delivered.  (His on-screen flame, a character played by Katie Holmes, seemed to have more common sense).  The best performances really came from Gary Oldman (who, I'm convinced, couldn't turn in a bad performance in any movie) and Cillian Murphy (unfortunately, his character was given -what?- maybe five minutes of actual screen time).

Don't get me wrong: it is nice to see a Batman who isn't surrounded by ice-skating snowmen/burglars or spinning neon lights (as in the horrible Joel Shumacher outings).  But really...a sonic machine that attacks the town's water supply?  A group of secret assassin ninja spies who want nothing more than to leave Gotham City in ruins?  Although almost everything was there: all the elements to make a really good, really dark movie for the Dark Knight, it's the ""almost"" that leaves me wishing I had seen a better film.

1569517,5,B00005JNJV,"Any fan will tell you that when Tim Burton announced that Michael Keaton was his Batman, there were gasps of disbelief and horror.  Tim Burton and Michael Keaton, however, made us believers.  After the first two movies, Burton and Keaton had the good sense to move on before the inevitable: WB going sequel crazy.  In the third movie, Val Kilmer almost pulled it off; the inclusion of the Robin storyline actually worked.  Director Joel Schumaker turned the Gotham into a black-light world of flourescent paint and was immensely heavy handed in constantly tilting the camera back and forth.  Seldom was there a nice, level camera scene.  The sucker was saved by the one-two punch of Jim Carrey as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones (who replaced Billy Dee Williams, sadly) almost as over the top as Carrey in playing Two-Face.

Even then WB couldn't let it go - exit Schumaker (and the need to take Dramamine to combat motion sickness) and Kilmer.  Enter George Clooney, who had the looks for the part, but didn't make it work at all.  It might have to do with his recent response to a question if he would ever play a gay character; he responded that he already had when he played Batman.  Suddenly the movie made more sense, particularly with those damned nipples and 'who gets the larger codpiece' argument on the costumes.  Uma Thurman gives a simply horrible performance and Ah-nold the now girlie-man governor was beyond horrific.  Thus was the death of the Batman series.

Then along comes Chris Nolan, et al.  The first thing he did was, as Christian Bale thanked him for upon receiving an MTV award, 'got rid of those bloody nipples'.  Amen, brother.  Rather than try to fix that which was badly broken, Nolan decided to explore Bruce Wayne's journey to become Batman.  By default you also get to see Jim Gordon's journey from an actual uncorrupt cop, helpless to do anything about a system that was essentially owned on all levels by crime.

Christian Bale has been an absolute chamelion since being discovered as a child by Spielberg during a miniseries about Anastasia, in which (looking like Alexei's reincarnated doppelganger) he made the miniscule role of the doomed Tsarovich more memorable than the rest of the four hour monstrosity.  Spielberg then cast him as the lead in the huge and harsh world of Empire of the Sun.  Since then Bale has been in so many movies that to list them here would take forever.  He has learned how to sing and dance, all types of accents, been everything from an innocent child to a literal pschopath, and sculpted his own body to fit whatever role he is playing.  In this instance he was coming off of playing a role where he dropped to 140 lbs. for the dark, psychological ""The Machinist"".  He then bulked up to 220 lbs, working out, to the point when he showed up for the martial art training he was actually too big.  So he lost weight and re-sculpted his body to the shape they wanted him to be in.  Even during interviews on the extras disk, as well as when he was doing the publicity tour for the film; he speaks with the American accent, not wanting his British accent to sideline people's focus on the fact that he, unlike his character, is not American.  Dedication doesn't even begin to describe Christian Bale.

The same could be said for Gary Oldman, also a chamelion of an actor.  He IS Jim Gordon.  Never once do you think of the various villains and other odd characters he has played during his career.

Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman perfectly round out both Bruce Wayne and Batman's inner circle of supporters. Caine perfectly played both the paternal role as well as the keeper of the Wayne family's legacy and honor.  You will find yourself saying, ""Nevah,"" with utter conviction in your own life.  Freeman's character is brilliant, hidden in the bowels of the Wayne building with scientific and just plain cool items that would be wonderful to make use of in Iraq right now.  As Freeman's character notes, however, the military doesn't think that a $300,000 body army suit is worth protecting their soldiers with, so even if the various military prototypes were not fictional - you know that they would be shoved in a drawer waiting for Bruce to 'borrow'.  Most well-played was Freeman and Bale's unspoken acknowledgment of what Bruce is doing, even as he aids him under the guise of cave diving and base jumping.

WB and fans no doubt want sequels, and there are already things set up for the next film; nonetheless you wonder if it should stand alone rather than trying to make it into another franchise that will eventually be mishandled.

My only complaints are that there is no commentary and the extras disc is out and out annoying in its cutesy attempt to use a small comic strip as a way to find 'Easter Eggs', i.e. all the extra features.  Just list the damned documentaries.  Katie Holmes did a good enough, albeit annoyingly self-righteous, character.  You can't help watching her and thinking, ""Yep, that's probably the last movie she'll be doing now that she's been sucked into Scientology as a breeder for Tom Cruise.

I'd actually give the movie 4 1/2 stars for the above reasons, as well as a few logistical issues.  Most people wouldn't notice them, so it likely won't matter.  All in all the movie is brilliant in its story, the acting, and the return to classic scenes of the stoic Batman perched like a gargoyle on various older buildings, watching silently over Gotham.",1152403200,3,5458,4.702105263157895
1569518,1,B00005JNJV,"I hated this movie.  Its not fleshed out, its just plain terrible.  Although I still fully believe that Val Kilmer was the worst Batman, Christian Bale is the second worst.  He whisper acts.  Also he seems more like a actor than Bruce Wayne.  He plays both with such a dullness about him, almost as if he does not really care.  The story is about a bunch of mumbo-jumbo about finding the path of justice and blah blah blah.  We are talking about a Batman FRANCHISE, not a Shakespearian Play.  This is just a summer blockbuster.  The morals are what barney should have taught you.  This movie (not film) does not need to be o-so-moral or even o-so-serious.  It should at least have a little fun.  To me the movie is just a male version of Elektra.  It has the same bad editing, the same ""flashback to my tragic childhood"" cut scenes, the same ""I can take on 15 people at the same time because I'm just that good"" action, but most of all, it has the same ""I'm going to fool people into thinking that melodrama is what makes movie good"" wishful thinking.  The movie tests my patience and tries to treat me like a idiot.  It was just a big pile of dung.  Bruce Wayne has never been such a complete moron with zero common sense.  One of the worst parts is that the movie contradicts itself.  For example:  Bruce Wayne's mentor tells him in one scene that his father is to blame for his own death because even though he has no skill he never acted to save himself and that its not strength that is needed for survival but the ability to try.  In the very next scene the same guy says that Bruce is so much stronger than his father and that's why he is a survivor.  That really makes no sense.  Another example is how Bruce won't kill anyone because its against his moral code but literally 5 seconds later he kills a whole building full of people without blinking.  The only voice of reason in this movie is not Alfred, but Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes.  She keeps trying to tell people what they literally need to hear (especially Bruce), but nobody ever pays any attention to her and instead just gets all bent out of shape by what she has to say.  Also, the batmobile was the worst ever!  It was like a pancake shaped, junkyard made, jeep with a roof.  It was short and stubby.  It drove like a pogo stick.  It was so ugly. It seemed so redneck to me.  It was like a mini monster truck and I fully expected Joe Dirt to jump out with a beer in one hand and a package of cheewing tabacoo in the other.  I loved the first 2 batman's and even Forever and Batman & Robin were silly campy fun, but now I probably will never see a batman movie ever again.",1152144000,14,2645,4.240480961923848

1569570,5,B00005JNJV,"I wouldn't call myself a hardcore follower of Batman, but I'd still say I was a pretty big fan. Batman was the first superhero I can remember hearing about. I used to draw pictures of him in the early grades of school. I watched the 1960s TV series and film, saw the Burton films, put up with the Schumacher ones had a comic or two, collected the trading cards, and even had the DC comics Super Dictionary (does anyone else remember that?).

When I first heard that there was going to be a Batman film that would try to stay true to the origins of the comic, I scoffed. In the world of comics, particularly DC comics with all its retcons and reimaginings, could there really be anything that could be honestly considered true to Batman's origins? Plus, I heard that it was pretty serious, with humourous moments few and far between. Sure, I appreciate Batman's darker side, but I felt that a Batman without so much as a drop of humour would just be pretentious, and I avoided this film for a while, for fear I'd be disappointed. Eventually though, curiousity got the better of me, and I faced these fears and watched the film. I'm glad it did, Batman Begins is pretty good.

Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne, reflecting on his tragic childhood high up in the ice locked mountains of Asia. He's staying with the League of Shadows, led by the enigmatic Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Wantanabe). Under the wing of the equally enigmatic Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), Bruce comes to terms with the death of his parents (more or less) and begins to fashion his Batman persona, becoming the thing that he fears in order to scare criminals into submission. Though he once had many thoughts about revenge, Bruce no longer desires to kill lawbreakers and murderers, he only desires to bring them to justice. Putting this ideal into practice, he refuses to kill a man who has broken Ra's Al Ghul's law and returns to Gotham City, his home reuniting with his family butler Alfred (Michael Caine). Bruce, though wealthy by way of company shares, takes a job at his late family's business in the research department, headed by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who has access to many items of sophisticated technology. With his wealth, his access to high tech equipment, and a little bit of help from old Alfred, Bruce becomes Batman, and just in time too. There is something brewing under the streets of Gotham, something to strike fear in the heart of each and every citizen. Does it have anything to do with the Scarecrow, a figure that haunts the minds of the patients of Arkham Asylum? Does criminal bigwig Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has something to do with it, perhaps? It is all up to Batman and a weathered but honest policeman Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) to find out!

The film is rather fast paced, especially early on, so you have to pay a bit of attention. Kind of cut into the atmosphere a tad, but it doesn't matter too much. With such a fast pace, there's no time to be bored, and it means the movie's a lot shorter than it could have been (even then, it still goes for over 2 hours). Batman's look is a little rougher that we've seen in the Burton films, but that's understandable, as Bruce Wayne's just starting out. He also looks more like an animal in the suit than anyone before, I think, which is interesting. The Batmobile, too, is equally rough. Christian Bale puts on this gruff voice whenever he gets into his suit, which took a while for me to get used to, though it can be quite scary sometimes. Batman's scariness is emphasized quite a lot, actually, especially when he works with villains. Though not exactly a kids movie, this Batman is still regarded as a hero figure to them, which can be seen through the eyes of a particular child in this film, who meets Batman briefly and is sure he'll save the day when he and the rest of Gotham find themselves in danger.  Michael Keaton's still my favorite on screen Batman, but Bale is now my favorite Bruce Wayne. He plays unmasked Bruce as two distinct personaes, the decadent gadabout in public, and the brooding but driven soul in private. This Batman leads a triple life, which I thought was a fascinating concept.  Michael Caine was an unexpected choice for Alfred I thought, with his cockney accent and all, but he pulls it off (I still think that Michael Gough is the definitive Alfred though). Gary Oldman was a great Jim Gordon. As for the dialogue, it is dramatic, but it doesn't go as far as pretentious, which is good.

As I watched, I discovered that there was actually a little bit of humour in the film. It wasn't as much as there would be in, say, a Tim Burton Batman film, and not as much as I would have preferred, but it is there. Bruce Wayne's tabloid antics, for example, and the odd one liner delivered in a dry, jaded kind of way, which in a city so heavily burdened with crime is the way you'd expect the world weary Gotham citizens to crack a joke.

I think director Christopher Nolan is onto something with this rethink/reboot, and the sequels could be really something special. I just hope he's careful, I can see a lot of ways this kind of take on Batman could go wrong. It could easily become really pretentious and totally humourless if he and the team aren't careful. It could get too gritty, the League of Shadows could be behind absolutely every villains plans, which would just be boring. Just have to wait and see how it goes. I do hope we get to see the Joker next!

The special features disc is rather unique. It's menus are set up like a comic strip, depicting a scene of the movie featuring Batman and Scarecrow. You can flick through the pages, and if you press certain remote arrows, you can find yourself highlighting a character or a word, easter egg style. Pressing enter on these comic elements will take you to a special feature, be it a behind the scenes featurette or a data file on a weapon, hero or villain. I wanted to see all the special features, and I was getting frustrated that I had to do all this fancy remote work when I flicked through to the end of the menu/comic and found an index page of most of the special featues, which was a lot easier to follow. Locations, models, sets, actors, writers... you can find out about everything on this disc. Well, everything I'd ever need to know anyway.

Definitely worth a look for fans of Batman, whatever the era, whatever the medium. Not my favorite, but its fairly high up there.",1152057600,7,6420,4.513327601031814
1569571,5,B00005JNJV,"There is really no other word (other than its synonyms) to describe this movie. Batman Begins takes the movie Batman to a whole new level. You now know more about him then you did before. Batman is no longer that super hero with his trademark ""tongue-in-cheek"" humor. No, no, no. This is a darker much more serious Batman.

This movie has taken everything you thought you used to know about the caped crusader and basically, just threw it out the window. Thats not to say that the key elements of who Batman IS aren't still there. He still is out for justice (or maybe its more for vengeance...) he still dwells in a cave on his huge estate and is still the millionaire self-made superhero with all the cool gadgets. Basically what this movie has done is taken all of the humor out of the Batman we saw in the previous movies. It takes a more serious approach and quite frankly its refreshing. I think that now we finally get to see the legendary Batman as we were ment to see him. Christopher Nolan has done what Tim Burton never did, and thats what makes this movie so great. Not to mention the great special effects and story behind it all.

1569574,4,B00005JNJV,"To really appreciate Chris Nolan's ""Batman Begins,"" one has to also understand two other things.  The first is the character of Batman, his core and the continuing appeal.  The second is Hollywood's dawning comprehension of how to make a superhero movie.

As to Batman (or The Batman, if you like), his enduring appeal has always been based upon his nature: tortured, borderline psychotic...and DARK.  From his earliest days, the selection of the bat costume and motif, his preference for working from the shadows, and his utter grimness, were intended to strike FEAR into the hearts of evil doers.  Unfortunately, the backlash against dark, morbid comics in the 50's led Batman's publishers to ""lighten"" him up.  Garish colors replaced the shadows, Batman became a daylight figure in Gotham City, and the stories became downright silly.  It was THIS thread that Hollywood picked up on the 60s during the 1964-66 ""Batmania"" craze...but it had NOTHING to do with the original concept of Batman.

Unfortunately for all concerned, however, the Batmania craze sold a lot of toys and other licensed materials...so it was only natural that when Tim Burton's ""Batman"" debuted in 1989, the Warner Brothers licensing people would again look to sell oodles of toys and other assorted goodies.  But Burton's vision, while taking distinct liberties with the Batman canon, was nonetheless dark...and tykes were scared by the movie.  They were even more rattled when ""Batman Returns"" came out and Danny DiVito was gobbling raw, bloody fish.  Thus, the studio honchos put down their corporate feet and said ""No more...you're alienating Mommies and ruining a perfectly good money-making enterprise...let's get back to movies that kids will like so we can sell toys.""

That was (as it had been for the two latter sequels of the Superman movie franchise) the death knell.  The resulting movies were awful and, while the five year-olds might have been entertained, older movie-goers stayed away in droves.  It was not until the first Spider-Man movie debuted that the studios got it: leave the movie-making to directors and writers who respect the core material, and you will sell movie tickets AND toys.

So the suits got out of the way, and in their place entered Chris Nolan, a director who respected the source material, and one who had a vision of the story he wanted to tell.  Batman's origin, the death of his parents as the event that dictated his path in life, had been told more than once. There was no need to go back there again, and Nolan wisely chose to almost gloss over that part of the story, and focused instead on how Bruce Wayne BECAME The Batman...and THAT was a story that had NOT been told before.

Unfortunately, Nolan's depiction of the birth of the Batman was almost told in real time.  The film is half over before Batman even makes an appearance...but what a first appearance it is.  This Batman IS shadow...this Batman IS terror.  This Batman IS a criminal's worst nightmare.  Inspirationally eschewing the third person POV, Nolan has us see Batman as his opponents see him...or rather, as they DON'T see him.  The impact is palpable.

For his part, Chris Bale, the latest actor to don the Cape and Cowl, also has an obvious respect for the legend he has taken upon his shoulders.  There are no winks, asides or clever remarks.  This Batman is all business.

The rest of the cast is magnificent, with the glaring exception of Katie Holmes, an ""actress' whose least egregious sin is being just too darn young for the part she is portraying.  Add the facts that she has little talent, no range and little expression, and you have Nolan's one true miscue in the movie.  The rest of the casting, however, is sheer genius.

This is a movie for both fanboys and casual viewers alike.  Geeks will get goose bumps watching the origin of all the Bat-toys told for the first time ever, and less involved viewers (IF they can sit through the first half of the film) will find themselves glued to the edge of their seats as a truly memorable story is told.  In this movie Batman truly and finally BEGINS, and it is very good to have him back.",1151539200,2,4140,4.8132956152758135
1569575,5,B00005JNJV,"I think the best thing to come from the Renaissance of Superhero films is to be less tongue-in-cheek with the characters and show them just how extreme a real-life personality has to be to want to live the life.  We've seen it in ""Daredevil"" and we've seen it in the ""Blade"" series.  We've seen people who'd rather be ""Normal"" forced into the life through mere genetics in the ""X-Men"" films and we've seen a guy become a hero out of never-ending guilt in ""Spider-Man.""  Now, we see the fully-developed psychological reasons why Bruce Wayne, a man who has all the privileges of being white, rich, and gifted, would choose to live what amounts to a freak's life.

Nolan and Goyer took what Tim Burton did in ""Batman"" and did it one better.  Rather than giving us an artistically ""dark"" vision as to who the character is and what makes him tick, they decided to give us a plausibly ""real-world"" look into what a Gotham City would be like, right down to the gritty corruption that consumes it.  We also get to see just how long it took for Bruce Wayne to become ""Batman,"" right down to where he almost takes the other road and blow away the man who murdered his parents.

Christian Bale - not my first choice to play Wayne, but one can't have a really big name wear the suit.  It's been proven - if a ""superstar"" wears the suit, then we don't see the character.  (Unless, the actor is tailor made for the role, a la Patrick Stewart's Professor Xavier, or someone transcends expectations, like Michael Keaton did in the first ""Batman"")  He delivered a dark, fatalistic Batman, as well as a flighty-but-never-fey millionaire playboy ""Bruce Wayne.""  You get the feeling with Bale that the real Bruce Wayne DID die those long years ago along with his parents.  I got a sense of doom from him the moment he decided to become Batman, and that is the core of the character - the REAL ""person"" is Batman.  ""Bruce Wayne"" has become a mask.  As it should be.

All told, this was the Batman that had to be, apart from the first Dini animated series.  Thank God for the Goyers and Nolans of this world.  They both did this character, and the character's long, storied, history, the justice it deserved.",1151452800,3,2186,4.521628498727735

1569578,5,B00005JNJV,"Finally, an installment to the Batman film franchise that takes seriously the idea of what the graphic novels of Frank Miller and Alan Moore had in mind. When this originally was released in the theatre, folks asked me what I thought, and I told them that by comparison, the previous 4 movies WERE comic-book compared to this - a graphic novel on screen, quite literally. This is the perfect vision of what The Batman is designed to be: DARK. How Bruce Wayne as a character is meant to be portrayed - the rich playboy on the outside, and a benevolent monster on the inside, something those closest to him would ever see. How Gotham is portrayed - very gritty, very dangerous, and made to look very real.

  The story is basically a marriage between a few different graphic novels, respectfully ""Year One"" by Frank Miller and ""A Long Halloween"" by Alan Moore, and it works quite well. The only difference in origin was the part when Wayne was a boy, which if you're not a die-hard fan, makes no difference (that is - in 'Begins' the theatre event they go to is an opera, and in the actual origin it's a Zorro movie, but probably due to copywrights they couldn't expound on this). The plot line is brilliant in that it covers several neccessary points such as how he is inspired by the bat, how he gets some of his training as well as his evading the police. Well done indeed. The way this is filmed is remarkably different too. Even with the Burton films, you see a well-groomed set, but here's where 'Begins' stands apart from all the other four films. It's filmed in such a way that it makes everything look HUGE, which is what Brian Singer took notice of when he directed Superman Returns. Go figure. The environment you see them working with isn't just an obvious set, it looks completely real. Too real, if you've ever been to NYC or Chicago. All in all, if you want to see a serious film on Batman, this is the one. Ignore the other 4 unless you're showing them to your younger children. This one is much darker and more for an adult to be able to comprehend and relate to. There is now word there is going to be 2 more sequels in the works to boot. Currently, no titles yet, but thus far, everyone that was in this, save for a few faces, are, in fact, contracted for the next 2 films as well.

But they never really captured the feel of Batman or the depth of the mythology. They concentrated too much on the gadgets and the costuming, and not enough on the people behind them.

This movie is about Bruce Wayne, and how and why he decides to dress up like a gigantic bat and fight against the scum of the earth, when he *could* be living it up as a billionaire playboy.

It sets Batman up against two of his famous nemeses--Ra's al Ghul and the Scarecrow (and shows a third, Mr. Zsasz, who doesn't feature prominently)--as he also tries to work out his personal relationships and assume the Wayne family mantle.

This movie transcends its genre--an action superhero/comic book movie became so much more. I was completely blown away by ""Batman Begins.""  Christian Bale gave his all to this movie and it shows.  He plays the traumatized billionaire to perfection. He broods, he deliberates, he flusters; in short, he's kinda Hamlet-like (though spared the Oedipal complex).  A lot of people have panned Katie Holmes' performance, but I don't understand why. Her role was understated, as this movie wasn't about Bruce Wayne's romantic quests. Katie Holmes convincingly portrays Rachel as a young woman with great integrity and determination, and Rachel is more of a supportive, peripheral character.

I also liked that this movie had some grounding in real science--we were shown the science behind the mirrors, smoke & magic of Gotham City and its heroes and villains.  In the other Batman movies, it's all magic. (Granted the scientific explanations are cutting edge and futuristic, I still appreciated that this movie tries to connect spiffy equipment with almost plausible technology. Morgan Freeman's character does a great job of introducing Bruce Wayne to the government's latest finds.)

The follies of the Shadow of Leagues demonstrate to us viewers that justice and revenge are not interchangeable. Bruce still clings to the ideal that justice needs to be tempered with mercy, and his mentor (Liam Neeson) cannot change Bruce's stance on the matter.

I can't find one complaint against this movie. I'm not a huge action hero fan, but I loved this movie nonetheless.  Bravo to Christian Bale and the cast and crew of ""Batman Begins.""  This Batman bested the other Batman movies hands down.",1150156800,7,2152,4.983240223463687
1569665,5,B00005JNJV,"It has been said that a work of art tells us more about the artist than the subject matter in the art.  This is particularly true in stories about comic book characters.  I feel privileged to have lived in a time when so many good ""superhero"" movies have been made.

I enjoy morality plays, stories that are thinly veiled formulas for discussing uncommon ideals and moral questions.  As I get older, I enjoy fewer things, but I still enjoy a moral tale.  It seems a little bit ironic that we seem to be able to swallow sweeping moral discussions more in animated, operatic, or superhero features.  In TV we've constantly had morality plays in the many incarnations of ""Law & Order"", ""Star Trek"", & many other shows.

The movie starts off by graying the lines between good & evil and vigilantism & idealism.  The main characters are people with primary personas different than their alternate identity.  We hear the advice of Liam Neeson's character, not knowing whether to champion him or be suspicious - a writing choice that respects the intelligence of the moviegoer.

The movie explores the long running ""Batman"" question of:  What separates a vigilante from a righteous avenger?  When is a person simply a facist by taking justice into their own hands?

The movie also explores the important question of:  How do you deal with the possibility that you may have been a contributing factor to the death of someone you love?  The movie does not ""answer"" either of these questions; but rather shows characters trying to survive in the aftermath.

I love this movie because it promotes these, and many other, ideals:

1.  Never give up on the people close to you.  Seriously, never.  (Or as Michael Caine says, ""Nevah!"")

2.  Why do we fall sir?  So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

3.  People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.  People need someone to rattle the cages.

4.  Its not who you are ""underneath"" that matters.  It's what you do that defines you.

I really appreciate the intelligence and creative force of Christopher Dolan & David Goyer's caring screenplay.  This movie packs a great emotional punch, on par with Spiderman 2, another great movie.

The title of this review is from a line in the film where Batman's father lets young Bruce know things will be alright, and the father will stand beside his son in the midst of all fears, even death.  ""It's okay, it's okay.""",1150070400,6,2411,4.705035971223022
1569666,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins succeeds on many levels.  It provides a wide range of fully realized settings.  It guves us a satisfying drama, fleshing out the origins of Bruce Wayne until he became Batman. It is filled many good acting performances, large and small.  And overall, Christopher Nolan made a lot of smart choices in theme and tone, making this version of Batman much more resonant than any other version.

In the final analysis, Batman Begins will be remembered for the performances of Christian Bale, Cillian Murphy, and the fine ensemble supporting cast.  And it should also be remembered for its emphaisis on primal fear as the compelling theme for the story.  What makes Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow so scary, is not that he has fancy gadgets or superhuman powers, it is that he has simply enhanced his ability to scare people out of their wits.  Batman also uses fear as a main weapon.  Christian Bale delivers a wonderful performance because he demonstrates three distinct personas.  The first is Bruce Wayne, from scared little boy, to angry young man, to seeker of justice and revenge. The second is Playboy Bruce Wayne, who is a character he plays (almost exactly the same as his character in American Psycho) for the sake of his public.  And the third is Batman.  The genius of Bale's preformance is that he shows us that he is putting on a performance for the public (as the Playboy) and for cops and criminals (as Batman).  Bale's is a performance inside a performance, and I think that is pretty cool.  I also want to give brief mention to Gary Oldman, who stands out among the supporting cast (who would have thought this was the guy that brought Sid Vicious to the screen?).

The reason this is a 4-star film and not a 5-star film is that, for all its merits, it fails to deliver the action and it ends up being formulaic in the mold of a typical big budget film.  The car chase was pretty good as car chases go, but it was a poor choice.  And while it was fine to bring in a gadgetmeister (Morgan Freeman) to help explain the Batsuit and his various weapons, less would have been more in terms of superpower type stuff.  It wasn't necessary to have Batman fly or have a car that can drive across rooftops.  The grapling hook was well used.  The Batsuit, kick-butt karate, the grapling hook, and a relatively normal Batmobile is about all Batman should have needed to get along.  It would have served the action better to cut out the car chase and improved the hand-to-hand fighting sequences.  And instead of showing how Batman learned to fly, show us a little bit more of Batman as detective.  I mean, show us Batman doing actual detective work, rather than having his very smart allies explain everything to him.  That would have been more apealing: a Batman who is both smart and able to beat up criminals.

All in all, this was a good movie, regardless of whether you have now, or have enjoyed comic books, or their movie adaptations.  Maybe it is too much to expect a perfect Batman movie given that the cost to produce such a movie will inevitable steer its production toward convnetional and formulaic choices.  I give Christopher Nolan credit for making this Batman somewhat off-beat (in a good way), if not completely perfect.  Maybe the answer is an animated film for adults.

1569667,5,B00005JNJV,"It can sound like hyperbole when comic fans describe their heroes as the mythology of the modern age, but in the hands of a skilled storyteller, we can see that there is more than a little truth to it.  Director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan and co-screenwriter David Goyer play up the mythic elements of the Batman legend, presenting Bruce Wayne (Christain Bale) as a figure driven to combat the evil that destroyed his childhood and warped his personality.  Along the way, we also get a plausible explanation for just why a young billionaire might be obsessed with bats and how he might come up with a Batmobile, a bat suit,and an array of advanced weaponry.

The real strength of this film is its emphasis on atmosphere and character, so much so that I didn't mind that Batman didn't appear until roughly an hour into the film.  When he does finally show up, it's great.  Highly recommended.",1149984000,2,895,4.785714285714286

All of the major players are in top form.  Bale and Caine are very natural together, and Oldman was a great choice to play a your Gordon.

I cannot wait for the sequel to this movie.  Under Christopher Nolan's deft direction, I am certain the movie will be great.  I always thought that Spiderman II was far superior to Spiderman.  If the sequel to Batman Begins tops this one, we are in for an exceptional treat.

This movie not only honors the comic book, it also succeeds as a movie independent of the comic.  Even my wife, who did NOT want to watch this movie, absolutely loved it.  Every choice the filmmakers made was right, but none more so than casting Christian Bale.  He absolutely nails the character.  He is the first actor to play Bruce Wayne as the playboy he's supposed to be, something that makes the contrast of his deeply pissed off and angry Batman that much darker, just as he should be.  Christopher Nolan, or whoever was in charge, made sure every single person involved in the project was on the same page, and the effect is superb.  This movie actually stayed with me for days.  I didn't learn any life lessons, but it had been a long time since I'd seen a big Hollywood movie this finely layered and nuanced--the explanations of his armor, his batmobile, and how, in the future, Batman's batcave came to be filled with expensive gadgetry, are all offered with a wonderful plausibility.  There's a palpable feeling as one watches it that all the players on the project really wanted to kick some ass, and they succeeded masterfully.

1569728,3,B00005JNJV,"This movie was an attempt to tell the story of how Batman got his start as a crime-fighter. Although certainly well-intentioned, it ultimately FAILS to tell a BELIEVABLE story of Batman's humble beginnings.

The movie starts out intriguingly, with a young Bruce Wayne studying martial arts with a mysterious sect in the Tibetian wastelands of Asia. But about one hour into the film, things begin to go SERIOUSLY downhill...

My Complaints -

Despite several weak attempts at humor, this is BY FAR the most grim and humorless of all the 'Batman' films. The 'oh-so-serious' tone is not so bad during the first part of the film, but as the TEDIOUS moralizing continues, the film comes dangerously close to becoming BORING.

The Batmobile is ugly... and I don't mean just slightly ugly; it's REALLY UGLY - it looks like a piece of U.S. military hardware left over from Desert Storm !! The Batmobile is supposed to look COOL and SLEEK and SEXY, not like some hulking monstrousity left over from a construction site !

As one other ASTUTE individual pointed out, the fight scenes here are often claustrophobic; it's hard to see who's doing what to whom. In general, several of the fight scenes seem to be POORLY edited.

Liam Neeson is a fine actor playing a very confusing role. His character at first HELPS Batman, only to betray him later. The motivation for this turnaround is rather VAGUE and (IMHO) unrealistic. Meanwhile, Gary Oldman just looks TIRED in his role as the befuddled 'Detective' Gordon. His character is so meek and ambiguous, it's even hard to tell who's side he's on until near the end of the movie.

Christian Bale's 'interpretation' of Batman is RATHER STIFF to say the least; but his portrayal of Bruce Wayne is even WORSE - a rich, pouting whiner with NO CHARISMA AT ALL. As for Katie Holmes, I offer just one word - ANNOYING.

On a positive note -

Veteran film actors Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both do a FINE job with the supporting roles they're given here - their CLASSY performances (particularly Caine's) ALMOST saved this movie... almost.

The young actor who played the 'Scarcrow' character was FABULOUS ! He seemed to understand how his role should be played - with HUMOR and STYLE. It's a shame he got so little screen time.

Some of the photography in the Tibetian mountains and also of Gotham City at night is breathtakingly beautiful.

Overall this movie was a SERIOUS let-down. I went home with this DVD and a HUGE bag of popcorn, expecting to be watching the BEST Batman movie ever, and it just DIDN'T happen. Of all the 'Batman' movies made, Tim Burton's 1989 'Batman' remains by far the most enjoyable of the series. Also recommended: 'Batman: The Animated TV Series' (far better than this movie was) and 'Spiderman,' 'Spiderman 2.'",1149292800,6,2776,4.7845188284518825
1569729,4,B00005JNJV,"Don't expect any bat junk like ""shark repellant"" in this one. It's darker than Tim Burton's and it complexly makes you forget about all the other modern incarnations of PG rated goffery. This film has a great build up and a great explanation of things. Bruce works hard and fails continually, we get to see him develop and suffer and most importantly we get a great new Bat Mobile.

The only problem I had with this film is that the scarecrow just seems unnecessary. The movie worked so hard to present a new kind of realism that seems detracted from one that stupid mask appears. Henri Ducard was a good enough villain and the scarecrow just seemed to get in the way.

1569731,2,B00005JNJV,"This film would have gotten three stars from me if ONLY the fight scenes were not so HORRIBILY directed. Shot at extreme close-up, one has to struggle, unsuccessfully, to follow them. I cannot believe the crappy way those scenes were shot, it ruined the whole movie for me. The clueless director should have taken a cue from Spiderman 2 or the X-Men movies. People want to be able to see the action in fight scenes. Maybe he did not want us to get to good of a look at that terribly designed bat-suit. In fleeting shots, it looks okay, but if you get a good look at it, forget it. This film probably would have done better at the box-office (it limped to 200 million, good, but look nothing compared to the spidey movies, a fact which I am sure disappointed Warners, but that it is what they get for having a director ill-equipped to direct coherent fight sequences) if these flaws had been fixed before release.

Also, it looked like he tried to rip off the far superior ""Blade Runner"" in some of the claustraphobically obvious set scenes. (hell, he even has Rutger Hauer (Nexus Six) in a barely there supporting role!) The use of real world settings like Chicago, does NOT mesh when mixed in with these scenes, which also have some laughably chessey cgi, exspecially for a film with a supposed $ 200 million budget. Most of that budget must have wound up in someones pocket, or more likely, it was only there on paper.

Bale was merely okay as Batman, to me he has an overall sinester appearance unsuitable for the role. Katie Holmes was a baby doll so she could have been awful and I would not have cared, but she was servicable in a thankless damsel in distress role. Neeson was good, but too beefy for the role of Ras. Why do they always do that?  Way back in ' 89's ""Batman"" fat ass, bald nicholson was all wrong visually for Joker, yet he undeniably stole the show with a great performance. Neeson was unable to overcome this asthetic  flaw to  to make the role his own. And where was his hot daughter Talia, or his hulking henchman , Ubu ? The only cool thing was the red herring thrown at us concerning Ras's true identity.  Oldman made an okay Gordon, but being able to not only drive that crappy looking batmobile with no training, but succeeding in his mission with it? Gimme a break.

Now for the one thing that made this movie cool for me , Cillian Murphy's STANDOUT performance as the ""Scarecrow""!! He was incredible and truly made the role his own, the one real casting gem in this seriously flawed film. But, he did not have enough screen time. Why do these idiotic movie executives feel the need to have two major villians in every ""Batman"" movie since the original?  Again, have they learned nothing from Spiderman's incredible success? The first Batman film had a gross none of these seguels could remotely come close to, especially if you factor in adjustments for inflation. Why in the hell are they so retarded?  If Scarecrow had been the only villian, the movie would have been much more solid. He should definately return as the main villian in a sequel.

It was way too long.  That's right , you don't even see Batman until the film is half over. The boring first hour spends WAY too much time focusing on Bruce Wayne's transformation into becoming Batman. Again, the incoherent fight scenes do NOT help matters, although for some stupid reason, Bruce's fight scenes are easier to follow, which is really dopey, 'cause people laying down their hard earned cash expected to be able to see BATMAN in action, not all this training crap. I am damn glad I did not pay money to see this in the theater. Matter of fact, I pretty much never pay to see movies anymore, because of crap like this. The simple minded exec's who greenlight this stuff try way too hard to suck in every possible demographic, (this reached a pinnacle with Batman and Robin) diluting the movies into averge pap unworthy of my hard earned cash.

So, I am still waiting for a truly good Batman movie. I think that one with a different director, better shot fight scenes, a better looking batsuit, more like the one from the actual comics, complete with visible bat symbol with the yellow , a utility belt that looks like it could actually hold stuff, and a better looking cowl, along with the return of Scarecrow as the major villian. Or Joker, if he is done right. Which I doubt will ever happen.

 At its core this movie is about fear and how it is dealt with (and dealt out) and director Christopher Nolan has captured that theme and embedded into every scene and nuance, and the actors, Bale in particular, keep a veneer of fear over their performances that adds to their realism.

Some of have been done very well like, the Spiderman movies, and the X-men movies, but then some have not exactly hit the mark like, The Fantastic 4, and Daredevil.  Batman Begins absolutly deserves to be in the class of super hero movies that have been done well.

I confess that I was a little leary about watching this movie.  I really enjoyed the original Batman movie with Michael Keaton, and I thought the second movie (michael keaton as well) was quirkey but enjoyable.  But after these two the batman movies were honestly not that good.

The cool thing about the first two batmans was the fact that they did not try to hide that these were comic book inspired films.  They were kind of like live movies that resembled animation.  It wasn't believable, but I don't think it was suppossed to be.  The last two Batmans, took the comic book animated look to a new level, and it just didn't work.

Recently with the X-men movies we saw a new style of comic book movies being made in a more believable, less comic book style format, and that format for the most part has created a better movie.  With the creation of the Spiderman movies I believed the format hit perfection.  The super hero movie wasn't going to get any better.

After watching Batman Begins I have changed my mind.  I think that this movie edges out Spiderman 2, by a hair.  The action and story is just as good as Spiderman, but the evil enemies in Batman are scarier than Spiderman.

The cast in the movie is great.  Katie Holmes, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neison play great parts.  But my favorite actor in the movie was Michael Caine, who does a superb job as Alfred.

And the most surprising role in the movie was Gary Oldman.  Until this movie I had never seen Oldman in anything but the villain, but he plays a great supporting character to Batman.

1569824,5,B00005JNJV,"16 years after Tim Burton stunned audiences and critics with his believable and dark motion picture version of Batman, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) has remade the movie with an even more believable premise and darker edge.

After Burton and Batman star Michael Keaton left the Batman series in 1992 with Batman Returns, the sequels got worse and ridiculous (Joel Schumacher literally destroyed the Batman installments with Batman Forever, with Val Kilmer as Batman, and Batman And Robin, with George Clooney turning Batman into a smiling dummy). Nolan succeeds in bringing back the seriousness of the original Batman, with Christian Bale (The Machinist) donning the bat suit this time around.

As the title prescribes, the film explores Bruce Wayne's gradual emergence into the dark caped superhero, and in the process resurrects the death of his rich and famous parents. The film then shows Bruce getting picked up and raised by the family's butler Alfred, played by Michael Caine (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), departing from Gotham to no man's land where he learns the skills of fighting on the hands of ninja warrior Ducard, played by Liam Neeson (Gangs Of New York), being initiated into but refusing to join a dark cult known as the League of Shadows led by Ra's Al Ghul, played by Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), returning to a corrupt and crime-ridden Gotham city, reestablishing a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes, played by Katie Holmes, and vowing to bring back order to the city that his father help build, and in return got him killed, while in the process fight a relentless enemy known as The Scarecrow, played brilliantly by Cilian Murphy (Red Eye), with a little help from an honest detective named Jim Gordon, played by Gary Oldman (State Of Grace, JFK).

Nolan's directing never fails, while Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman is only second best to, if not equal to, Michael Keaton's. Whether you agree with me or not, Batman Begins is destined to be a new beginning for yet another adventurous and exciting Batman franchise, just as long as Joel Schumacher stays away!

1569895,5,B00005JNJV,"16 years after Tim Burton stunned audiences and critics with his believable and dark motion picture version of Batman, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) has remade the movie with an even more believable premise and darker edge.

After Burton and Batman star Michael Keaton left the Batman series in 1992 with Batman Returns, the sequels got worse and ridiculous (Joel Schumacher literally destroyed the Batman installments with Batman Forever, with Val Kilmer as Batman, and Batman And Robin, with George Clooney turning Batman into a smiling dummy). Nolan succeeds in bringing back the seriousness of the original Batman, with Christian Bale (The Machinist) donning the bat suit this time around.

1569896,5,B00005JNJV,"Christan Bale as a young Bruce Wayne/Batman is a much needed reinvention of the Batman movie franchise. He has amazing screen presence and makes you believe that he is the Dark Knight. I was impressed how naturally he jumped into the role and made it his own.

The story is tight and easy to follow. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the parts filmed in Iceland. Big sweeping shots of snow covered mountains and raggedy buildings lining the slopes. Just fabulous.

The 2 disc DVD set is spectacular. The video transfer is almost perfect and there are plenty of extras for the rabid Batman fan. The compilation comic book is a very nice addition. I would recommend this set to anybody.",1146787200,5,694,4.775
1569897,5,B00005JNJV,"This is the best Batman movie they've made so far.  Christian Bale does an awesome job, and Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy are great as the villians.  Katie Holmes isn't that great, but at least she's nice to look at.  Also, it's cool that they actually did something good with the Scarecrow character.  I was worried it was gonna be like in ""Batman & Robin"", with the horribly done Bane with the super-crappy foam suit, and the guy making ""Rerrr!"" sounds.  But they actually pulled Scarecrow off really well, and Murphy's natural creepiness fits perfectly.

Definitely buy this, if you're a Batman fan.  It's surprisingly very good.",1146700800,6,633,4.859813084112149
1569898,5,B00005JNJV,"Having been a fan of Batman since seeing my first Batman cartoon as a child I was thrilled when they decided to make Batman with Michael Keaton; it was everything I had hoped it would be.  Then the series began departing from what had made that first movie so great and became downright silly. Batman Begins brings the series back to its roots.  Batman never was intended to be a light, simple character, he's called the Dark Knight for a reason.  Christian Bale does a wonderful job of taking the audience through Wayne's transformation from an angry child into the avenger of Gotham.

This movie revisits the loss of Bruce's parents in a much more intimate and profound way.  You know what they meant to him personally and the lessons his father was teaching him about life, both by example and by instruction.  Fate and the intervention of a friend redirect his life away from simple hate/revenge into a need to understand the murder of his parents, resulting in his walking away from his privileged lifestyle to enter the world of criminals.  While learning more about his own nature and the nature of criminals he still struggles with his anger and uses his new lifestyle as a means of acting out that aggression, but without any real purpose.  He comes no closer to understanding the criminal mind and is unable to find any solace from his pain.  He finally ends up in prison, reveling in the constant conflict.

The introduction of Ducard into this dismal world provides Bruce with a source of focus and a redirection for that anger.  Through his training with Ducard he learns to control his own emotions and become more than a scared child wanting to avenge his parents. He becomes a man, a man with a purpose and the ability to fulfill that purpose.  He is still fallible, he still struggles with his loss and his new role, but he is learning from each new struggle and failure.  He learns to rely on those who have proven their loyalty and trust in himself.  Even the realization that he not only trusted, but actually saved the life of the man intent on destroying Gotham does not shake his new strength and resolve.

Christian Bale's portrayal brings Batman's dark, conflicted nature back to the screen, but this time the audience has a greater understanding of those conflicts. He shows us what drives Batman to devote his life to protecting the citizens of Gotham from evil while sacrificing the ability to have a real life of his own.",1146528000,5,2450,4.665116279069768
1569899,5,B00005JNJV,"With the release of ""Batman Begins"", the bar has been raised to new heights in terms of superhero movies. Though once thought of as lame and corny, superhero movies like this one show that they can be moving and thoughtful films. Not only is ""Batman Begins"" a physically beautiful film, there are some excellent performances and a well spun plot with enough twists, turns, and action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie.

Christian Bale is outstanding as Bruce Wayne, a young heir who swears vengeance on the criminals of Gotham City after his parents are brutally murdered by a thug. Bruce travels the world as a small-time criminal, looking to get back at ""those who prey on the fearful"", before he is invited to join the League of Shadows, led by the notorious Ra's Al-Ghul. However, when the League gives him a mission he cannot bring himself to complete after his training, he returns to Gotham City in an attempt to save it from criminals and corruption. He receives great resistance along the way, especially from Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka The Scarecrow, played  a deliciously villainous Cillian Murphy. As Batman unravels The Scarecrow's plot, he is determined to do all he can to stop him.

""Batman Begins"" brings a kind of emotional tension not normally seen in superhero movies. Christian Bale does a great job channeling Bruce Wayne's soul, layered with anger and guilt about the death of his parents. He is so into acheiving justice that, surprisingly enough for a superhero flick, he completely ignores the girl (Rachel Dawes played by Katie Holmes) until the end of the movie. In this and other ways, ""Batman Begins"" soars to new heights and proves that superhero movies do not have to be cheesy and over the top, but can prove to be excellent movies that rival any of the great ones of 2005.",1146355200,8,1843,4.753125
1569900,3,B00005JNJV,"This was the first Batman movie I had ever seen so I am not comparing it with any of the previous films in this series or whatever.  So then:

It was OK.  That about sums it up.  There were some cool parts and scenes and the concept of the villians weapon were pretty cool but the movie didn't have enough excitement for this type of film.  I never felt that batman was in much danger and he probably wasn't.  Christian Bale played the part decently but that darned raspy voice that many other reviewers complained about was getting to me too after a while.  The action sequences were not filmed very well with too much in-close camera work to really see what was going on.  The fighting itself was solid but I wanted to get a wider view of it all.

The backstory of how Batman came to be was pretty interesting and I enjoyed this almost more than when Batman actually came on screen.  Quite frankly,  the first hour of the film although slow at times was better than the last hour due to this backstory and build-up.  You could feel the anger of Bruce Wayne and his desire to clean up the city.

There were the usual attempts at humor which I really hate in movies these days especially when they try them at what are supposed to be tense moments. Also, there were several cliche situations that you'll find in most action films.  I was impressed with the special effects and I was glad to see that CGI did NOT dominate the movie like it often does.  The directing by Nolan overall was solid but he needs camera work help as mentioned before.

Katie Holmes was...well..... just another young, cute Hollywood actress.  You could have casted just about anyone in this picture without it making a difference.  The rest of the cast was solid if unspectacular.

Overall I would sugest watching it as something to do for a couple hours but don't get your hopes up too high.  It was decent, not a blockbuster and I can't see myself buying it since I'd probably never watch it again.",1146096000,3,1976,4.421052631578948

Its great and if u are a fan of the Batman movies or just Batman in general you should definetly see this movie.  The plot and story in this movie is probably better than all the rest, the action is very cool and you will really get sucked into the dark world of Gotham.  The only problem that i had with it was that i wanted to see more of the villians of gotham, but the scarecrow was pretty scary and i guess all the other movies show the other villians.

1569902,2,B00005JNJV,"Like everyone of us, I grew up with Batman. It has been an enduring image. I remember wearing a towel for a cape, and much to the chagrin of mother, charging through the house and jumping off couches, imitating Batman, when I was younger.

I am suprised to say the least, the proper choice of words would be appalled, shocked and angered to see the way Batman was depicted in this movie.

Mark you, the story line is not too bad, and stellar performances by Michael Cain, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are truly enjoyable. But the main character, Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman was played by arguably the worst actor in present day Cinema.

Christian Bale has a speech impediment and an acting impediment. That guy couldn't act convincingly for 10 seconds to save his life. He looks like one of those moronic farm hands, the kind at whom you throw an insult, and they say ""Oh yeah..."" and pause for like forever, are lost for a comeback and then say something lame.

You know the kind? Incredibly dumb, with a jaw jutting out like a neanderthal...?

And Katie holmes is equally bad. Having a cherubic face is not an acceptable compromise for the skills required to act in a movie. Through out the movie, they concentrate on head shots of her. The viewer is supposed to just admire her mug... I think not, we came to watch a bloody movie. And then she has that crooked smile... it looked so silly after some time. She just didn't have the personality or presence required to pull off a crooked smile, let alone a role as that of a Batman romantic interest.

Nicole kidman and now Katie Holmes... what has the world come to!!!

The story line, as I said, wasn't too bad. But after a while, I was just sitting and watching Christian murder the movie with his absolutely terrible acting. I grimaced each time he just stood there, unable to emote or deliver his dialogues.

CHRISTIAN BALE SUCKED!!

I am deeply anguished and scarred by this movie. If it was possible, I would consider filing a law suit against the makers of this movie for scarring the image of a hero that we have all cherished for countless generations.

I gave it 2 stars, because of Freeman, Neeson and Cain.

This movie sucks, don't pay to watch it.

1569903,4,B00005JNJV,"Compared to Joel Schumacher's eternally pitiful excuse for a movie--AKA Batman Forever--Batman Begins is heaven.  Christopher Nolan has definitely done his homework, and has taken the persona of Batman back to the dark, brooding, mysterious, tormented realm the character BELONGS in; he is to be thanked for helping us forget the bad taste Schumacher's laughable product left in our mouths.  But even if we disregard Schumacher for a moment, Batman Begins by itself is a triumph.  Everything about the movie--from the locations and sets to the cinematography to the music--is dark and atmospheric.  Even the Wayne mansion that we see young Bruce in is gothic and foreboding.

What made this movie one of my favorites of all time is its psychology: Nolan decided to give the audience a glimpse into Bruce's tormented mind and soul, which hasn't happened before in a Batman movie.  This is done mainly via Bruce's conversations with Ducard (Liam Neeson) as Bruce reveals some of his most intimate and guarded thoughts and memories regarding his parents' death, his opinion on the modern legal system, and his desire and need for personal gratification (i.e. vengeance).  And Christian Bale is to be hailed for pulling all of this off while making it look easy.  And because of all this, the first half of the movie--in which Bruce hasn't even become Batman yet--is actually the best part; all the action, fighting, and high-tech gadgets take a back seat to this important development, for both Bruce and the movie.

In an otherwise strong cast, the one weak link in the chain is Katie Holmes.  She is a mediocre actress at best, and is unable to fully sell an important role like that of Rachel Dawes, who obviously holds a special place in Bruce's heart.  So it's ironic that Holmes has one of the most important lines in the movie, at the end when Rachel rejects Bruce.  This cuts his last remaining bridge to the ""light"" world, and he is left entirely in the ""shadow"" world, the world of Batman.  Bruce is left with the realization that now, thanks to fate and the choices he made, there is no going back; he is more Batman than Wayne, and the only thing he can do from here on is press forward.

But as far as the DVD (not the movie itself) is concerned...what is up with the bonus materials section?  Just a theatrical trailer?  That's it?  Not a single featurette, not a single interview?  And now WB is coming out with a ""deluxe"" DVD edition...is this a cheap ploy to squeeze more dollars out of fans or what?  Shame on you, WB...",1145318400,5,2535,4.720454545454546

1570015,3,B00005JNJV,"An insouciant Bruce falls into a backyard well and crashes against a pile of unforgiving rock, only to discover -- or rediscover -- the terror of cacophonous bat wings knifing through the space where he lies prostrate.  Timely Dad, the esteemed and hugely affluent Thomas Wayne, quickly descends the well shaft, offering therapy in the form of mechanically compassionate eyes and bite-sized moralisms, and Bruce's crying subsides.  But the bats aren't terrible or awe-inducing.  The fall may have stung -- even required impressive quantities of antiseptic - but the bats remain uneventful and even superfluous, passing so abruptly and formlessly that attention shifts (contrary to the film's intentions) excitedly to the abyss beyond them, where real childish exploration could happily begin.

In Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins the obvious too often shapes experience. Bat-fear becomes an unfounded fetish for young Bruce, as Dad seems increasingly eager to reinforce his son's effeminate response to inane danger:  whimper, clutch the hand of a deferential loved one, and crawl beneath the bed sheets until a God-like father simplifies life into machismo folly by brandishing marital gifts signifying nobility and a penchant for female objectification.  So Bruce cries and cries -- a tragic commentary on the meekness of privileged children -- until he mistakes costumed actors for bats while attending the opera and (surprise!) cries his parents into an alley where a token criminal shoots them.  Never mind Dad's parting words, whispered to his son with unfittingly eerie stoicism, or Mrs. Wayne's (did she have a first name?) wooden disorientation. Bruce exercises restraint when the viewer expects him to implode; ostensibly unmoved by the finality of his parents' departure, he gazes - almost listlessly -- beyond the immediacy of the crime scene, and the viewer loses him during this moment of uneven malaise - or is it eighty-year-old resignation?

After the formalities of a funeral, a pinch of plot-moving dialogue, and Alfred claiming surrogate-Dad status,  the film indulges a fully mature Bruce (Christian Bale) self-imprisoned in an off-the-map Asian penitentiary, veritably linking adulthood aimlessness with the alleyway slaughter of yore. Importantly, Bale's character isn't convincing as a necessary extension of a traumatic childhood and gripping phobias.  His physical prowess, brooding glances, and witty quips better argue for a curious intellectual in search of higher meaning, a man rejecting the vacuousness of his inheritance and formal education to evolve into something more authentically self-determined.  And when locked into this unnamed despair, Bale entwines primordial violence and youthful ambition and introspection to shine considerably brighter than any previous incarnation of Bruce.

When Batman finally emerges (ungodly long gestation be done!), everybody's enamored - though only temporarily.  Too quick for the eye to capture, he twists his way through a gaggle of stunned gun-wielding cronies with grace and uncanny precision while sound creates a palpable impression of terror. His greatest skills culminate in an assault equal parts feasible, heroic, and bone-chillingly invisible. Unfortunately, close-ups soon destroy Batman's sexy elusiveness, as Bale doesn't have enough freakishness to settle into the costume, whose short inward-turned ears appear laughably feline.  The Voice ranges from hoarse to overly echoic and scares only when divorced from Bale's over-sized round jaw and curled tongue. And Batman transforms into something unfamiliar: the Batmobile, in desperate need of an ethical overhaul, upends traffic and devours property at a militaristic rate.  At its helm, Batman becomes an uneconomical sensationalist willingly jeopardizing hundreds of lives to secure the safety of childhood friend.  Suddenly, dangling corrupt cops from scaffolds during fits of malice seems arbitrary and cheaply manic, and were it not for the mechanics of a standard good-versus-evil plotline, tripartite Bruce would spin the movie out of control.

Nolan deserves credit for bravely attempting to harness Batman's psychological genesis - a directorial first.  The visually incessant symbols of Bruce's childhood may strive to provide a believable superhero impetus, but the all-too-dissonant first two Bruces push the film into irreconcilable universes -- unnecessary emphasis on origins reveals Batman as too fundamentally fantastic for real-world explanations and psychoses.

1570021,5,B00005JNJV,"Here's the style that irritates me to no end in books but more so in movies. Movies are really projects about making money. They are very short term investment opportunities. So unlike the legal FIFO rule, it's crap in; crap out, or garbage in; garbage out, as long as we make money. So the dark hero quipping jokes with his female/old/disabled/African American partner, sells to kids but makes your suspension of disbelief that much more difficult. Was the character supposed to be a hard guy? Then don't make him Henny Youngman or Chris Rock.

""Batman Begins"" is true to those ideals. First of all Christian Bale looks like I imagined (before all the 'pretenders') Batman should look. The guy is built. Secondly, Batman's etiology does not include doing stand-up in LA. He's not funny. Michael Caine can be funny. I didn't know that. But you always suspected that Alfred was kind of wry, involved but seemingly above it all. Liam Neeson was a good choice, kind of like Costner, willing to take a second, supporting role. Sean Bean also would have been a good choice. Katie Holmes. Lollipop role.

But all those characters avoid making it a parody. You take the movie seriously. And Bruce Wayne is a shallow playboy, and Batman is a cold hearted, driven, vigilante, super hero.

Spiderman made millions but it was a comedy played for (often) 12-year old humor and a hot Dunst. Hard to take him seriously if you were over 20. Hulk was a joke. Avenger started out fairly tight and evolved into oddballs and flatulent humor. Early Batmans? You're kidding me, right?

The clever link at the end to the ""joker"" story is a nice touch, and the bats (as Bruce calls them, the ""reinforcements"") are terrific. This film always takes seriously its obligation to provide the psychological beginnings of the Batman character -- and this is not a small challenge.

Christian Bale handles the double focus between boy-next-door and gravel-throated, dangerous  hero better than most actors could hope to do. I adored Michael Keaton & didn't think anyone could replace him as Batman, but I'm happy with the swtich.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman provide a magnificent supporting cast, and the shots of glittering ""Gotham City"" and the high-tech effects -- for instance the wonderful batmobile (as one homeless person announces mid-film ""NICE RIDE"") -- make this movie a delight to watch. Michael Caine's humanity especially gives the film depth. Caine's (""Alfred's"") affection for Bruce Wayne is indeed contagious.

The diversion to the Far East is a bit strange (and I'm not sure entirely necessary, especially since it does strangely contaminate Bruce). Why does every warrior need to learn his stuff on the top of a high mountain in Tibet (or the equivalent)? The first half of the film therefore drags a bit. But in the end the payoff is worth every minute.

I also like the way that the romantic interest is handled here. Not as frustrating as in the Spiderman movies. At least we get a KISS, and some sense that the girl knows the score!!

The four movies from the last decade never happened!! The director took them all and flushed down the toilet! As a matter of fact, it's a good thing pretending that these movies never happened because all of them are very untrue to the comics, so forget about them!

Batman Begins is the first movie that adapted Batman's comics the right way. There is no such things as a Joker killing Bruce's parents, bat-nipples, bat-card or an excentric Two-faces. EVERY BATMAN LIVE ACTION MOVIE FROM THE 90'S ARE WRONG! They never happened and they never will!

Batman Begins is the only one Batman movie now. Even the things that Nolan and Goyer created for the movie can be incorporated to the comics mithology, like Ras being Bruce's master, for example, or the assassing, Joe Kill (his name in the comics) being dead by that woman, witch explains why the assassing was never found again. The new Batman is not only true to reality, but also true to the essence of the character.

Even better: this movie can also work as a prelude to Mask of the Phantasm (the 90's masterpiece animated movie). It fits great! No reason for the live action craps of the 90's to be remembered, so forget all about them and stick to this movie.",1142208000,,1351,4.551440329218107

Upon his release, the young American joins the stranger, a man called Ducard, in the mountain domicile of ninja cult leader Ra's Al Ghul, where he begins refining his skills of combat and stealth in addition to learning the arts of deception, intimidation, and theatricality. During his time with this mysterious ""League of Shadows,"" the young man reveals the secrets of his tragic life and his obsessive quest for the means to fight injustice. We learn that his name is Bruce Wayne, and he is the only surviving heir to the great Wayne Family fortune of Gotham City. His parents brutally murdered before his eyes in an alley when he was only 8, Bruce has spent every moment since then acquiring knowledge and skills to help him in his as yet unclear goal of becoming an enemy of crime. Once his training with the League of Shadows is complete, Bruce is ready to return to Gotham and begin his fight against the criminal element, but maniacal Ra's Al Ghul has other plans for him! After a daring escape that appears to spell the end for Ra's, Bruce finds himself on a jet plane bound for Gotham, his loyal family butler, Alfred, at his side. On the trip home, Bruce tells Alfred the nature of his travels these past 7 years and of his plans to take on the villains of Gotham with a dramatic dual-identity meant to strike fear into the hearts of evil-doers. With the help of Alfred and a Wayne Enterprises employee named Lucius Fox, a scientific and technological genius, Bruce takes on the identity of his greatest childhood fear, the bat, setting up shop in the caves beneath his family mansion and developing an unequalled arsenal of gadgets and gear to aid him in his fight against crime. Wearing the mask of a billionaire playboy by day and stalking the rooftops of Gotham at night in the guise of the Batman, Bruce becomes both a myth and a living legend to the downtrodden people of the corrupt and dangerous city.  The Batman first sets his sights on exposing notorious mob boss Carmine Falcone, enlisting the aid of childhood friend Rachel Dawes, Gotham's beautiful assistant D.A., and the one trustworthy cop in the city, the kindly Police Sergeant Jim Gordon. However, the Bat's investigation into Falcone soon uncovers much more than he expected, revealing a plot to victimize the citizens of Gotham and involving the sinister and powerful Dr. Jonathan Crane of Arkham Asylum and a higher power so evil that even the arrogant Carmine Falcone is intimidated!

After director Joel Schumacher destroyed the promising Bat-franchise created by Tim Burton's 1989 film, ""Batman,"" taking it in the direction of the enjoyable yet extremely campy kids' TV show of the 1960's rather than treating the Bat with the respect his fans demand and deserve, it seemed the Dark Knight would never be allowed to grace the silver-screen again. Then came ""Batman Begins,"" a fantastic new take on the bat more true to the character comic and animation fans know and love! This is a dark, brooding, even terrifying Batman, angry at the criminal element that destroyed his parents and his childhood, and dead-set on bringing justice to the city his family once nurtured and loved. The always wonderful Christian Bale seems born to play the Bat, bringing the right amount of intensity and emotion to both hero and secret identity. Katie Holmes is both beautiful and noble as the high-idealed Rachel Dawes. Gary Oldman continues to impress and surprise with the most perfect incarnation of Jim Gordon I could ever hope for! And, though I never would have thought to cast him myself, Michael Caine shines as Alfred Pennyworth, bringing his own charming and original take to the role. The great Morgan Freeman is wise and endearing as Lucius Fox, the Bat's gadget man. Of course, we can't forget the amazing villains so crucial to any Batman tale! By far the favorite is Cillian Murphy, who is fantastically creepy as Dr. Jonathan Crane, AKA the Scarecrow, taking the role right to the top at times, but never going over! A perfect Batman villain performance! Liam Neeson is always flawless, this time playing the role of Henri Ducard, a man with a past as dark and mysterious as The Batman's. And the magnificent Tom Wilkinson is terrific as the sleazy crime-boss Carmine Falcone. The story is inspired! The choice of subject and characters is perfect for a tale of the very origins of the Dark Knight, everything about it reflecting the core subjects of fear, deception, theatricality, intimidation, symbolism, madness, and the nature of justice! These are the things the Batman is all about! I certainly hope there will be many more films in this new Batman line, as long as they all share the strength and realism of this one! A tale involving the Mad Hatter would be fantastic! Might I suggest Paul Giamatti? How about Crispin Glover as the Joker? And Christopher Lloyd is long overdue to play Mr. Freeze!

What director/writer Christopher Nolan and co-writer David S. Goyer created with ""Batman Begins"" is nothing less than a masterpiece for the superhero film genre. There is nothing ""cartoony"" about this Batman, something that truly differentiates it from all the live-action, big-screen attempts that came before it. There are scenes of such perfection that they demand mentioning. For example, Cillian Murphy's brilliant performance in the bowels of Arkham Asylum, as he boils-over with anticipation at a 2nd encounter with Batman. There's also the wonderful scene where Batman converses briefly with Jim Gordon outside his own modest home. I love all the Jim/Batman scenes, and Batman's use of live bats as ""backup"" at Arkham was fantastic! My favorite scene by far, though, must be the final scene between Batman and Gordon, where we are given a drool-enducing bit of foreshadowing in the form of a simple playing card!

The 2-disc DVD of ""Batman Begins"" is just glorious!

Yes, the new Batmobile is very tank-like, and I would love to see a little style added to it in future installments (its crude simplicity is understandable in the beginning). Maybe smooth out the body just a bit and add a couple of bat-wing fins. Of course, I'd rather see less style than TOO MUCH. You also get image galleries and gadget and character overviews. Plus, if you pick up the DELUXE 2-disc Edition (as I did), you also will get a very nice, exclusive comic book and a case to hold the book and DVD together. The high-quality comic features three stories, The Man Who Falls (1989), Bat-Man in The Case of the Chemical Syndicate (1939), and a 48-page excerpt from The Long Halloween (1996).

1570242,2,B00005JNJV,"I didn't like the film nearly as much as the 1989, 1992 and 1995 movies, but yes, it was WAY WAY WAY WAY better than the 1997 film. Still not as good as the first Batman and I think I liked even Batman Forever more than this one.

Firstly, if you're going to end up knowing who killed Wayne's parents, fine, but make it someone worthy (like the Joker). Batman never knew who killed his parents in the comic and I think that was vital to why he continues to be Batman. When are screenwriters going to realize not to tinker with the comic. What made Spiderman and X-Men work was that it honored the core elements of the comic.

Secondly, the villians were kind of plain. They don't need to be toony and over-the-top like Two-Face and the Riddler were, but a good mix of gritty realism and comic appeal (i.e. Jack Nicholson, Devito and Phiffer) would have helped.

They also had no cool superhero music. All great superhero movies from Superman's I and II, to X-Men to Spiderman all have great superhero music. I loved the gritty Elfman theme and the Batman Forever theme worked too, even if the rest of the movie was a bit over the top. Where's the superhero music?

Finally, the Batmobile didn't look like a car, it looked liked a tank. The Batmobile is supposed to be stylish.

Liked the fact that it was grittier than the last two films and had good narrative, I think it tried too hard not to be 'Batman and Robin.' Michael Keaton did a great job with the first two and there was no need to totally separate it from the previous franchise, which was actually really good except for the last one.",1141516800,2,1597,4.381756756756757

Michael Caine and Gary Oldman are great casts in their respective characters of Alfred and Jim Gordon whereas Katie Holmes gives a rather expected low performance of Bruce's childhood friend Rachel.

Cast:  Christian Bale, Michael Cane, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Morgan Freeman.

Running Time:  141 minutes

Rated PG-13 for intense action violence, disturbing images and some thematic elements.

The last time we saw Batman in action he was wearing a rubber suit with nipples, had Elle Macpherson for a girlfriend, strolled around a neon-infested landscape, and fought ultimate evil in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger (his weapon of choice being puns). Things were not well in Gotham. Eight years later, DC Comics and Warner Brothers, weary of constantly being left in the dust as Marvel chalks up win after win (the glorious ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" franchises), return to the silver screen with the definitive caped crusader adventure, ""Batman Begins.""  Unable to seek revenge over the brutal murder of his beloved parents, billionaire/heir Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) leaves his privileged world behind in disgust, only to end up in a seedy Asian prison fighting for his life. Bruce is rescued by a mysterious figure named Ducard (Liam Neeson) who offers the lost soul a chance to join his clan of ninja, led by the enigmatic Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe in a cameo). Bruce agrees, and is soon tutored in the ways of stealth, honor, and justice. Fearing his home of Gotham City is sinking under the weight of corruption and crime, Bruce returns to Wayne Manor and sets up shop, building a bat suit and assorted crime-stopping toys with the help of a tech genius (Morgan Freeman) and Bruce's trusty butler, Alfred (Michael Caine). Stalking the streets of Gotham at night, looking to stamp out crime through intimidation, Batman/Bruce finds greater evil coming as the fear-mongering Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy, ""28 Days Later"") begins his nefarious plans to rid the city of whatever harmony is left in the streets.

Written by David Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy), ""Batman Begins"" is a confident origin story that starts this new franchise at ground zero. The film is a polar opposite experience from the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series, which trafficked in pop culture and cartoon-like adventure to provide big-budget entertainment. ""Begins"" returns Batman to his dark, comic book origins, trusting the audience to be patient while cautious director Christopher Nolan (""Memento,"" ""Insomnia"") painstakingly builds and arranges this shadowy cinematic world from scratch. Those accustomed to the sweetened thrills of the earlier films are in for a rude awakening with ""Begins,"" for it desires to construct a solid initial base for the character, not paint the town red with gags and style in a quest to keep the story mindlessly moving forward. Nolan's film handles exactly like 1978's ""Superman,"" which also took its time getting the audience used to personalities and the locations. Goodness, it takes a full hour before the film even hands the audience some actual Dark Knight action. However, patience is rewarded with a full-bodied representation of Wayne's journey from cowardice to heroism, taking its time ensuring that the leap into the fantastical isn't a disruptive one, along with setting up a nice tone of heightened authenticity in Wayne's transformation into Batman (seen in Bruce's fear of bats and desire to intimidate his enemies). The film may not reflect reality, but Goyer and Nolan do a terrific job capturing verisimilitude for Bruce and his bat world.

The theme of ""Begins"" is fear, and how it can affect all creatures regardless of might. From Bruce's conquering of his demons to become Batman to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin (which paralyzes victims into a state of horror), the idea of fear is worked to the bone in ""Begins."" Since the movie is not afraid to get chillingly sinister in tone or cinematography, Nolan milks the idea of terror well, seen often in the macabre distorted images presented in the Scarecrow's toxin-induced hallucinations (which makes the picture not terribly appropriate for young children). ""Begins"" isn't even close to the light fare that Schumacher brought the series in back in the mid-1990s, which was layered with camp and one-liners. Nolan's film is more fierce and demonstrative in brood, which gives the film oodles of gravitas and energy, helped along significantly by the propulsive score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, which oddly eschews traditional heroic themes.

Boasting an all-star cast of grand acting talents, ""Begins"" gives every actor plenty to work with, and the fun is written across their faces. Also appearing are Gary Oldman as the friendly cop Jim Gordon, Katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend, now Gotham D.A. Rachel Dawes, Tom Wilkinson hamming it up as mob boss Carmine Falcone, and Rutger Hauer as Wayne Enterprises chairman, Richard Earle. The supporting cast works dutifully fleshing out the ""Batman"" experience, but the center of attention is Christian Bale, and he deserves heaps of credit for making ""Begins"" come together as expertly as it does. Taking a role with dubious lineage, Bale reinvents the Bruce Wayne character, making him a person of action and crafty intelligence, not of words. While Bale has expected trouble trying to emote trapped in a restrictive rubber costume, the actor dives deeply into the role, and is a deciding factor in the film's successful grand design to strip the franchise down and piece it back together differently. It's wonderful work here from Bale, who gives Batman authority without winking and the outfit realism without much assistance from special effects. The tone of the film stresses practicality while retaining a comic book mood and nothing spells that out more than the film's final moment, which superbly sets up the villain for the inevitable sequel.  A rip-roaring, exceptional entry (or newfound expansion) of the DC comic fame and one of the better action films in recent memory.",1141084800,4,5951,5.200417536534447
1570246,5,B00005JNJV,"Quite possibly the movie of the year.

I went into this thinking, ""They've DONE the whole Batman thing. Why put us through it AGAIN?! The first Burton/Keaton Batman was da bomb. ""Returns"" was decent, ""Forever"" was entertaining but sadly lacking. Seriously, with a cast like Drew Barrymore, Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones, Nicole Kidman, Val Kilmer, and Kevin Grevioux (Raze of Underworld fame), how could Schumacher screw that up? Well, he found a way, and with the release of ""Batman & Robin,"" it became painfully obvious that the end of Batman was more than just ""in sight,"" it was here.

I grieved the death of what could have been a terriffic franchise, and I moved on.

Then along comes Goyer. He wrote ""Blade: Trinity,"" and while I am NO fan of that movie, we'll blame the studio's cut and Parker Posey's horrible acting...for now. I will give him the benefit of the doubt because he has also written some great screenplays and stories. Blade, Blade 2, and Dark City are all his, but his writing abilities seem to be more hit-and-miss than substantially consistent talent.

Christopher Nolan directs and kicks in his two cents' worth in the screenplay department... I'm not impressed with his body of work. I liked Insomnia, but let's face it: Nothing I'd seen so far said to me that Batman Begins would even be watchable, much less entertaining.

To be honest, I didn't even WANT to like this movie for several reasons...

* Michael Keaton did so well with Batman

* Schumacher was so total in his obliteration of the franchise, I could not see any reason to beat the dead horse

* A fan of the ""Dark Knight"" I was tired of being disappointed at the cinema by the direction in which the franchise had gone

I must say that I'm very glad I saw this in the theater (on the ""big screen""). Just think; I almost missed witnessing a true rebirth of this franchise!

The casting was work of art in itself. Some unlikely choices really REALLY pay off. Two character actors were cast against type, but it seems to have been a brilliant choice!

The effects were dynamic, and the sets and backgrounds were more than realistic. The stunts seemed to be more wire work than CGI (thankfully), lending a more believable and realistic feel to this endeavor. And gone (again, thankfully) are the hiddeous nipples from the Bat-Suit! (Curses Joel Schumacher for ever adding them in !!)

The thing which most impressed me about this film was the story. It was fantastic! I've read reviews by the ""professional"" reviewers, and one in particular claimed that the movie got lost in the beginning to find itself again only at the end. I'm learning NOT to listen to the ""professional"" reviewers and to judge for myself.

I have to say that by going through the changes in the beginning, you fully understand the motivations and abilities demonstrated by the Dark Knight. Because quite frankly, this isn't just Batman anymore. If the new franchise follows this first installment, it will literally BE the Dark Knight vein of the comic book series! THIS is the Batman I grew up with, not the campy, weak-@ss byotch who cracks off one-liners while feebly dealing justice to ineptly stupid criminal miscreants. Adam West was ""A"" Batman. Michael Keaton was ""THE"" Batman. Bale is the Dark Knight; it's a totally different animal.

The nemeses in this one are Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow, with a promise of meeting the Dark Knight's ""Joker"" in the next installment!

This movie exhibits perfect direction from start to finish, never loses itself, never loses the audience, and with great relish fights its way through to a superb and satisfying ending.

I can't WAIT for the next one!

It gets a 9.5/10 and yes, that's a big leap from the rating I gave Burton's Batman cuz let's face it: Bale isn't a better Batman, but the movie itself is LIGHTYEARS better!",1140739200,5,3833,4.72263868065967
1570247,5,B00005JNJV,"The ultimate argument of ""Batman Begins"" is that Batman is really more like Superman than we have suspected. The two DC comic book superheroes have always been like night and day, with Batman prowling Gotham City at night relying on only his finely honed human abilities while Superman uses his superpowers for truth, justice, and the American way. But one of the things that made Superman unique was that he really is Superman, the strange visitor from another planet: he pretends to be Clark Kent. ""Batman Begins"" argues that the same thing applies to Batman. His name might be Bruce Wayne, but the billionaire the world sees is just a construct. Batman is his true face.

Batman is a psychotic and in this 2005 film we find out why. Before his parents were murdered young Master Wayne had a fateful encounter with a whole bunch of bats, and the two events actually end up being related, which makes the death of his parents even more tragic. Despite the protestations of the loyal Alfred, Bruce Wayne knows it is his fault. But while becoming a crime fighter is inevitable there is still a choice as to how that war will be waged, which means traveling halfway around the world to be mentored and trained.. Then he must return to Gotham City and transform himself into a creature of the night whose very appearance will terrorize the criminals and supply himself with the gadgets that will give him a fighting chance on the streets. However, Gotham is being threatened by more than its ruling crime lord and the stakes are higher than our hero knows.

The problem is that I hate the frantic pace of film editing in action films like ""Batman Begins."" I am not overly enamored of hand held camera work either, but it is constant cutting in contemporary montage that is driving me crazy. When I go to a theater to see a movie I would like to actually see what is going on and not have to wait until the DVD comes out to slow things down to really see what is going on. This approach to editing did not start with ""Batman Begins,"" but since I was looking forward to this cinematic retelling of the origin of the Dark Knight it was particularly bothersome. Every time Batman starts fighting the images are on the screen long enough that I can tell it is a new shot but then we are on to the next one while I try to make sense of the jumbled images of these fight scenes.

Maybe the key reason why ""Spider-Man 2"" remains the best comic book movie to date is because since the tentacles of Doctor Octopus had to be computer generated Spider-Man was be as well in their big fight scenes. There is not a sequences as good in ""Batman Returns"" as the one where Spidey and Doc Ock battle on the side of the building in ""Spider-Man 2,"" mainly because there is not a single shot in the action sequences of this new film even half as long as that one. Meanwhile there are lots of martial arts films in which we managed to see what is happening during their big fight sequences, so how come we cannot do the same thing in this Batman movie? When Batman fights I want to see what he is doing flip through shots like I was flipping through the pages of an issue of a ""Batman"" comic book. It is maddening.

The big irony is that usually movies about comic book superheroes sacrifice story to action, but that is not the case with this screenplay, co-written by director Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer (based on characters created by Bob Kane, but with obvious nods to Frank Miller's work, especially ""Batman: Year One""). Originally the story was quite simple: young Bruce Wayne sees his parents gunned down by a robber. He builds up his body, studies science and decides to become a masked vigilante, taking as his inspiration a bat that flies against a window of Wayne Manor. Noland and Goyer provide more depth to the origin, which adds to the depth of the character as well, which is why I rounded up on this one in the end. The only real flaw in their script is an over reliance on the screenwriting trick of doubling up on dialogue (if a line is good once maybe it will be even better a second time). That is why when people talk about their favorite bits in this film they will probably be talking about one-liners (virtually every scene has one) and not any particular action sequence or specific gag.

Few will be surprised that Christian Bale has no problems playing the Dark Knight, and a supporting cast that offers by Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman is pretty impressive for a comic book movie. It is too bad that Katie Holmes is not only 16 years younger than the youngest in that bunch because she seems like a kid and not an Assistant D.A. with a death wish, and there is no reason for her to be around for the next one given her benedictory speech. Besides, if Batman works even more closely with Lieutenant Gordon to catch the Joker in the next movie, that would be fine with me. The bottom line here is that while I have no problem with the idea this is the best Batman movie to date, the action sequences were not as good as the other parts of the movie and they should have been in order to move ""Batman Begins"" from being very good to being truly great.",1140652800,2,5227,4.446298227320125

The always great Morgan Freedman plays a (James Bond's) ""Q"" type character, and helps Batman come up with all his familiar devices we so love from the stories.  It is interesting to see them in development -- as it is to see Bruce Wayne develop into the formidable Batman.

Christian Bale plays the part of Batman beautifully, and very believably, and of course having Liam Neelson in your movie is always a big plus.  Despite what you may have heard re Liam's part, it is NOT the same as his part in Star Wars, tho it seems so at first as you watch.

The characters were human and the relationships genuine. The chemistry of the cast is fantastic (though I have a hard time thinking of a film I didn't like with Morgan Freeman or Michael Caine). Hollywood cliches are deftly avoided and the ""love interest"" story line rode the fine line between being the focus of the film and avoiding the irrelevant fluff often seen in action films.

1570361,5,B00005JNJV,"The ""Batman"" concept has had an iron grip on American pop culture for decades, but for some reason the various adaptations of the Caped Crusader's tales to the Big Screen have been at best acceptable, and their worst, despicable.  Whatever the reason, there hasn't been a film version of ""Batman"" that really captured the essence of the ""Batman"" stories.

Until now, that is.  Christopher Nolan, of ""Memento"" fame, has made arguably the best ""comic book"" film ever with ""Batman Begins.""  (I know, fans of ""X-Men 2"" and ""Sin City"" get riled up with that assertion, but as Gene Hackman says in ""Crimson Tide,"" ""It's a short list."")  Taking the ""Batman"" story closer to the ""Dark Knight"" versions of our hero and eschewing the more campy elements of other interpretations, Nolan takes an all-star cast and makes a movie that should have George Clooney, Val Kilmer, and even Michael Keaton calling their agents and screaming, ""This is the 'Batman' picture I should have made!""

Christian Bale takes over the title role, and works wonders with it.  Batman has always been a difficult hero to personify.  Not only is he a brilliant, daring muscleman, he has to possess the vulnerability brought about by the tragic loss of his parents.  He also has to bring off the ""billionaire playboy"" public persona of Bruce Wayne.  No actor donning the Bat Cape yet has achieved this balance with the same ease as Bale - perhaps this isn't surprising, since Bale has been disappearing into wonderful characters long before ""American Psycho"" -- his work as a young lad in 1987's ""Empire of the Sun"" and Kenneth Branagh's ""Henry V"" in 1989 was very impressive.

To ""help out the young guy,"" Nolan and his team assembled an all-star supporting cast, to say the least.  Michael Caine brings the necessary dignity to Alfred the Butler, but also the necessary affection and humor.  Gary Oldman is remarkably restrained as the lone straight arrow in the Gotham City police department as a young Jim Gordon.  Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe are creepy as young Wayne's tutors in the nefarious League of Shadows (more on them in a second).  Tom Wilkinson plays a gutter-boy-made-it-big crime lord.  Rutger Hauer plays a minor villain, as a deceitful corporate hack in charge of Wayne Enterprises.  Cillian Murphy (""28 Days Later"") brings a youthful menace to the Scarecrow.  And once again, Morgan Freeman almost steals the show as Wayne Enterprises' resident technical genius (and source for all the infamous Batman gizmos) Lucius Fox.

Only Katie Holmes, as Wayne's love interest and young D.A. Rachel Dawes, seems a bit overwhelmed by all this star power.  But I guess Scarlett Johannson can't be in *every* movie.

""Batman Begins"" is aptly titled, as the movie spends most of its time telling the tale of how Bruce Wayne forged the alter ego Batman after his parents were gunned down before his eyes as a lad of ten or so.  Wayne, struggling with guilt over his innocent role in his parents' murder as well as the crushing weight of his family's wealth and legacy, tries to research the criminal mind by hanging out with criminals and spending time in foreign jails as a petty thief.

There he is ""tapped"" by Henri Ducard (Neeson) as the chief trainer in the League of Shadows.  The League, a collection of ninja-warriors, has been dispensing its draconian form of justice for centuries.  Whenever a civilization gets too corrupt, the League brings it down so civilization can start anew.  ""We sacked Rome.  We were there when London burned.""  Neeson's Ducard is quite insane, but his insanity is so restricted by his rigid code of justice that he is more or less kept in check.  Wayne is stellar during the training, but he balks at the League's more draconian beliefs, and Wayne's belief in redemption sparks what is certain to be a long-standing feud between Wayne and the survivors of the League (oh, yeah, Wayne single-handedly burns their headquarters to the ground, which may require the League to ""get reacquainted"" with Wayne later in the movie).

Wayne returns ""from the dead"" to Gotham City just in time for the Scarecrow, Dr. Jonathan Crane, to unleash his plot to bring the city to its knees using a hallucinogenic drug and the city's water main.  All I'll say about that is that this plot line builds to one of the most amazing fight scenes imaginable involving Gotham City mass transit and the tank-like Batmobile.

A visual splendour, ""Batman Begins"" is also more realistic than the more recent stylized ""Batman"" movies.

I imagine a review of ""Batman Begins"" is redundant if you're already a Batman fan -- you've already seen this movie, probably more than once.  But if you've stayed away from Batman because of the terrible reputation of the previous movies, or the Adam West TV show, or because it's a 'comic book movie,' you should watch ""Batman Begins.""  It is a great entertainment, and hopefully the start of a great new line of movies about the Caped Crusader.",1140566400,6,4959,4.856123662306778
1570362,4,B00005JNJV,"When I was a kid, I grew up with the superhero comics:  Batman, Superman, Daredevil, Spiderman, Supergirl, and others. When the superhero movies started coming out, I know I always used this ""comic knowledge"" as a reference point to determine whether the screenplay was true to the character.  Superman being slowed down by a car thrown on him?  Give me a break!  The Hulk bounding across the landscape and avoiding pursuit?  Yeah!

Batman movies have been just okay...I'd say they tried to be more true to the Adam West TV character than the comics.  Artistic license, I guess.  They've never been my favorite.

Then came Batman Begins.

This is a great movie for the comic-based Batman buff.  The movie ""answers"" a number of questions.  Why bats anyway?  How did a billionaire playboy get these fighting skills with no one noticing?  How do you just happen to build a house around the Bat Cave (or vice versa)?  Where did Batman's suit and gadget technology come from, since Bruce Wayne never even finished college (actually, I'm not sure about the finishing college, but I think not)?  And who designed, in secret, the Batmobile?  Where did all of those psycho adversaries come from?  What was the origin of police commissioner Gordon's bond with Batman?  How did the bat signal get established?  My personal favorite was Bruce Wayne's learning process... he bounced off a number of roofs and walls before he figured things out!

This movie was very entertaining, with lots of action.  Michael Caine as Alfred the butler is a hoot!  Jim Gordon was all cop action.  Ducard (Liam Neeson) was okay, but a bit too much mumbo jumbo... Gotham City at its worse was never Sodom and Gomorrah!

The PG-13 rating is probably appropriate for the fighting scenes, but it could just as easily been a PG.",1140566400,4,1793,4.8

I loved the way it followed to life of Bruce Wayne in terms of how he actually becomes Batman. The other films didn't really do this, and if they did, somehow I missed it. It's my thought that the other films focused too much on the stars, and not enough on the story of Batman, itself. This movie is more closely related to the comic strip. It shows Batman as the dark character he is, without, compromising his compassion. This is a must see. I recommend it. I enjoyed it very much!!!",1140307200,,587,4.20353982300885
1570365,5,B00005JNJV,"The movie franchise that started with Tim Burton's ""Batman"" in the 1980's slowly transitioned from gothic thriller to an uneasy mix of Adam West camp and Bob Kane comics.  It was a wise decision for Warner Bros. to pretend those four movies never happened.

The result is Christopher Nolan's wonderful ""Batman Begins"", which explains Bruce Wayne's childhood, his quest for answers, his training to become a crime fighter, and his discovery of the tools that would make him into Batman in perfect detail.  The movie is darker than the Joel Schumacher Batman films were, undoubtedly, but a different type of dark than the Tim Burton films.  Instead of being gothic, the film is now a gritty, stylish noire, complete with sneering mob boss and corrupt cops.  Gotham City now resembles contemporary Chicago.

The cast is perfect.  Christian Bale is the best actor to step into the role of Batman so far.  His Bruce Wayne is believable and human, and his transition into the altar ego Batman is almost seamless, though he has a tendency to gargle a bit too much when slipping into his menacing ""Bat voice.""  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman bring much needed comic relief as butler Alfred and gadget-master Lucius Fox, respectively.  Michael Caine brings back fond memories of that OTHER Michael from the previous Bat-films.  Katie Holmes, like Kim Bassinger, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Nicole Kidman before her, is talented and absolutely stunning.  Unfortunately, her character is given precious little to do.

The true stars of the Batman films have always been the villains, though, and ""Batman Begins"" is no exception.  Cillian Murphy may not have the star power of Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, or Jim Carrey, but he delivers the stand-out performance of the movie, playing psychotic psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane.  It helps that Murphy auditioned for Bruce Wayne.  He's perfect as the hero's doppelganger, ranging from charming to oily to completely deranged.  As the villainous Scarecrow, he makes a simple burlap sack creepier than should be possible.  Liam Neeson, whose bold, commanding voice is second only to James Earl Jones', plays a character in the gray area between hero and villain.

There are a couple of drawbacks to the film, though.  First off, Nolan makes the action sequences too artistic for his own good.  The fights are montages of extreme close-ups and quick cuts.  Sure, it captures the mystique of the Dark Knight, but it's not so fun to watch.

My second complaint is the same that I had with Tim Burton's first Batman film.  In the comics, Bruce is forever motivated by the unsolved murder of his parents.  In both films, the murder of the parents is solved.  This time the killer of Bruce's parents is caught and killed before Bruce even becomes Batman.  As a result, Bruce's motivation to become Batman takes longer to explain than absolutely necessary.

Those minor quibbles aside, ""Batman Begins"" is the most human, and most entertaining, Batman movie so far.",1140220800,,2989,5.020325203252033

1570429,5,B00005JNJV,"Tim Burton's carnival film noir atmosphere is gone and Joel Schumacher's campiness is shelved. What is left is a straightforward Batman adventure whom everyone thought would have to be director-proof.  BATMAN BEGINS is what some say is the ""they-finally-got-it-right"" Batman movie. Director Christopher Nolan's vision seems to be what everyone can agree on, as Batman/Bruce Wayne doesn't play second fiddle to the villain(s) in this film.  He is definitely at the forefront of the story. Christian Bale is the most intense and angry Bruce Wayne so far in the series and his Batman is even angrier. The origin of Batman is explored with greater depths and one of the key ingredients is the character of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas Wayne played by Linus Roache, who comes off as interesting a character as Bruce Wayne. The story by co-screenwriters Nolan and David S. Goyer is multi-layered and involving tying in Batman's origin with a plot of an ancient secret society to destroy Gotham City. An impressive cast in this film surrounds Christian Bale. Gary Oldman who has made a career of playing evil characters is terrific as the pre-commissioner James Gordon (he's a police lieutenant in Batman's early days).  Gordon is given more depth and character in this film than in the previous films. The other standouts are Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox (playing a sort of James Bond's ""Q"" character) and Michael Caine as Alfred the butler.  When Alfred/Caine utters the one phrase ""Never!"" to Bruce Wayne's/Bale's ""You haven't given up on me yet!"", it is the single best line in the whole film! With the three powerhouse support characters, it is hard to remember that Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson, and Rutger Hauer also round out the cast. Lastly, Chicago is the backdrop for the fictionalized Gotham City and the film seems to break out from the restraints and confines of Anton Fursts set designs of the first films bringing the film more into the modern world. This is a great re-introduction of Batman to the motion picture scene and a needed boost for the Batman franchise. This reviewer hopes that the last scene with Gordon showing Batman the ""calling card"" of a certain villain is just the tip of the iceberg of what's in store of great things to come.",1139961600,2,2254,4.908136482939632

1570432,5,B00005JNJV,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's a good time to be a comic book nerd.

With the recent renaissance in good comic book films (starting with Blade in 1998 and really kicking into high gear with X-men in 2000), fans of characters like Wolverine, Peter Parker, and now the Dark Knight, have finally been able to enjoy movies that treat their source material with almost unerring respect, and yet still manage to stand alone as solid entertainment. Batman Begins, directed by Memento and Insomnia's Christopher Nolan and written by comic book veteran David S. Goyer, is the best thing to happen to the character since Bruce W. Timm's animated re-imagining of Batman more than a decade ago.

Like other ""comic book movies"" in recent years, Batman Begins lives up to its title, telling the origin story of Gotham's tormented savior from the death of his parents to the ""present day."" However, unlike Burton's boldly gothic world or the later, glitzier neon Batman incarnations, Nolan's live-action film places the story firmly in a recognizable reality, avoiding even the milder sci-fi trappings of the Spider-man and X-men films. Gotham City is not an evil-looking nest of fiersome gargoyles and gloomy cityscapes; it feels like a real american metropolis, albeit one that has obviously fallen on hard times. Economic depression has created street thugs of honest men and women, and the crime syndicates flourish while the powerful are too scared or too bribed to do anything.

All this changes when Bruce's parents are gunned down in an alley by a desperate man, leaving the grieving young boy alone in the world but for a childhood best friend, Racheal, and the family butler, Alfred. When robbed even of the chance to exact vengeance against his parents' murderer, Bruce Wayne abandons Gotham and his inheritance to disappear into the ciminal underworld, eventually ending up a prisoner in Asia. Here, a fateful meeting with Henry Ducard (Liam Neeson) and Ras Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) propels Bruce from his training as a member of the League of Shadows to donning the cape and cowl of the world's greatest detective.

The film's strengths lie not just in the refreshingly realistic sensibilites that the film uses to portray Begins' ihabitants (everything from corrupt city officials, bent cops, lone idealists, and cocksure kingpins manages to feel grandiose and familiar without coming off as overbearing or cliched), but also in the skill apparent in every frame of the film. The story is a very well-drawn tale that touches on Batman's complex but idealistic morality (something Burton's films forgot when it was time for Batman to break out the chainguns and bat-bombs), as well as creating credible villains.

For that matter, the entire world seems credible; Gotham doesn't look too much like any one city to be place (Chicago with multiple digital and practical enhancements plays the part), and everything from the stunts to the more outlandish technology never feels out of place in the film. The same can be said for the music; Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard collaberate to create a subtle yet very moving score that never tries to one-up or emulate Elfman's original.

However, perhaps the most impressive accolade the movie can claim is the cast. Christian Bale completely inhabits the dual role of Bruce Wayne/Batman with a feral strength and darkly ironic sensibility that never quite made it to the character in the previous live-action films. However, even more enjoyable is the supporting cast; Gary Oldman's Sgt. Gordon looks like he stepped right out of the pages of Batman: Year One, and is cast brilliantly against type as Batman's lone ally in the police force. Micheal Caine's Alfred is fraternal and likable enough for two roles, and Cillian Murphy's turn as Dr. Cane/The Scarecrow is so enjoyable that it's almost depressing that he is now unable to play the Joker in any future films. Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman also turn in slightly smaller but no less memorable roles as allies and adversaries to Bruce and his alter ego. These are thesbians who could sleepwalk through their roles in the movie, and yet every one of them turns in a grade-A performance.

The film is a pure delight for comic book fans, and does a fantastic job of obtaining its own identity as a very good hi-tech action/adventure film. In fact, the only (very miniscule) flaws of the movie lie in the more action-packed segments. Fisticuffs are never shot from quite enough distance, limiting the view of the coreography and creating perhaps a bit too much ""in your face"" intensity and not enough of the grace of Batman's combat style. It works the first time we see the Dark Knight in action, as we see from the criminal point of view, and it's mean to be disorientating and frightening. But by the time the duel on the monorail rolls around, one starts to wish that the fights could have been filmed more like The Matrix and less like The Bourne Supremacy.

However, these are small complaints in an otherwise astonishingly good and refreshingly serious take on the genre; a movie that is its own film first and foremost, and just also happens to be about comic book characters while treating its source material with the utmost respect.

The DVD itself (the double-disk deluxe edition) is a fine investment, not only containing the film with an excellent video and audio transfer, but an entire second disk of bonus features on everything from the secrets of the special effects (you'll be surprised what was real and what was computer generated) to the genesis of the redesigned Batmobile (and some cute comic book easter eggs to boot).

Batman Begins is one of the best movies ever at exploring how a superhero becomse a superhero. The darkness one probably would have to go through, as well as the training and experiences, are depicted very well.

Christain Bale is the best Batman and Bruce Wayne ever on screen. Cillian Murphy is wicked as the devious Scarcrow, and Michael Kane and Liam Neason perform their respective roles of influence well. On the other hand this is one of the few movies I've seen that Morgan Freeman failed to really impress me, and Katie Holms as Bruce's love interest is average at best. The only other real downside to this movie is it's really not a great storyline with a few too many major villans and some confusion towards the end. The actions scenes are terrific, and the new Batmobile is the coolest yet.

The best superhero movies for me are still Superman 1 and 2 and Spiderman 2. Batman Begins is the best Batman by default that none of the others were really that good.

If you appreciate action packed, fun movies, then you will love this movie, it really does not matter if you are into Batman or not, it's just a great movie, and this DVD has so many cool extra's that even if you have seen it, it is well worth the price to buy the C.D., highly recommended",1139097600,,1436,4.275735294117647
1570527,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins certainly isn't perfect, but it more than does the job of instilling new life into the Batman cinematic universe.  It's unfortunate that any filmmaker had to actually start from scratch and reexamine the origins of Batman, but what else can you do after 1997's Batman and Robin?  It should never have come to that, as Batman is by far the most compelling and human superhero ever envisioned.  I don't think the film truly gets the back-story right, but it does hit on Bruce Wayne's primary motivation - the fact that legal and political restraints keep the cops from truly succeeding on too many occasions.  As for that back-story, the murder of Bruce's parents is presented quite well, and his childhood before and after that fateful night also works.  Wayne the young adult, however, doesn't work for me.  Director Christopher Nolan really overplayed, in my opinion, the guilt factor and turned young Bruce into a jerk - when Katie Holmes has to slap some sense into you, you know you're a jerk.  And then there is the matter of Wayne's 7-year disappearance.  Personally, I think the story of Batman's foreign training in those years is best left shrouded in mystery.  In the movie, we see him trained by none other than Ra's Al Ghul - and that works great and really helps tie this movie together.  If you're familiar with Batman's history, however, you have to ask: who in his right mind would have Bruce Wayne train under Ra's Al Ghul, of all people?  In the comics, Batman never even met the guy until he kidnapped Robin and tried to recruit Batman to be his successor and son-in-law.

As you can see, I had a few problems with the first section of the film.  Once Wayne returns to Gotham City, however, and dons the cowl of the Batman, the film finally kicks in with all cylinders.  It's great to see a dark and gritty side to the character; when this version of Batman says ""he'll talk to me,"" he knows whereof he speaks.  That's the kind of dark knight that can raise a little heck, even in a city as corrupt and socially broken as Gotham City.  After a rather clumsy and embarrassing debut, a rather ruthless (yet just) Batman soon begins spreading fear among the fear-mongers of his city.  He doesn't win many friends with Gotham's finest (other than Sergeant Gordon), but that's understandable.  Even if half of the force weren't already bought and paid for, the fact that Batman causes untold millions of dollars in damages on the streets (not to mention the roofs) of the city doesn't really inspire a lot of good will among guys in suits.

Nolan certainly succeeds when it comes to making his movie as realistic as possible, especially in terms of the big chase scene.  Realism bows to unbelievable theatrics all too soon, especially in terms of the big plan to purge Gotham City of its sins and social degeneration, but even this fits well inside the Batman milieu - and it makes for some pretty exciting action on the screen.

The link between Gordon and Wayne, which extends all the way back to Wayne's childhood, is subtly done.  Michael Caine is surprisingly good as the venerable Alfred.  Morgan Freeman (the best actor in Hollywood, for my money) lends great presence to an otherwise minor character.  I also liked the dichotomy established between Bruce Wayne and Batman - it's not explored all that deeply in the film, but the foundation is there for any future sequels.  As for Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), I have to come down on the side of those asking why her character was even in the film.  I see what Nolan did with the character, and I suppose she does help define Wayne as well as Batman, but this film could have easily done away with her character and never skipped a beat.  Ra's Al Ghul alone provides more than enough insight into Wayne's mindset, as he is basically the very type of man Bruce Wayne might have become were it not for his principles.  Ra's Al Ghul, after all, feels himself to be a noble force for justice in a world of degenerate behavior.

There's really no doubt about the fact that Batman Begins is the best Batman movie to date.  Christian Bale grows into the role (both figuratively and literally - gaining back all the weight he lost for The Machinist) quite well as the story progresses, the supporting cast is loaded with big stars who live up to their names, and the special effects (even all of those CGI bats) are awe-inspiring and fun to watch.  Most importantly, though, Christopher Nolan succeeds in putting the dark back into the Dark Knight.",1139011200,,4525,4.639899623588457

The so called-Batman purists dislike the original because Jack Napier/Joker kills Bruce Wayne's parents. Big deal. ""It's not true to the comics"" is the lame, blindly followed line. Well if that's the case then why in the hell is Ras Al Guhl not in the desert and there's no mention of the Lazerus Pit?? ""Batman doesn't kill"". What happened in Begins? Someone died. Why no black and blue suit?

It's an interesting and refreshing thing to see the origin of the bat suit, equipment etc. But, at times the suit looks to thick.  One of the many things that made Batman appealing was his intellect. The mystery of if he designed his own stuff. His detective skills, deciphering Riddles etc. He doesn't really need a Lucious Fox. I couldn't help but miss the yellow emblem. (Hopefully,Nolan and Goyer bring it back.)

1570532,5,B00005JNJV,"Christopher Nolan set out to make the best Batman movie possible.  He spared no expense.  He recalled looking at the success of the first Superman movie back in 1978 and decided that part of making the film work was having the right cast.  Christopher Nolan more than succeeded in his aim!  Snatching up some of the best actors around in Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, and even the young talents of Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy helped make this, not only the best Batman adaptation ever done but one of the best comic book adaptations of all time.

Nolan also made sure to find a screenwriter who was familiar with the Batman universe.  He looked at various bodies of work from Frank Miller to other graphic novels as well, trying to find the best story and the best medium for making the movie.

First, Christian Bale NAILS the role of BOTH Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Reports are that he put on nearly 100 pounds...so much that he, in fact, had to drop some weight in order to fit into the suit!  He makes Wayne more of a philanthropic playboy who is more interested in cars and women than about the corrupt state of Gotham City.  But as the Dark Knight he is relentless and brutal in his mission to make crimelords and corrupt public officials pay and pay with interest!  You gotta love the scene where Batman snatches Detective Fass off the ground from 10 stories up.  ""I don't know anything, I swear to God!"" cries Fass.  ""Swear to ME!"" Batman growls at him.  Nolan, the crew, and Bale all had a clear idea of the kind of Batman that they wanted to have portrayed.

The supporting cast is first rate, and why shouldn't it be?  Liam Neeson is brilliant as Wayne's mentor, Ducard.  And Michael Caine is wonderful as the ever reliable Alfred.

One of the best performances has to go to Gary Oldman as Sergeant Jim Gordon.  He looks like he was cut right out of the comic, and he does a fantastic job.

Morgan Freeman is also very good as Lucius Fox who helps Bruce Wayne make his preparations.  Cillian Murphy turns in a very good performance as Scarecrow (best villian portrayal of any of Batman films thusfar).  Katie Holmes is very credible.  Luckily, she isn't in the film too much so her performance doesn't suffer under the weight of so many veteran performers.

Batman Begins is dark and brutal, just as Batman was meant to be based largely on Frank Miller's work.  He has always been the antithesis to Superman, each at the other end of the spectrum.  Batman is the hero who does the dirty work among psychopaths and the dregs of society.

In a recent Justice League Comic, every member was captured except for Batman.  The alien race stated that it wouldn't be difficult since Batman has no powers.  Superman only laughs and states categorically, ""He's the most dangerous of us.""

Batman is popular because of the power of his deductive reasoning.  He is more than a fighting machine.  He is able to  out-think his opponent.  Batman Begins does the best job of tapping into this.  The suit is the best yet as well.  Gotta love Christian Bale's ""Batman Voice.""  It's perfect.  And this film is as close to being perfect as it can get.

The support cast which includes Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, and Gary Oldman is excellent. They fill there parts very well. His journey to distant lands as a young man looking for answers to his doubts about himself is a nice touch. The training in marshal arts fits in with his journey to the East. The romance is there but not shallow as in previous versions, and it has an intellectual woman. Good acting, camera work, scenery, special effects, and music make this well worth your time.

1570535,5,B00005JNJV,"I usually laugh at these types of movies given their lack of true credibility when it comes to believing that a super hero really exists.  Superman for example, required a man from another planet - unlikely.  However, this batman shows from scratch how it is possible.  I always wondered where a guy like Michael Keaton had the time to build all the toys -the cave, the fancy equipement, planes, boats, etc. etc.  Not too realistic.

The rediculous evolution of fancier, blingier, more hollywoodistic toys, like the spinning light show that brings the batmobile up and ready to drive off.  Where does a guy who is busy fighting crime come up with time for that?  And for what purpose?  It's all hollywood, and it kills the reality of the character.  Arnold and Clooney pretty much put the nail on the coffin for that crap.

But thank god for this episode.  Not to say the toys were not unrealistic, but they were explained.  And they were tested, and modified, and of course already developed by real scientists who had no clue what they would end up being used for.

Really, the only unrealistic things I found were that a stone mansion would burn down so easily.  Does a billionaire not have a sprinker system?  Or the rediculous subway system that seemed to soar right to wayne enterprises, and how simply it all came down with a few shots in one of the support beams.

Never mind just finding the raw strength to pull a huge man like Liam with one hand up the side of a mountain, only holding on by the glove with spikes in the other hand - that was simply not possible for a man his size who had just exerted all of his enery escaping an exploding building.

Or the ""feature"" boy that always seems to spot batman and be saved by batman.  There are probably thousands of kids running in the city, but of course our feature kid always gets to see batman.

But still, I loved the details.  By the time he became batman, you knew how and why, and were right there with him ready to kick some ass.  The story line is not consistent with the past versions, for example, Commissioner Gordon spots batman for the first time in the original, but in this episode, he is still just a grunt working along side a developing batman.  And the story of Jack (the Joker) killing his parents is no longer possible, given he was shot in court (at least that's what we think happened).  The Joker was previewed, so I hope that the genuiness carries on for the next episode.  If you listen carefully to the last line of the movie, ""robbery, double homicide"", you realize that he was in fact not killed in the courthouse - it just occurred to me.

And major kudos to Morgan Freeman - he is truely the light in every movie he stars in - he is the hope and inspiration that makes us all believe anything is possible.  Gary Oldman was ok, he's getting pumped up as a great actor, but really I saw nothing exciting about his role here - anyone could have done it.

But the director was very careful here with the details.  For example, batman wears the black makup around the eyes, obviously, but in the scene where he takes his mask off, you think, hmm, will that black makeup be there?  Well, let's just take a shot from the back and we don't have to address that issue.",1138147200,2,3251,4.407718120805369

I was expecting not to like Katie Holmes, but again, was pleasantly surpised by her performance. She was too young to play the part of an assistant DA, but it wasn't as bad as I expected.

1570598,5,B00005JNJV,"In my opinion, Batman Begins is the best Batman movie ever made. Christian Bale plays the role of Bruce Wayne superbly.  I also think he portrays the Batman character as well as any of the past previous stars (Michael Keaton, George Clooney & Val Kilmer).

As with most Batman movies of the past, this one begins with a young Bruce Wayne witnessing both his parents being murdered in cold blood.

At a very young age, he vows to devote his life to fighting crime.

After spending time in some sort of prison facility, Bruce meets up with Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who introduces him to martial arts.  After mastering martial arts, Bruce is now slated to lead a group of ninjas, with the consent of Henri Ducard.  His initiation consists of his killing a past criminal.

Bruce decides this is not the way he wants to fight crime. In turn, he decides to fight the very group he's trained with for so long.  This does not please Henri Ducard at all.

After a brief battle, Bruce ends up out of the group.  With no where to turn, Bruce finds his way back to his hometown, Gotham City.  It is here where he meets childhood sweetheart, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes).  It is also here that he decides to come up with the Batman gimmick.

With Gotham City in such disarray, Bruce is determined to bring the city back to respectability by fighting crime. This is his passion.

Once Bruce becomes Batman, he eventually goes head to head with Dr. Jonathan Crane, a real mask-wearing psycho, played by Cillian Murphy.  Dr. Crane, better known as ""The Scarecrow"" is a big-time drug dealer that has been running rough-shod over the competition.

Let the battles begin.

The cast in this movie consists of such veterans as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer & Gary Oldman.

Caine plays the part of Alfred very well.  Morgan Freeman plays the part of Lucius Fox, who introduces Bruce Wayne to the batmobile.  He is memorable in this role as a good guy.

On the other hand, Rutger Hauer plays bad guy Earle, who has been running The Wayne Foundation ever-since the murder of Bruces' parents.  He will do anything and everything to stay in this position.  But boy does Bruce foil his plan when he returned to Gotham City.

Gary Oldman plays good-cop, Jim Gordon, who helps Batman in any way he can.  Nice to see Oldman in this role.

1570601,5,B00005JNJV,"If it's broke, then by all means, fix it!

After a series of disappointing forays to the big screen, Batman has found his redemption in more ways than one.  This is arguably the best Batman movie and Christian Bale gets my vote for being the best actor to play the titular character.

The question for any filmmaker is always there, how can you make a comic book hero believable on screen?  Thankfully, the writers of Batman Begins (Christopher Nolan, Bob Kane, and David S. Goyer) chose to follow rule number one, cover all your bases.  It would hardly seem a stretch in hindsight.  Batman has no superpowers.  He's a man driven by anger and fear to become all he could be.  It makes one wonder how previous film incarnations did it all wrong.  But the real triumph of this film, like Revenge of the Sith recently, is that Batman's pieces finally fit together and the puzzle of the Dark Knight is completed.  In other words, we get to see how a young Bruce Wayne (played near-perfectly by Christian Bale), heir to a billion-dollar empire, becomes tortured by the murder of his parents and eventually decides to dress like a bat and fight crime.  This is the unbelievable part of Batman's mythology, but in this film it is made possible.

Development of character is a staple and fundamental in film that is horribly rarely done well.  In this film's beginning, we are brought in to follow the development of Batman the only way it should be done, by starting with no Batman.  We follow Bruce Wayne as he acquires a certain fear as a boy, his horror as his parents get killed, his guilt over his parents' death, his vain attempts at self-training, and his eventual decision to fight crime.

The film opens with Bruce being an inmate in some asian prison camp, learning the nature of criminals and training himself to fight them.  He is found by a mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) who trains him to lead the League of Shadows, a secret society mastered in stealth and several martial arts dedicated to fighting crime.  After training is completed, Bruce is to be initiated into the League by executing an unarmed criminal before their leader, Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe).  This is in conflict with Bruce's principles and the League becomes his enemy.  He then chooses to use his training to fight evil by using fear but not becoming an executioner.  He ""finds himself"" with that purpose and goes through a series of motions that leads him to become Batman.

I said earlier that all the bases were covered.  How did Batman acquire ""all those wonderful toys""?  Why does he have bat-shaped throwing blades?  What's with the ears on his cowl?  How does his cape allow him to glide through the air?  How does he develop a mini-grappling hook gun?  How does he discover a cave under his family's estate?  How did he get a bulletproof (sort-of) costume?  How did he even get a ""Batmobile""?  How does he get the money for all these?  How does he earn the trust of future police comissioner Gordon?  Why are there so many psychos running around in Gotham City?  How was the bat-signal established?  Yes, all these questions are answered, including the most important one.  How does Bruce Wayne become Batman?  All these could be answered easily and matter-of-factly, but this film chooses not only to make it believable, but carry actual depth.

One of my greatest admirations with this film is how everything is designed.  Everything seems so ""prototype"" from the batmobile (which we all know will eventually become some hot-rod racecar, but for now it's a tank) to the bat-signal (which only barely projects the silhouette of a bat).  The batcave does not have the multitude of state of the art computers.  The costume is in a wooden cabinet, not a metal container.  Access to the batcave is via mining elevator shaft, not a ""batpole"" or a hidden slide.

My peeves are few.  Mainly the character of Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) who has some vital moments in the film which lead Bruce to his decision to become Batman, but overall a forgettable character.  The film's score is barely there (no Danny Elfman-esque catchy main theme).  But I said that about Spider-Man as well, only to be proven wrong when the sequel revealed a main theme had always been there.  Batman Begins' score was composed collaboratively by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.  I know Zimmer best for his score in The Rock but everything else he does seems a variation of his work from that film. Batman Begins included.  Howard is best known for his scores for M. Night Shyamalan's films.  I'm afraid I remember very little of his work in those movies, and that's not a good thing.  However, there was never a moment where the music seemed out of place but it just never had a voice of it's own.

Ken Watanabe, who was the actor who saved ""The Last Samurai"", has disappointingly short screen time here.  Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, a Wayne Enterprises employee heading the company's applied sciences department (and unknowingly supplies Batman with his gadgets) plays the role well as usual.  He is quickly becoming one of the top thespians in my book.  Liam Neeson once again brandishes a sword and is powerful as Henri Ducard.  Gary Oldman plays Gordon, an honest policeman lost in the corruption of Gotham, quite well.  I appreciate him looking as he does in the comic books.  No more fat scottish Jim Gordon.

Honorable mention goes to Cillian Murphy who plays Dr. Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow.  There is always something odd in his demeanor in the film.  Some creepiness hidden under the well-pressed suit.  And when he shows himself as Scarecrow, he is effectively scary.

""Batman Begins"" is the film that should have started it all.  It reinvigorates the troubled franchise and pretty much starts things from scratch.  It was broke and they fixed it.",1137801600,4,5830,4.74402390438247
1570602,5,B00005JNJV,"This was my favorite movie of 2005. I'm a Batman fan and really lost interest in the movie franchise after the first two Tim Burton movies. The others were okay but things were just getting too over the top. This movie brought the series back to earth a little. Aside from being a great comic book movie, it's just a great movie. What I liked was how the movie avoided clichs through out. The damsel in distress isn't. Katie Holmes character is in peril but she isn't a screaming victim. It's also nice that the relationship between the two is downplayed. There isn't a forced romance just because movie history requires one. There is still something between them but it is a more realistic complex connection. The don't ask, don't tell nature of Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox's relationship is refreshing in a genre of movies that usually rquire the hero's identity remain a secret from everyone around him. It's a more realistc approach. I like fact that we are shown the origin of Batman's gear also. It's interesting to see where the Batmobile comes from rather than it is just there.

The best trick Chris Nolan pulled off was keeping it interesting even when Batman wasn't on screen. A problem with a lot of the older superhero movies was you waited for ever for the hero to get into costume and then there was a two minute appearance than it was back to the alter-ego. I thought the balance was well done and the story was about Bruce Wayne as well as Batman. Part of the credit goes to the actors. I wasn't familiar with Christian Bale but thought he was good in this part. And Michael Caine as Alfred is a fresh take on the thin old bald butler of the past.

Everything about Batman Begins was fresh and original to this type of movie. It was closer to the comics. The people that make the movies have a tendency to take use the character but then re-write everything like any other movie. Like The X-Men and Spiderman this movie really gets into the heros legend and makes good use of the history to tell an interesting story.

(Keep in mind, however, that I only found the Michael Keaton Batman and Val Kilmer's Batman Forever mildly diverting while I found Batman Returns and Batman and Robin to be virtually unwatchable).

The basic story of the film is explaining how Bruce Wayne (played surprisingly well by Christian Bale) became Batman.  The story is familiar - Bruce Wayne's parents are cut down in the course of a crime and Bruce devotes his life to justice.  However, what makes Batman Begins superior to the previous entries is that is shows how the path to justice could easily have veered into vengance and vigilantism.  Indeed, early in the film Bruce is confronted by Ra's al-Ghul, a Bhutan-based martial arts master who has taken the second, darker path.

The viewer needs to keep in mind that this film falls outside of the timeline of the previous four Batman adaptations; thus, for example, the killer of the Wayne parents is different in this film than it is in the Keaton Batman series.  That said, the story is well told and flows logically; by the end of the film the main questions of how Bruce Wayne became Batman will be answered.

The dichotomy between vengence and justice plays throughout the film, which is dark in nature but not in its ultimate message.  That said, Batman Begins is a film that takes itself seriously and is not a film that has been punched up with a witty sidekick or other comic relief.  That the film is not overwhelmed by its seriousness is a tribute to both the director and a superb cast of both main and supporting actors.  The only moment when the film starts to veer out of the control of director Christopher Nolan is an overly long car chase sequence.  That said, this film flies by (no pun intended) for a movie that clocks in at 140 minutes.

The cast is very strong and includes Morgan Freeman as gadget man Lucius Fox, Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Sergant Gordon, Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Rutger Hower as Wayne Enterprises CEO Earle, and Ken Wantanabe as Ra's Al Ghul.  Katie Holmes shows that she is more than Mrs. Tom Cruise with a well-rounded performance as love interest Rachael Dawes.  Given the star power in the supporting cast, I'm a bit surprised that Christian Bale, a relative unknown, got cast in the title role.  I was pleasantly surprised by his range in this role, which is likely to vault him into super-stardom.

Special effects in this film are nothing remarkable, though the shots in Iceland (which plays Bhutan in this film) are beautiful cinematography.  The score by Hans Zimmer is outstanding and reflects the dark and serious nature of the film instead of veering into a comic book sensibility.

The single-disk DVD is extremely basic - English and French soundtracks and English, French, and Spanish subtitles.  Other than that the only feature is a trailer.  If you are someone who likes DVDs that are tricked out with commentaries and other bonus features then you should probably look at the two-disk Deluxe edition.

That said, if you want to see one of 2005's best films and a new standard for the Batman series, this is the film to watch.",1137369600,2,3269,4.678321678321678

This is probably the best comic-book to film adaptation of all time.  The writer and director give us a serious rather than silly, campy take on Batman.  After Joel Schumaker (or whatever his name is/was) destroyed the franchise with his glitzy Broadway-inspired-coreographic crap I figured I would never see another Batman film in my lifetime.  I believed the Warner Bros Batman franchise was dead.  I am happy to report I was wrong.  This film makes up for those debacles and far outshines the Tim Burton films.  The franchise is alive and well. Let's hope they can keep it up.

One tiny criticism - you have to buy the special edition version to get any special features. There are no special features on this edition.  Cheap stinginess on the part of Warner Bros.",1136678400,,950,4.703030303030303
1570732,4,B00005JNJV,"This movie come close. Damn Close. The early comic book years of the Batman story were serious, but not sufficiently angry to explain WHY he becomes Batman. It was not, in my estimation, until Frank Miller began showing the dark side of the character that Batman became truly interesting. Readers like myself long to see the cold and cruel elements in ths world get what they deserve with the same cruelty they showed toward their victims.

In BATMAN BEGINS, Bruce Wayne is shown as a truly angry character, who with the help of the League of Shadow, finds the path to become ""something more"", a legend. Even with this intensity and focus on the revenge Bruce Wayne is compelled to take, the character is still TOO WHOLESOME.

In the Frank Miller-type characterizations, Batman is borderline psychotic. While trying not to slip into becoming a murderer like the villians, Batman is not above maiming or beating his enemies within an inch of their life (see Dark Knight Returns or Bruce Wayne: Murderer for some truly dark stories in which Bruce says his ""mask"" is SLIPPING).

Still, this is a notable and worthwhile restart for the Dark Knight.  I agree with many reviewers who complained that the intellectual and detective skills so prevelant in the comics was overlooked here. But, this can be explored in the follow-up versions.

I hope Warner can be convinced to delve even darker, much like the recent SIN CITY release. If so, true Batman/Dark Knight fans will recognize the franchise as having returned and that Hollywood finally GETS the character.",1136678400,,1556,4.901140684410646
1570733,1,B00005JNJV,"First of all: I LOVED the movie Batman Begins.  It was an amazing rebirth of the series and so much better than the last, despite the fact that I like George Clooney.  (Although I must point out what my sister said after we saw the Clooney Batman: ""I want my superheroes to take themselves *seriously*.""  Which, as silly as that may sound, is exactly what Batman Begins does, and does excellently.)  Furthermore, the fact that they chose my home town of Chicago as the filmed location for the corrupt and dying Gotham City I find perversely satisfying, this city having been run on graft for so long, despite continuing efforts to root out corruption... but, hey, if they actually rooted out all the corruption and graft in Chicago (or Illinois for that matter), I seriously doubt that ANYTHING would ever get done efficiently.  It literally greases the wheels.

But I digress.  So I loved the film. So why the 1 star? BECAUSE I am having the same problem with Disc 2 Special Features that other reviewers have mentioned.  It simply doesn't work.  I have tried this in my two DVD players (a Sony and a Fujilink), a friend's DVD player (a Sylvania), a friend's PC (Dell Windows XP Pentium 4) and another friend's PC (a Sony VAIO desktop).  On every player and PC, the same problems mentioned by previous reviewers occurred: all you get is the anti-piracy FBI warning and the WB logo, and that's it.  I can't access ANYTHING else on the Special Features disk.  So, I'm very, very disappointed, because I also got the Extended Uncut Sin City double DVD set for xmas, and both discs work perfectly in all the DVD players I've used -- for Sin City.  I was really looking forward to the Batman Begins special features, and unfortunately, it looks like I simply can't view them.  And I am not at all certain that returning it to Amazon will result in my getting a working copy, since one reviewer already did so and his SECOND copy of Disc 2 didn't work, either.

1570735,5,B00005JNJV,"I agree with almost all the good reviews.  Best Batman film, etc.. My only complaint (it's really more of a question) was why did Batman seem so mentally moribund?

Where was the great mind, the detective side of him?  There was a bit, but he seemed much more dependent on the intelligence of others (like the Freeman character) than coming up with his own ideas.

One of the things I always loved about the character was that he's a ""self-made"" superhero. A HUGE part of that is his intellect, a feature that really sets him apart from a lot of super power superheroes. I got the feeling Bale's Batman had done his physical homework...but that he may have been cutting class to do it.

That having been said, I can't really say that ANY of the live action Batman movies have ever done a good job of this (the best may have been the Adam West Batman...and what does THAT say?)

That having been said, I'm going to buy this DVD...and I do not own any of the other Batman movies in my home collection.

1570806,5,B00005JNJV,"When I heard that another Batman movie was in the works; I shivered. I actually feared that the film would be worse than the Joel ""I have to show Batman and Robin's butt every chance I can for some stupid-ass reason"" Schumacher films. However, after reading articles in Wizard Magazine and seeing the film's preview, I got very excited. And when I actually saw the film, I was blown away. This is not just the BEST Batman film I've seen but (along with ""Sin City"") the BEST comic book movie I've ever seen. What I loved most was that there was serious character development. This was not just quick action and meaningless fight scenes. Don't get me wrong, the action was there, and was terrific, but it made sense with the story. Chris Nolan and the others responsible for the film obviously had done their homework. Taking the best from Batman comics (more than just the look-but the story) and making one MOTHER of a great movie out of them. (Most notably they borrowed a great deal from Frank Miller's ""Batman Year One"" which is one of the greatest Batman comics I've ever read.)

After Joel ""I'm of the opinion that more florescent lights and awful casting will make Batman movies better"" Schumacher, Chris Nolan has actually renewed my faith that Batman films could be good again so much that I eagerly anticipate their sequels. This film is so good that even my wife, who is not a comic or Batman fan, likes it very much. It is great! Great story, great characters, great action, great look and feel, and great casting and acting. If you are thinking about buying this movie, buy it now. You will not be disappointed.

Many May enjoy the fact that this shows a long indepth view of Batmans life and past in order for hi mto become such a powerhouse.

1570812,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is an excellent retelling of Batman's origins (something's that never been properly done in the movies, except maybe in the cartoon movie ""Mask of Phantasm"") and brings the Dark Knight back to the mantel he stood upon before the late 1990s. That aside, I really have to commend the director -- Christopher Nolan -- on bringing Batman into the silverscreen limelight, the plot was written quite well. It certainly was on par to the Batman Comics themselves and the dark themes of the series. The city used for Gotham City was such an amazing choice of the corrupt city -- much better than cartoonish Gotham City via ""Forever,"" ""Batman & Robin,"" and the early Tim Burton Batman movies. All which reminded me a deranged architect's warped mind.

A short overview of the movie is this: A young Bruce Wayne (Gus Lewis) while playing with young Rachel Dawes (Emma Lockhart), falls down a well and is attacked by a flurry of bats. After his father, Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), pulls him from the well, Bruce begins having nightmares about bats. One night the Waynes go to the opera where Bruce becomes scared at some of the dancers' portrayals of bat-like demons. Bruce experiences a panic attack and begs his father to leave the theater early. The family exits into an alley where they are confronted by a mugger, Joe Chill. Despite the calm submission of Thomas, Chill shoots both him and his wife. Fatally wounded with a bullet in his chest, Thomas Wayne tells his son not to be afriad. Bruce is left physically unharmed, but in a state of total mental shock.

From there the movie picks up when Bruce Wayne is in the a Chinese prison for attempting to steal products that, ironically, belong to Wayne Interprises. He approached by Ducard to meet his master Ra's al Ghul and an opportunity to join ""The League of Shadows."" From the movie becomes very interesting. That aside, the actors chosen for the roles (comic book and original character alike) were also an excellent choice. Aside from Christian Bale and Michael Caine, other well known actors play their roles superbly.

Even Liam Neeson, whom I usually haven't liked since ""Phantom Menace"" was interesting as the character Henri Ducard. Though many people complained about Katie Holmes' performance in the movie as Rachel Dawes, I thought she did a swell performance in this movie than she ever did in the entire series of ""Dawson's Creek"" and other films she's been in.

Cillian Murphy, an actor quite knew to me played his role as twisted Arkam doctor, Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow, like a well oiled machine. The mask he used when his victims were given his hypnotic gas gave me quite a scare. The graphics for the film were top notch. It was hard to tell what was CGI, though there were obvious CGI moments in most of the high shots of the city. The narrows, the rundown and cut off area of Gotham City where the poor reside was nicely created, very reminiscent of Gotham City after the massive earthquake in the ""No Man's Land"" arc.

The action was sparely placed throughout the movie to develop the storyline and character, but when the action was thrown into motion it really captured your in the moment, especially the Tumbler/Batmobile scenes. Batman's fighting style was very Batman-like, though most of the time it was hard to tell what was going in the darkness, even then Batman was grabbing up his enemies on his grappler. All in all, Batman Begins managed to reel you in with its dark comic book style story telling set in a more realistic world that better reflected Bob Kane's universe, while maintaining the mystery of the plot until the very end. This is a film I would defiantly want to own. ----- [a 5 out of 5]",1135814400,2,3705,4.720247295208655
1570813,4,B00005JNJV,"After the first batman that came out, Each of its sequels failed to live up to the original.  Batman Returns was probably the worse comic based movie I have ever seen.  Batman Forever and Batman and Robin were a little better, but still pretty bad.

First I must dispell all the talk that this movie is a prequel to the other movies.  This is not true.  This movie is not connected in any way to the other movies.  Take for example Bruce Waynes parents who were killed, when you watch the first Batman you will see that Joker (pre Joker) killed them, in this movie the person who kills Bruce's parents dies.  Take this as a new beginning to the whole Batman story, hopefully there will be sequels, but only if they are good.  I would hate to see this story ruined like Blade with Blade trinity, and of course the first Batman that was ruined.

The story starts off with a young Bruce watching his parents be murdered.  The anger and thirst for revenge drives him throughout most of his young life.  He eventually meets up with a guy that encourages him to to channel his anger before it consumes him.  This guy teaches him many things in addition to the physical and martial arts training, like compassion for enemies could get him into trouble..............

Bruce eventually returns to Gotham and this is where he becomes Batman to rid the city of crime and corruption.

This movie was beautifully written and directed.  As I said before, I wasn't expecting much out of the movie which is why I didn't rush to the theatre to see it.  I ended up with it on DVD which is when I decided to watch it.  Christian Bale makes a wonderful Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Morgan Freeman also makes an apperance in this movie as Batman's source for all of his gadgets and suit.  It goes without saying that Freeman was very convincing in his role as well.  Overall the storyline was great, the fight scenes were as well and not overdone and not littered with pointless special effects.  This was a great movie I was plesantly suprised.  This is the kind of movie that I can watch over and over again.

The ending of the movie leads you to believe that there will be more battles for Batman to fight.  I just hope that any sequels will continue to follow this movie's lead and not turn into some special effects laden crap.  If this can't be done then I would perfer that it be left as is.",1135728000,,2373,4.412442396313364
1570814,5,B00005JNJV,"I won't (and can't) add to the other 700+ positive reviews here.  Suffice it to say that for nearly 40 years, I have been a fan of Batman in comics and on screen, and for the first time ever, I feel someone (namely director Christopher Nolan, writer David Goyer, and actor Christian Bale) have brought the character that I have loved for so long to full three-dimensional life.  Someone finally GOT it.

As much as I liked Michael Keaton's take on Batman, THIS is the definitive version.  The previous four movies were, as Bale's Bruce Wayne would say, ""practice"".

Nolan takes a huge chance in spending a full hour of screen time introducing us to Batman's alter-ego Bruce Wayne.  We don't even see Batman until nearly halfway through the movie.  But this chance pays off in spades, because by the time Batman appears with his full costume and equipment, we are fully invested in his character, his motives, and his techniques, and we are 100% rooting for him to start kicking some a$$.

(Let's face it: it's pretty much ridiculous for a guy to dress up in a bat costume to fight crime.  But the brilliance in this movie is that it not only convinces you that this scenario is possible, but that if you were in Bruce Wayne's shoes and you had access to all of his resources, you would not only want to do it but HAVE to do it.)

I have watched this movie a half dozen times and I have seen more in it every time.  It's beautifully written and acted by all.  All I can say is that if you have been put off by the previous four Batman movies or the campy TV series, give this movie a chance.

The Film Boasts A Wonderful Cast. Cristian Bale Is The Dark Knight This Time Around. And He Is Aptly Supported By Michael Caine,Katie Holmes,Rutger Hauer,A More Restrained Than Usual Gary Oldman,Morgan Freeman,Tom Wilkinson,And Liam Neeson.
So What Is The Problem? First Of All Too Many Characters In A Movie Usually Makes For Very Thin Storylines,Tho These Are Pretty Well Fleshed Out. But There Is WAY Too Much Back Story That Just Seems To Jump Around All Over The Place. Too Many Flashbacks. And Not Only That,You Can't Tell If It's Recent History,Older History,Are The Flashbacks Given In Order,And Finally At The End Of The Day Is All The Back Story Really Necessary? It's Like M Knight Shamalan's Signs. Another Excellently Well Done Story. But In The Case Of Gibson's Wife,The Flashback Is Restarted Over And Over And Over And Becomes Hard To Follow.

1571049,3,B00005JNJV,"As with most recent comic adaptations, some scenes are unecessary, painfully slow, and devoid of any kind of logic.

The companies seem to think of them as 'Epics' in the Spartacus vein, which means they take themselves way to seriously to be enjoyed on a comic level. 2hrs 15mins is just TOO long!

The characters played by liam, Michael, and Morgan are yawningly predicatble stock roles that any of them can do with their eyes closed. Scarecrow/Crane is played out with some looney tension to his due, and Bale is humane enough to pass it off.

The most exciting bit was the Batmobile 'Tumbler' sequence. The action is turned up 30 notches in realistic 'French Conncetion' style ode, and really delivers a roar.

I'm all for these movies in a disposable, popcorn way. But like I mentioned, they're too cliched and drawn out, and too serious!",1135036800,,843,4.7534246575342465
1571050,4,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" is one of the classier comic book adaptions of recent years. While it has far less in common with the DC comic book than one might think, virtually all the changes made to the characters and their history were essential for an audience that remembers the Tim Burton Batman films but seldom (if ever) reads a Batman comic book.

This DVD is the single-disc version of the film, without most of the extras that the two-DVD set contains. Be aware of this before you order. If the extras are what you'd like, go for the two-DVD set. If not, used versions of the single-disc version are cheaply and readily available.

The film traces Bruce Wayne's journey from an embittered and self-destructive young man into his metamorphosis into a mysterious and powerful urban vigillante. Christian Bale throws himself into the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman, giving us the best Batman since Michael Keaton. He's also given ample support from a Who's Who of Hollywood blockbusters - including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Rutger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, and Cillian Murphy. Along the way, there are strong echoes of the Tim Burton films, through the character designs, music, and general mood. There are also some top-notch action sequences, including one of the strangest car chases you're likely to see.

The film isn't entirely successful due to the almost total lack of chemistry between Bale and Holmes, and the absence of a truly gripping villain. Coming on the heels of the ""Spiderman"" movies, ""Batman Begin"" has villians whose motivations are far too shadowy to fathom. Liam Neeson turns in a fine performance as Ra's Al Ghul, and Cillian Murphy is appropriately eerie as the Scarecrow, but neither character is fleshed out enough (or over-the-top enough)to command our attention the way Jack Nicholson did as the Joker many years ago.

Still, this is a great start to what will hopefully be a long-running and successful series. This is a movie well worth watching again.",1134950400,,1998,4.973053892215569

because it had good movie flow.

 My experience with the film was good. I would watch it again because it was packed with action and exciting things happening all the time during the movie. I would also watch it again because the way that they went from scene to scene. It had good transitions between scenes.

 There was a lot of action in this movie. Some good examples of this was when the person that killed Bruce's parents was coming out of the court house after being convicted of murder.  Bruce shows up at the courthouse to kill this person, but somebody else shot and killed him instead. Or when they are on the train and it is going to crash because the tracks have been blown out ahead. Batman puts his last touch on the bad guy and exits the ripped in half train through the big opening in the back using his cape. One other scene that was funny and full of action was when Bruce was trying to get the medicine to his girl friend. He was speeding through the highway and on the rooftops is his car that looked like a tank, but could go really fast and could jump great distances.",1134777600,,1159,4.269406392694064
1571053,5,B00005JNJV,"So here is Warner Brothers attempt at reviving the Batman franchise after the ridiculous cartoons that were Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. When the original movie with Michael Keaton came out in 1989 I was a bundle of overexcited 11-year old joy. I was a huge comic book fan as a kid and Batman was always my favorite character. I loved the Tim Burton version with Keaton, but I recognized that Burton's Dark Knight was slightly different than the detective Batman of the comics, not to mention the difference in the costume. As that original series progressed, both the costume and the character of Batman devolved into silly cartoon caricatures of the dark, conflicted character of DC Comics. Fastforward to 2005 and Nolan's rebirth of the franchise with Batman Begins. Nolan understands more about the Batman mythos than either Burton or Schumacher, and the film is a thrill ride that doesn't forget to focus on the interesting internal dynamics that make up the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman. It reminds me of the fantastic Batman: Year One graphic novel in that we get to see Batman as he develops, from concept to crimefighter, in all its arcane and sometimes clumsy detail. That being said, I still feel that Nolan's Batman is slightly different than the DC Comics character. The costume still isn't right (again) and we still see very little of Batman the detective. But I don't suppose that matters a whole lot, since the heart of Batman - the conflicted yet noble idealist Bruce Wayne - is still there. The action is great without being too over-the-top, and the villains are believable and they don't take center stage over the title character as they often did in the Burton and Schumacher versions. By the way, if you want to see what a more authentic film version of a Batman costume would look like, hunt online for a fan film called ""Batman: Dead End"" by Sandy Collora.  You'll be glad you did.",1134604800,,1936,4.796407185628743
1571054,5,B00005JNJV,"Movies usually either meet, go below, or totally exceed your expectations. <em>Batman Begins</em> was more masterful than I could've hoped and as far as comic book movies go it blows <em>X2</em> and <em>Spider-man 2</em> totally out of the water. Not only that, but it's a great movie even without being in the comic book genre. This movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the first four Batman incarnations and is not really a prequel. It's a starting Batman movie the way it was meant to be done. The acting was completely and utterly spot-on. I can't imagine if Bruce Wayne would've been so perfect without Christian Bale and Michael Caine really puts Michael Gough to shame as Alfred. Hopefully, more people will show love for Gary Oldman after him aptly portraying a pre-Comissioner Gordon. Cillian Murphy is finally showing the mainstream public, who likely hadn't heard of him, how good he really is in his role as Scarecrow and it just felt right. Katie Holmes and Morgan Freeman did very well reinventing their characters and I just love how they both interacted with Bruce Wayne. I'm not going to talk about Liam Neeson and Ken Wantanabe to avoid spoilers, but just know that they were no different from the rest.

I still have more to say though so indulge me for another paragraph. Acting is all well and good, but what is it that makes this movie so special? The careful attention poured onto every shot. When you can't tell what's cg and what's real, you know you have a winner. You may think that the bats aren't real, but you'd be surprised which scenes actually had live bats. Part of this grueling attention comes from the dialogue though, which I just fell in love with. Not a single line was actually corny or out of place, but rather it got to its point without having to dumb things down at all. It all seemed pretty intricate, and I liked how key lines (especially those relating to big themes) came back. <em>Batman Returns</em> came on last night and comparing this script to that one is like comparing night to day. David Goyer really outdid himself and so did Christopher Nolan. For the latter to top <em>Memento</em> is no small feat, and yet he managed to do it right here. Not only was his hand in the script good but also his sense of art direction and grabbing the essence of Batman. The whole movie seems designed for people my age and older because of how dark it is. Batman isn't scary when he goes around in a batsuit like in those old four movies, but he may strike fear in you a couple of times when he does what he does this time around! It's hard for me to scrape up anything I didn't like besides one thing I don't really want to spoil (very minor anyway) and how fast the hand-to-hand combat was. I think the latter was on purpose, but I just would've preferred to see them go a little slower. Of course, it makes sense that in real life the people fighting wouldn't slow down and what this movie did best was putting you in a world where everything happening seemed possible, not gimmicky. I loved the subtle explanations of things and the batmobile may not look as sleek as before but it's definitely more useful.

The video and sound quality are pretty good, though I feel that the transfer could've been a little brighter though I was watching the movie on an older television model. The special features are accessed via a comic book, which is kind of neat, but I'd rather just have it all straightforward rather than hunt for them (though if you navigate to the last page of it you can do this also). The features I've watched so far are really good and none are too long so you can easily watch them all in short bursts. They range from his training to the history of the movie's development to the costume design and down to the creation of Gotham City. Plus, you learn a lot of nifty things like how much fighting Christian Bale actually had to learn and that the scenes in the mountains were filmed on location. If you enjoyed the movie I feel that this set is pretty worthwhile. Even if they were to release a super duper edition, this is really all you need to thoroughly enjoy the film. The only thing that's missing is a commentary track, but I've heard that Nolan's commentary on <em>Memento</em> sucks anyway so it's no big deal.",1134518400,3,4288,4.524484536082475

1571056,4,B00005JNJV,"An edition to this series which is long overdue, Batman Begins tells the story of Bruce Wayne's upbringing, how he came to become the hero behind the mask, and delves into the psychological aspect of not only good versus evil, but also self-examination of one's soul. For this reason, Batman Begins epitomizes more of a thinking man's Batman.

Much of the first half of the film is used to set the background and roots of who Bruce Wayne is.

After witnessing the death of his parents, and feeling a sense of guilt over the tragedy, Bruce Wayne attempts to understand not only the criminal's mind, but the essence of justice as well. After spending time in prison, Wayne encounters Ducard (Liam Neeson), who in turn teaches Wayne how to defend himself and become an impressive fighter. Despite giving Wayne essential advice (""if they can't stop you, you can become something else entirely""), it is evident that Ducard's scheme of justice comes in the form of completely destroying Gotham. Sensing this, Wayne makes a desperate escape from the League of Shadows, returning to the city. From here we see Bruce Wayne's destiny to become Batman, as he battles the corruptions and injustices which are prevalent in Gotham, choosing to become the symbol of a bat (which perhaps symbolizes his need to overcome the childhood fear of bats).

Becoming Batman, and returning to Gotham anew, there is not only a method to fight the various forms of evil-crooked police and officials, and the diabolical psychiatrist Dr. Crane..aka The Scarecrow-but an outlet for Bruce's anger at injustices within his own life. This motivation comes through so poignantly, which separates this film from previous others, such as Batman and Robin.

The cast is also all-star and remarkable in its own right. Katie Holmes plays Rachael, childhood friend of Wayne, and the woman who he eventually falls for. Michael Caine is exquisitely cast as the butler, Alfred, and Morgan Freeman is great as man behind the technology who works for Wayne.

Perhaps most refreshing is the vision and effort of the producers to take a comic-book hero and make him complex. Chris Nolan is able to take the theme of good versus evil and personify it within the characters. Yet, at the same time, the movie still has its action and chase scenes (albeit quite a lengthy one that is a little over the top).

Batman Begins is the step in the right direction for this series, and this one is on the same playing field as the original Batman.",1134345600,,2489,4.844705882352941
1571057,3,B00005JNJV,"This was a fun movie in some respects, depressing in others.
Christian Bale was, of course, very good.
But what irks me the most, is that people in Hollyweird have to REVAMP everything.
Here's a few items:
1. Thomas & Martha take their kid to an opera. What the...? In the original books, it was the movie 'Mark of Zorro'. Who takes a kid to the opera?
2. Ra's Al Ghul becomes his mentor, then his enemy. Anyone familiar w/the comics KNOWS that Ghul comes in later in his career.
3. Bruce seems to get help from every direction. This flick turns him into a semi-co-dependant whiner (on occasion). Not the hard-as-nails, bootstrap, perfectionist, be-prepared-for-everything character we've all come to admire.
4. Lucius Fox becomes his armorer. And lo & behold! Everytime the hero needs a device, or armor, or even mobility, YIPPEE! Welcome to Comic Book Hero Convenience store, your 1-stop shopping for all your super-hero needs! Wonder if they've got a spare Green Lantern ring?
5. I dunno about anyone else, but I rather preferred Al Ghul as the eco-terrorist, rather than some existential nihilist (why on earth anyone would try to cure civilization's ills by destroying Gotham is anyone's guess: just another stupid revamp done by some ghost-writer on a coke binge, is my guess).
The fight scenes were very cool, the special effects outstanding. Katie Holmes not wearing a bra wasn't really eye candy for me (I'd prefer Jessica Alba or Halle Berry, m'self), since she's just cute, not all that great.
So I gave it a 3. Fun watch, but not more than once.
& I repeat: it ain't broke, don't fix it. Original storylines were great? Why rewrite the bleedin' thing?",1134259200,7,1663,4.7979094076655056

1571118,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is the most unique, action-packed, and overall best Batman movie of all time.

In this movie, instead of fights some of his famous enemies, such as the Joker and Poison Ivy, Bruce Wayne battles himself as he tries to find out who he really is.

This is the one Batman flick where we get to see exactly how Batman came to be.  After witnessing the death of his parents when he was young, billionaire Bruce Wayne wanted to fight villainy in the world.  This drove him to become Batman; and, ironically, he chose to become 'Batman' because bats were what he was most afraid of.

As Batman, Bruce Wayne uncovers a plot to damage Gotham City's water system, which would in turn destory the city itself.  With the help of Wayne Enterprises science wiz, Officer Gordon, and his friend Rachel, Batman must stop these criminals before Gotham City is wiped off the map.

Overall, this Batman is great-filled with stunning action scenes and a good plot, this is a must-see movie for any and all Batman fans.  It is packed with intriguing information about how and why Bruce became Batman, and we get to see the beginnings of the Batcave, the Bat signal, and a sweet new Batmobile (though it can never replace the original one!).  I will admit, however, that the beginning is quite confusing the first time around; it starts with Bruce stuck in some prison in Asia, then he goes into the mountains to train with group that is a sort of 'secret police', the League of Shadows.  It all happens so fast that one can get lost and confused quite easily.  However, things pick up once Bruck gets back to Gotham City.

I wouldn't say that this movie is perfect, but it has several aspects that make it nearly flawless.",1133913600,2,1713,4.562091503267974

There isn't all those crazy special effects, poor storyline and just plain silly looking characters. This gets you deeper into who Bruce Wayne really was and why he became this man of the Night.  I like that he was not a killer and wouldn't not murder anyone.  This makes him so much more respectable and honorable.  Christian Bale was perfectly cast for this part.  I thought he did a great job and I think this helps to put those other Batman movies out of memory.  I think this movie finally makes Batman completely respectable and no longer the joke the character had become.",1133827200,,756,4.427536231884058
1571120,3,B00005JNJV,"This is the dark side of DC comic come to life.  Batman has always been the most complex and interesting superhero.  He has no special powers.  He appears to be neurotic if not psychotic.  He is as creepy as any of his foes.

The film shows the origin of the character, from the murder of Wayne's parents, to his rebellion leading to indoctination into a secret cult that opposes corrupt societies.  In a cult ceremony, he is asked to murder a convicted killer.  He refuses, as he cant break with societies mores, and feels the man must bear trial.  Not judgment by the cult.  Yet Wayne then kills several cult members in the process of destroying the ceremony.  This makes sense how?  Not exactly well written.

Yet these scenes as a cult knight, with Liam Neeson's cult leader, are the best in the film.  Batman's uniform, skills and mission all spawn directly from this cult, thus 'the dark knight.'  The film then diverges for 90 minutes and is pretty conventional Batman.  Only at the end does Batman meet his creator/nemesis in the form of the knight leader.  The whole film would have been more interesting if it kept its focus on how the cult's principles form Wayne's own, his break from the knights, and realization that the cult is responsible for many of the problems of the society it undermines.

While this is the 'hip' Batman, the Batman-Joker axis with Nicholson was truly more complex and interesting.  Worth seeing.",1133827200,3,1434,4.690763052208835
1571121,5,B00005JNJV,"They finally got Batman right.  The other Batman flicks gave you a brooding, dark vigilante, but they never told you how he got that way.  This movie does.

The title actually explains it all.  From the senseless murder of Bruce Wayne's parents through all the training he went through and why he donned the cowl.  Sounds boring, doesn't it?  Well, it isn't.  The story is very well told and kept me engaged throughout.

I guess this was the movie where you could actually sympathize with Bruce Wayne.  You get to know the tortured man behind the mask.  This wasn't so much a ""Batman"" movie as it was a Bruce Wayne movie, at least in the first half of it.

This isn't just a good comic book movie, this is a good movie period.  There's a plot to keep you riveted and plenty of action too.  You even get to see how Batman got his hands on all his toys, not to mention why he decided on a bat for his emblem.

For comic book officionados, I'll say that this story isn't canon (you comic folks will know what I mean).  I think they tried to get away from maniacal or cartoonish bad guys (joker, penguin) and went with one that was more recent in the Bat World (I'm not telling who the bad guy is) but was on the more reasonable side.

It's the best Batman movie because it's a story with a comic book hero in it and not a comic book story on the screen.

At the end, all I could say was ""WOW!""

Only one warning.  The batmobile is cool, but it sure isn't what you're used to.

Added note:  I've been reading other reviews that state that Michael Keaton was the best Batman.  Please stop.  You're cracking me up.  Yes, I saw it.  Geez!

As for the lack of humor: IT WASN'T SUPPOSED to be a comedy or a satire.  You've learned about Batman through the Burton/Shumaker films, evidently  You want to understand The Batman?  Read the comics and graphic novels.",1133740800,2,1852,4.28695652173913
1571122,3,B00005JNJV,"After years of not having a Batman film and mostly due to the franchise hitting bottom thanks to Joel Schumacher's disastrous ""Batman forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"", Christopher  Nolan present us his version of the character with an impressive all star cast anda story brilliantly written by David S. Goyer.

The film

There were  high expectations for this film before its release as if would it be as good as Burton's films, the truth is, there are no points to compare, Nolan and Burton visions are quite different from each other, but both respect the origins and essence of who the character is.

Goyer took some liberties in the storytelling that could be considered as unforgivable by many fans (Bruce's parents are originally killed after seeing ""Mark of Zorro"" at the movie theater, a fact that marks Bruce's mind with the idea of a masked vigilante) but also hints at stuff that the previous versions let pass unnoticed, the main focus of this film are the origins of Batman and his training to become what he ultimately is. Even though the detective part of Bruce's training is not even mentioned, the twist in which Ra's Al Ghul (Liam Neeson) is the one who trained him in the ninja arts and theatricality just makes their conflict more delightful and interesting. Cameos and appearances of characters from the comic book are also well used, justified and important to the story (Carmine Falcone and killer Zsaz)

The story uses the two villains exactly as they would act in the comic book, Ra's Al Ghul with his constant desire to set thing right his way and Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) working and experimenting with the thing he enjoys the most: fear. Even though the Scarecrow is totally the opposite of the comic book (in the comic Jonathan Crane is an old and ugly doctor who was fired from Gotham University for experimenting on the students with his gas of fear), the character presented keeps the essence and motives that the original character has, unlike the Riddler, Mr Freeze, Two Face or Poison Ivy in Schumacher's awful versions.

A new Gotham city is presented, much more like a NY city style, a new Batmobile (not as fancy as the previous ones but quite impressive) and a whole set of characters we expect to see in future releases, James Gordon (Gary Oldman who amazingly looks exactly as Jim in the comic), Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Jonathan Crane, Carmine Falcone and Ra's Al Ghul.

Masterfully executed by the whole cast and brilliantly directed by Nolan, there are many of us looking forward for a sequel to this film.

The extras

Disc one contains Mtv's ""Tankman Begins"", a spoof we could have lived without but without any doubt a collector's piece for all Mtv fans.

Disc two contains a set of documentaries related to all aspects of production and shooting of the film, from the early beginnings in Nolan's washing room until the shooting of some of the most difficult sequences of the film. The disc 2 is organized in a comic book-like format which makes it a little difficult to follow as many things are like hidden, but if you go until the end of the short and pointless story, you will find a list with all documentaries available. One of the documentaries called ""Genesis of the bat"" presents comic book artist related to Batman talking about the character and film, from Dennis O'Neil to Jim Lee. I am sure this will be a piece fans of the comic book will enjoy. All extras are worthy of watching and I strongly recommend the 2 disc set, it is a 5 o 6 dollar difference that will compensate with all the facts and items found in the bonus materials.

***BluRay review***

I had already written a review for this film when the two-disc special edition was released on DVD, so I will not get into any details about how great the movie is.

The treatment they gave to this release is incredible, image looks great and colors are stunning, the high definition definitely makes a difference and 'Batman Begins' looks better than ever (simply check out the ice sequence between Bruce and Ducard)

I have seen threads with questions as to what exactly does the limited edition set contains versus the regular single disc, so here are what I think are the most important ones:

The Disc

The disc included here is the same disc they released separately:
* All the extras from the 2-disc DVD are included, the documentaries and the awful 'Tankman Begins'
* The prologue to 'The Dark Knight' in high definition (are we in for a treat when released on Bluray!) This is basically the bank robbery scene that opens the sequel.

The Extras

The USB with 18 the stills from 'The Dark Knight' included in the DVD version of the gift set IS NOT INCLUDED in the Bluray gift set; don't know what the reason is but it would have made sense to include it in both versions.

The postcards included are selections from the art created to promote 'Batman Begins', in my opinion some of the images look simple and overall they are not that great.

The two comic books included are a joke! One is a comic book adaptation of the same 6 minutes prologue included in this edition (the bank robbery), the other one is the script with pictures of the same 6 minute prologue! I am a collector and big fan of Batman and even I find this ridiculous and overpriced.

The $7.50 coupon to see 'The Dark Knight' in theaters.

Bottom-line, I would give 3 stars to the BluRay release, not to the movie itself (which is great and looks superb in HD) but to the release. I am having buyer's remorse, don't be fooled by what the product description says, it may sound interesting but had I known the extras would be as they are, I would have gone for the cheaper single disc edition.",1133740800,176,5729,4.6393280632411065

It tells the story of Bruce Wayne's life as a child and the psychological factors that made him become what he is today (although the Frank Miller graphic novel - Batman: Year One, does it much better). An all-star cast including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman firmly place the Batman franchise back in the land of professional acting... which is a world away from the television series which Burton dictated his direction from, comical bad guys and larger than life characters are nowhere to be seen, instead Gothem is gritty and the terrain that the caped crusader wanders in, is as real as our own. These are all major plus points especially when the two main villains, the Scarecrow and Ras Al Ghoul come to life. Unfortunately the action sequences tend to overshadow the storyline with unclear resolutions and grand finales that are not as satisfying as its predecessors with an end note that doesn't really sell that well to those who can literally remember watching Burton's versions as fresh as a daisy. Certainly heaps better than the latter Batman vehicles and worth owning, but at the same time doesn't really bring out the B in Batman.",1133654400,2,1191,4.814634146341463
1571257,5,B00005JNJV,"If you are not a fan of comic book heroes, you'll still find a lot to like here, including awesome acting, music, special effects, fighting, explosions, etc.  Bale shines as Wayne and the ""Bat.""  So do the other actors, however.

The one minor issue that I have is the use of the handycam (I think that is the right word) during the hand fighting scenes.  Directors use this to instill a sense of urgency or to get in really close to the action.  I find it annoying because the trick makes it hard to see the actual action.  Plus, I get dizzy trying to follow everything.  Nolan uses this type of camera a lot during the fight scenes.

Other than the use of the handycam, this is a cool movie.  The music is especially haunting.  I am thinking about investing in the soundtrack to this movie as the music is that good.

I think this version is closer to what Batman should be.  It is a dark, gritty action movie with gadgets, villains, and heroes.

This is an excellent DVD to add to your collection.  I am glad that I picked a copy up for our family.  I hesitate to say that is an instant classic in the genre, but I think it compares favorably to Spiderman and the X-Men, two stellar franchises.

I hope DC has learned its lesson.  Nobody wants to see cheese when it comes to superhero movies.",1133568000,,1295,4.3070539419087135
1571258,4,B00005JNJV,"Definitely a good movie, Batman Begins, brings to the screen exactly what the title indicates: the story of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman.

On the positive side: a) The WONDERFUL cast which includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, and Ken Watanabe among others, who have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  Consequently, they have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.  b) The movie is action packed, while the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the costumes, the special effects, and the battle sequences are all excellent. c) The film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!

On the negative side: a) The district attorney (Katie Holmes) looks like she is sixteen and Crane like he's seventeen.  The young actress was a rather poor choice as this movie does not seem to be her thing, while the teenage-looking doctor overdoes it with his character's weird ""attitude."" Consequently, the actors were not convincing in their respective roles, b) The choice of having the League of Shadows being the ""villains"" was not the best.  They do fight evil after all, unless of course there is a not-so-hidden message of frowning upon vigilantes.  Personally I believe that Neeson's words of ""Crime cannot be tolerated.  Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding"" ring true, c) The mention of the Underground Railroad for no other reason than political correctness, which has no place here.

Christian Bale is quietly effective as Bruce Wayne, a likeable and soulful hero, and a truly impressive cast of very famous faces from both America and England give him more than enough support.

But its the story which impresses most. This Batman tale has real depth and only rarely stretches credibility to the point where you are reminded that the film is based on a comic book. It's the story of a man, searching for a means to deal with his own demons and looking for a pathway through life. The script is deft at every turn, making the unfolding plot seem effortless and natural.

Best of all, it relies on great acting, writing, direction and plot, seemlessly interwoven, rather than special effects to hold your attention.

Without a hint of Hollywood's usual, typical ""look at me"" ostentatiousness, Batman Begins may be the most totally watchable and satisfying comic book hero movie I've ever seen.

Bale had lost a horrifying amount of weight down to 100 pounds for the role in The Machanist (2004) and quickly had to beef up and put the muscle back up and out for the Caped Crusader role.  This adult ""Batman"" version is not to be thought of with the version Michael Keaton began with in 1989.
  BATMAN BEGINS (2005) is a brand new metropolitan (metrosexual) Batman as originally written when known as ""The Dark Knight"", to begin a new era of films.  This ""Batman"" is a harder, more violent one.
  This story might be based on ""The Dark Knight"" comic books or ""The Batman"" film serial (1943) starring Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft.

1571263,5,B00005JNJV,"...only joking.

Christopher Nolan's take on the Caped Crusader takes a refreshing and more serious direction than the previous two installments of the Batman franchise. Gone is the irritating self-parody. Gone are the tired theatrics. Gone are the camp villains whom seem more in common with the tone of the original television show (POW! WHACK! YAWN!) rather than Tim Burton's revitalised take on the then stale 'superhero' genre.

Christian Bale is an inspired choice to play Bruce Wayne. If you have seen his portrayal of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho you begin to recognise a true acting talent. His transformation from murderous, souless Wall St yuppie into one of the world's most recognisable superheroes is very similar to Michael Keaton's transformation from his funny OTT performance as the green haired, bug-eating bio-exorcist in Beetlejuice to his sobering, deadpan portyal in Burton's Batman world.

Bale, however, is just as complex as Bruce Wayne as Keaton was in his portrayal. Bale's Bruce Wayne is fuelled by anger, guilt and, initially, a desire for revenge. In this respect, he is not much different from Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's initial mentor (played by Liam Neeson) - who teaches Wayne how to let go of his fears.

Katie Holmes is the love interest as Rachel Dawes, a district DA (if somewhat unrealistically young) who, like Wayne, seeks justice in a city slipping into squalor and corruption, fuelled by apathy.

Michael Caine is great as Alfred. He is very paternal to Wayne, even to the point of chastising him as if he is a mischievous school boy. Morgan Freeman adds warmth as a fallen Lucius Fox who keeps some pretty cool toys in his warehouse-like workplace.

Gotham City has also been given a fresh takeover. Gone is the neo-gothic fairyland that is always nearly buried in night and snow. This city is a fusion of New York and Chicago and other huge city landscapes. This supplements the film's more sober approach to the Batman legacy. Criminals are drug-dealers, mobsters, corrupt cops, rather than Jokers, Riddlers, etc. The Scarecrow is a wacky villain, but his use of mind destroying drugs is creepy and sinister enough to give him serious gravitus.

I found this film brilliant in its fresh retake on the story. This, arguably, is the best superhero film to be made in years. It has revitalised the legacy for new Batman fans as well as offering something new for old die-hards.

The ending finishes up with a tantalising prospect of a sequel (I read somewhere Jude Law may play the Joker, though it may be just a rumour).",1133395200,6,2572,4.9375

In fact, I didn't go see this one in the theater until it was almost released to DVD...one night on a boring business trip when I had nothing better to do, I strolled to the local theater and decided to check it out...

...and WOW.

If you were tired of the Batman flicks of the '90's and how they got worse with each movie, do not fear.  This one is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest (yes, even better than the first one with Jack Nicholson).  Batman Begins is, in a word, incredible.

Strong performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and others.  A fabulous storyline that is much, much more than cheesy one-liners and ridiculous comic book style visuals and effects.  And some great action sequences that will even make you say ""WOW"" in this era of super-sized special effects.

1571335,5,B00005JNJV,"First off, I really liked the BATMAN in the 80s with Michael Keaton.  That said, this take on Batman is just better.

Why?

Well, yes, they've got CGI and a better budget to help them out and the cast is arguably more known.  But the big thing is that it's true to the actual comic books.  For instance, unlike the older BATMAN, the Joker didn't kill Bruce Wayne's parents.

Also consider that big name actors chose small roles to be in this . . . most notably Morgan Freeman.

Action scenes are purposefully fast to make it more realistic.

Character of Batman is far well-defined than in any other Batman movie.  Several payoff dialogues add closure to the tale (i.e. with Katie Holmes, the homeless dude and Rutger Hauer).

1571336,4,B00005JNJV,"This is the dark Batman that Frank Miller created, mixed with some of the original 1940's iconography from the Batman's original Comic Book beginnings.  At certain  points during this caper it was a little bit difficult to recognize him as a hero who wants to help the downtrodden, because of his dark nature (played to the hilt by Christian Bale - the American Psycho himself).

Michael Caine has a wonderful comedic influence on this semi-twisted movie.  More power to this actor!  It is certainly a long way from The Hand.

Katie Holmes seems to be a bit young for the Bat to be dating, but he is a millionaire.  I suppose that the characters were supposed to be approximately the same age from the scene towards the beginning of the movie where they were playing in the Wayne garden and Bruce discovers the cave under the South-West corner of the Manse.

The new Bat-Moblie is killer.  I like the jet-powered one from the Burton films better, but this one served its' purpose.  I never visualized the Bat driving what is, for all intents, a Tank!  It works.

This film is a new conceptualization of Gotham and its residents.

The character of Jonathan Crane was well played.  I cannot remember the actor who brought him to life on tis movie, but he made the Scarecrow real for me.

Don't believe all the exaggerated publicity regarding this movie.

This has to be one of the most over-rated films i've ever seen.

Yes, the movie has a big quality to it - it is over-produced and heavy-handed. Watching it was a real drag. Just because a movie has a big feel and look to it, doesn't mean its great.

Anyway, to me 'Batman Begins' was a tiresome waste of time and as phony as Batman's hoarse voice. (sounds like in the movie he may have a cold - so instead of pop corn, you may want to have a few cough drops on hand if you decide to watch this).

If you have never seen those movies you should, to understand just what this man was capable of before getting ensnared by the major American studios.  Definitely not your typical big-budget Hollywood cheeseball, Nolan has an original vision and style.

What sets this film apart is the fact that it has a well-developed, well-written and believable psychological AND philosophical backstory, rather than being just another special effects and computer-animation orgy.

With the exception of the inevitable ""Batman saves the day at the last moment in dramatic showdown with the evil head honcho"" final 10 minutes, it had me guessing most of the way through.  The weakest link as others have noted, was casting Katie Holmes, who is a cutie but has an acting range of maybe 3 rubber expressions (self-righteous, confused, scared).",1132876800,7,955,5.382550335570469

So here's my take on this movie.

Batman's costume wasn't that good. It looked heavy and the pointy bat ears were really short- which they aren't supposed to be. Since when does batman have a raspy voice? I hated batman talking like he had a sorethroat. I mean he's a multi-billionaire and it only costs like 2-3 bucks for a bag of cough drops. The batmobile was like a tank. The batmobile is supposed to be a car, not a tank. It's batMOBILE, not batTANK.

Christian Bale as batman was good but not good enough. Batman is supposed to be like 6""2. Christian Bale is quite short actually, Katie Holmes was taller than him as well as the butler. I mean come on the butler is taller than batman!? The directors did a poor job finding an actor for this.

The beginning is very slow however it is expected as the title says 'Batman Begins'.

I'm no hardcore batman fan, meaning I don't often read the comics or frequent batman message boards, but I do know batman is supposed one of the most respected and intelligent heroes. Alot of people are forgetting what batman really is, and they are only thinking about the action infront of their eyes in the film. Batman is intelligent, he figures out mysteries he makes good descisions. I didn't really see any of that in Batman's character in Batman Begins.

The plot in Batman was really weak. I mean we have already seen the train scene in Spiderman 2 why do they finish with something like that? I did not feel the climax of the movie at all as a I watched it. All batman does is battle his mentor on a train while it's about to go off the tracks. We've seen batman throw punches and kicks earlier in the movie! Why do they give us the same thing and people are happy with it? I'm tired of Hollywood giving us the same crappy predictable movies and everyone is happy with it. The story was alright but it was so dumbed down to typical Hollywood Blockbuster level with the unrequited love between Holmes/Bale with the worse being the end with yet another train hurtling towards the destruction of something ala Speed and more recent Spiderman 2. This was a remix of a movie abet better then previous attempts but that is not saying much. Alot of people liked this movie, I didn't.

It shows how Bruce Wayne came to be Batman, starting with the death of his parents when he was a child.

Shocked by the stunningly bad treatment of this classic character, critically acclaimed director Christopher Nolan and comic book fan David Goyer (who wrote the ""Blade"" films) joined forces to write ""Batman Begins"". Unlike the films of the previous series (event the Tim Burton films, which were excellent and are still my favorites), this one was to be faithful to the source material and show the true origins of the Dark Knight.

And man does it ever. ""Batman Begins"" take you back - way back -to Bruce Wayne's origins. Tormented by the sight of his parents' murder as a child, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) goes on a journey to find himself. He winds up in an Asian prison, where he is found by the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who works for a secret organization known as the Leauge Of Shadows. There Bruce learns how to concquer his fears through strength and discipline. However, he soon learns that the Leauge are not all that it's cracked up to be, and he eludes them and returns to Gotham City. There, he is awaited by his trusted and loving butler Alfred (Michael Caine, perfectly cast) and his childfriend Rachel Dawes (a miscast Katie Holmes). He learns that Wayne Enterprises, the corporation his father started to help Gotham City has been taken over by sleazy business mogul Richard Eearle (Rutger Hauer, c'mon, you remember him). With the help of Alfred and outcast Wayne Enterprises ally Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman, again perfectly cast), he adopts a new persona, a vengeful vigilante who uses his fear of bats to strike fear into the hearts of others. He becomes...Batman. And that's where the fun begins. He becomes allies with Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, once again perfectly cast), one of Gotham's only good cops). With his help, he must take down the sinister Dr. Jonathan Crane (the creepy Cillian Murphy, who was awesome), aka Scarecrow, who plans to poison Gotham City with his fear gas. There's nonstop action mixed in with an incredibly well written plot that amounts to the best Batman movie in nearly 15 years.

All in all, this film is excellent. The cast is perfect for the most part. Christian Bale makes for a great Batman and Bruce Wayne. He does just as good as Michael Keaton, but he also adds an edge to the role not scene before. Michael Caine brings the role of Alfred to life, as does Gary Oldman with Jim Gordon. In the previous franchise, these characters weren't given proper treatment. I didn't mind, but it's nice to see them finally get the respect they deserve. Neeson is excellent as Ducard, who wasn't actually a villian in the comics. He is extremely low key and very creepy. Freeman is excellent as Fox. In the comics, Fox was a pretty minor character, but Freeman makes the character very accesssible and thus the character is put to good use. Cillian Murphy was fantastic as The Scarecrow. He owned the part. Tom Wilkinson even pops up for a great cameo as crime boss Carmine Falcone. Katie Holmes, as I said earlier, was extremely miscast. She just wasn't able to hold her own against the film's other stars.

The extras on the second disc are great, but the menu takes a while to navigate. I liked the comic book, too. Definitely a must see movie.",1132790400,4,3539,4.7216828478964405

1571506,4,B00005JNJV,"Doubtless, Nolan has reinvigorated the Batman franchise. Warner Brothers gambled on this production and was hugely successful. Who knows if Nolan will continue to direct but doubtless Caine, Freeman, and Bale will continue to play their roles. They've been given very good scripts, very good characters, and guaranteed box office. That is the hat-trick that all actors crave. Batman Begins should have a very significant effect on the genre itself. Where comic book movies have begun to falter very badly--we were given a very good example of such faltering movies in The Fantastic Four playing this very summer--Nolan has shown us how a such a movie can be successful. Certainly, future movies in this sub-genre will be encouraged to explore similar ""dark and adult themes"" in their scripts. What will be interesting to see is if Hollywood can tear itself away from the setting of the comic book world and begin to explore new concepts in speculative settings that don't have agendas, scripts, and characters ready-made. Could Batman Begins have been successful under a different title and a different name? We think so. In fact, the thought of a movie where a troubled man begins to take justice in to his own hands with the implicit cooperation of elements within the justice department would have a profound resonance in this day and age of terrorism. Or, it could follow in the footsteps of M. Night Shyamalan's excellent movie Unbreakable where the thought of becoming a comic book hero in real terms has real consequences and real misgivings. Truly, watched together, Unbreakable and Batman Begins share similar elements and differ only in that one invokes a heritage and one inherits a bequest. Will Nolan show Hollywood the path to reinvigorating movie production in general? We can only pray it is so...

WHO SHOULD SEE

The box office take for this movie was wildly successful. Certainly, enthusiasts of Spider Man, prior Batman films, Superman, and all the host of other comic book movies will be astonished at the scope and daring of this movie as compared to others. Fans of Burton's first Batman film who felt rather lost and abandoned in the subsequent three films will find the return to roots and adult plotting refreshing. Movie audiences that relish psychological conflict as much as they relish physical conflict will find a great deal within this movie that will excite their craving for suspense.

WHO SHOULD PASS

This is a movie that requires a deal of immersion and patriotism towards the genre itself. People who approach these more speculative elements with a great deal of suspicion tinged with a bit of contempt will not enjoy this film. A suspension of some disbelief is required despite Nolan's efforts at creating realistic spectacle. This is precisely true because the characters are symbolic and the themes are familiar archetypes... for subtle shadings of grey, the viewer will have to seek elsewhere. Gotham City is, after all, not a real place and that will irritate some viewers. Equally, people looking finally for something different in this genre of comic book movies will be disappointed; it is different in craft but it is still very emphatically a comic book movie. It is a comic book movie done exceptionally well but still a comic book movie. People seeing this film only because they are fans of Katie Holmes will probably be disappointed with her performance. Younger children will probably not enjoy this film, be terrified of some elements of it, and not understand a great deal. Parents should take the 13 in the PG-13 rating very, very seriously. Take young kids to see Spider Man 2 and The Fantastic Four.

1571507,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins (Christopher Nolan, 2005)

Nolan finally shows us that Memento wasn't a fluke with Batman Begins. Completely ignoring the film-series mythos, he starts from scratch again, giving us the story of Bruce Wayne (The Machinist's Christian Bale, giving his second fantastic performance in two years) in the years leading up to his becoming Batman, as well as the first months of his superhero status.

While Bale's performance is quite good, there's no way he could have pulled this off by himself. Nolan and co. surrounded him with an excellent supporting cast, including Liam Neeson, Michael Caine (who takes over the Alfred role more than capably), Gary Oldman, Katie Holmes (whose career, save the amusing Pieces of April, had taken a decidedly ugly turn before this), Rutger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, and more (it would, in fact, be possible to spend an entire thousand-word review just naming, much less extolling the virtues of, the cast).

Nolan seems to have (thankfully) thrown away everything he learned in his completely unnecessary remake of Insomnia and decided to direct another Memento. Good thing, too; the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of Memento is tailor-made for a Batman story. He's got a bigger budget this time, though; Nolan's Gotham is perhaps the best-realized alternate city since Ridley Scott made Bladerunner more than two decades ago now. Nolan, like Scott before him, shows that it's possible to have a whole city as your landscape and still make a movie that's almost painfully intimate.

About the only real flaw in it is that Bruce Wayne's character isn't nearly as fatally flawed as either his comic-book incarnation (at least, the comic-book incarnation we've had for the past twenty years or so) or as he was in the earlier films. However, if Nolan continues the series, and the movie's final scene certainly sets the stage for that, then he'll certainly have ample opportunity to more fully explore Wayne's character.

The best Batman film to date by a wide margin. It's good to see Nolan's found his chops again. ****",1132704000,,2064,5.094674556213017

And the wait was definitely worth it. Nolan's film is, simply put, the best in the series. Christian Bale captures the true essence of the character, playing him neither too weak (like Tobey Maguire in the ""Spider-Man"" films) or too strong, but somewhere in between, and perfectly. The great supporting cast, fantastic action sequences and dark tone converge to create the best superhero film since the original ""Superman."" The 2-Disc Deluxe Edition comes with amazing extras and a fascinating 72-page comic book with three stories that inspired the movie.

1571511,4,B00005JNJV,"Hey, guess what? This is a real good film. Actually, the first half of this production is an excellent movie and the second half is still pretty darned-good.

As the title implies ""Batman Begins"" is an origin story. This is usually my favorite part of Superhero epics -- how about you? The filmmakers took some interesting risks in casting a lesser-known, though strong actor -- Christian Bale. Bale fits the role and the costume well. He's brooding, strong, vulnerable, yet decisive -- and perhaps even more than all of that -- as about as real/believable as Batman gets.

Another surprise is director Christopher Nolan of the highly acclaimed Memento. For those who haven't seen this unique, yet brain-straining feature; suffice to say that Nolan is great with thought and suspense -- but action? What an exciting risk to employ. Personally, I think these risks pay off in spades. This is a film that cares a great deal for what is going on inside the Bat-Man's head; the action is more of an accent.

The fight scenes are shot close in; Nolan seems to have made a conscious decision not to compete with other more ""martial arts"" hand-to-hand action flicks. His action scenes are dark, the sounds and movement jeer a chill or more accurately -- fear.

Building a solid motif around fear, this strong screenplay unfolds masterfully until the two-thirds mark, at which point some of the pacing slips just a bit, and further complications blur its initial beauty. I enjoyed the idea of the masked foe introduced at that point, but his actual execution on film smacked of the phony supervillians I didn't like in earlier Batmans. That said, the film's other foes are well-acted, enjoyable, respectably intimidating.

A good film -- you'll get your money's worth.",1132444800,12,1760,4.89261744966443

The antagonist is kind of unlike any other movie which is bizarre but at the same time interesting.

1571513,5,B00005JNJV,"This movie is by far the best Batman movie ever created.  Unlike the past movies, this one had all the aspects of greatness.

The past movies relied on the concept of fantasy, overacting, and pre-acceptance of less than realistic approach for portraying Batman.  The past movies Were more for children than mature audience.  They relied on making batman a pre-modified super hero who did not have to go through anything but a vague backflash of the deaths of his parents.  This movied took time and effort to establish a story on Bruce Wayne's journey into achieving his status.  No pre assumed training, finance, and control over his wealth.  This time Bruce Wayne had to fight and earn his positions from letting go of the spoiled rich life, to the background of his training, to the question of how he got a hold of all his cool gadgets.  Realism, while there are still some extraordinary events going on, this movie was still very realistic.  Even the Batmobile itself is a real vehicle, not CGI.

The best part of this movie is how the director took the time to tell the story without jumps.  No where in the movie will you go, ""what the hell just happened?  how did they get there?""  The explanations were smooth and clear.

The acting was also a major part in this movie.  the director really wanted to pay attention to realism and not theatrics.  the past movies portrayed the characters as almost comicly with their overacting their parts.  There were no BWAHAHAHAHAHAs in this movie and all characters played their roles as one would expect from any normal person.

If possible, I would have rated this movie a 10.  And for those who have not yet seen this movie, the ending will DEFINETLY capture you and make you eager for the next installment to come out.",1132272000,2,1768,4.645161290322581

People really need to go THINK about something for five minutes before they wax philosophical about something like this movie. *whooosh* Batman swoops in. *Whoosh* Batman swoops out. And all the 14-year olds in the movie theatre (Even the ones that are certified public accountants) go ""COOL!"".

Somehow, no matter how much psychobabble they try to slap on top, and no matter how many Pseudo-Literati Youngin's trying out the skills they learned in their first English lit class talk about it, they'll never quite manage to cover the fact that this is a movie about a DUDE that wears a costume with BIG RUBBER MAN MUSCLES (nipples included) and BAT EARS on it. WHY would I be interested in what this fellar has to pontificate about while he kicks people and shoots at things and drives around in computer-generated gadgets? THE DUDE IS WEARING BAT EARS AND RUBBER MUSCLES.

Did Chuck Norris star in this movie? I couldn't quite tell. There was so much posturing and mooning around in costumes that Orville Redenbacher could have been Batman and I wouldn't have noticed. In fact, given the aforementioned RUBBER MAN MUSCLES, Orville Redenbacher COULD have been Batman.

This was an unimaginative, uninteresting rehash of a movie. The philosophy was suitable for NFL voiceovers, and the action mostly revolved around explosions and swooping. If this is what people think it is to be a MAN, no wonder we've got so many fools running around our country. You know who was a MAN? Gandhi was a man. Poundmaker was a man. Kierkegaard was a man. Zeno was a man. The Apostle John was a man. Being a 'Man' isn't a function of the size of your muscles or the amount of butt you can kick. If you think it is, you need to turn off the media boxes you're intravenously connected to and go do something with yourself.

""Batman Begins"" takes the story of the superhero Batman right to the beginning. The viewer sees what lead Bruce Wayne to become Batman and not in just brief flashback scenerios. The first 45 minutes of the film goes into great detail to how Bruce Wayne acquired the skills that he knows as Batman through his rigorous training with Liam Neeson's character Henri Ducard. In the begining, one can't help notice the similiarities between Henri and Liam's character in ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"" Qui-Gon Jinn. Christian Bale was an excellent choice to play Batman. His quiet intensity gave Bruce Wayne/Batman proved to be the most convincing since Michael Keaton. The film was a bit slow and sluggish at times. I found Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes a bit unbelievable. I just couldn't believe that she was an assistant d.a but she wasn't completely terrible. I think she was just a bit too young for the role, not to mention the wrong actress to play Rachel Dawes. I think the film would have been better had there been no romantic storyline between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes. I always didn't like it in the Batman films when Bruce Wayne would hook up with some attractive young woman except maybe for Catwoman. I found the romantic storyline a distraction in the film. I think the film should have had a pre-Two Face Harvey Dent instead of Rachel Dawes as the prosecuting attorney. Michael Keaton was excellent as the butler Alfred, and gotta love Cillian Crane/Scarecrow.

1571628,5,B00005JNJV,"You've got to hand it to Warner Bros.; they finally got it right.  With Memento director Christopher Nolan at the helm, Batman is finally given the right treatment that the classic DC Comics icon has deserved as Nolan and co-screenwriter David Goyer take the Dark Knight back to his roots.  There's no major celebrity villains that take up most of the film, there's no fourescent colors, there's no Bat-nipples, and there's no Robin; this is the way Batman should be.  Christian Bale wonderfully cast as the brooding Bruce Wayne, searching across the world for a means to battle crime as he is haunted by the death of his parents.  He meets a man named Ducard (Liam Neeson), who trains him and offers him a place in the League of Shadows led by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe).  After a spectacular action sequence, Bruce returns to the crime ridden Gotham City which is under the fist of crime lord Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson); and with the assitance of his faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine, perfectly cast), technical genius Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and honest cop Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, wonderfully cast against type), Batman is born.  Unlike the other Batman films, Batman Begins really gets to the heart and soul of the character, and Bale couldn't be better as the Dark Knight.  The cinematography is superb, the fight scenes are nicely orchestrated, and the rest of the cast is great as well, including Cillian Murphy who is perfectly creepy as the vile Scarecrow.  The only weak point of Batman Begins is Katie Holmes as the Gotham DA/love interest, but her she doesn't have a significant amount of screen time.  All in all, Batman Begins is a magnificent return to form for the character, and it's one of the best comic to film adaptations ever.",1132185600,3,1765,4.798679867986799

This episode was lighter on the comic relief and more on the story. In the beginning Liam Neeson (who plays a pseudo mentor for Christian Bale) reminded me a lot of his Star Wars character. Michael Caine was excellent as the caring chaperone butler but I expected him to go into his ""Kings of England"" speech a few times. Katie Holmes was her cute little self but nothing to write home about. Morgan Freeman had a wee role. All the supporting characters have had better roles but it was fun to see them as supporting cast. And they really do support Christian without stealing the spotlight.

This is a splashy role for Christian but he was hot. This was a huge difference from the Machinist which I've seen recently (definitely watch it to see the physical sacrifice this actor goes through). He was enjoyable and believable as the dark Bruce searching for a purpose and societal role.

We enjoyed seeing the creation of Batman's gadgets: the car, the belt, the suit etc. My husband didn't like the car though. My only disappointment? Absolutely no features. Excellent movie.",1132185600,,1258,4.788018433179723

The beginning of the movie reminded me instantly of ""Highlander"" (the first one of those), the rest of it could have been inspired by a thousand other ""dark"" action-movies (""The Crow"" as an example). So take it easy now, Batman-maniacs. Bale is a good actor, and ""suits"" his part -Oldman sadly wastes his talent (my favorite actor), the same goes for Freeman and Caine. No disaster, but nothing remembarable here. I couldn't help feeling that the script was missing something.

For instance some parts of the beginning of batman have been changed, where little bruce see's his parents die, which was a main part of the movie with the Joker.

the X- Men or the Hulk. In fact, even if you don't care for Batman or

any of his costumed colleagues, you can still enjoy this film as a good

action- thriller. It doesn't thrive on special effects and big action

scenes but offers a decent story with lots of attention to character

development. The movie is fairly low tech and because it doesn't rely

on computer technology in the way other recent superhero movies do, it

has an old school feel to it, kind of like an early 80s fantastic film

or even Superman: The Movie. Of course, Batman Begins is much darker

than Richard Donner's beauty, but the evolution of both main characters

from youths, coming to terms with who they are, to caped crusaders is

depicted in a similar way. As far as the actual crime fighting goes,

this movie puts right everything that was done wrong in Batman Forever

and Batman and Robin. Our hero's weapons are not covered with blinking

lights, but sober and practical: no computer controlled Batarangs, but

ninja stars shaped as a bat. No design costume, but military armor,

decorated with a cape and mask. The Batmobile is no skyscraper climbing

super car, but a rejected army vehicle put to new use that befits the

general atmosphere of this movie. Batman doesn't fight villains in

shiny outfits who fly around on supersonic gliders or have tentacles as

arms. The bad guys in this film are real people: gangsters, a corrupt

warden of a psychiatric ward, a martial arts specialist and lots of

crooked cops. If you take into consideration that Batman Begins is

based on the Year One comics, written by Sin City's Frank Miller, one

cannot help noticing the similarity between Robert Rodriguez' newly

created world and the one depicted in this movie. In fact, Sin City

could just as well be Gotham City without Batman. So forget Joel

Schumacher's monstrosities. In fact, Christopher Nolan has even gone

one better than Tim Burton and created a credible movie with a good

story, realistic characters and the filthiest setting the world's

Darkest Knight has ever called home.",1131926400,4,2152,4.784741144414169

First of all, the character of Batman is really well developed.

1571709,4,B00005JNJV,"I saw this film on Sunday, and I left the theater feeling mostly pleased with what I had witnessed. The movie is a bit of a mixed blessing though, because despite the direction in which the writer and director decided to steer this series in, which was a very promising and likeable concept, it still fell short of expections and didn't quite live up to the hype for a number of reasons.

The acting was good, and the cast was perfect, I mean it has the cream of the crop of actors so that couldn't have been better. Honestly, who can complain with the likes of Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Christian Bale and Michael Caine? It just doesn't get much better than that, folks. Unfortunately, the primary problem with the film was that it felt rushed and I didn't really notice a great deal of character development, nor was the plot itself all that fleshed out. For example, as many may have seen in the trailers of Bruce Wayne's training, that was more or less the extent of his training in the film. I was under the impression that the director would expound upon those principles to a greater degree in the film, but rather I was treated to a mere glimpse, much like the trailer, into Wayne's actual transformation from the billionaire playboy to the dark and brooding, masked crusader of justice. Where was the in depth martial arts training, the focus on ninjitsu, the impartment of Asian wisdom, the meditation and devotion to the cause of fighting evil and upholding the balance of good and evil? I felt robbed of what was promised to be an unparalled, unique and enriching experience of the real Batman.

Having said that, what I did like was the more realistic and plausible approach towards his gear and high tech gadgets, as well as his training obviously, however limited in scope that it was.

The villains were a little disappointing this time around, which is another major distraction from the overall enjoyment of this film. Was the Scarecrow well made? Yes, I like the effects, not too over the top, and he seemed a little scary but he wasn't quite as effective and disturbing as let's say Nicholson's Joker or pathetic and loathsome as Devito's Penguin. He didn't have enough screen time to make a big impression, nor did his evildoer counterparts, like the mob boss or the main antagonist.

As for the special effects in general, I thought it was competent, since the producers did not get carried away with CGI and superfluous aesthetics which is far too common these days, which is evident with such films as 'Van Helsing', '13 Ghosts' and so on.

I was fond of the romance between Wayne and the assistant D.A. played by Katie Holmes. Their chemistry was not off the charts and in your face, but it worked, and it seemed believable unlike certain unmentionable on-screen romances that have plagued prequels in recent years.

All things considered, I think the story was a little above average with awesome concepts but flawed execution, as in too brief and rushed. I'm thinking that they cut out many crucial scenes much like Jackson did with the LOTR trilogy, just for the reason of being able to sell millions more DVDs than the regular theatrical version would. I'm positive that there will be an uncut, unrated director's cut with extras up the wazoo, but quite frankly I find this trend inexusable, since the theater version should be the ultimate and final version of the film, because first impressions count the most, and it's the version that the majority of viewers will be familiar with from the start.

It's kind of sad to see such wasted potential though, since many of these legendary actors did not really get the chance to show off their acting skills to a great extent.

As a whole, I recommend the film for trying something original and taking the road less traveled, but I cannot accept all the missed opportunities for greatness that were there for the taking. That I blame on the writer(s) as well as the director, perhaps some of the producers as well. Nonetheless, it is worth seeing, and I'm glad to say that it is way better than the last two Batman incarnations, but not any greater than Tim Burton's first two films.

Final grade is 4/5 stars, since it is above average but nothing memorable or classic. Hollywood, good try but you can do better.",1131840000,2,4320,4.681159420289855
1571710,4,B00005JNJV,"The new Batman movie, the first since Joel Schumacher ruined the franchise eight years ago, can basically be divided into two separate movies. The first part plays out almost like an episode of Lost, unfortunately of the second season variety, where Bruce Wayne finds himself in the Himalaya region where he is recruited by, Henri Ducard played by Liam Neeson in full Qui-Gon Jinn mode with Wayne as his apprentice, to join his League of Shadows. And the training sessions, with its clichd metaphors, are peppered with a younger Bruce Wayne, showing what in his life led him to this point. These flashbacks also lead to some revisionist flashbacks most notable that The Joker was not the one who killed Wayne's parents nor did the killer even mutter the phrase, ""Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?""

The first act is saved by the closing fight sequence between Wayne and the villain of the first half of the film, Ra's Al Ghul played by Ken Watanabe from The Last Samurai. It seems as if Ken was cast solely for the fight sequence because his role is quite limited in the movie.

After his exile in Tibet, Wayne finally arrives back in Gotham to start the second act. It starts out slowly as Wanye starts to create his Batman alter ego with Batsuit, which we don't get to see until an hour into the movie, and Batmobile, which is now a tank rather than the classic sports car from past incarnations of the franchise. The villain of the second act is one of my favorite from the Batman mythology, the Scarecrow, second after the Penguin. But much like how the ruined the Penguin in Batman Returns, the Scarecrow is usually seen as his alter ego, Dr. Jonathan Crane, both played by Cillian Murphy, no relation tom Eddie or Charlie, and his only rarely puts the mask on. And when he permanently turns into the Scarecrow, he only makes a small cameo in the final epic battle.

In the final battle, they tie in both first and second acts well including a plot twist that I never saw coming. The acting is top notch, but that happens when your supporting cast includes Neeson, Watanabe, Micheal Caine as Alfred, Morgan Feeman as scientist Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as not quite yet Commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale, who I will always remember as the title character from American Psycho, is Bruce Wayne, which he does a good job at. But, like his predecessors, I really don't think he does a god job as Batman. Katie Holmes, most known as Tom Cruise's latest promotional tool, plays the token love interest who, like all of Batman's love interest not named Catwoman, is one-dimentional.",1131753600,3,2609,4.655097613882863

Mr. Bale, who was a complete stud in American Psycho, didn't get much too work with here, and thats a shame cuz' the kid can act. I adored the 1st Batman, that's a 4.5 star movie, easy, Michael Keaton and of course Jack Nicholson made that movie so much fun. Unfortunately, Bale and Liam Neeson don't have any of the chemistry that Mike and Jack had, even Clooney and Arnold had more chemistry, which is kinda sad when you think of it.

I didn't care for any of the explanations on how he came to use bats, how he learned his ""art"" even the scene with his parents did not work for me cuz we saw the same scene in the first movie done much better with Jack robbing his folks and blowing them away.

This did not get 1 star thanks to Michael Caine, this man rarely makes a bad movie, and even though I really did not care for this, he was still wonderfull, very funny, and really shined and made me forget that this was a different actor playing Alfred.

I know alot of you loved this movie, saying it revitalized the franchise, but I disagree, I'm Batman'd out, we've had four different Batman's, two diffrent Alfred's, three different mayor's, a couple of different Gordon's, enough is enough, let it end here, please.

1571712,5,B00005JNJV,"When I heard there was another Batman movie coming out I thought to my self, ""Yes, another big flop on my favorite comic book and show."" I was dead wrong. Batman Begins has the action, and more importantly the plot development that movies lack nowadays. Unlike the Spiderman movie's happy happy joy joy feel with unrealistic happy outcomes to every event, Batman Begins has plot twists, deception, and is a more realistic movie in general. I'd have to say that the movie started out pretty quickly and for a second I thought they made Bruce Wayne an Asian man. This movie is probably for teens and adults versus younger kids, just because their is some ""intense and scary"" parts. I'd have to say this is perhaps one of the best ""hero movies"" and I highly recommend it.",1131667200,2,768,4.613138686131387
1571848,4,B00005JNJV,"...especially the one with Alicia Silverstone.  Although, ""it's time for a freeze!"" is a damn good line, no denying it.  Anyways, onto the review.

All in all I'd have to say this was a pretty good movie, I'd say the second best Batman film made, next to the first one with Keaton and Nickleson.  I especially enjoyed the first 45 min, dealing with Bruce Wayne's tutelage under Liam Neisen, who is brilliant in the film.  The whole Batman character has been made much more realistic than in past films (although less comic-booky), and psychologically this movie is far superior to its predecesors.  The idea of Batman as an object of fear is well explored, and I find it refreshing in the face of too-friendly superheroes like Spiderman and the like.  Katie Holmes is passable (at best) as young Bruce's romantic interest, although the romance really takes a major backseat to the crime fighting an all.  Cillian Murphy is great as the Scarecrow, one of the more interesting Batman villians (and just not as fruity as Riddler).

So mostly good, but some areas to watch out for:

- Fight scenes: Commonly described as ""victim's point of view"", a lot of the fighting in this movie just gave me a headache.  It's impossible to tell who's hitting who or what the hell is really going on.  Victim's point of view is just a stupid idea.  So if a guy gets clocked in the head and falls on his back, is the camera supposed to just stare at the sky until he wakes up?  No, because that would be stupid.  Fight scenes would've been so much better without a camera controlled by a drunken chimpanzee.

- Gruff voice:  Yeh, I understand that Batman should sound scary and maybe disguise his voice a tad, but Nolan just goes way overboard with the huskiness.  It almost comical at points.  I defy you not to laugh when he's yelling at the fat cop to get info out of him.  Just histerical.

- Lack of congruence:  Not sure if this was intentional or not, but some stuff in the plot just doesn't fit in with the previous Batman films.  Not really a huge deal, but it might bug some people.

So yeh, a few less than grand areas, but an entertaining film nonetheless.  Give it a shot.",1131667200,2,2167,4.494871794871795
1571849,3,B00005JNJV,"If the fight scenes were filmed, as said, from the victim's point of view, all I can say is the victim is the viewer. These are some of the most poorly edited and cramped fighting scenes I've ever seen in a major motion picture. What is going on in them is anyone's guess and there is certainly no thrill or excitement and anxiety built in any of them. Mostly, you, the victim/viewer, is trying to figure out what the hell is going on and who is beating up whom. But there are good things, to be sure, in this Batman, particularly Liam Neeson as Ducard, the mentor. Christian Bale has received major accolades for making Batman and Bruce three dimensional, but I was only partly behind his portrayal the entire way -- he certainly wasn't aided by some ridiculously stilted dialogue. In the modern series, this certainly is the most intellectually rich Batman, but the whole story of the Batman has been retold in variations and adventures for years and years, on and on. It has proven elastic, but I think the story is a phase fans relate to intensely, then either move on from, or forever wallow in its permutations. So, while the ardent point to this film and say, see, there is life left in the franchise! You could also say it's just been dressed up all over again. I did enjoy this film, but it's still hokey claptrap, and the fight scenes set it way back. I'm not walking away from Batman for good, yet, however. If they deliver more Cilian Murphy as Scarecrow, I just might find myself plunking down my money again.",1131667200,4,1522,4.498194945848375

It would have been a great movie had it not been for an insipid performance by Katie Holmes. There are countless other female actresses that could have played that role better. (why oh why?) Try as we did to suspend disbelief and give her a chance to play her character in the dramatic scenes... we never were able to get over the eerie feeling that Dawson's creek made it somehow into the script. She's just not ready for the big screen... Perhaps a few more films might do it. It's a sad case as I would have probably bought this film had it not been for her lackluster performance. On a more positive note... All the other characters and actors were superb.",1131494400,2,773,4.4125874125874125

1571852,5,B00005JNJV,"This is the way to do it! All the other Batman movies were lame ducks. In this one, acting goes from good to extraordinary good. Visuals are superb. Cinematography is excellent, darkish, ominous looking, just can't be any better. Stunts and fight sequences are magnificent.

Any low point? Yes. My main problem was the water-down violence, in search of a PG-13 rating. That was bad. Let's look at it for a second. Batman is a crime fighter. Criminals do evil things, are ruthless, kill everybody and shoot twice at the wounded. So Batman is a goody-goody fellow, never kills anybody except by chance or accident, and avoids romantic involvenment.

Well, that is not good in my agenda. But that is just me. It is my usual complain against PG-13 ratings which kill potential great movies by turning us into grown-up children.

Film violence is always carefully choreographed to avoid injuries. In this movie they go to the borderline, and the actors perform their own stunts most of the time, adding realism to the action. Thus, the fighting sequences are great. However, in order to make it less shocking, the scenes are filmed mostly in close-ups and with fast editing. Remember the ""Moulin Rouge"" disaster? Just similar. Too bad. Bruce Lee did it best 30 years ago. All his fighting scenes are shot from a distance, so the viewer can see the whole body of the hero and his foes.

That said, this Batman is the real thing. I hope the sequels are equally relevant to the saga.

Did I forget something? Well, yes... the Batmobile. In this movie is called The Tumbler and I assure you, is the coolest, greatest Batmobile ever. It's sooo wonderful that they should get Detroit to manufacure so people could drive it to the supermarket or kids to school.",1131494400,6,1749,4.740131578947368
1571853,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman has taken a whole new twist in this completly different telling of the story of the dark knight. The 40's produced some lame seriels, the 60's produced a campy comedy of Batman and Robin, but it left confusion when Tim Burton decided to base his 1989 version of Batman on the comic books and show the REAL Batman story that only the comic book fans knew about.

Tim Burton did a great job with his Batman, and a decent job with Batman Returns (1992) but the saga slipped and fell on its bat-butt with the other 2 shockers.

Now, 16 years after Tim Burtons vision of Batman became what it became, this newer version goes back to the roots of Bruce Wayne. Everyone knows the sotry of Bruce Wayne, even your great grandmother whose not a fan knows Bruce Wayne's parents where killed, then he goes into hiding and returns to Gothem as the caped crusader..... BUT, for the 1st time ever, we get to see what happend in those years he was away from Gothem. And where he learned his skills, and the big question of WHY he would decide to be Batman.

This edition focus's its history and remaking from the comic books. So, forget everything you saw in the Tim Burton versions, this is not a prequel to those same stories, this is comepletly starting over and is the begining of many more sequels to come.

PLOT.

Dorothy finds herself in a strange place over the rainbow.

New stuff.

I didn't like the look of the new Batmobile at first, but after a while it grows on ya, and when ya can see what it does....well, i wonder if I have a stocking big enough for Santa to fit one into?

The Batsuit and gadgets are more beleivable this time around. Which was there intention. It all ends setting up for the sequel.

Batmans no academy award winning movie, but that matters not to me, cos i avoid those overrated garbage flicks anyway. This movie you can just sit on ya bat-couch, on ya bat butt, with some pop-guano and kick off ya bat-boots and enjoy watchign Batman.",1131494400,,1963,4.400552486187845
1571854,1,B00005JNJV,"My God the pain! Let's point out numerous flaws/stupid stuff in the movie:

1. Why are there present interludes when we are watching the past? Why won't Nolan just show the kid Bruce and then the adult Bruce? It's pointless the way he does it. Oh wait I know why; he's a bad film maker. Sad that people mistake this for ""good film making.""

2. The Scarecrow has about 2 seconds, and Ra's Ahl Ghul is so plain and boring. Yeah, this is a BATMAN movie, but come on, what is Batman without his criminals and bad guys? Some dork in a suit who whines and whines and whines...

3. And whines... and whines. Batman is a pansy in this movie. ""Oh, I fell down a well and some bats scared me. Mommy, help me! I might start wetting the bed again!"" Too much gibberish about ""fear"" too. It's like who cares?

4. No imagination. None. What's the scariest thing Nolan came up with with Scarecrow's gas? FIRE EYES! Bow down to FIRE EYES! Wet your pants in FEAR with FIRE EYES! Or worms... or a skull... I mean instead of putting something that actually scares people (a spider? a scary clown? snakes? etc. etc.) he puts FIRE EYES. All shake and tremble to FIRE EYES! Just watch as Batman glides and what scares the people? FIRE EYES. The movie is also ""realistic"" because Nolan can't but IMAGINATION and FANTASY into a FANTASY character. Ya know, making a FANTASY movie about BATMAN is out of the question!

5. The fight scenes... are edited so badly it's crazy! People say this is from the victim's POV... well why was the fight scenes like that when Bats fought Ra's or when Bruce fought the Chinese people in the beginning? Why is Nolan treating ME like a victim (actually, after watching this ""movie"" I feel like a victim)? The argument makes no sense. The reason Nolan shot them that way? He sucks.

6. How he got his gadgets... watching these sequences is about as entertaining as watching someone buying groceries at the grocery store - except here you here some idiot keep on making excuses and asking stupid questions like ""Does it come in black?"" But then again, this is genius film making! What is more genuis than watching people order stuff from their own company? Best Screenplay/Director/Picture award coming this way!

7. The collateral damage. So Batman who wants to be silent and a dark knight costs about a billion or 2 dollars in property damages, risks cops lives and bystanders. And for what? KATIE HOLMES (who is horrible). That's right. Obviously she is worth more than a dozen cops and property.

8. Closer to the comics? Nope. Not at all. People say ""Well, the Joker didn't kill Batman's parents!"" Well, Ra's Ahl Ghul did not train Bruce! John Crane is a teacher! Rachel Dawes does not exist in the comics! If anything, Burton's version is closer, even Bob Kane has admitted that's how he always invisioned Batman.

9. The music is uninspired, with too much synthesizer and drums. Nothing special. No memerable theme like Elfman's score. Fits the movie though; dull, uninteresting, uninspired and boring.

10. Doesn't need to be a Batman film. Replace this with Jerry Orbach and change a few characters names and BAM you have a totally different movie. Hell, you can even keep Ra's and Scarecrow and have a different movie; it's just too realistic. It's like a martial arts episode followed by Law and Order. It just isn't that great.

The good things about the film:

- It ends

- It can be used in a suicide note

- It makes me want to watch Keaton's Batman to feel better

- It gave me a warning to watch it again or its sequel",1131408000,22,3540,4.535321821036106
1571855,4,B00005JNJV,"After four tries it seems they finally came up with a Batman to remember.  Christian Bale not only cuts a fine figure but gives the role the gravity it deserves, providing the much needed raison d'etre for the Dark Knight.  Unfortunately, the plot was a bit far-fetched and not very well resolved.  Christopher Nolan put together an excellent supporting cast with Michael Caine giving Alfred a nice comic touch and Gary Oldman as a young Detective Gordon.  But, it is the extra touches which really make this movie, like Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, who helps Batman come up with the armor and gadgets he needs to take on the underworld of Gotham. I also thought Cillian Murphy did a great job as Dr. Jonathon Crane, the genesis for the Joker.  However, I wasn't particularly smitten by Katie Holmes and Mark Boone Junior turned Flass into a joke, whereas he was a much darker and more sinister character in Frank Miller's Batman: Year One.  It will be interesting to see where they take Batman from here.",1131408000,17,1006,4.6875
1571856,5,B00005JNJV,"Im a real fanatic superheoroes fan (count Spiderman,Daredevil,Superman...i watched them all) and im really proud to say i like Batman most. I mean,Bruce Wayne is rich,intelligent,charming and all stark-handsome.

I've watched all Bats-related movies,from Micheal Keaton's brush with Michelle Pfieffer's Catwoman to Jim Carrey's joker or Nicole Kidman the shrink with the hots for new Bruce Van Kilmer,and even to Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin...with George Clooney,Chris O'Donell (his name goes something like that) and Alicia Silverstone (Batgirl).

All the above films Batman (1989), Batman Returns(1992),Batman Forever(1995) and George Clooney's (1997) were nice,but a little too bleak. For a start,you might find the visuals effect,other than Tim Burton's,a little too fake. I must say director Christopher Nolan's was a total far cry (thank god).

I'm so much a big Christian Bale fan. I mean,this guy is all so cool. He cries,fights,trains and battles with his emotions all so well,he is no doubt the best Batty ever. No one can ever replaced him. You can't ignore this fact. This is perhaps the darkest Batty film ever,as Nolan chose to explore darker themes which include's the deaths of Bruce's parents,his turbulent childhood/young adult years as well as grappling with a double identity as Bruce Wayne by day and Batman by night.

Here,Bale shows he is indeed such a good actor of great calibre,he puts the rest of the cast,be it his loyal butler Alfred,love interest Rachel (a very redundant Katie Holmes) or Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). His painful moments and past,you're sure to feel the agony too as Bale,an ever brilliant actor,plays it right on the cards.

It's so good-with the right cast (minus ineffectual Holmes),right script and director,dark moments and a wonderful male lead,i give this film two thumbs up. In fact,i'm looking forward to the upcoming sequel too!!!",1131408000,2,1893,5.3389261744966445
1571857,5,B00005JNJV,"""When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural."" Ra's Al Ghul, Batman begins.

And so it was with the Batman franchise as well. Having reached ground zero with 'Batman & Robin' (Which I consider to be the worst big budget film of all time), Warner Brothers put Batman back in his cave until the time was right. What a difference a decade makes.

Like X-Men & Spider-Man, Batman begins takes the 'Comic' out of 'comic book movie'. 'Begins' is a serious, but not somber, take on the Batman legend. Instead of hiring trippy ""Visionaries"" like Tim Burton or Joel ""Woodstock flash-back"" Schumacher, WB went with a filmmaker who had the ability to tell a story, Chris Nolan. Teamed with an expert in the genre, co-writer David Goyer, Nolan avoids the pitfalls of Ang Lee's disastrous 'Hulk' and delivers not only the year's best film, but the best 'Super hero' film of all time.

The movie is available as either a bare bones DVD, sans any extras, or a ""Deluxe"" two disc version that includes a disc full of twelve minute documentaries on the making of 'Begins' as well as a mini comic book. The deluxe version runs five to ten dollars more, and is only recommended for hard core fans. The movie, however, is recommended for everyone.",1131321600,7,1253,4.635135135135135

1571949,5,B00005JNJV,"People tend to think of comics--and films based off of them-- as things just for kids. Something with bright costumes, lots of violence and explosions. This film proves that comics are no different than any other novel, videogame, or film. You have the good ones (Batman Begins, Batman, and Batman Returns) and the bad ones (Batman Beyond and Batman and Robin).
 Batman Begins is one of the best films I have seen that has been based off a comicbook series. The film has a strong storyline, great script, and a very talented cast. You can tell by the quality and detail of the movie that the people involved really cared about this character. I'm glad to have seen a film that brings justice to Batman and his story.
 As for portraying Gotham's Dark Knight Bale has brought the character back to life on the screens just as Keaton had for Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns.",1131235200,,878,4.621794871794871
1571950,4,B00005JNJV,"Director/co-writer Christopher Nolan has done two movies I admire very much:  MEMENTO and INSOMNIA.  With BATMAN BEGINS he works with co-writer David S. Goyer to explore Batman's roots.  Goyer apparently did a first draft, then passed it on to Nolan for polishing because Goyer knew more about comic books.  The movie is based largely on three DC comic stories: ""The Bat-Man,"" ""The Man Who Falls"", and ""The Long Halloween.""  These comic stories are actually included in the deluxe dual DVD as a nice bonus.

BATMAN BEGINS is so long and complex that I needed two viewings to like it.  A first viewing left me confused and sorry I bought the DVD.  Not helping matters is a bonus disk that has featurettes as Easter Eggs hidden inside comic strip panels.  They are interesting and made the film coherent for me, but were hard to find.  I went back to the movie a second time the next night and loved it.  The first hour or so has Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) on a seven year quest in the Himalayas for inner peace after witnessing the murder of his parents when he is ten years old.  He also falls down a well full of bats when he is a child, and childhood friend Rachel has to rescue him.  These are all flashbacks, with a strong and interesting good-bad performance by Liam Neeson as a martial arts expert.  Location filming for the Himalayas was done in Iceland, which has a rugged top of the world feel.

The cast here is huge.  Bale is a perfect Bruce Wayne/Batman, full of both anger and disillusionment.  The actor apparently did a lot of his own stunts.  Rachel will grow up to be lovely Katie Holmes (DAWSON'S CREEK) and work in the D.A.'s office.  Gary Oldman is unrecognizable and magnificent as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Caine is butler Alfred.  Alfred is also the unofficial caretaker of Wayne Manor, along with Morgan Freeman as Lucius.  Lucius invented the batsuit and batmobile, and controls Wayne Manor.  But it gets a bit confused because Rutger Hauer is chief financial officer of the estate until Bruce Wayne fires him at the end.  And Tom Wilkinson (IN THE BEDROOM) is a formidable Mafia don.  The second half of a 140 minute movie has Batman fighting for truth and justice in a violent world; the movie is rated PG-13.

BATMAN BEGINS is a technical masterpiece, with constant night for night aerial cityscapes with lights everywhere, a very busy and noisy soundtrack, and a lot of rain.  Nathan Crowley was the brilliant production designer and apparently designed set models in the same house where Nolan and Goyer were collaborating on the script, which must have been very convenient.  The cinematographer for a Panavision movie is Wally Pfister, whom I have never heard of.  A bonus feature shows how Gotham City was built almost to scale inside a huge and abandoned London factory eight blocks long.  Some of its action set pieces, including batmobile-car-monorail chases, are just stunning.  And the dialogue is wonderful for them:  ""He's not ON a street, he's driving on ROOFTOPS!"" ""Well, at least tell me what he LOOKS like.""  The editing, by Lee Smith, is sensational as Batman flies or drives all over the brightly lit night city and says poignant lines like ""I don't have the luxury of friends.""

This new BATMAN movie may be the best yet in terms of taking everything seriously, treating it as realistically as possible with the material, and being intelligent.  There are no over-the-top villains here, no Nicholson as the Joker or DeVito as the Penguin.  Again, it is a movie I hated on one viewing, did not understand at all and found long and boring.  But it came alive for me on a second viewing with help from the bonus second disk, which I was also ready to give up on.  But be patient, my friends, and you will be rewarded.

BATMAN BEGINS is an excellent comic book adventure for adults, and I look forward to reading the 75 page comic book included with the double DVD set. I guess whether you want to actually buy this movie depends on how badly you want this included comic book; the alternative is to just rent it and watch it twice.  But I believe there is also a single disk edition with no bonuses.  Whichever you choose, be sure to get it in widescreen format to see all of Gotham City.",1131235200,,4241,4.640268456375839

Goyer (Blade) reinvent Batman and make the movie more about him than what was shown in Burton's films. Their are villians, they just don't steal screen time from the hero. Michael Caine is great as Alfred he brings a warmth to the role. Gary Oldman is phenominal as Jim Gordon, I was happy at the way he played the character.

1571952,5,B00005JNJV,"The marriage of comic books and the movies has had a stormy relationship.  From the serials of the early 40's through the campiness of the 60's ""Batman"" to the big-budget opuses of the past quarter century, the comic hero as movie attraction has been topsy-turvy.  Successes have included the first two ""Superman"" films, the first two Tim Burton-directed ""Batman"" films, the X-Men movies, and the Spiderman films, while the duds have included ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" ""The Hulk,"" ""Spawn,"" ""Hellboy,"" as well as last summer's ""Fantastic Four"".

""Batman Begins"" belongs to the success category.  Revamping the Batman mythos somewhat, director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan has a genuine respect for the character and does a superb job of crafting a tale that makes Bruce Wayne an even more tragic individual whose obsession with fighting crime is only equaled by his drive to prove himself as a man worthy of his family's name and reputation.

Christian Bale, late of so many critically acclaimed (yet not mega-hits) films, is deserving of a wider audience and the popularity of this film has gotten him noticed by filmgoers that may not have seen his other films.  He assays his role wonderfully and can only be better in the subsequent sequel.

The film can't lose with a supporting cast as brilliant and talented as Oscar nominees/winners Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson.  Chameleon actor Gary Oldman gets to be a ""hero"" as he portrays a young ""Jim Gordon,"" the character that would later become Batman's ally in the police department.  Perennial villain Rutger Hauer is also on hand as CEO of Wayne Enterprises and his limited screen time is well spent.

Cillian Murphy's ""Scarecrow"" is so frightening that it would be great to see him as the chief adversary in any future Bat-film.

The great dialogue in the script allows each character to deliver at least one ZINGER line, something that was sorely missed in the first X-Men film.

The ""look"" of the film, though reminiscent of the Burton films, has enough of an individuality that makes it refreshingly new.

And the new Batmobile??? At first, I thought it hideous, but when I saw it in action, I found it to be the perfect tool for ""The Dark Knight"".

All the extras on the bonus DVD, as well as the comic book contained within, are worthy of multiple visits.

If the makers of the new Superman film do half the job that Nolan, Bale, and company did on this one, they should have a winner of their hands.",1131148800,5,2493,4.874407582938389
1571953,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is a superb movie on so many levels.  It is a realistic action movie, one with a compelling and realistic storyline, that incorporates the comic book movie into a full fledged movie for everyone, leaving out the cheesy unrealistic characters.  The acting as well was very believable, with the characters not being overdone or getting into emotions and interactions that are out of place.  That Rachel couldn't be with Bruce is real, whereas other movies would have them be with each other.  That Bruce is looked down upon or does wondrous deeds for people and they don't even know it (""drunken billionaire burns his house down""), only draws you into his character and makes you feel for him.

Then, to top all of this off, it has a darker edge that is all too often left out for fear it would drive people away.  Not so in this movie as it enhanced the theatrical effects much more, making the movie that much more enthralling.

I can't say enough about this my favorite movie of the year.  A must see for everyone, even if you aren't typically entertained by comic book movies.

1572086,5,B00005JNJV,"Having no idea what to expect from ""Batman Begins"", it was with some skepticism that I saw this film. If any other prequels were anything to go on, the expectation was not too high. ""Batman Begins"" removed all doubts and proved to be an excellent movie.

The plot basically delves in detail into the formative life of Bruce Wayne and his development of the alter-ego that would be Batman. The movie covers this is a fair amount of detail, giving you insight as to how he met important people such as Gordon, and where he got his fighting abilities, his gadgets and even symbolic animal. As an underlying thread, Wayne's principles are also developed throughout the movie.

Unlike one or two other superhero movies, ""Batman Begins"" keeps a fair amount of the action and pace present while it deals with the troubling issues that a budding crime-fighter of this kind faces. There is a fair balance between self-reflection and visual action that has been absent in other movies of this kind.

Another aspect of the movie that is lacking in the earlier Batman movies is the brooding seriousness of it. Rather than an almost over-the-top, comic book feel, the movie presents a darkly serious characterisation. Even the villains share in this forboding seriousness, and lack some of the light exuberance of Jack Nicholson's Joker, or Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face. While neither good or bad, this does mark ""Batman Begins"" as different in an important way. For me, this was an excellent difference.

All in all, I enjoyed this movie much more than the earlier movies from the Batman franchise. It looks very different from the other movies, for obvious reasons, and I feel that it adds a deeper element to the Batman saga on film. This is a great film, and really has a lot going for it.",1131062400,3,1777,4.741100323624596

1572088,4,B00005JNJV,"I've submitted this review twice - I deleted the first one - and each time, within hours, it gets a slew of ""not helpful"" votes.  Why?  I gave it 4 stars fer Pete's sake!  And I pointed out a genuine problem with the formatting that I think might be of value to potential buyers. But NOOOO ... any review that doesn't say ""Oooh, what a great movie!"" gets voted ""not helpful"" by its fans.  This certainly undermines my faith in Amazon's ratings, as apparently only THE MOST FAVORABLE reviews get high marks.  Readers beware!

Anyhow, ""Batman Begins"" certainly contains some spectacular moments (e.g. the ""Tibet"" sequence, actually filmed in Iceland) and the plot contains enough twists to keep you guessing -- but Christian Bale never really brings The Batman to life, and the Grand Finale is all too predictable. Except for the surprise identity of the Evil Mastermind, there's little to distinguish the last half-hour of the movie; it's the same old chase/fight mix we've come to expect in movies of this genre.

Also, although the DVD I rented is described as ""Widescreen,"" on my wide-aspect TV the image shows up with bars on the top and bottom, as well as on both sides. Instead of filling the whole screen, it floats in the center, a shrunken version of what it should be. I was able to enlarge it by going to ""panorama"" mode, but this creates distortion at the edges.

1572089,4,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" is the best of the franchise, beating Tim Burton's first film, which was better than his sequel; both were certainly better than the last two directed by Joel Schumacher. All were bound by comic book fantasy, full of superheroes battling bogeymen. Writer-director Christopher Nolan chucks that formula and gives us a real man in a real city up against his own insecurities and, to be sure, real villains. The script returns to the beginning, when Bruce Wayne was a boy, and the missing seven years before the young man dons cape and cowl.

Burton showcased Jack Nicholson's sideshow mugging; the other films also focused on outlandish bad guys and gals, almost sidelining The Caped Crusader. Here the villains are life-size; it is Batman who looms large. It is he in whom we invest our understanding and emotion. Nolan and his production staff owe a debt to Ridley Scott's futuristic Los Angeles (""Blade Runner."") But the success of his movie rests on the shoulders of its star, Christian Bale, who now owns the role if he wants it.

Bale gets boffo support from Linus Roache as the do-gooder father; Liam Neeson as his Ninja trainer and mentor; Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman, who run his father's financial empire; Michael Caine as his butler and conscience; Tom Wilkinson as the city's crime boss; Cilian Murphy as a creepy asylum keeper; and Gary Oldman as a cop, his first good guy role. Even Katie Holmes is passable as an assistant DA, a damsel able to handle any distress. But the resourceful Bale, physically and emotionally, is the whole show.

Well, maybe not the whole show. The locations, the plethora of bats, and detailed sets are a marvel, especially the batcave. CG imagining is used sparingly, so real environments interface impressively with the actors. The fight sequences could have been edited better and the menus on this two-disc DVD are a challenge. Although there is no commentary tract, there are enough extras to satisfy any Batman fan. Thanks to ""Batman Begins,"" there may be a lot more of them than before.",1131062400,4,2053,4.876790830945558
1572090,3,B00005JNJV,"After watching Batman Begins on DVD, I really wish I had seen it in the theatre, on the big screen! To be honest, I was a little wary upon hearing that ANOTHER Batman movie was going to be made, but this film does the legend justice.

Unfortunately, the movie starts rather haltingly, with the viewer seeing images of a young Bruce Wayne trapped in a cave, terrified of the bats that live there, juxtaposed with scenes of an older Wayne (played by Christian Bale) in a foreign prison. Viewers then witness more scenes from Wayne's childhood, interspersed with his odd (and slightly insane) journey to martial arts mastery. However, once Wayne leaves the ""League of Shadows"" (corny, but that's the name), the story begins to pick up. Fortified by his newly-minted combat skills, he returns to Gotham, where he vows to clean up the city's crime problem.

Of course, adventure ensues! Viewers are treated to ""the making of Batman,"" including the wit and heart of such characters as devoted butler Alfred Pennyworth (played perfectly by Michael Cain) and cunning scientist Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman). I cannot say enough about the impact of both Cain and Freeman on this film. They both offer an experience and a mastery of their craft that is a pleasure to watch. Cain gives the film some of its most emotional moments, but he is never too maudlin or sentimental. Freeman, though not the father figure that Cain is, is a cunning friend to the young billionaire, and he provides lots of chuckles and smiles by the virtue of his excellent line delivery and facial expressions. I thoroughly enjoyed both of their performances. (Gary Oldman, as Lt. Gordon, isn't shabby, either. He makes a great cop and a great ""good guy."") Bale was good in the film, but it is difficult for me to see him as an actor, cloaked as he is in the whole Batman mystique. (So much of it is the cape and the ears, right?) Katie Holmes played Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes, now a young lawyer with Gotham's D.A. office. Though her role wasn't large, I thought she turned in a solid performance.

This was a fun action film, and I didn't think it was too violent for young families. However, if you are planning on buying the DVD in order to get extras such as deleted scenes, interviews with the actors or technicians, or other goodies, think twice!! Our DVD contained nothing except the movie and its trailer. We found this VERY DISAPPOINTING. Shame on you, Warner!!",1130976000,2,2455,4.717948717948718
1572091,4,B00005JNJV,"The origins of Batman are explored in this fine fifth installment of the Batman series.  Young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) tumbles down an abandoned well on his family's property.  While in the well, he is set upon by a group of angry bats. After some time, Bruce is finally rescued by his father, but he now has a terrible fear of bats.  Later, Bruce witnesses the horrible murder of his mother and father. Years later and still shaken from the death of his parents, Bruce ventures abroad to learn the means to fight injustice and turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.

Bruce meets Henri Ducard (Lian Neeson)a member of a secret society known as the League of Shadows.  Henri trains Bruce in fighting injustice , but some of their methods seem very extreme. These methods will show up later in the film.

Bruce returns to Gotham city to find it a cesspool for crime bosses and wrong-doers.  Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has managed to buy off most of the cops and judges in Gotham so his mob basically controls the town.  One of Falcone's thugs is doctor Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy).  Known as the ""scarecrow"", he has developed a gas that can poison people as well as Gotham's water supply.  Inhalig the gas can cause people to go insane. Crane is getting ready to unleash this gas on the citizens of Gotham.

Bruce decides that he must do something to help the people of Gotham.  He enlists the help of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a techie who works at Wayne Enterprises.  He developed all kinds of cool gear, such as a kevlar suit and a high-performance ATV.  With Lucius' help, Bruce uses these items to give birth to Batman.  Even with all of this high-tech gear, will Batman be able to stop Carmine Falcone and the scarecrow before they destroy Gotham?

I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  The special effects are very good, and I enjoyed seeing how Bruce became Batman.  The acting, especially by Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman, is superb.  I recommend this movie very highly.  Watch and see how a troubled child matures into a great crime-fighting superhero.",1130976000,,2086,4.663013698630137
1572092,2,B00005JNJV,"Okay, I'm obviously in the minority, but here goes...

Christopher Nolan's Memento is one of my favorite movies. I would go so far as to rank it alongside The Godfather and Vertigo. I think it's that good. It is clever, original, and well written.

Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is none of the above. True, it promises a character study of what drives a man to dress up like a bat and fight crime, and it does do a decent job of delivering on that promise. That aspect of the movie was interesting and reasonably wall done. But it's also just window dressing. Batman Begins is really just another dumb, big-budget action movie, an empty spectacle we've seen twenty times before.

The writing was particularly disappointing after the brilliance of Memento. Once Batman takes on the massive criminal plot threatening Gotham nothing really makes much sense. The characters never have conversations -- they reel off what someone must think are witty one liners, or they make deep statements about becoming one with your fear and what you are on the surface defines you. Or something like that. It all ends with that big action movie cliche -- everything's okay because the bad guy dies a just death -- while ignoring the fact that there are hallucinating, homicidal zombies roaming the streets of Gotham. In my book that's a loose end.

But I go on. My point is that Nolan has gone from making a truly original film to dressing up tired action movie cliches. I have to assume that the pressures of making a franchise movie drove things in this direction (although Spider-man II shows how good a big-budget superhero movie can be). Batman Begins was just a huge disappointment to me. I would have expected this had Jerry Bruckheimer's name been on it (or Joel Schumacher's), but I expected so much more from Nolan.",1130976000,9,1813,4.764331210191083
1572093,1,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" is a great example of what happens when good guys (Chris Nolan, Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman) go bad. And I don't mean dudding themselves up in a batcape and fighting crime: I mean turning out a superhyped, yawn-inducing stinker like ""Batman Begins"".

So with that: 10 Reasons why the once-talented Chris Nolan's hopelessly tedious, depression/sleep-inducing greenish-tinted floater stinks up the joint:

1)It's dull. Achingly so. It goes on and on, and just when you think it's about to exhaust itself and die---it goes on and on.

2) It's dull, did I mention that? How can you make a story about a psychopath vigilante who duds himself up in a flouncy cape and tights dull? I dunno, but Nolan did it.

3) It's Dark. *Really* Dark.

By that I mean it's underlit: it's hard to see anything, because Nolan doesn't know how to light his sequences.

4) The action sequences bite, hard. Why? Because the camera is shoved up against the Batman's left nostril: every fight sequence is close-cut, cropped, psycho-edited, and so tightly shot that you can't see who's BAMFING and BAPPING and THWAPPING who. So maybe it's best that it's so dark it's impossible to see what's happening because---well, nothing really is.

5) The ""Batmobile"" (basically a huge, hideous, mutant farm tractor spray-painted black) drives around on the rooftops of Gotham. Yes, really.

When I think Dark, Brooding, Vigilante Justice, I think the original, sleek, armored-up Batmobile of the Burton masterpiece. I do *not* think John Deere lower-40 special, tooling around amongst the chimney-pots of Gotham City.

6)Batman (Christian Bale, who tries, dammit, he really tries) is played as psychotic yuppie (a la American Psycho), or a fluty voiced drag-queen. C'mon, listen to the Voice: tell me, if you were a Gotham criminal, you wouldn't die giggling.

6)Batman doesn't loom, or hulk, or menace: he squats.

Not crouches, squats.

This is meant to suggest coiled rage: it suggests, instead, a man in the final, lethal stages of terminal, chronic constipation.

7)Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) is in this movie, playing Qui-Gon Jin channeling Oprah by way of Dr. Phil. Oh, and Ra's Al-Ghul, evidently, is Arabic for ""I wear cheesy facial hair"".

8) The chief villain, Potato Sack, wears a potato-sack over his head. No, honestly, a potato-sack. This is meant to just TERRIFY you, man, scare you senseless.

Why does he wear a potato sack over his head? My theory: so he doesn't have to watch ""Batman Begins"" like you, chump. Oh, and he sprays his victims with some kind of hallucinogenic spray. I actually *envied* the Scarecrow's victims: at least they experienced an emotion other than sleep, apathy, boredom, or raw contempt, all of which this movie induces in spades.

9) Katie Holmes and her hideously scary hands. Some advice, Katie: next time spend a little of the money you're blowing in the Scientology bunker having your engrams removed---on acting lessons.

10) ""Batman Begins"" actually makes Gary Oldman (the once-and-future Commissioner Gordon) look like a silly, incompetent, middle-aged dufus---oddly enough, the target demographic for this silly, incomptent, middle-aged movie. How is it possible to squander the talent of the incomparable Gary Oldman? How is it possible to make a Batman movie into an incomprehensible, incoherent, mind-numbing snorefest that features a John Deere tractor tooling about on somebody's rooftop? I dunno, but Nolan does it.

Things I'd rather do than see ""Batman Begins"" ever again:

1) Drive red-hot pokers into my eyes.

2) Stab myself in the face with a rusty knife.

3) Sever my right leg and surgically re-attach it to my a**.

4) Take a bath in a tub full of acid.

5) Read the Encyclopedia Britannica cover-to-cover in a single sitting, in Braille.

6) Watch ""Gigli"" again.

Let the order go forth: all copies of the negative to ""Batman Begins"" should be burned, and the ashes sealed in an airtight container and shot into the Sun. Well, except one copy: round up all fans of this rancid, stinking turd, surgically remove their eyelids, and force them to watch this abomination over and over---forever.

P.S.: If you enjoyed ""Batman Begins"", check out ""Catwoman"" and ""Doom"". You'll dig 'em.

2) A number of top notch actors give good performances.

3) The movie stays on track in doesn't get side tracked by focusing too much on a particular villian, as some of the previous Batman movies did.

1572167,2,B00005JNJV,"Someone actually told me that BATMAN BEGINS was a decent action hero flick.  I was leery, to be sure, as I had sat through all those horrific, mind-numbing ""Batman"" features of a decade ago, yet I was advised to relax; this movie, I was told, was a ""thinking man's"" action hero yarn--a deep, broad, introspective spectacle of existential proportions.  And so I took up my pipe and popped this puppy into the DVD player, thoroughly prepared to discover the dark origins of a comic book legend.  Well, to be sure, there were bats, and there was brooding, and there was a sinister, bleak city, and there was some fighting, and some explosions--even a vehicle that reminded me of a high-torque fertilizer spreader--but there wasn't much of anything else.  In fact, BATMAN BEGINS turned out to be as shallow as dried bread crust, and just as palatable; this movie grated on my nerves like a marathon session of traffic court.  Where do I pay the fine so I can get out of here?

Via much fanfare, this movie was heralded as a departure from its batty predecessors.  Writer David Goyer and director Christopher Nolan collaborated on the screenplay--an allegedly brilliant manuscript destined to redefine the action hero genre.  In all fairness, the writers did attempt to present a story meshing the incompatible elements of realism and super action.  They also attempted to present a brooding, troubled Bruce Wayne as he grapples with his inner weaknesses and finds his crime-battling persona.  But a wet dog is a wet dog; the makers of this film can apply as many layers of reason they wish, yet this dud still comes across as a monotonous, tedious, unoriginal, been-there-done-that comic book caper.  What's worse, the fighting scenes are so constipated they looked like they were choreographed in a phone booth--and sounded like pillow fights.  And Batman (played by a wild-eyed Christian Bale), once he puts on his pointy-eared cowl, allows his speech to become so raspy and throaty I swore he swallowed a furrball.

Finally, let's go over a roll call of utterly wasted cinematic talent.  Liam Neeson.  Michael Caine.  Gary Oldman.  Ken Watanabe.  Morgan Freeman.  Rutger Hauer.  There's some serious talent there, all of it zapped into superficial inconsequence via very one-dimensional, forgettable roles.  And Katie Holmes, were you in this movie?  Could've fooled me.

Alas, if BATMAN BEGINS is the new face of the action hero genre, I'll pass.  Two stars for the special features deluxe edition, as the information presented on the second disc is much more entertaining than the film itself.  Never a good sign when the special features trump the movie, but that's the case here, as it turns out to be a lot more fun talking about Batman than actually watching him.

Director Nolan completely nailed the feel of the story and the character of Batman, returning him to his original noble vigilante persona rather than the vaudeville act the original TV show and directors Burton and Schumacher mutated him into.

Batman Begins is fantastic from beginning to end.  I agree with other critics that the fight scenes could have been a little less muddy, but that is my only complaint.

1572170,4,B00005JNJV,"I have been a fan of Batman for years. I really enjoyed the Dark Knight resurrection of the 80s, which has been the focus of the entire Batman franchise. On the whole, I have enjoyed most of the films.

This Batman is dark, but without the Tim Burton touch of hyper reality (or unreality, if you would prefer that term). He is also cool and calculating, taking time to study the criminal element, even to the point of getting arrested to learn more. Very driven to change the world in his quest for catharcism for his parent's death.

Early on in the film, Bruce Wayne is given the opportunity to hone his skills fighting evil by the mysterious Henri Ducard. Henri tells him he can find what he is searching for if he will just come and learn to fight evil under the tutelidge of a grand master.

As you have seen in the previews, he does this. In the process, he learns a lot about his own fears and learns the limits of his own anger over his past.

In a pivotal moment, Bruce returns to Gotham City and through exploration of his own psyche becomes the Batman.

What is good about the film:

* Very good back story that adds a lot of depth to Bruce Wayne's character

* Nice effects kept realistic. While there are some fantasy eleemnts, the story is kept in the realm of believable.

* Realistic presentation of a human superhero.

* Fight choreography. This Batman uses distraction rather than simply relying on gimmickry.

* Villians have depth. Nothing one dimensional like Mr. Freeze.

What is not so good

* There are a couple of moments where the veil is lifted due to bad acting, primarily when Christian Bale attempts to be ""too Batman"" (low, raspy voice) - the plane scene comes to mind

* Katie Holmes -something about her character just annoys me; almost too pure for the film. I guess every film needs a goody two-shoes, but I found Jim Gordon far more realistic.

No big deal stars!  (Unless you're a huge Michael Caine or Rutger Hauer or Liam Neeson freak!) No over-exposed criminal masterminds!  Director Cristopher Nolan strips down The Bat it his primal form and lets it rip.  Get it straight....I'm not saying that the first four Batman efforts were a total waste...Nicholson, Burton, Keaton...etc.  (Except for the 4th which was utter and complete crap!) I'm just pointing out that Batman Begins is honest.  It doesn't hide behind stars and stage-dressing.  It relies on...acting.  There's a change for Hollywood.  This movie rox on levels that most movies never even reach.  Great ensemble cast of characters (including Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman)a plot that actually develops into something from something...sure it's been rehashed a little.  (Some of us are asking ""Didn't Jack Napier a.k.a. The Joker kill Bruce Wayne's parents?""  Are we supposed to discount all the films from before?)  Well, I guess so.  Now, if Nolan continues the story where he leaves off (Good luck to him) then the next installment should include The Joker.  Does Nolan have the balls to go after Nicholson's performance?  Who knows.  All I do know is that as long as WB keeps The Bat pure and simple then it will continue to flourish and attract new fans.  If it gets corrupted like it did before and turned into a media-holocaust...oh well at least there's The X-Men and Superman and so many more classic characters to explore.

1572172,5,B00005JNJV,"YES! Now I can came closer to anyone with a Batman movie and say ""THIS is Batman"". I know that because of the lack of interest of some people for comic books and the lack of interest of the previous directors to make a decent Batman movie, many people got the wrong impression about the big bat man all these years. But believe me, like it, or not, THIS is the REAL Batman!!

Dark, misterious, cursed with his fathers' death, a man without fear of make justice at any cost. A man that trained his phisic, mind, a great criminologist, detective, scientist, fighter, THIS was the Batman that we waited to see all these years on the big screen.

That's very interesting something that Goyer did, in get elements from the firts Batman comics in the late 60's and 70's (Bob Kane, Bill Finger, Denny O'Neal, Neal Adams), like the Wayne family getting off of a Opera House, and the new writers, like Frank Miller (Batman Year One, Dark Knight). The movie is trully inspired on the story in the comic Batman Year One, but most of the time centered on Bruce Wayne/Batman. The vehicle was inspired on the famous minisserie Dark Knight, published in the beginning of the 80's.

There's no doubt about it! Christian Bale IS Bruce Wayne/Batman! He was conscientious that he had to play three roles in the movie. The Batman, the playboy Bruce Wayne and the real Bruce Wayne. His voice tone demonstrate what role he was playing at the moment. TERRIFIC!! He got the right spirit and idea behind the complex mind of his character and did an amazing job! He became to be what Christopher Reeve was for Superman! And I would be very unjust to not mention others like Michael Caine (Alfred), Gary Oldman (James Gordon), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) that did great jobs as well.

Definitely, this is the REAL and only one adaptation from Batman to the movies. Forget about all the CRAP of the old ones. Batman Begins HERE!!

1572283,5,B00005JNJV,"Rarely does a movie live up to its hype.  This is one of the exceptions.

If you didn't catch this movie in theatres buy it now.  It's not only as good as you've heard, it's actually even better.  For the first time, a Batman film has succeeded completely in capturing all of the elements of the fabled comic book character while also producing a Batman that seems fully grounded in reality.

Let's face it, though the Tim Burton Batman movies have a large and devoted following, those movies are ultimately less about the Dark Knight and more about Burton's ongoing fascination with offbeat characters and the bizarre.  Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"" was an enjoyable if overly campy romp but by ""Batman & Robin"" this series had collapsed under the weight of too many villains, sidekicks, and corny dialogue.  It's telling that on the recent DVD special edition of that film even Schumacher admits that movie stunk and issues a public apology for running this series into the ground.

This meant that ""Batman Begins"" director Chris Nolan had a hell of a task on his hands when he took the reins of this film:  Deliver a Batman film for the 21st Century and restore credibility to the character.

The idea of going back to the character's origins was a master stroke and serves the story well.  Here we get the most detailed on-screen documentation of Batman's beginnings ever shown and damned if it all doesn't come off as more than a little epic.  Much credit must also go to Christian Bale in the title role.

It helps that Bale is the first Batman who is diesel enough to play the role without the benefit of a muscled, rubberized suit.  Seriously, you could probably crack walnuts on this guy's abs.

It helps that he also looks good in a tuxedo.  The whole appeal of Batman was always that as Bruce Wayne by day, he was the biggest playboy this side of James Bond.  But by night he was an obsessive revenge freak bent on striking at criminals from the shadows.  Bale's got the acting chops and the look to nail this in a minute.

The movie also benefits from a strong supporting cast.  While much of the pre-release publicity on this point went to the future Mrs. Tom Cruise, Katy Holmes, the real standout performances come from Michael Caine as Alfred, Wayne's stalwart Butler, Gary Oldman as the Gordon, one of Gotham's last honest cops and the city's future police commissioner, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, an inventor who helps equip Wayne for his war on crime.

One thing that is a holdout from the earlier Batman films is that the movie features two villains, in this case criminal mastermind Ras Al Ghul and Scarecrow.  But where this detracted from Batman in the earlier films, it works here because Nolan keeps the story centered where it ought to be, on the Dark Knight.

Granted these aren't exactly A-list Batman baddies but ""28 Days Later""'s Cillian Murphy imbues Scarecrow with just enough serpentine evil to make him a major player.

Hardcore Batfans will of course know that Ras Al Ghul, though not a household name, is depicted in the comics as the Caped Crusader's most dangerous adversary.  As the head of centuries-old criminal empire with ties to all levels of government and organized crime, he's the Batman universe equivalent of Keyser Sose.  The movie gets this exactly right and you're likely to be thrown by a nifty twist involving this character.

If there's one complaint about this movie it's that it's perhaps too long.  But this is perhaps expected given that movie not only introduces Bruce Wayne/Batman, his entire supporting cast, two villains, and lays out a plot to destroy Gotham by driving its citizens mad.

Still this movie is a treat and stands along with Sam Raimi's Spiderman films as the new benchmark by which all superhero films will be measured.

So now that DC is shown that they can get Batman right on film and is getting ready roll out a new Superman next year, how about they drop the Caped Crusader and Man of Steel fixations and greenlight movies based on some of their other cool characters.

A Flash movie would be awesome if done right and, speaking of ""greenlighting"" where's that long-discussed Green Lantern flick.

Come on DC! Marvel seems to be prepping movies for just about every single one of its characters, including the C and D list ones. Get on the ball!

Plenty of them, but you don't really see anything being done. Worst choreographed fight scenes--if this is a new Oscar category, this movie should win it.  Background of Batman looks like a ripoff of the origin of Dr. Strange mixed with Magnus Robot Fighter (Remember that one?)  Some interesting stuff with the effeminate looking badguy shrink with his ""bag"" of tricks, but Batman himself looks like he'd fit in better as ""Fire Island Man.""

1572285,3,B00005JNJV,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge Christian Bale fan! I love the guy and I think he was a good choice to play Batman. This film is directed by Chris Nolan, the guy who did ""Momento"" and ""Following"". Two great movies that I highly recommend. Sadly this movie isn't anywhere near the level of those two as far as direction goes. It has a good cast; Micheal Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldmen as ""seargent"" Gordon, I don't know the actors name that played the Scarecrow but he is very good! And of course Christian Bale. The actor I could have done without was Katie Holmes, (not a big fan).

 I thought the movie did a good job of showing how Bruce Wayne became able to do what he can do as Batman. It made sense and it was believable if you have an open mind. The movie I think, took itself too seriously though, which made it come off kind of corny but not in a good way. The movie was also VERY predictable!

 With all that said I would recommend renting this movie. I wouldn't buy it until after you've seen it. It is entertaining!

 As far as Christian Bale as the new Batman, I think he is very good. MAYBE even better than Keaton, MAYBE!

 The original Batman is still the best and probably always will be but this was a nice attempt to restart the series, if that's indeed what they're gonna do. The ending lets on to him going after the ""Joker"", so I don't know if they're gonna make a second movie with Christian Bale or if this was a pre-quel to the original. I hope they do make another one with Christian. I think it would be better than this one.",1130716800,,1552,4.167224080267559
1572286,5,B00005JNJV,"I have always been a big batman fan since I was a kid. As a teenager, I was thrilled to see that finally somebody (Tim Burton) decided to make a big movie about him. I liked the movie really much, but still... I was left with the feeling that there was something missing. When the second production came out...wow!!! I was impressed!!! It finally got it!! Still, there was a lot of Burtonesque cartoonish flavor about it but it was the best of the first 4 movies (of course, before this one). Then, Schuhmacher came to the director chair and it all went down from that point... very dissappointing. I sadly came to the conclusion that my best childhood superhero was dead.

I was very happy to see that superhero movies could have some substance and depth to them when the Spidey series came out (Two thumbs up still for Spidey 2, which for me, was the best superhero adaptation from Hollywood, until this one came out). Xmen 2 was incredibly awesome too. But this one really blows them all away!!!

First of all, the great story behind Bruce Wayne and all of his motivations which led him to become his alter ego. Then, the actors: Christian Bale was born to be Batman!!! I have to admit that I hadn't seen him acting before, I came to know him as an actor with this movie. He's a really good actor with a very promising career and a promising franchise; at this point, I can't think of anyone else who could put up with the Bruce Wayne/Batman role better than him. Not to mention the more known actors such as Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman (love his roles as the ""badguy"", and was stunningly surprised to see him as Comm. Gordon, but did a very good job with it). I even think that Katie Holmes did a nice job. Although her acting is not extraordinary here, but I think it was decent and did not affect the movie in its storytelling or quality, as opposite as other reviewers think.

Now, regarding the Deluxe Double DVD edition... its features are awesome. I was a little afraid at first when I read a lot of complaint from some reviewers about the second disc menu, but I found it to be fun. Of course, if you did not have the patience to go all the way through the story, you did not find that at the very end of it, there is a little ""document"" icon. If you click on it, you finally see the whole menu in a ""regular"" or ""decent"" layout, as other reviewers may put it asking for something more ""standard"". It has all the featurettes included in the interactive comic book and even a couple of them, which I was not able to find in my first interactive ""trip"" through it. So, to all of the reviewers that state that it was a ""challenge"" for your DVD players and got frustrated about it, thinking that it was the only way of getting into the different features, never mind the comic book, go all the way to the end with the cursor arrows, click on the ""document"" arrow at the end of it, and there you go... good old standard menu for all of you. Hope this tip helps.

1572287,1,B00005JNJV,"..is the most interesting thing about this film.  it (the film, not the goatee) is long, boring, unoriginal, and overserious.  Early reviews would have you think that this film has something new to offer the superhero genre but it doesn't.  What the film DOES do is take the FUN out of the genre.
1.it's long and boring:  the film takes forever to get going.  It seems like about the first 45 minutes of the film is Bruce Wayne sortof 'finding himself' - which is fine, but it's just so boring.  We see him in a temple in the mountains talking uber zen psycho babble mumbo jumbo with Liam Neeson for what seems an eternity.  That would almost be okay if the stuff they were saying didn't come off as nonsense.  I can't believe Neeson could keep a straight face talking that trash.  They finally start fighting eventually, but Nolan's style detracts from the effect he is obviously trying to create: excitement.  It's hard to get excited or roused by action scenes shot almost in close-up.  Remember the scenes in the original Matrix where Neo fights Morpheus in the gymnasium?  that was shot from wide angles and you could really get into the acrobatic nature --the ballet if you will-- of the fight scenes.  Batman Begins was mostly like watching two or more people fight in a closet with invisible walls.
2.unoriginal.  You get all the requisite action crap as you'd expect.  Car chases, car crashes, more badly shot fight scenes, grappling hooks.. well basically that's it.  Absolutely nothing you haven't seen done countless times before.  The Batmobile flying across rooftops.. semi cool but not nearly cool enough.  Since we've seen this stuff before you'd think the director would try to make it special.  he doesn't. (we get it:  the Batmobile is really fast n stuff.)
3. Overserious.  This might be the biggest flaw.  Nolan needs to realize that a film about a man whe dresses up like a bat and goes chasing after a bad guy who calls himself the Scarecrow just ISN'T MEANT TO BE TAKEN ALL THAT SERIOUSLY.  That's why all the psycho babble crap comes off as so ludicrous.  We don't watch this stuff for the insight it might give us into anyone's psyche.
I'll reference the first (and by FAR best) Batman flick to close: that film had a few things this films wholely lacks.  Style for one, and panache for another.  The film had a vibe that just worked.  Batman Begins doesn't work.. for me anyway.",1130716800,19,2405,4.65083135391924
1572288,5,B00005JNJV,This is no doubt the best Batman flick ever! Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman does an excellent job in my opinion! Way better than George Cloony and Val Kilmer! Michael Cain is the best Alfred ever as well. That is one casting choice where they did not go wrong. The story is very well told about how Bruce Wayne goes from a privilaged child who witnesses the murder of his parents to the Dark Knight out to use fear on those who pray on the fearful of Gotham.,1130716800,,464,4.284090909090909
1572289,5,B00005JNJV,"The newest movie of Batman is the darkest and the best of any movie that has the Dark Knight sweeping off of roof tops onto bad guys who never really seem to learn how to point a gun right. Anway a star studded cast and possible one of the best evil plots ever to be put on screen gives this wild ride a perfect score.....

Batman Begins does not have the well known comical evil villians that everyone knows about; Two Face, The Joker, Poison Ivy, The Penguin, and perhaps the biggest cliche of them all, Robin, do not appear in this movie. However there is one character who does appear that really doesn't have that much publicity as the others do, and his name is the Scarecrow. Its really creepy how he plays a role in this movie.

Let me just make it clear, that not having all those evil guys in the movie is NOT a bad thing. In fact that is one of the reasons why Batman Begins actually works rather than watching Danny Devito rise up out of a crater in the floor. Christain Bale [who plays Batman] gets a chance to dwelve into character more and we can relate to seeing someone who has a rough past trying to make a good future for him and everyone else in Gotham City.

The plot goes like this [Don't worry, no spoilers] After the death of his parents, Bruce Wayne goes on a trip around the world, trying to find his own inner self while also looking at the way the criminal mind works and how to conquer evil. This eventually leads him to prison in a foreign country, I think it was China, and he is left there to rot basically.

Liam Neeson plays a mysterious man named Ducard, who arrives at the prison to offer Wayne a chance to become someone that can fight evil in a secret brotherhood known as the League of Shadows. [The movie does a great scenery shoot of snowy mountains and rugged terrain and the music is just excellently placed in the right tone with it.]

Meanwhile Gotham City is like Chicago in the 1920's but just a few times worse. Corrupt cops and businessmen, and also crime lords rule the city. Katie Holmes plays Rachel Dawes, a district attorney, one of the few that's actually fair and not corrupt. She starts to realize that some thing big is starting to happen to Gotham.

A lot of flashy camera work and dramatic music really help this Batman movie to really shine on its own. As Wayne comes home and starts building a secret hideout for Batman he starts to see just how badly his city has turned into. Morgan Freeman plays Lucious Fox, a weapons designer who spends countless hours perfecting spyware and weapons vehicles. His services help Batman out more than once in the movie.

The plot takes twist after twist. Double crosses, and killing sprees are to be expected, as well as poisonous gasses that make people hallucinate. As puzzle clues start to come together the plot just gets that much more captivating.

I will say the main bad guy is a surprise [it was for me] and the ending is dramatic and nail biting as the entire city is on the verge of chaos [But how and why are two things I am afraid you will have to watch and see for yourself.]

I might also add that Michale Caine does a wonderful job as Wayne's always reliable butler. A great supporting actor if I ever did see one. So many great actors, one great evil scheme, and a great dark tone in the movie gives this a five star rating from me, so go out and buy it now!",1130630400,3,3374,4.317535545023697

1572391,3,B00005JNJV,"Just saw the much-touted Batman Begins, but sad to say, it still disappoints, like all comic book based superhero movies...  Yes it's one of the better comic book superhero movies, but definitely not a masterpiece of any shape or form.  Let's just say it's as good as any comic book superhero movie is ever going to be, but that's not saying much...  The problem is with the source material, comic books (especially American ones) are simply too juvenile, absurd and unimaginative to base any good movie upon.  However hard the film-makers try to make comic book movies look respectable, at the end the best they can do is to mask the basic flaws of the source material and make the movie look a bit less juvenile, absurd and unimaginative, but only a bit...

It's a sad fact that American obsession with comic books is fueling the Hollywood craze to make them into mega-buck movies, while other much more deserved material is left to gather dust.  e.g. Why aren't we seeing more movies based on sci-fi masterpieces by Asimov, Clarke, Brin, Bear and the like?  One page in any of these novels contains more intelligence, correct science, mind-opening ideas and grand action than all the comic book movies combined.  Yet movie versions of Asimov's Foundation, or Clarke's Rama, or Brin's Uplift saga, or Bear's Eon, are still nowhere to be seen on Hollywood's horizon...

Perhaps America is simply not ready for such intelligent movie material... but perhaps, just perhaps, America is ready but Hollywood isn't...",1130630400,,1512,4.921259842519685
1572392,5,B00005JNJV,"This is the way it should be: an ordinary man who rises above tragedy and his own guilt and fear to become something more. A legend.  An icon.  The Batman.

""Batman Begins"" does not flinch for a moment in its portrayal of the origins of the Dark Knight.  We do not even see the Batman we know until the film is half over.  What we see first is Bruce Wayne, his tragic childhood and the burdens he carries as an adult, and finally the choices he makes that turn him into a symbol for hope in the face of dark times and evil people.  This is how we come to understand how a man can become so driven, so focused, so honed and balanced, like a weapon always prepared to strike. The first act of ""Batman Begins"" shows us not only his physical training, but his mental and spiritual rigor as well. We come to understand the man beneath the mask, before he ever puts the mask on.

And then, when he does finally don the familiar cowl and cape, it is so much more powerful, so much more bellievable than it ever has been before.  We see a man who understands what the nature of fear is, and for the rest of the film he uses it against his enemies, the criminals who are tearing his city apart, and those who threaten to tear it down completely.  Because as much as ""Batman Begins"" is about the creation of the legend that is Batman, it is also about fear.  Coming to understand one's fears, to face them down, and finally to use them as tools.  Bruce Wayne understands this when he puts on the mask and the cape, and one of his foes understands it as well.  The nature of fear forms the subtext and undercurrent of this powerful film.

And what a film it is.  The casting is ideal, from Christian Bale as the best Bruce Wayne/Batman dichotomy to ever grace the screen, to Gary Oldman as the perfect Sergeant (soon to be Commissioner?) Gordon, to Liam Neeson as...well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.  The direction of Christopher Nolan captures with crystal clarity, and for the first time on screen, the dual aspects of the Batman character -- the man, and the hero.  The musical score, a unique partnership of Hans Zimmer's dramatic style and James Newton Howard's understated themes, suits the film beautifully, carrying the dramatic aspects while avoiding the use of a catchy theme.  The story is well-paced, with a good blend of finely-tuned character development and high-octane action to keep it interesting, leading up to a pulse-pounding conclusion that will leave you breathless.

I'm inescapably reminded of ""Unbreakable,"" the only other film I can think of which takes the concept of a comic-book hero and deals with it in a real-world context.  Both films share a grounding in reality, a hope that things can be better than they are, and an emotional center which should resonate in even the most cynical heart.  Chances are good that if you like ""Unbreakable,"" you'll like ""Batman Begins,"" and vice-versa.

At last, you can forget Joel Schumacher's Batman flops, and you can even lay aside Tim Burton's efforts at bringing the Batman to the screen. Finally, in ""Batman Begins,"" we have a film that treats the Batman as he should be treated -- a complex character who is both legend and man, who looks his fear in the eye and brings a new understanding of fear to his enemies, who buries himself inside a cocoon built of his own doubts, fears, and guilt but emerges as a changed man, free to fly above darkened streets.

""Batman Begins"" is certainly one of the best comic-book movies ever made, primarily because it treats the subject seriously and honestly, but more than that, it is a challenging film that confronts the subject of fear and the nature of heroism head-on.  Here is where we see that being a hero doesn't mean having special powers or abilities...a hero is defined by the choices he makes, and by the actions he takes.

1572394,5,B00005JNJV,"I am not one of those detractors of the last cycle of ""Batman"" films.  For those too young to remember Tim Burton, the director of ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", was a young visionary filmmaker and his offerings in the series reflected his comic-goth outlook.  Joel Schumacher, the director of ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"", took a campier approach to the character.  While Schumacher's films were entertaining there wasn't much artistry to them.  Also, these films were geared towards casting movie stars instead of actors appropriate to their roles.  For instance, Jack Nicholson, who played the Joker in the first installment(and was quite good), received top billing over Michael Keaton as Batman.  The makers of this film probably took their cues from Sam Raimi in how he cast his ""Spider-Man"" films.  Though Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, or Alfred Molina would be considered household names they were the right actors for the roles and that contributed to the success of Raimi's films.  Warner Brothers must have taken notice because they hired a director, Christopher Nolan, whose previous work, ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"", were critical successes but hardly blockbusters.  Where he departs from the previous ""Batman"" films is that the emphasis is on Batman and not on the ""guest villains"".  Christian Bale is the perfect choice for the conflicted Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Bale, aside from his impressive physique, expertly displays the torment of a man who loathes injustice but has to skirt the fine line between crusader and vigilante.  An example at how well cast a film this is Cillian Murphy, who is excellent as the Scarecrow, isn't the most interesting secondary character.  That plaudit goes to Liam Neeson as Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor in Tibet.  Ducard is by no means a cardboard character rather a complex one who loathes the criminal element but differs from Bruce ever so slightly in combating it.  Michael Caine, born to play Alfred the butler when he reached a certain age(Michael Gough, you were fab in the first four).

I'm blown away... this is not only the best Batman movie out there but one of the top five best action/adventure movies I've ever seen!! I bought a copy through Amazon before even finishing the DVD.

Batman has always been one of my favorite superheros but one that has rarely been well captured on screen. He's basically a regular, more-or-less everyday guy who works out a lot and has some cool gadgets; sort of brooding James Bond in a mask and cape. This movie starts out by showing how he learned and perfected his martial arts skills. It really captures the soul of the Dark Knight. Christian Bale is a perfect choice to play this character. I can't say enough positive things about this approach, it's exactly how I have always pictured the character.

The pacing nears perfection, the action is gripping and extremely well choreographed, the acting is top rate, the writing is fantastic, and the cinematography is outstanding. Rarely is a known story done so originally and well. I love the depth of the characters, the splashes of humor, and the low-key but everpresent moral undertones. It's neither preachy nor over the top. And, despite the fact that we all have a pretty good idea of the plot it is surprisingly original. Oh, and it's got Liam Neesan with a sword too; what more could you want ;-)

I am also very impressed with how they show Gotham being very much like any large US city today yet demonstrate in a realistic and believable manner how a masked superhero and fantastic villians can fit in that context. I really hope this cast/crew/director hook-up again for a sequal as the calling card at the end perhaps suggests.

The story keeps changing about how he fell into the bat cave as a boy. In one movie, he falls into the cave while running in angst over his parents death. In Batman Begins, Bruce falls into the bat cave while his parents are still living, and while he's playing around at Wayne Manor.

Now, I'm not saying that all the other Batman films were that bad. But THIS....is darker than Spiderman. Dr. Jonathan Crane {Cillian Murphy} becomes more viscious than any other villain in a Batman film as the Scarecrow. His mask shoots out a harmful fear toxin that poisons the victim and makes them imagine that they are seeing something freaky. It gets worse when the Scarecrow spreads this stuff out all across Gotham City affecting everyone, and that it would destroy itself in fear, and Batman {Christian Bale} has to stop it. Both Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy pulled off their roles quite well for one being the hero and the other as the villain. The other actors were great too, including Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman.

The movie starts with Bruce Wayne in Asia training in karate. However, when he gets back to Gotham City afterwards, it is overrun with crime. Then, he finds a batcave under a hole in the ground where he fell when he was just a child. This is where he decides to become what he is: Batman! Luscious Fox {Morgan Freeman} helps him build the equipment along with the batsuit. From here, he seeks out criminals, epecially the Scarecrow and that's how the whole toxin thing is started after Dr. Jonathan Crane tests it out on an inmate from Arkham Asylum and then Dr. Crane goes crazy and confronts Batman, but so does everyone else. It gets really, really awesome.

Highly recommended. 5 out of 5 stars for a splendidly-made Batman movie that we've all been waiting for to see the lights of DVD.

1572534,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman is one of the greatest superheros of all time and yet over the years we have insulted him with crappy movies. Tim Burton's Batman movies were good but they didn't match. Gotham City and the overall look of the film from movie 1 to 2 is inconsistent. Joel Schumacher's  two Batman films were disgraceful . . . he tried to make it campy like the old TV show . . . we are just too intelligent for that . . . whoever got the bright idea to make Alicia Silverstone Batgirl was obviously Clueless (not to mention almost destroyed the series for good.) Let's move on and put all that behind us. Batman Begins is not only a rebirth for the Batman franchise but it is also one of the best superhero flicks to date. If you haven't seen this movie yet . . . you need to. Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne and a great Batman . . . unlike some of his predecessor who could only pull off one or the other. The new twist on the Batman myth is so well conceived. Great story, great cast, great acting, awesome special effects . . . I was totally satisfied.  I heard this is to be a trilogy like Spiderman . . . I hope the other two films will hold up to the standard of the first",1130371200,6,1174,4.056034482758621
1572535,3,B00005JNJV,"As much as I wanted to love the newest incarnation of Batman, especially under the direction of the sharply talented Christopher Nolan, there is a gnawing imbalance to the film that makes the overall experience less than enthralling to me. In what looks obviously like the start of a new franchise, the 2005 movie spends an inordinate amount of time on the myth creation, and the first hour feels so solemn and methodical that the more interesting second hour or so in Gotham City feels rushed and telegraphed with arcane explanations of panic-inducing hallucinogens.

The problematic pacing makes the 141-minute running time seem interminable when it needs to sprint. The movie then ends almost too quickly for the dense plot that Nolan and co-writer David S. Goyer present in sometimes frustratingly cryptic strokes. Although they provide moments of deadpan humor reminiscent of ""The Terminator"" films, what is missing is the satirical sense and ironic nihilism that Tim Burton brought to the 1989 and 1992 Batman films. At the same time, Nolan imbues a true focused sense of dramatic purpose and atmosphere to his treatment that easily eclipses the subsequent Joel Schumacher movies.

Fortunately, Christian Bale is ideally cast in the title role primarily because he is an actor who emits a searing presence by not divulging too much about his interior life.  That is exactly the quality needed to portray a loner driven by the horrific murder of his parents to penetrate the criminal mind and then ironically become a reluctant, clandestine hero. Under his cowl, he takes on Clint Eastwood's raspy vocal inflections to add to his mystique, and he brings a sinewy intelligence and quiet reserve to the conflicted millionaire Bruce Wayne. The combination works.

With a virtual Who's Who of A-listers, the supporting cast is almost too overwhelming to utilize their individual talents effectively. In a rather dastardly variation on his Jedi Master in ""Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"", Liam Neeson plays Henri Ducard, another intimidating mentor who this time, acts as an operative for a ninja vigilante group trained somewhere in the Himalayas. Neeson exhibits a palpable sense of malice in the role, though his character's return late in the film has a foreboding sense of predictable inevitability about it.

Gary Oldman, who usually specializes in screen villains, does an about-face and with genuine goodwill, plays put-upon Lt. Jim Gordon, who will become Gotham City's police commissioner someday. In his usual impeccable form, Morgan Freeman portrays Lucius Fox, the brilliant staff scientist at Wayne Enterprises who invents Batman's wardrobe and gadgetry. As Wayne's manservant Alfred, Michael Caine seems to be enjoying the humorous asides and unyielding British sense of duty in his relatively constrained role. As if he walked right off the comic-level ""Dick Tracy"" set, Tom Wilkinson chews a lot of scenery as the Jersey-accented crime boss Carmine Falcone.

The normally charismatic Ken Watanabe, however, is wasted in a small role as Ra's Al Ghul, the meditative head of the ninja group spouting all sorts of incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo. Cillian Murphy turns in the film's most chilling performance as the creepy psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane, evoking the perfect portions of fear and loathing in a character that makes my skin crawl. Last and truly least, Katie Holmes fails to rise to the caliber of her cast mates as her perpetually girlish manner belies the driving conviction of an assistant D.A. struggling with her lifelong attraction to Wayne.

The film is not as visually resplendent as previous Batmans, though the old-meets-new vision of Gotham City is compelling thanks to Nathan Crowley's impressive set designs. Also thrilling are the scary visual effects conjured up for the hallucinogens. Not as effective is Nolan's liberal use of close-ups and quick edits, especially in the numerous fight scenes sometimes impinging on the clarity of the action presented. I just wish Nolan and Goyer were not intent on overstuffing the screenplay with so many plot threads as it became a challenge to keep everything straight by the end.",1130371200,5,4173,5.228699551569507

Read ANY Batman comic book before the 50s and after the 1960s, and you'll clearly see that Batman is NOT about buttcheeks, witty lines, and whatever the hell Shoe-smucker supported. Seriously, the guy's parents were gunned down in front of him as a child, and you expect him to grow up happy-go-lucky about it? I think not. The guy grows up wanting revenge. Of COURSE he's gonna be dark and broody about it. ""Batman a villain"", as you put it? Dude, who do you think was fighting the REAL bad guys, the tooth fairy? And your gripes about the presence of Qui-Gon Jinn and the Last Samurai guy? Dude, those are CHARACTERS in seperate films, played repectively by Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe. They're actors. As such, they're paid to act in movies, which is what Batman Begins IS. By your logic, an actor can only play ONE role his/her entire life and leave it at that. Seriously, pal, you need to take a look at the real world some time. Batman Begins is everything I'd been expecting in a Batman film. The Burton films were good, but the sets and costumes were too comic-booky and not believable. Batman Begins brings a whole new real-world feel to the legend, and should mark the beginning of a whole new, much grander franchise. Though I supposed one of your intelligence, Shockmaster, won't be able to grasp that, as you seem to be to fixated on fantasies of Batman in a homosexual relationship with Nick Carter.

1572658,5,B00005JNJV,"I have already seen this movie about four times on DVD in the past week because it is amazingly good.  Not since Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando in SUPERMAN have I seen a superhero movie that captures the mythic subtext inherent in every great hero in a way that would make Joseph Campbell laugh like a child at play.  As such, for me, this even beats Spider Man by a country mile.

Christian Bale has seemed to me well poised for becoming our Brando ever since he gave me the creeps in SHAFT--not to mention AMERICAN PSYCHO.  He does not disappoint by any stretch of the imagination here, giving Batman the dark yet human quality he so desperately needs; something missing since the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson venture (that should have earned Jack another one of his Oscars as far as I'm concerned).

The movie is chock full of the best character actors in the business:  Michael Caine as a brilliant Alfred, the loyal butler; Morgan Freeman as a scientist/inventor that is more like the techno master in the 1960s series MISSION IMPOSSIBLE than Q in JAMES BOND (though the comparisons to Q will be unavoidable); Gary Oldman as the young sargeant turned lieutenant (soon enough to become Comissioner) Gordon; Rutger Hauer, iconic bad guy and spy from the seventies and eighties as Mr. Earle, the well-intentioned but questionable agenda-ed CEO of Wayne Enterprises; and Liam Neeson playing a role he has come to master: mentor; to Bruce Wayne, who, in leaving Western Civilization and all of his wealth in order to find his soul after the murder of his parents before his eyes, becomes a lost soul that is saved by this Jedi-like follower of a mysterious guru in the Eastern mountains.

And yet none of them outpace the magic and beauty of Christopher Nolan's direction--who also helped write the screenplay.  There is maybe about two minutes of the two hours of his work that I would change in the total picture; something I can only say from having been so riveted to it I watched it four times in a week (as I said) to notice areas where there could even be improvement.

The musical score by Hans Zimmer is also nothing short of breathtaking--when you even register that it exists--further intensifying the character development, action, plot and dialogue: the sign of a master movie composer at the top of his game.

This movie needs to be a part of the collection of anyone who loves movies, regardless of age or interest. My teenage son bought it for the house, saying, as I missed seeing this on  the big screen, that I need to see it.  He was right.",1130284800,3,2591,4.695364238410596
1572659,1,B00005JNJV,"for all the time we have to spend following him around while he drifts aimlessly.  Very little Batman here, and what we do get of him.... well, here's some random points I'd like to make about the movie.

1. When did the batsuit make him start yelling like a WWF reject?  When he's not yelling, he slips into some strange '2 packs a day for 30 years' croak.  Sometimes the voice is so raspy you can close your eyes and picture him on the porcelain throne, straining as best he can.  You even wonder if he might be on the verge of defecating from his mouth, that is seriously how hard he is trying.  I'll wait for the super collecter's edition deluxe director's cut, when they redo the voiceovers to give him back his calm menacing voice.  For the time being, I am left to giggle and/or weep silently whenever he tries to talk while in the suit.

2. Nolan is a coward.  I think there are two scenes where he had the guts to make Christian Bale stand still and let us look at the costume for more than 1.3 seconds at a time.  I guess it doesn't matter, since there are only 11 minutes of screentime left when Nolan finally gets around to letting Christian Bale wear the goddamn costume to begin with.  Was he afraid the other kids would make fun of him?  Was he ashamed of how it turned out?  Even Scarecrow only puts his mask on for quick bursts, just barely long enough for, say, a fart to dissipate.  Scarecrow doesn't even have to sneak away and change into any kind of costume, that's how lazy Hollywood has become, people.

3. Katie Holmes dials in a performance from the WB.  It's moments like her ""It's what's on the inside that's on the inside"" speech that make you weep for the centuries of intellectual development that have been wasted.  Later in the movie, when Batman regurgitates this gem past all of the bat phlegm stuck in his throat, you'll be forced to question whether mankind even has the right to exist anymore.

4. This version of Bruce Wayne doesn't need justice and vengeance - he needs a support group and designer antidepressants.  Yeah, you fell down a well once, does it really take a ninja school for you to finally come to terms with that?  Are you crying?  There's no crying in Batman!  This Bruce Wayne isn't driven by a passionate obsession that fuels the grim exploration of his limits and capabilities.  This Bruce Wayne is a whining pansie who needs somebody to hold his hand and show him where the bathroom is.  When I'm watching a Batman movie, I should never feel like I want to pat him on the head and say ""There, there.  Everything will be fine.  Have some warm milk... is that better?  Good, now get up off your can, put the damn costume on, beat some people up, and keep your mouth shut while you're doing it!""",1130284800,17,2752,4.387351778656127

1572662,5,B00005JNJV,"This is the best Batman movie for some time it is because everything in this movie is good. For the story, it is good because it talks about how the Batman Begins. For the acting, I can't say that Christian Bale is the best for Batman but he is suitable to act as Batman. He is somewhat better than George Clooney where he stars as Batman in ""Batman and Robin"" in 1997. For the direction, it is awesome because since this movie is truly exciting, no doubt to say that it is good. For the visuals, it is perfect because you know, if it is a good movie, the visual must play a part of it. So, it is good overall.  And for this two-disc deluxe edition, it is good to make this because for disc 2, I can search more about Batman and it is nice that this movie is with the comic book in it.  Therefore, it is nice to buy this.

Till now, I have watched all my Batman movies, here is how I ranked from the best to worst:

1. Batman Begins
(No doubt that it is good, it is a must-watch.)
2. Batman and Robin
(Why I ranked it second for this, not because for the casts, it is quite a relaxing one as there are some quite laughs.)
3. Batman Returns
(This movie is very memorable, especially the second half of the movie, first, the catwoman is being banished by the Penguin, then, after the city was distroyed by the Penguin, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle know their true identity to Batman and Catwoman.  During that time, Max Shreck was out of the cage and found out their true identity, he wanted to finished Batman and Catwoman off by a gun.)
4. Batman Forever
(Maybe after a few years after Batman Returns, it brings some fresh look between this and that.)
5. Batman

1572663,5,B00005JNJV,"I personally think this is the best Batman movie to date. The story, although cartoon in character, leads the audience on a journey that's almost believable. We witness the spiritual growth of a tortured soul who's parents had been killed by a down and dirty, mid-city mugger. Bruce Wayne had disappeared from civilization only to be found hiding at the far reaches of humanity in a personal depression. We view his rise from someone searching for revenge and vengeance to a concerned and vigilant citizen trying to right the wrongs of corruption and crime in society. And although Batman is good, he is a dark hero and he really enjoys hunting and playing with his prey. Perhaps a touch of evil lurks inside the masked crusader himself.

What a great cast of actors, Christian Bale who plays Batman and a supporting cast of great talent: Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutgar Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan Freeman. This is the first time I have seen Katie Holmes in a film - disappointing.

I saw this DVD on a home theater, wide screen TV and I was very impressed. The cinematography is exceptional and so is the great musical soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. Christopher Nolan is a very good director, coming from classic films like Memento. He rose to the occasion with this film, making it the best off the series. I look forward to more from Mr. Nolan.",1130198400,2,1379,4.717842323651452
1572664,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman and Batman Returns were easily the best two of the first four films. They had everything the darker comic books had, including the deep atmosphere and an anti-hero Batman character. For a long time after the release of the third (Batman Forever) and fourth (Batman & Robin) I feared for the future of what had been a great movie franchise. So, when Batman Begins came out, I was determined not to waste the same amount of time as I did with Forever and Batman & Robin.

Luckily, I changed my mind. Batman Begins has gone back (without Keaton) to its darker roots, capturing the haunting, crime-ridden atmosphere made great in the first two films. Not only that, but it left behind all those childish moments in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.

Though certainly not Michael Keaton's Batman, Christian Bale brings to us a new Batman, one hell bent (at least at first) on succeeding where he had past failed, and one facing many new obstacles in his career. When he's in constume, Bale delivers convincely as a menacing crime-fighter. Definately better than Clooney or Kilmer. To add, the villains in this film are far more convincing than even those in the first two films.

I'd recommend this movie for anyone who is enjoying the current flood of superhero films, or for those of you who still had hope left for the Batman movies. A great movie sure to promise greater sequals (I HOPE).

As for the DVD, I highly recommend the Deluxe Edition, as it contains a second disc filled with interesting documentaries along with a small graphic novel of past Batman adventures. A must have for true fans.",1130198400,4,1605,4.701067615658363
1572745,4,B00005JNJV,"One cannot fault the cinematography in this film, it's a work of art. And they got the atmosphere right, and added some emotional depth to Batman's backstory. But: the dialog was aimed at the lowest common denominator (and mixed so poorly that sometimes I had to listen to it 3 or 4 times to understand it); the action was so chopped up that it was hard to tell who was who and what was happening; the ethics became a little murky as Batman crunches and crashes dozens of police cars; and the proceedings become way too illogical as: 1) Batman dangles by a cable from a speeding monorail L train as it passes through multiple trestles (how do you do that?); 2) some kind of giant microwave projector is employed to boil the city water supply - that would be some nasty steam, wouldn't it? and wouldn't all water-containing items such as people, etc. be affected as well? Ultimately I ended up constantly making a comparison to Spider-man 2, which also featured a train scene. Nowhere in SW2 was I taken out of the movie by baffling logic gaps; those film-makers had the sense to run their story through an adult-level logic check, whereas these guys obviously didn't. How could Ra's (who is tough but can in no way be as high-tech-equipped) be beating the hell out of Batman who is wearing kevlar and graphite armor? This movie was really good where it stayed small, a scale which the writers could handle. They just don't have the intellect to write ""big."" Maybe it takes a committee. Anyway, this is entertaining, even beautiful to watch, but the last 45 minutes or so is way over the top and nonsensical.",1130198400,4,1607,4.583333333333333
1572746,5,B00005JNJV,"For once, the producers got it. They didn't want to screw up the franchise anymore and seem to have understood the way Batman was meant to be seen: Dark, gritty, angry, yet intelligent, sensitive, and even showing flaws in his first wake as the batman.

Are you sick and tired of being pushed around by actors wearing plastic-rubber suits that make them look like a group of circus? Then come on in, this movie is for you. Here, we are *treated* and the word is light, with a Bruce Wayne that understood what most of us knew long ago: Batman is a symbol of fear, representing a man's eternal journey to rid a corrupted city's evil.

The movie opens with a young Bruce Wayne playing in his parents' garden with Rachel Dawes. Inadvertently, young Bruce falls into an old hole. Meanwhile, Rachel went to seek Alfred (Michael Caine) and Thomas Wayne for help. Flash-forward almost 15 years later as Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) wakes up, bearded, dirty and in a cell. A large man picks a fight with him and quickly, the young billionnaire gains the advantage over many fighters. Shortly after, Bruce is sent to an isolated cell for protection. There, he meets with Henry Ducard (Liam Neeson) who offers a proposition he can't refuse. The next morning, set free, Bruce Wayne embarks on a journey that will transform him into the most feared creature of the night by all criminal. A fearless fighter who became his own demon by fighting it, the Batman. But every fight and victory has its price as Bruce Wayne will learn throughout the course of the movie.

Christopher Nolan not only did an excellent job directing his actors (as always), but he managed to keep every aspect of the film as natural as possible, so it's no surprise when the movie ends that we feel like it might happen somewhere... anywhere, next door. His direction is precise and he knows exactly what every scene means to the characters involved. A++ for the director. A wise choice from Warner Brothers who definitely should hire his services for an inevitable sequel that should be as good as this movie.

Christian Bale (Duh, the man was so born to play Batman), Liam Neeson (a nice addition to his impeccable acting skills), Morgan Freeman (the genius behind most of Batman's gadgets, nevertheless, an exquisite time with this character), Michael Caine (this man IS Alfred, no questions here), heck, even Katie Holmes is great, Where I thought she would play the Kim Basinger-ish heroine, she strikes to the heart as a woman whose entire life is the same battle as Batman (only, without a mask). Katie Holmes is definitely, after Michelle Pfeiffer, the series' best female addition ever, beating (I'm sorry people) Uma Thurman and Nicole Kidman. This ensemble shines everytime the spotlight is on them and every scene makes you want more of their characters. You almost want to spend some time in Gotham City.

The design of the city, as the look and feel of the movie, is as natural and realistic as ever. A lot of work went into this project and it definitely shows as the alleys crowded with hanged clothes, close buildings and high-rise buildings give us the most beliveable Gotham City we've ever seen on screen. The locations serve the story and characters, never the opposite, which makes this movie one of the best superheroes movies ever seen.

The special effects are impeccable as Batman is surrounded by digital bats, most of the city's skyscrapers are nowhere near real and the stunts are impressive. I was baffled, without a word when I saw all the details (I've seen it 5 times so far and I always see something new... always realistic though)

Overall, finally, Batman Begins is not only a worthy addition to your DVD collection, it's a must. Warner Brothers went over-the-top with this edition (the deluxe edition). The bonus features are near perfection as we are brought in to discover the real struggle to make Batman work with Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer as they speak about the secret project that was Batman Begins (so secret they had to name it ""Intimidation Game""... I'm not making that up people). From the special effects to the building of the batsuit, it's all in one of the most exciting DVDs I've seen in years. Truly a must buy and a must-see... now it's a must-own and frankly, you couldn't pick a better Batman title if you want something coming close to the original comic book material.",1130112000,5,4399,4.742483660130719
1572747,5,B00005JNJV,"Yeah, this movie is almost perfect, it's the best Batman movie to date, a must see for anybody. All the good stuffs been gone over already, so I'll just point out the two things that I think could have been better.

1. The action, most it was to hard to follow, I know why they did this, but I didn't like it.

2. More attention should have been paid to the Scarecrow, I didn't feel like I got to know him well enough during the movie, he didn't seem like a character.

Other then those two things this movie is amazing, I do miss Keaton (nobody can replace him as Batman IMO) and I do miss Burtons image of Gotham city, but overall you can't beat this movie, and it seems to be a great price here on Amazon, at stores the 2-disc set is going for $30!!! This is a must have movie...get it.",1130112000,,789,4.077419354838709
1572748,5,B00005JNJV,"In the music industry, super-groups are well reviewed and tend to top the charts. Super-groups are, in case you weren't aware, when members from one band and members from another band merge together to form a new band. Velvet Revolver, Audioslave, and A Perfect Circle are examples of that. With movies, you rarely see two filmmakers put their heads together and create something really good. With ""Batman Begins"" that's what you get.

You have the writer/director of ""Memento"" and the writer of the 3 movies in the ""Blade"" trilogy. That's a smart pairing up and it didn't go to waste. ""Batman Begins"" is a wonderful film, in many ways. As a comic book adaptation, as pure entertainment, the art direction and cinematography are great and the cast is unbeatable. Going back to the previous 4 Batman movies, there are several things that are wrong with them. The first two Batman movies (Batman & Batman Returns) were directed by Tim Burton and had Michael Keaton as the masked man. The films had a very gothic, creepy feeling to them; but Michael Keaton couldn't really pull of tough. Don't get me wrong, I love both of those films though. Joel Schumacher took over directing for the next two films (Batman Forever & Batman and Robin) and took a different approach. Those films were more like cartoonish black comedies; and the actors that were chosen to play Batman weren't that great either. Val Kilmer was too serious, George Clooney was too charismatic. Both are great actors and again, I enjoyed both films...But, I don't know. This film is more of an action film/drama that has a serious tone to it. It's dark, but not really gothic. We also have our protagonist Batman being like the comic book character. He's a reserved, reclusive billionaire instead of a womanizing, charming, billionaire. The film doesn't have your typical Batman feel to it, either...I'll explain. First of all, Batman doesn't appear in the film (by that I mean Bruce Wayne donning the cape) until 61 minutes in. In fact, most of the first half of the movie takes place in Japan or somewhere simalar and feels like ""The Last Samurai."" Ironically, a star from that film appears in this movie as well. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, who hits all the right notes) is in a prison in Japan or China (I get confused) when a man named Ducard (Liam Neeson) gets him out and begins training him, so Bruce can join The League of Shadows; an elite team of heavily trained ninjas that is run by a man named Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, 'The Last Samurai'). After passing all the tests and realizing that The League isn't for him, he leaves the place in ruins and returns to his home in Gotham City. Gotham City is a crime ridden town, that's run by a mafia boss (Tom Wilkinson) and Bruce feels it's up to him to fix things. It's a perfect cover too, because everyone in Gotham is under the impression that Bruce is dead.

So, with the help of his trusty butler Alfred (Michael Caine, who replaces Pat Hingle who played Alfred in all four films), an employee of Wayne Enterprises named Lucius Fox (a wonderful Morgan Freeman), a semi-love interest named Rachel (Katie Holmes), and Detective Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman); Bruce takes crime fighting into his own hands. Cillian Murphy ('Red Eye') plays the main-villain, who turns out to not even be the ""head villain guy"" Scarecrow. Oddly enough, Murphy seems to be blending both the roles he played in ""Breakfast on Pluto"" and ""Red Eye"" for this role. The character he plays is very flamboyant, but maintains a cold icy stare. Anyway, the cinematography and art direction are absolutely wonderful. This is the best looking Gotham City we've seen on the screen yet. The dialogue is really good; Everything looks different. And the movie is done in a serious way. Nothing cartoonish about this. Everyone plays their roles to perfection;

Bale proves his versatilty, Caine and Freeman are wonderful to watch, Gary Oldman is like a chameleon blending into his role. I also like how they bring in a female character (Rachel) as a potential love interest, but nothing comes of it. It really does justice to Batman. Anyway, despite what Ebert & Roeper said, I don't think this was one of the best films of 2005. I think it was the best comic-book based film of 2005 and I think it's the best Batman movie so far; but that's because none of the other ones are taken seriously. Spiderman is a semi-dramatic comedic action film. X-Men are action films.

Fantastic Four was a comedy. It's a nice break; Fans of the comics or fans of writer/director Christopher Nolan should be pleased.

1572749,4,B00005JNJV,"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this, I'd heard good reviews...but another remake? I loved the Tim Burton version, especially the Prince soundtrack. The colours and sound made it funky.

The background info on how Bruce took on the bat persona made it interesting, and how he didn't get the mandatory girl, kept his dark, brooding character more believable. I had the surround sound system pumping--the batmobile sounded awesome. Highly recommended.

SPOILER: If the weapon was designed to vaporise water, thus spreading the poison, why weren't all the people zapped as well? After all, aren't we made up of 90% water? Just a thought.",1130112000,,645,5.018691588785047
1572750,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman gets a bad rap in comics and movies as a supposedly ""dark"" hero.  But really, like the criminal elements he haunts, so many people have missed the point.  Batman is not dark.  He's about justice, helping people, protecting the innocent, and stopping the guilty.  His dark image is just how he chooses to become a larger than life ""supernatural"" force against crime, but it's merely a tool to fight evil.  Anyone who misses that doesn't understand Batman at all.

I HATED Tim Burton's Batman interpretations.  To begin with, the bad guys were more important than Batman.  True, they're complex characters and a lot of fun to watch, but the movies did a lousy job of that, too.  A bunch of loonies running around in funny costumes is not what superheroes are about.

This film understands that.  It begins slow, presenting a very real, very damaged Gotham City.  The same could be said for Bruce Wayne.  His development from spoiled richboy to force of justice is both believable and larger than life.  A very neat trick.

The cast is perfect, especially Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon who finally gets to be the good cop he never got to be in the TV or movies.  And the script solid. The only bad thing about it (-1 star) is the clumsy action scenes, which can be difficult to follow.  Still, a great rendition that I was overjoyed to finally see made.",1130112000,,1353,4.594142259414226

1572752,5,B00005JNJV,"Yes, I understand that this could be considered somewhat of a prequel to the 4 other Batman movies of recent Hollywood endeavor. Tim Burton's two films Batman and Batman Returns were very entertaining. Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever was fair, but Schumacher's Batman and Robin was absolutely atrocious (think the TV series)!

Batman Begins is so head and shoulders above any of the aforementioned that it would be okay with me if Christopher Nolan just took the franchise from the beginning and went forward...yes even steamrolled right over Burton's versions of The Joker (who wants to think of Jack Nicholson when they think of the Joker anyway?), the Penguin and Catwoman.

The title of Batman Begins is the best description of the movie. We see exactly why Batman is Batman. What happened in his childhood, his training, how he gets all those cool devices and toys including a modern day, very realistic Batmobile...the Tumbler (out are the stupid nicknames Batmobile, Batcave, Batetcetera). Batman returns to Gotham from his training to face his first nemesis...Scarecrow.

Batman Begins is suspenseful, scary at times and well acted with terrific special effects. An improvement even on Burton's Batman and Schumacher's Batman was a disgrace in my opinion. So Batman Begins was a delightful breath of fresh air filling the sails of what hopefully is the beginning of a new era of Batman movies.

1572753,5,B00005JNJV,"This is the most satisfying of the Batman movies.  No goofy villains or campy lines here.  This Batman has a great script, plenty of action and terrific acting.

Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freemen, Rutger Hauer and of course Christian Bale.  These guys are professionals.  Even though many of the parts seemed minor, each actor makes their presence felt.  They make this the most realistic of the Batman movies.

High marks for the director, Tim Nolan who got these wonderful performances from these excellent actors.  He really had a handle on his movie and it shows.  He allowed his actors to  become multi-dimensional people, not simply side-kicks to Batman.  In a good ""period"" piece, the director develops his characters slowly; in some cases leaving the viewer to ponder if they are good or bad or somewhere in-between.  Nolan manages to create this struggle in his characters and at the same time keep the action level high.

The plot is far more intricate than other Batman movies too;  taking it from a comic book action movie to an action mystery.  Gotham is dark and forboding and the Batman is tough and sober about his mission.

Side note:  the chase scene is probably the best I have ever seen.",1130112000,5,1229,4.803827751196172
1572754,4,B00005JNJV,"This movie was a pleasant surprise for my family (most of us anyhow).  One of my teens thought it was stupid.  The rest of us loved it.

As a kid I grew up watching Batman on TV.  This show gave me an origin to the entire concept of the show from the beginning by carefully and compellingly laying a foundation for how and why Batman uses the image he does and how he overcomes evil.  It is a movie we will end up buying, not just renting, because we'll want to see it from time to time.

If you are a firstborn, and carry the 'hero' mantle in your family, you will no doubt love this movie.  It appeals to your internal sense of justice in a refined way that rejects some of the eastern tendencies that bother some of us.  At the same time I flaw the plot for providing no realistic solution for the inability of men to overcome their internal battle against evil desires.  The idea that sheer will power will do it seems rather pale to me.  So it's a four star....but the rest of the movie is really good.

Kids can watch it and enjoy it because the bad language and sexual connotations that many movies contain were absent by and large.  Even the recently released 'Robots' contained a lot of references to gender confusion...yet this movie was refreshingly free from those common 'flies in the ointment' (if you will).

Honestly the other Batman stuff I've seen in the last few years never made me happy.  As an old 60's Batman and Robin guy this was the first movie on Batman that I've seen that I thought was worth watching. It left me satisfied with the question of why is Batman Batman...and how did he really get started and why? That's the name of the movie...so I guess it delivered...Batman Begins.  See it if you haven't.  I think you'll agree...at least most of you will.",1130025600,4,1785,4.363636363636363
1572845,4,B00005JNJV,"I really enjoyed this movie and I enjoy watching the special features, but I was disappointed to find that there is no commentary even for a ""deluxe"" edition.

Furthermore, the second disc is laid out like pages from a comic book where you move the cursor to highlight menu keys to access the features.  For instance, you would highlight certain words in the dialogue bubbles or highlight objects in the background.  However, the cursor or highlighter disappeared but I could still blindly access the features.  It was very annoying.  If I ejected the disc and started over, the highlighter would come back and would stay if I did not access any of the features in the comic pages (another set of features are simply listed after the comic page format).  Again, very annoying.  If anyone else has experienced this problem let me know.

One more thing--and this isn't a complaint--for anyone who did not know this already, Christain Bale purposely kept the American accent in some interviews (so that US audiences would not wonder why Batman seems British), but you will find some features where he lets his Welsh accent be known.  This can be confusing if you don't know the reason behind it.  See also the Quotes & Trivia page.",1130025600,3,1228,4.777251184834123
1572846,3,B00005JNJV,"I just saw the movie again, and frankly, I was a little disappointed.

If you're anything like me, the first time you see this movie, you'll come away thinking it's a definite improvement over some of the recent installments -- particularly the Scharzenegger/Uma Thurman dud.  Christian Bale makes an excellent Batman, the back story about how he becomes Batman is plausible and well told, his relationships with Ducard (Liam Neeson), with Alfred (Michael Caine), and Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) are real, and his emotional torment convincingly conveyed.  Some of the scenes are great -- particularly the exposition about how he becomes Batman -- the most lust you'll see in this movie is when he sees the future Batmobile for the first time, and you'll be right there with him.  Also, the director gets the iconic Dark Knight look just right.  When Rachel Dawes meets Batman for the first time, you'll know what I mean.

So why doesn't the movie have staying power (ie -- why didn't it hold up so well after a second viewing?)  There are several reasons.  The dialogue is actually pretty didactic -- justice v. vengeance, face your fear, etc. etc.  Second, there really is no drama -- you know what this story is going to be before you go into the movie theatre, you're going for the action, the scenery, and the details, so in a way, it's kind of boring.  Third, it's emotionally pretty one-dimensional.  This Batman is focused, and neither love, nor money, nor a good time, are going to get in his way.

Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, and I think it had better than average entertainment value, but like this DVD (which really has no special features), it's a limited pleasure.",1130025600,5,1689,4.7465753424657535
1572847,1,B00005JNJV,"I really enjoyed watching all of the Batman movies except for this one.  I just don't think Bale was the right chose to play Batman.  Everytime he spoke with that low corse voice, he really annoyed me.  He seemed like he had to force himself to be Batman unlike Michael Keaton or Clooney which seemed more comfortable playing Batman.  The only thing that I enjoyed was the very beginning where you see the special effects of bunch of bats flying around, and way at the background you see a huge Batman figure.  There just wasn't very much action in the movie, there's ton of talking though.  When it came to action, the camera made it look like MTV video, the action was shown very quickly so that you don't fully see the fights.  I wish our actors and actresses learn how to do kung fu, karate or other martial arts like the asian actors do.  I'm just so sick and tired of watching same actors and actresses on t.v. (Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Holly Berry, Christen Bale, etc).  They seem to focus on their looks and not actual talents like knowing martial arts.  I would like to see more newcomers in movies.",1130025600,11,1136,4.470873786407767
1572848,1,B00005JNJV,"I copied this review cause the guy who wrote it besically took words out of my mouth so read below.

This movie is terribly bad (while not as bad as the detestable ""Batman & Robin""). It is also full of inconsistencies with the 1989 film. For instance, in this movie Commissioner Gordon gets to know Batman, even though in the original film he didn't; the Commissioner invents the batsignal, which was a ""present"" from Batman at the end of the first movie; Bruce Wayne's parents were not murdered by the man who would become The Joker, but by an unknown criminal (as in the comics); and The Joker appears to exist already at the end of the movie, while the in the 1989 film we get to see him before he becomes the Clown Prince of Crime. Also, the Batmobile is the worst I have ever seen, and the villains are nothing but secondary characters. Ra's Al Ghul is a global menace in the comics, but here his goal is conveniently focused on Gotham City only, and the Scarecrow, one of Batman's most dangerous enemies, was wasted here, with only a few appearances, all without a scarecrow suit (he uses only a lame mask). All in all, I didn't like this movie one bit, and don't recommend it at all. If you want to see a good ""Batman"" movie, I suggest you watch the first original 1989 version.",1130025600,11,1285,4.399159663865547
1572849,5,B00005JNJV,"After a foiled attempt at avenging the deaths of his parents by a common street thug and a run-in with Gotham City's crime boss, rich kid Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) realizes that he knows very little of the injustice and evil that adorns the world like a plague. He grew up a rich snot-nosed kid, but his father always told him to protect the less privelaged. But Bruce decides that he needs to study those who take advantage of the weak, and so becomes a criminal himself in order to further his study. While in an Asian prison, he is visited by a mysterious man named Ducard (Liam Neeson) who is a member of the League of Shadows, an organization dedicated to stamping out evil and corruption wherever it can be found, even if it means destroying Gotham City to further their ends! Bruce, in the guise of Batman must return to his home to save his city from tearing itself apart and rein in the criminal elements that rule the streets.

Batman Begins is a modern classic with beautiful shots reminiscent of Kurosawa that George Lucas would envy. When I saw it at the movies, I knew the director was doing a 180 degree turn from previous installments by concentrating on the characters, almost making it a domestic drama that just happens to be a superhero movie by accident. I thought then that maybe he took things TOO slow, but after seeing it on DVD on a small-screen I was more impressed. This is a very personal film and relies a lot on old style acting. And by that I mean Bale actually ACTS. He shows emotion and nuance in his performance. A good example is when he runs into Katie Holmes, his old love, for the first time in years in his guise of drunk playboy Bruce Wayne and you can just feel how much he wants to explain himself, but is hampered by his secret identity. Or a scene where Alfred (Michael Caine) tries to comfort Bruce Wayne as a young kid after his parent's deaths. The actors and actress were very good at relaying their character's inner lives with the lost art of close ups and the director's use of reaction shots. The other great thing that Bale does in this film is make Batman scary for the first time. Of course, if you know Bale's work from American Psycho you know he can play the unhinged really well as he murdered people to theses on Huey Lewis and Whitney Houston and here he seems tough as nails and unforgiving but his Batman never slips to murder as a means to an end. As for the look of the film, it was very similar to the first Batman and Blade Runner, but I guess there hasn't been much advancement in the field of set design when it comes to slightly futuristic cities in decline. Batman Begins feels more like a film from the 40s or 50s when movies truly mattered and is the better for it.

1572851,5,B00005JNJV,"You'll find many concise summaries of the film's details on this site, so I won't repeat them; what I will say is, FIVE STARS JUST FOR THE EDITING!  Director Nolan and his team have adopted a swift-as-thought, ""through-composed"" style of editing that skips and leaps like a mountain goat, in quick lightning-flashes from one thought to another, often as if in a dream... which is highly appropriate to the tone of the film they made. It's a joy to watch.  Bravo.

The movie has tons of things to recommend it (and it's got a superb turn from the always-welcome MICHAEL CAINE!).  The filmmakers have made many sharp choices that cause it to stand out boldly from the normal run of big-budget concept/action movies (their story structuring, production design, casting choices: all are admirably unusual, but not weird -- which when taken all-together creates an environment of freshness and unpredictability: a tough feat when you consider how well-worn the story is!) By the last reel, the movie starts to sag under the sheer weight of all the plot points that need resolution, and this is when it's at its least fresh; but no matter.  It's a wonder anybody could take a hot, high-stakes property like this, and manage to make it new.  (Personally I think it's the only truly good Batman movie -- never really thought even the Tim Burton original mined the richness of the material properly.)

But at the end of the day, it's all about the editing, man.  Check out that amazing editing.  Study it.  Live it.  Love it.",1130025600,2,1516,4.7701149425287355
1572852,4,B00005JNJV,"Not at all being one for the comic book fantasies that continue to flood the screens and gobble the dollars, camouflage weak scripts with tacky overblown computer graphics, introduce bizarre meanies and barely clothed wonder women, etc, I approached this BATMAN BEGINS with a big bag of prejudices.  And in no time at all that bag of unjustified prejudices began to fill with applause for a truly fine film that carries style, wit, character, and enough dazzle to please everyone.  This is a surprising good movie!

It takes courage to move a larger than life fantasy hero into the realm of humans who through reasons of their own feel the need to become superheroes to the down and outers of the world. Watching the early life of Batman as produced and trained and stimulated by believable characters makes the non-believer want to return to the earlier forays into the genre.  So very much of the success of this film lies in the hands of a brilliant cast: Christian Bale (once again a hunk after his pathetically shriveled body in 'The Machinist'), Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Linus Roache, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and yes, even Katie Holmes (!) all master the tightrope of parody, serious drama, and comedy.  The costumes and cinematography are exciting and the direction by Christopher Nolan is pitch perfect.

It is good to have a dusty old bag of prejudices fall apart.  Maybe there will be more action hero movies that take themselves seriously as an art form!  Grady Harp, October 05",1129939200,3,1527,4.8687258687258685
1572853,5,B00005JNJV,"As a long time Batman fan (I do use a Batman Comforter), I think that this Batman movie is the best of the lot.  While all are fun this one seemed to capture the dark charm of Batman so much better then the others.  You get to see Bruce Wayne before Batman and really see that Batman over any other superhero is really just a man trying to make the world a safer place.  Now, that I've got that out of my system let me just say that Christian Bale was great.  The whole movie had fantastic casting.  Katie Holmes wasn't very believable as a strong district atorney and really didn't hold up that well against Bale on the screen.  I believe that the moive is interesting enough that even people who are watching the movie simply because it is Batman will love it too.",1129939200,3,766,4.248275862068965
1572854,5,B00005JNJV,"Finally someone got it right...after the last couple of outings, I seriously thought the Batman franchise was beyond repair, but then Hollywood is a land of re-invention, and, in the right hands, miracles do happen...yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus..well, two of them, and their names are Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, the director and writer, respectively, of Batman Begins (2005).  Written by David S. Goyer (Blade, Ghost Rider, The Flash) and directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia), the film stars Christian Bale (Swing Kids, American Psycho, Reign of Fire) as billionaire playboy/dark knight protectorate of Gotham City.  Also appearing is Michael Caine (Miss Congeniality, Austin Powers in Goldmember), Liam Neeson (Schindler's List, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace), Katie Holmes (""Dawson's Creek"", Teaching Mrs. Tingle), Gary Oldman (True Romance, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later..., Red Eye), Tom Wilkinson (The Patriot, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), Rutger Hauer (Nighthawks, The Hitcher), and Morgan Freeman (Unforgiven, The Shawshank Redemption, Se7en).

As the film begins we see Bale, who we later learn is Bruce Wayne, in an Asian prison camp, and he's not getting along with some of the local boys (Wayne's got the moves).  After and incident, he's thrown into solitary confinement, visited by a man named Ducard (Neeson) who offers to help Bruce find meaning in his existence, along with a path for his life.  From here the film bounces back and forth illustrating how Bruce came to this place, specific events including an episode with Bruce and some bats, and a tragedy involving his parents, one which fosters an overwhelming sense of guilt, along with a desire for revenge, in young master Wayne.  Bruce is freed from the prison and takes Ducard up on his offer, training in the ways of martial arts in a secluded temple atop a treacherous mountain.  After mastering a great many skills (and coming to terms with his own fears), Bruce has a falling out with the group (philosophical differences), and returns to Gotham only to find the city has slid into a serious state of decay, primarily due to rampant corruption and apathy.  There are a few who still hold onto hope, like Sergeant Jim Gordon (Oldman) and long time friend/D.A. assistant Rachel Dawes (Holmes), but idealism is fading fast...Bruce, determined to make a difference, creates a persona, one which will strike fear into the hearts of those who prey on the weak, and so is born...The Batman!  As he ventures into the festering, crime ridden bowels of the city, plots unfold, and evil arises in the form the Scarecrow, but he is a relatively minor player in terms of the true danger that looms in the darkness, one that threatens to destroy the entire city itself.

After watching this film, I couldn't decide if I liked it so much because it was just a great movie, or if it was due to the fact that it was so much better than the last few Batman movies, but then I realized it was a combination of both.  Thankfully Nolan and Goyer recognized the state of disrepair the franchise was in and smartly avoided tying themselves to that which came before.  Much like Sam Raimi did with Spider-Man, here we see a real understanding of the importance of aligning the film to that from which it came, the comic book (graphic novel, if you prefer), and focusing on adapting to the screen the essence of the characters, rather than trying to `fix what ain't broken'.  There's a reason why some of these comic book characters have endured as long as they have, and fans don't appreciate someone coming along and monkeying around with the formula.  The first half of the movie focuses on the background of Bruce Wayne, and how he finally came to donning the suit.  This may seem like a good deal of time, but it worked for me in terms of fleshing out the characters, and detailing the motivations extremely well.  I felt this was time well spent, and an investment that paid off later on...it is true Bale doesn't don the suit until about an hour in, and a great deal of the action is in the back end, but there's enough up front to keep things moving along at a strong pace.  One aspect I found particularly interesting was the involvement of the character of Alfred in the story, played by Caine.  He was a much more interesting character than in the past, as in prior films he seemed more of just another set piece.  Here, he provides a sort of anchor for Bruce, one that doesn't let him slip off into the deep end of his alternate persona.  I thought Bale did really well in his role, backed up by a very strong cast.  I thought Murphy was excellent as the Scarecrow, exhibiting a quiet quirkiness one would expect from such an odd villain, but never going over the top, which would have felt out of place here, but not in the previous films.  I would have liked to seen a little more of his character, but I guess it was better to leave one wanting more than to get too much.  Also, I thought Oldman also did very well, bringing to life the character of Jim Gordon, the one, truly honest cop in a force besieged with corruption.  I'm always amazed to which the levels Oldman goes to put himself within a character, especially here given the limited amount of screen time he had...I thought most everything on this film was done really well, from the sets, location shots, the overall feel, the strength of the characters, the writing, the pacing, the action, the stunt work, the gritty atmosphere, progression of the storyline, casting, effects...I really dug on that Bat Tank, especially during the exciting chase sequence with the police...you will believe a Bat Tank can fly...and we finally get to see where Batman gets those wonderful toys from...all in all I have to say Nolan and Goyer did an excellent job in bring the characters to life, and I hope the next film continues on the same track.  Is this the birth of a new franchise?  If the quality, excitement, and fun here are present in future projects, then I hope so...

I won't go into all the details about the extensive amount of extras available in the two-disc deluxe edition (which is the one I got), as the Amazon website does a great job of that, but I will say there's enough here to choke a stable of horses.  As of now, there are three, different releases, a single disc widescreen, a single disc fullscreen, and a double disc widescreen, the last version obviously featuring all the goodies.  If you don't dig on special features, then I'd recommend one of the slightly less expensive versions.

Thinking back, I can remember how fun that film actually was to watch, so I thought that this one would offer up some of the same action packed material that the other ones did....WRONG!!

This story does deliver what the title says, Batman Begins...which shows us exactly how the Batman character came to life. Other than a few fight scenes, this movie is more of a dialouge film than anything...is this for kids??? Yeah, the comatose ones...if you have a child that is into action, and just plain out fun like the other Batman's had to offer, then this one is not for them.

1572958,5,B00005JNJV,"As for comparisons, Tim Burton's 'Batman' (1989) and 'Batman Returns' (1992) was a tribute to the best parts of the franchise.  If it is superior to this film in any way, it is the style of Tim Burton, keeping you consciously grounded in a comic-book-reality (e.g., the Joker's pistol with a 4-foot long barrel taking down the Batwing), while never taking off the dark edge off the heroes (which was Schumacher's sin).  Put simply, Burton's Batman installments were fun.

Similiarly, 'Batman Begins' (2005) keeps the darker edge of Burton's interpretation (including a suspicously similar looking costum), but that is where the similarities end.  This film has a much larger palette (beyond the world of Gotham), based more in a semi-real world (as was the case with 'Superman' (1978)) and indicative of a much deeper psychology within the nature of the title character.  The heroes and villians are painted in much greyer shades, and the title character's motive of simple revenge is dispensed with early in the film for headier explorations.  Batman is a very literary figure - a metaphor for the exploration of the connection between the id (fear, violence, revenge) and the superego (justice, family obligations).

Whether you like Burton's interpretation or this interpretation will depend on your own vision of this icon.  As films, both have excellent casts and both are worthy of 5 stars, even if for very different reasons.

The two-disc expanded version was released on the same day as the two-disc expanded versions of 'Batman', 'Batman Returns', and Schumacher's two installments and is loaded with the extras you come to expect from great DVDs (with the exception of deleted scenes).",1129939200,3,1696,5.138181818181818

Former films describe the tragedy of his parent's death then jump to his adult crime-fighting career.  Most Batman fans know he received special Ninja training during those missing years.  This film fills in the gaps and fits nicely with the films that have gone on before.  This is one of the better Batman films.  I wonder where they will go from here?  Will they continue to blaze new trails or settle for telling the old story in new ways?",1129939200,,593,4.547169811320755
1572960,4,B00005JNJV,"Having seen all the previous Batman's I was hesitant to watch yet another Batman but, to my surprise I found myself quite taken with this movie's approach. Batman Begins, takes you behind the scene of Bruce wayne's animosity towards the criminal mind and therefore gives clarity on the way he becomes Batman. Bruce's journey to self discovery was quite believable  embarcking the taste of desperate while learning the patterns of criminals. What I really enjoyed about the movie was watching Bruce Wayne's metamorphis into Batman. The director took great care in showing the audience the difference between Bruce Wayne the man and Batman the Ideal. An unforseen twist takes place when Bruce is confronted by a man who becomes his teacher. Bruce learns the art of ninja as he confronts the demons of his past.

Out of all the Batmans I have to say Christian Bale takes the prize! He is completely comfortable with the role of Batman and at home in his mansion at Wayne's mannor. Christian has a natural chemestry with his butler and loyal employee Morgan Freeman. Of Course Gary Oldman does a perfect job as Officer Gordan. All in all the cast was well organized and perfectly matched! I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this movie and recommend this to any super hero, comic fan who enjoys the history of his heros as much as the adventures.",1129939200,,1353,4.802575107296137
1572961,4,B00005JNJV,"It is great to finally see Hollywood stay pretty close to the actual darkness and storyline of a character as he was originally written.

The Batman of the 1930-1940s was not the campy characters often seen in the 1960-1970s TV series.

There are a few moments of humor in this movie, but not the usual comic farse Hollywood seems to throw into everything they make these days.

This Batman is about as close to authentic as we can probably ever expect from any major studio.

True, there are some minor complaints and areas where the film could have been improved upon, but this would be nitpicking.

The one MAJOR NEGATIVE in this film is Katie Holmes !!!

Ugghhh.... what terrible casting.

It is hard to imagine how the Casting Dept chose her for this role.

Her screen presence is bad, she does not fit the role, her acting is below par compared to other actors on the screen and there is ZERO chemistry between her and Christian Bale.

An actress like a Naomi Watts or Kate Beckinsale would have been much better in that role !",1129939200,3,1033,4.510752688172043

Christopher Nolan's direction keeps the focus on the dark side of Bruce Wayne's life and he also has as keen eye for visuals and action scenes.  Although the film is necessarily slow in its initial scenes, due to expository reasons, that doesn't keep it from being engrossing and mesmerizing.  Christian Bale who looked so awful in THE MACHINIST is now looking fit and capable in his role as Wayne/Batman.  Bale brings the inner guilt and frustration with the death of his parents, and also his dedication to bringing justice to the ever corruptable Gotham.  Katie Holmes is surprisingly good as Rachel, the dedicated DA assistant also out to bring justice to the corrupt city.  Michael Caine is the perfect Alfred, showing a fatherly side to his butler role; Liam Neeson is sinister in his role as Batman's mentor/nemesis; Gary Oldman does a good job as Commissioner Gordon; Cillian Murphy is effectively evil as the Scarecrow; and Morgan Freeman seems to be having a good time as Batman's munitions expert.

1572963,1,B00005JNJV,"The movie is amazing and worth the price. This is one of the best movies of 2005. Disc 1 is the movie, the 2005 MTV movie awards intro spoof and a trailer.

The menu system is a series of comic panels that has only one feature per screen and you can't tell what you are looking at with out actually starting the feature, most of the time anyway.

1573044,5,B00005JNJV,"People who have seen the previous Batman movies and still have the gumption to say they don't like this one apparently have a fetish for anatomically-correct Batsuits, gaudy Mardi-Gras Batmobiles, and villains so excruciatingly over-the-top and utterly fixated on 'Peabody & Sherman'-caliber puns that they make Cesar Romero look like a Nobel Prize winner for painting over his mustache to play the Joker back in 1966.  And if this be the case, then they're completely missing the point of what Batman is all about, what director Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer accomplish with ""Batman Begins"".  By keeping their source material close to heart, they give us Batman in his very best, most functional form: the Dark Knight, relentless, obsessed, unstoppable in a one-man WAR on crime where the stakes are as high as they can get.  It's what Bill Finger and Bob Kane first envisioned back in 1939 (ask any comic-book/Batman diehard what it means to 'raise the Finger' and you'll get a tale in itself).  It's what made Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" the end-all-be-all of Batman stories and comicdom's first true epic.  It's what sent moviegoers lining entire city blocks on June 23, 1989.  It's what won Paul Dini, Bruce Timm and their WB Animation team an Emmy here and there for their version of Batman.  And it's what makes ""Batman Begins"" the best Batman movie ever and one of the best superhero movies ever.
Sealing the deal is what is arguably the best cast of any Batman movie, starting with its star.  Christian Bale more than earns his wings as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, portraying the latter with appropriate ebullience and charisma, and the former with resplendent darkness and pure fright.  Only Michael Keaton came as close, but he, of course, was lacking in the physical requirements of the role, hence the rubber outfit; Val Kilmer, by contrast, LOOKED great in both parts, but his brooding Batman left Bruce Wayne a little stiff; and then, George Clooney essentially played George Clooney playing Bruce Wayne as well as George Clooney playing Bruce Wayne while wearing a Batman costume.  Bale stands head and shoulders above all of them: in one scene, his Bruce Wayne responds to a 'crisis' in a hotel restaurant with hilarious results; his Batman, however, has no compunctions against putting a corrupt cop through an horrific mid-air interrogation, dangling precariously several stories over the street below.  And - perhaps most importantly - unlike the previous Batman films, not once is that which is Batman lost in the character of Bruce Wayne; Nolan and Goyer have finally tapped the fact that unlike so many other superheroes whose true deep-down personas are really seen in their normal guises, Batman is the man beneath the mask, and Bruce Wayne is the disguise; Spider-Man may take down the bad guy, but at the end of the day he's still Peter Parker.  Bale's portrayal of the character as scripted by Nolan and Goyer gives Batman new psychological depth which few writers have been able to get away with in a film genre like this, where every other character spends half the movie in a tight form-fitting bodysuit.  That Bale carries the first hour of the film with nary a cape or cowl in sight fits into a dramatic tradition in the best of superhero films, embodied by Jeff East (dubbed by Christopher Reeve) as young Clark Kent in ""Superman"" and Tobey Maguire as a pining Peter Parker in ""Spider-Man"".
In his crusade to spare Gotham the hallucinogenic ravages of crazed Arkham Asylum director Jonathan Crane AKA the Scarecrow - played with sufficient chills by Cillian Murphy in the first genuinely creepy Batvillain role since ""Batman Returns"" - and the enigmatic ninja warlord Ra's Al Ghul - a cool-as-ice Ken Watanabe, abetted in the film's compelling first hour by Liam Neeson as the equally-mysterious Henri Ducard - the Dark Knight is aided, as always, by faithful Wayne family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine, brilliant as ever), who dutifully aids his charge in combatting the corrupt influences in Gotham City but bears increasing concerns for the welfare of both Bruce and the people he's fighting for.  His relationship with Bruce forms much of the emotional bedrock of the film.  Also assisting our hero is ousted Wayne Foundation board member Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman turning in a typically excellent performance), head of the Applied Sciences department that's been long forgotten by CEO William Earle (Rutger Hauer, acting with such oily benevolence you can practically see the dollar signs dancing in his head), thus making it the perfect place from which Bruce can appropriate his needed 'toys'; as well as not-yet-Commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman in a surprisingly likeable performance), one of the last remaining good cops in Gotham who shares Batman's discontent with a broken 'system', thus cultivating the roots of an unlikely but strong partnership; and, lastly, Katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend Rachel Dawes, now a persistent assistant DA whose quest for the truth about Crane's experiments predictably makes her a target for the mad doctor.  Holmes's character represents the one readily-apparent weakness in the film that has been suffered by every other Batmovie except ""Batman Returns"": a female lead who doesn't make any really significant contributions to the plot or development of the other characters.  Still, Holmes turns in a sufficient performance given what's required of the role, so I'm willing to let that slide.
That's not to say that the film doesn't have any other weaknesses.  Murphy is a much scarier presence without his Scarecrow mask than with it, there's a repetition of remarks and criticisms that are spat back and forth between rival characters as moments of conflict progress from the first hour to the climax, and the ""surprise"" reveal that kicks said climax into motion can be seen coming by anyone with half a brain in their head.  But fortunately none of that detracts enough from the overall story to have any significant or lasting impact by the time the end credits roll.
And then there's ""The Tumbler"".
Easily the most controversial element of the film, much was made prior to the film's release of what is surely the most unconventional version of the Batmobile ever designed (yes, even more so than those neon hippy-wagons in Joel Schumacher's Batwrecks).  The cool military functionality of its design and its impressive speed and maneuverability might have been greatly diminished had this Batmovie been filmed primarily on soundstages like those before it.  But that is where the beauty of the film's cinematography pays off in the second hour: the location shoots in Chicago afford us the opportunity to not only see the most wicked Batmobile chase sequence ever, but to see it at work in parking ranges, on freeways, and, yes, even on top of buildings.  Indeed, the decision to shoot live-action plates rather than build Gotham from the keel up in a movie studio may be one of the single greatest artistic decisions in the franchise's history; it's definitely something new to see.  And nothing we've seen so far beats seeing a ""big black tank"" barreling down a REAL interstate at 125 miles an hour with two dozen squad cars in hot pursuit.  Granted, this car will undoubtedly evolve over the course of the inevitable sequels into the Batmobile we all know and love, but it's fun to watch this ""embryonic"" Batmobile going through its initial paces (yes, even during the cheesier moments when Gordon is forced to take the controls).
""Batman Begins"" represents what happens when a capable cast and crew commits themselves to making a believable work of entertainment while staying as true as possible to a rather fantastic source.  It tells you something when some of the best comic-book movies ever made - from ""Superman"" to ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", from ""The Rocketeer"" to ""Spider-Man"" - are the ones that don't stray too far from the original stories.  Maybe Hollywood should be paying more notice to that.  And if you want proof, then ""Batman Begins"" is as good a place as any for you to sit down for two hours and see the evidence for yourself.",1129852800,5,8198,5.0

Now anybody correct me if I am wrong on this stuff.  In ""Batman Begins"" Commissioner Gordon is a skinny little guy who actually drives the batmobile.  In the original Batman, Commissioner Gordon is a heavier set guy who is not even sure who Batman is when they first see him.  Also, when Bruce's parents get killed they don't mention anything about the guy saying ""Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light.""  Which is what the Joker says to his victims because we all know the Joker killed Bruce's parents.  I was dissapointed that nothing was connected there.  The last thing was the bat signal.  At the end of the first Batman is when Batman gives the signal over to Gordon.  Yet at the end of Batman begins it seems he gave them a signal which is different from the original.

1573046,5,B00005JNJV,"Finally a movie that captures the nature of the Dark Knight and makes me hope this team will continue the series in the same vein. This is a fantastic movie, which must be watched. Not only was a good script written. But Christian Bale is perfect as both Bruce Wayne and as Batman. During the parts of the movie were we watch Bruce Wayne, not once did I wonder where Batman was. He played Bruce Wayne so well...I wanted to see what Bruce would do next. And then you have a fantastic cast surrounding him. This is a winning formula.

Batman Begins takes us back to the beginning. And shows us how Bruce Wayne get the skills to be Batman. And within this story we see how he chose the symbol of the bat. The movie jumps over his youth where Alfred raises him. But takes us to the end of the trial of his parent's murderer where he his vengeance has pushed him. Bruce learns that though he is filled with anger and feels he has nothing to lose...he does. So Bruce discards his identity and travels throughout the world learning all he can about the criminal mind. For as he was told, you only fear what you do not know.

We also see the process he goes through to not only condition his body, but to learn martial arts. The disillusioned Bruce is enticed by mysterious League of Shadows who claim to fame is dispensing Justice. And it is here that Bruce learns to channel his anger and fears into his newly honed skills. Making him a true fighting machine. But he learns he cannot follow the leagues methods, for they do not only dispense justice...but also go to the extreme and become the judge and executioner as well. A line Bruce will not cross. He finally decides he needs to go home to Gotham and help stop its downward spiral into corruption. And Batman is born.

The extra material not only includes the movie's trailer, a wonderful plethora of posters, but a spoof on Batman staring Jimmy Fallon on his way to an MTV Movie Award program. The spoof is well done, fun and silly all at the same time. There is also eight short features that cover everything from the Batmobile being built, casting, Mr. Bale's conditioning, all the great work on the Bat Suit, the sets being built and what I thought was most impressive, the filming in Iceland.

The included comic book shows more of what Bruce Wayne did to prepare himself in his travels and schooling to become Batman. And it has a couple of other stories in it as well. One, which includes Harvey Dent, called The Long Halloween. All in all the deluxe set is a winner.",1129852800,3,2525,4.412017167381975

The dream has become fact in ""Batman, the beginning."" After viewing it, my first impression is, WOW! The film is a great combination of humanistic philosophy, explosive action, menacing criminals, and an excellent script with talented actors. Crafted in the mind of originator Bob Kane, his Capped Crusader rises from the panels of DC Comics and explodes onto the big screen with all the force of a true classic. As Par for the course, director Christopher Nolan has conscripted the superb performing talents of Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, and Michael Caine as Alfred.

1573048,5,B00005JNJV,"In Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, we got to see the title character onscreen and in action within the first ten minutes of the film.  However in Batman Begins, Director Christopher builds the story slowly.  We are a nearly a full hour into the 140 minute film before we see the Caped Crusader for the first time.  This would not be the only contrast in this latest, and best Batman film.  What sets this film apart from any of the previous Batman films is the depth of character development not of the Batman character, but of the Bruce Wayne character.  By the time Joel Schumacher came out with his awful ""Batman & Robin"" the character of Bruce Wayne was nearly lost among a host of heroes, villains, and campy silliness.  Credit Christopher Nolan for taking Batman and Bruce Wayne serious.

For the first time we really get a sense of what drives and motivates Bruce Wayne to become Batman.  Comic fans have known this for years but this was never conveyed with any skill or intensity in the previous films.  Here we see a man who has gone into seclusion, far from the rest of the world due to his inability to cope with his own fears and guilt over the murder of his parents years earlier.  Wayne is tutored under than hand of Ra's Ah Ghul a mysterious figure from comic lore, who trains ninjas to carry out their own brand of justice.  Wayne's difference of opinion with the oriental war lords tactics lead to a violent confrontation as Wayne escapes the mountain stronghold and returns to Gotham to find he'd been declared dead and that Gotham is infested more than ever with crime, led by organized crime boss Carmine Falcone.  Wayne is reunited with loyal butler Alfred played magnificently by Michael Caine.  Caine's Alfred is a more hands on character than we've seen in previous films, aiding Bruce in the development of the Batcave in tunnels found underneath Wayne Manor.

Wayne also is aided by Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman) the head of R & D at Wayne Industries.  Jack Nicholson asked in the first movie, ""Where does he get those wonderful toys?""  Well the answer is from Lucious Fox who developed the body army, memory fabric cape, weapons, and the new Batmobile referred to as ""The Tumbler"".  He's kind of like Batman's ""Q"", and provides some much needed detail and backstory.  I mean even stalwart comic fans have always wondered if Batman came up with all this stuff on his own.  There's a great tip of the cap to Bob Kane's original Batman origin when Wayne encounters the bats in the caves and overcomes his fears and realizes that the bat is an image that will strike fear into criminals.  It's these little touches that make this movie so good.

The rest of the supporting cast is superb, too.  Gary Oldman plays an uncharacteristic normal and good guy role as office Jim Gordon, before he would become Commissioner Gordon as the lone honest cop that Batman trusts to aid him.  This very much stays with the canon created in the Batman Year One story by Frank Miller.  Cillian Murphy of ""28 Days Later"" is Dr. Jonathan Crane, a psychiatrist in charge of Arkham Asylum who also takes on the guise of Scarecrow, using a powdered drug to induce fear and psychosis into those who breathe in the drug.  Murphy fits the gangly scarecrow character very well.

Christopher Nolan has contrasted the comic look of Schumacher and the Gothic/Art Deco look of Burton to present Gotham has a gritty, dirty, slimy cesspool, overrun by the criminal element and desperately calling out for rescue.  Lets also give kudos to the cinematography of  Simon Margetts and Wally Pfister.  The scenery was just gorgeous.  In the final summation this is really Christian Bale's movie.  He is Bruce Wayne.  He comes the closest by far, of playing the character the way he's always been depicted in comics for over 65 years.  We can only hope that Warner will continue to let this creative group continue to handle the Batman franchise.

1573049,5,B00005JNJV,"Movie franchises are cherished commodities in Hollywood, when a studio finds a series of films that works well with audiences they will fight tooth and nail to hold on and capitalize on that success.  Sometimes this tenacity proves to be the undoing of the specific franchise, because in the process of capitalizing the movie studio churns out installment after installment in the franchise, and often times loses sight of what made the franchise so great in the beginning, resulting in diminished box office numbers and the end of a franchise.  However, sometimes franchises work for long periods of time, now they may hit some bumps in the road, but after taking a break the franchise returns with renewed vigor and blows audiences away.  Examples of this trend would be the ever-popular `James Bond' series, the `Superman' franchise, `Star Wars', and `Batman'.  With each of those examples, time away has produced strong box office numbers, and even with changes made with the cast and directors involved the success remains.  Examples of franchises that suffered from over exposure and lack of story and craftsmanship are as follows: `A Nightmare on Elm Street', `Friday the 13th', and `Halloween' (note that all of the series' listed as eventual failures were horror franchises).  The focus of this review is on one of the franchises listed above that after having huge success with 4 films, though the final installment was the weakest and turned fans off for some time, took an 8 year absence from the big screen and returned in the summer of 2005 with huge critical and commercial success.  The franchise is `Batman', and the movie that put this franchise back on top, well technically it kick-started a whole new `Batman' franchise, was Christopher Nolan's expertly crafted origin tale, ""Batman Begins"".

Completely ignoring the previous 4 films from the original `Batman' franchise, ""Batman Begins"" delivers an in-depth look at the origins of the Dark Knight.  After the murder of his parents, young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) embarks on a quest to find the means to fight injustice in all forms.  This quest takes him all over the world, where he learns how to defend himself and others, become a great detective, and eventually he realizes that his time has come to return to the city that he once called home, Gotham City, and cleanse it of the evil that has corrupted it.  However, to do this he must become more than just a man, he must become a symbol.  Not just any symbol will work, it must be something that will strike fear into the hearts of men, with this realization the Batman is born.  With the aid of his trusty butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), and his business associate Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Bruce Wayne/Batman will rid Gotham City from the likes of the maniacal Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), who uses fear as his weapon, the deranged Ra's Al Ghul, and mob boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson).

After ""Batman & Robin"" caused Warner Brothers' faith in the `Batman' franchise to dwindle, it's not hard to imagine the difficulty the WB had with returning to a franchise that over the course of 4 films went from flagship franchise to non-existent.  To convince the execs at the WB to greenlight another `Batman' film required the film to have a top-notch cast, a superb director, and terrific writing.  Thankfully, all of these components were achieved, and the WB presented audiences with the best Batman movie ever, and kick-started a new `Batman' franchise.  With director Christopher Nolan's success with his sleeper hit ""Memento"" and the crime drama ""Insomnia"", there wasn't much doubt that he could handle the dramatic aspects of the character, but what worried fans was that since he had never helmed a big budget movie before, especially one featuring a character with so much history from the comics, tv, and the previous franchise that spanned from 1989 to 1997, would Christopher Nolan drop the ball in bringing the Dark Knight back to cinematic life.  Fans worries were quickly laid to rest when writer David Goyer (writer of ""The Crow: City of Angels"", ""Blade"", ""Blade 2"", and ""Blade: Trinity"") came on board to pen the screenplay with the assistance of  Christopher Nolan.  Then with A-list casting choices being made, featuring the likes of Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, and Katie Holmes, this film was definitely shaping up to be the blockbuster success that would be needed to do both Batman justice, and to begin a new franchise.

Terrific writing, acting, and directing brought Batman back from the pits of movie hell and back onto the big screen.  With ""Batman Begins"" movie audiences finally learned how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and hope that future installments will continue to build on what was started here, and a great new `Batman' franchise will begin.  Don't get me wrong, the original `Batman' franchise was terrific for the most part, but based on ""Batman Begins"", this new franchise looks to take the Dark Knight's success to even greater heights.

Secondly, I'll try to keep this short, when I went to watch this in the theater this was not the Batman movie I was expecting to see... this was something much better.

Most Sc-Fi super heroe movies are just biding thier time until the hero puts on the costumes, but this movie is watchable from begining to end. Nolan hit's all the right notes, the editing is fantastic, and Bale feels like he nails the character Bruce Wayne with precision. Bat-man is at his heart, a facist, believing the world should function as he sees it. That's why he operates outside the law. Only truly trusting one cop, who manages to help him stay balanced.

All in all the best batman movie hands down, and just a great character driven flick period. Spider-man 2 is a whiney second best after this came out.",1129852800,4,955,4.540697674418604
1573051,1,B00005JNJV,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I was largely ambivalent about the first half, and then the second half just went to the crapper (only saving part was some dignity in the last 5 minutes).  Where to begin?  The League of Shadows.  What was the deal with that??  They bring down bloated or decaying empires, yeah, nice gimmic, geez.  Why do they even seek and train Bruce Wayne, they do what they want without him anyways.  And what is with Liam Nielson knowing EVERYTHING about his environment, even about soft ice patches and falling, flaming posts, does he have ESP?  Then there is Bale, who is as stiff as a board. And his love interest, who has the face of a 12 yr. old, and the two have ZERO chemistry (there isn't even an intimate scene between them).  Compare this to Maguire and Dunst in Spiderman, who rule together.  And then there is the whole story, what a mess!  Why on earth would the toxin be mixed with the drugs, then seperated, then put in the water, but then have to be vaporized by a super whizz-bang microwaverator.  Idiotic.

And what about that clown spraying gas in the freaky mask?  First he's a lawyer, then he's a psychiatrist?  And for all the background in the first half of the movie, we really learn nothing about Bruce, except that he's scared of bats.  Big whoop. And everytime batman talks, it's so husky and deep one can hardly understand it, as he growls and shows his teeth like a dog.  What's with that?  This movie is too dark.  It steals

lines, scenes and ideas from the original batman shamelessly, but to less or zero effect.  The second half moves jumbled and confused and there is no fun nor depth nor anything of value.  When they set up a sequel in the final minutes, i could have laughed, who cares!  And the freaking action sequences, one can't see sh#%!  And all those bats flying in at the climax, whatever.

of rationality is required in the comic genre, but this movie goes from serious to ridiculous back and forth that it ends up a blended mess.

Sure, by now you know the story line, the way cool Batmobile and a great telling of what has become a classic legend, all grown up from comic books, and evolved into a sort of Greek hero figure like Hercules or Achilles.  What makes the movie great is that it makes the story great.  Really great.  One of the wonders of childhood is when you begin to understand that sometimes a story is just that and nothing more. Then something wonderful happens to that transitional imagination.  You WANT it to be true.  Remember when you used to wish that there really was a place called OZ and dreamed that you could fly(just like Superman)even though you knew better?  Think back.  That's why this is a perfect movie.  Because the vision of this movie is that there really, really COULD be a Batman. You even want there to be one.  All of the gizmos and costumes are necessary, even required.  Further they are all plausible, and made so by justifying every single part of the Batman, even the cape, as essential parts of his battle outfit.  What kid didn't run around the yard or basement donning the cape of his favorite superhero?

1573173,4,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" tries to revive the defunct Batman franchise that had become a caricature of itself under the direction of Joel Schumacher and some very bad scripts. This film is a complete departure in theme and style from the horrid ""Batman Forever"" (1995) and ""Batman and Robin"" (1997). It doesn't try to emulate the gothic visual style that director Tim Burton brought to ""Batman"" (1989) and ""Batman Returns"" (1992), but director Christopher Nolan's vision is just as dark. Whoever conceived of reviving the franchise decided wisely that the best place to start was at the beginning. So half of ""Batman Begins"" is backstory explaining how and why Bruce Wayne came to be a masked crime fighter and the origins of his preoccupation with bats.

As a child, young Bruce Wayne witnessed the murder of his billionaire parents. Consumed by guilt and anger and reluctant to step into his father's prominent shoes as an adult, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) disappears without a trace. Seven years later, he returns to find Gotham City in the grip of a crime-ridden depression brought on by corrupt government and pillaging by crime boss Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), in cahoots with a mysterious out-of-town associate. Wayne reestablishes himself as a billionaire playboy with the help of his family's loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and takes a job in Wayne Enterprises' Applied Sciences department under the brilliant inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), where he finds good use for the high-tech military gadgetry that's been sitting around collecting dust.

Christian Bale is the best Batman of the franchise. He can play a decadent playboy, a shrewd industrialist, and a brooding bat without sacrificing credibility. Bale's performance is more energetic and versatile than actors who took on the role previously. And he has more sex appeal than even George Clooney, which the female audience will appreciate. An hour of backstory might seem like too much, but several periods in Bruce Wayne's life are integrated coherently and generally well-paced. The exception is the time Wayne spends training in Asia under the tutelage of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). There is too much gibberish about conquering fear, the combat scenes are dull, and all of the film's worst lines have been dumped on Neeson. Thankfully, that sequence is intercut with other material.

It can't be easy to explain why a sane individual would fight crime dressed as a giant chiroptera, but Bruce Wayne's motivations and the origins of the bat motif are credible and interesting. ""Batman Returns"" isn't perfect, but it left me wanting to see more Batman films, and that's quite a feat considering that the franchise seemed dead and buried. Consider the Batman franchise successfully resurrected. The only bonus features on the Warner Brothers 2005 single disc DVD are a short theatrical trailer (1 minute) and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French.",1129766400,2,3005,5.191752577319588

This movie really deserves a sixth star for sending all previous versions to an early retirement and hopefully their final resting place.

Try to forget all the goofy,spoofy and fluffy batman movies of the past - this one finally tells the story the way it was intended, dark with realism so long over-due that it will have you believing in heroes again.  A must see movie that will entertain adults as well as children.  I was absolutely convinced that Christian Bale is Batman - SUPERB !

1573175,5,B00005JNJV,"I've always been a casual Batman fan at best.  I liked the 60's TV show and the later films, but found the first two way too dark for my tastes.  I had little desire to see this film until friends and family started raving about it.  I decided to give it a try.  Am I ever glad I did.

Ignoring all previous movie and TV series, this movie begins with a Bruce Wayne unsure what to do with his life.  Through flashbacks, we see his tragic childhood including his parent's murder.  Back in the present, Bruce begins a quest to deal with his inner demons.  Ultimate, it leads him to return to Gotham City in his dual roll.  And it's just in time.  Corruption and crime have overtaken the city, with the Scarecrow leading the pack.  Can this rookie vigilante deal with the menace?

I think what impressed me with the movie was the back story.  For once I finally understood why a millionaire would risk life and limb like Bruce does on a regular basis.  For a superhero movie, the story is slow, especially in the set up.  But it really feels more like a drama then a superhero movie, so it really works well.  And there are plenty of action scenes, not to mention a climax that is intense enough to make up for the earlier aspects of the movie.

Ultimately, I walked away from this film feeling very satisfied.  This is a movie everyone can enjoy whether they are a die hard Batman fan or not.",1129680000,,1390,4.301158301158301
1573176,5,B00005JNJV,"I knew this movie was being made long before its trailer hit theaters. Not knowing who the cast, writer and director would be, I was very afraid of a repeat attempt at the kind of Batman that 1997's ""Batman & Robin"" punished us with. As soon as more info came in and I eventually saw the film. I couldn't believe it. Not only is this a dramatic improvement over the last Batman film, its arguably the best comic book-adaptation film ever made. Being treated like a credible film, you sometimes get the impression you are watching a creepy, gripping psychological drama rather than just a comic-film. Rather than its special effects, stunts, or over-the-top music that drives it; this is helmed by a superior cast and a great script to match. Not to mention the perfect portrayal of the story by director Chris Nolan. Christian Bale simply IS BATMAN! This is Batman the way that Bob Kane originally intended. It is the most exciting, dramatic and emotionally gripping of any of the more recent comic book films, certainly of all of the Batman movies. If you must judge what the Batman character was really meant to be from a movie, make it this one! I'm sure glad I've all the other films first, or this one would make them look like a let-down. DO NOT RENT IT! BUY IT! By, the way, the special features will keep you up watching for hours also.

Christian Bale's version of Batman is very intimidating! I remember watching this film originally in the theater and being scared to death for the guys he interrogated! The villians (Scarecrow/Ra's Al Guhl) were smartly handled well. Rachel, played by Katie Holmes, isn't eye-candy like the previous leading Bat-women. She actually has spunk and guts.

Overall, all the characters in this film are very believable. For those that still want an ""Adam West"" type Batman, please rent the old 1960's film or 1997's ""Batman & Robin"" by Joel Schumacher!

1573315,5,B00005JNJV,"When Joel Schumacher destroyed the other Batman series, the best thing to do is start over aagain and make it better. Batman Begins is definitley the best Batman film, the best film of the year and it's definitley a masterpiece.

After being the Batman champion for 16 years, Christian Bale has took that title away from Michael Keaton. Don't get me wrong, Michael Keaton is still a great Batman, but Bale was a greater Batman and a greater Bruce Wayne.

I love how the film starts where Bruce Wayne {Bale} meets a man name Ducard {Neeson}who will teach him to become a warrior. I also like how they show his past, where he finds the batcave that's under Wayne Manor, how his parents were murdered and the pain it's causing him. It's very close to the comic, only difference is that he never had a childhood friend name Rachael.

Anyway, after he is trained by Ducard, Ra's Al Ghul {Watanabe} wanted Bruce to kill a man, but Bruce refuses. And now, a feud starts and Bruce leaves and heads back to Gotham City. Only to see that crime is getting bigger.

One thing I love about this film is that it shows a very good relationship between Bruce and Alfred {Caine}, like it shows how much of a father figure he is. Also, the relationship between Batman and Jim Gordan {Oldman}, which you really didn't see in the other Batman films. How Lucius Fox {Freeman} shows him all the new technology he needs to become Batman. Cillian Murphy brings out a brilliant performance as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow and Katie Holmes was a good additional character to this film.

Some people say that this film is too talky. It's called Batman Begins, you're not gonna see any action until you see how it all began.

This 2-disc DVD edition with cool features is perfect for all Batman fans. It's definitley worth every penny and you won't be disappointent.",1129680000,,1834,4.610429447852761

1573317,3,B00005JNJV,"This is a great film and the distributors of the DVD have only half done it justice with their deluxe packaging.  The comic book extras are nice (and a bargain).  The content of the second disc is--I suppose--really interesting.  The problem is the horrible menu for it: baffling, frustrating, and completely opaque as to how it should be used.  This is hard to explain.  But since it will end up selling a ton of units, interested buyers will just have to wait to see what all of the complaining is about.  Myself, I ended up testing the limits of my remote control, until I did something irrevocable with my DVD/VCR settings and ended up being able to play nothing.  Very annoying since I like a lot of electronics users know nothing about things like ""progressive scanning"" (the crux of my SNAFU).  I never knew how complex and problematic DVD playing could be until somehow I'd stumbled across this feature and screwed it up, all because I mashed every button on my remote desoerately trying to undo a function I never knew existed.  Let's just say I went out and excitedly bought the deluxe set, brought it home, and spent hours trying to figure out the idiotic menu--at the end of which time I smashed my player with my fists and threw it down the concrete stairs of my apartment building's basement.  I went out and paid for a new player and paid another hundred dollars to have it installed by professionals who know all about the hook-ups.  I'm probably the only one who will have had this extreme a problem with this DVD set, but who knows where the frustration of its usage will lead others?  I ended up spending 250 dollars instead of 30!

Even though I prefer the first slightly better, this movie comes a very close second. The tone of the film is serious but not too serious. The film has it's dark moments but it is nowhere near as dark as ""Returns."" It's awesome to see Bruce evolve into the Batman right before our eyes and finally establish himself as the saviour of gotham. Can't wait to see the next movie with The Joker. Let the new Bat-Era begin!!",1129593600,,535,4.306930693069307
1573319,5,B00005JNJV,"One thing that's quite interesting when it comes down to the comic book heroes of old are that regardless of what's in the comic which should be the final be-all end-all of the events surrounding the characters, filmmakers and TV show creators will come in and completely add new twists or reinvent the character. Before we had 4 Batman films, 2 of which from Tim Burton, big on atmosphere and tone but not masterpieces by any means, just really well done Batman films. Then we got the Schumacher ones, with Forever being an interesting mess and Batman and Robin being film school for how NOT to do a movie, let alone a Batman one. So we have a re-imagining by Christopher Nolan, director of Memento and we're better for it.

Previous films already established Bruce Wayne already being Batman with slight reasons why he became Batman, like in the Schumacher ones. Here, Bruce Wayne is a lost soul who's in a asian prison who's freed by a man named Ducard, who offers a path and help. Bruce begins his training to be a fighter for the innocent until the group he's training with are actually wanting to destroy civilization so Bruce takes off to Gotham to clean it up.

And Gotham really needs to get cleaned up. Many of city officials are under the influence of mob boss Falcone, so Bruce has a lot to deal with. This includes a man who's taken over his parent's company; Dr Crane, a psychologist who induces a fear toxin into patients to make them nuts and corruption. So Bruce adopts his famous alter-ego, Batman, and together with a Q-like Wayne Enterprises employee and butler Alfred, Bruce is ready to fight for Gotham.

Since it is a re-imagining, a lot of things are different. First, I don't recall Wayne Manor ever...um, well it's a spoiler but it's bad. Second, Bruce always built his Batman stuff rather than the Q-like Lucius Fox. And of course we have the re-designed Batmobile. Instead of being like a slick lambourghini, this Batmobile actually looks like a superhero's beastly car. Named the Tumbler, it looks like a cross between a lambourghini, a ferrari and a hummer; fast but still very strong looking. And of course the featurette on it on Disc 2 is really awesome.

Of the previous Batman's, Christian Bale is probably the only one that actually nails both halves of the character, maybe less so on one. To me, Michael Keaton had the Batman part down, only not the Bruce Wayne part while both Val Kilmer and George Clooney had the opposite. Christian Bale does have that millionaire-playboy-but-tortured aspect but maybe not his loneliness. His ""Batman"" voice is ok but one scene where he questions a police officer seems really forced. As for the rest of the cast there's one weak link: the other half of TomKat, Katie Holmes. First, her character is a bit useless, existing only for a love interest figure. Second, not exactly the greatest range and she's got buggy eyes and that crooked smile thing bugs me.

Only Superman, the first 2 Batman's and the Spiderman films, this one's probably one of the better comic book adaptations. Here's hoping it's inevitable sequels are just as good. BTW, if you're only into the film there's a movie only version out(there's a theatrical trailer, big whoop), then there's the Deluxe Edition featuring all the goodies. Here's hoping they don't double dip this. But for now, get the Deluxe one.",1129593600,2,3356,4.739726027397261
1573320,5,B00005JNJV,"While watching this film in IMAX this summer, I noticed a couple of things about Batman Begins: The smartest move Hollywood has made in years; they dumped Joel Schumacher and his campy film tricks out the nearest window, got a REAL actor to play Batman (rent Equilibrium after watching this film); and used a great screenplay that told a STORY.

Heck, even the Scarecrow is really scary in the film. It makes me wonder what could now be done with the Riddler and Two-Face if the two screen writers, Goyer and Nolan, decided to re-make the last two awful Batman films.

I don't blame you if you are doubting the quality of this film, I walked out of the last one (what a waste of THREE good Batman villians). Trust me, this one is great.

The Burton film was rife with inconsistencies in relation to the true origin of Batman. The Joker did not kill Bruce Wayne's parents. Commissioner Gordon did play a crucial role in Batman's development.

Batman Begins is the truest version of the Batman legend and is not meant to be considered as a part of the previous films canon. It is the beginning of a whole new telling of the story.",1129593600,5,635,4.610619469026549
1573322,5,B00005JNJV,"While ""Batman Begins"" is probably the best Batman movie I have seen to date (even compared to both of Tim Burtons Masterpieces), I find that many reviews on here are about the movie and not the DVD itself. The movie review is important, yes... but I'm sure people out there would like to know if it is really worth getting the Deluxe edition of the DVD as opposed to the movie alone.

If you are as interested in the Batman lineage as I am, the Deluxe edition DVD is sure to satisfy your pallette for now... at least untill the inevetible sequel comes out. Included with the Deluxe edition of this dVD is a comic book that has some rather haunting graphics and a decently chilling story line. I have not yet watched all of the special features of this DVD, but I've sat through some of them. As of yet, there are no deleted scenes that I know of (which I'd like to have seen if there were any) but there are plenty of mini documentaries that discuss various aspects of the film. For anyone who wants to know more about the weapons, new batsuit, or the Tumbler (the wicked new spin on the Bat Mobile) will deffinately get a kick out of these features. The subtle gem of the special features is the ""Tankman Begins"" skit performed by Jimmy Fallon as a prequisite to the MTV movie awards. It is pretty hilarious and reminds me of the famous Oscar Skit Billy Crystal put together back in the day.

The movie itself is great. It has the origon of Batman drawn out as he matures from playboy millionaire to dual faced superhero. His journey starts with his dread of bats and it is his fear that drives the plot of this film. Fear is actually the main villain... under the guise of Scare Crow and Rahs Al Ghoul (spelling... lol) and it is powerful as it spreads like wildfire and causes a chain of events that would be devastating without Batman to save the day. This Batman is darker and while there is humor, it is more of the dry variety with crisp one liners and a couple of in-your-face moments. I personnaly feel that this movie captures the essence of Batman while its predessecors were to bright or cheerful... funny and abstract... or in the case of Batman and Robin... over the top fun. I am highly interested to see if Robin will be brought into the picture as well as Batgirl... but not in the silly way it transpired with afforementioned film. As for Christian Bale... well... he is now the face of Batman and he is the perfect fit. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, and Katie Holmes all offer decent supporting roles but it is Cillian Murphy (Scare Crow) that outshines them all. He is creepy and villaneous... not at all a nice guy under the disguise of a nice guy. When he goes bad... he gets ugly fast. But, what made this a great batman outing was that the focus on the bad guys was slight... they were merely there to show what extent Batman would go to to protect the innocent. They all accentuated his story and furthered his character development.

The sound is great with surround sound... the bat scenes are loud and all over the place which could be a little creepy in a dark room. The picture quality... outstanding. And if youa re a fan... the Deluxe Edition is a must have... if you just liked the movie and are not to interested in all the extra stuff... save yourself 5-9 dollars and buy the regular edition. The movie alone delivers the goods... the Deluxe Edition gives that extra bang for your buck.",1129593600,5,3448,4.426771653543307
1573323,5,B00005JNJV,"The fact that it took eight years for a new Batman film to be released illustrates how freaked out the studio was over the commercial and critical failure of Batman and Robin. Warner Brothers gave the franchise a much needed rest while they quietly looked for someone to reboot it. At first, it looked like Darren Aronofsky and Frank Miller might be the ones but the studio didn't like their vision. Then came screenwriter David S. Goyer and up-and-coming director Christopher Nolan who decided to return the Dark Knight back to his roots. They wanted to explore what motivated Bruce Wayne to dress up like a giant bat and wage war on the criminals of Gotham City. By all accounts, their effort, fittingly entitled Batman Begins, was a resounding success. The critics loved it and audiences flocked to the theatres to see it. So, what did they do right?

The casting. While anyone can disappear into the bat suit and look scary it's playing Bruce Wayne that is the real challenge. To date, only Michael Keaton has pulled it off because he brought a complexity to the role. Christian Bale, who has proven that he's got considerable acting chops with an impressive resume, perfectly captures the essence of the tortured billionaire. Also gone are the obvious casting of marquee names like Jim Carrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger in favour of reliable character actors like Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and Rutger Hauer. They bring sincerity and just the right amount of believability to their roles. The only weak bit of casting is Katie Holmes who is utterly forgettable as the token damsel in distress.

The story. Goyer and Nolan remain true to the spirit of Batman's origins as depicted by Bob Kane and Bill Finger (with a dash of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One), right down to how Bruce's parents are killed and how this torments him throughout his life.

The tone. The campiness of the Joel Schumacher films is gone, replaced by a darker, brooding vibe. Nolan brings an art house sensibility to a big budget superhero film which gives it more substance. He treats the source material with the respect that it deserves.

This is the best Batman film to date. It even surpasses Tim Burton's first one. While he certainly got the look of Batman's world and even understood the character's tortured psyche, he injected moments of silliness that took one out of the film (i.e. the Joker shooting down Batman's plane with a handgun?!). Nolan does not make this same mistake and he has created an excellent comic book adaptation that deserves to be ranked with other superior examples of the genre.

The first disc features spoof of the movie called ""Tankman Begins"" that Jimmy Fallon did for the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. It basically inserts Fallon and Andy Dick into the movie at certain key points.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

The second disc starts off with ""The Journey Begins,"" which looks at Nolan's vision for Batman. He wanted to depict his world realistically and talks about working with co-screenwriter Goyer who in turn talks about what he wanted to do with the character.

""Cape and Cowl"" is a featurette on the Batman costume and how Nolan and his team tweaked the traditional design to resemble a combat outfit. We are given insight into the process of how it was made.

""Gotham City Rises"" takes a look at the creation of Gotham City and the Batcave. The visual effects techies show us how they achieved the dense, complex cityscape through CGI, models and actual, elaborately constructed sets.

""Path to Discovery"" explores Bruce Wayne before he became Batman. Nolan and Goyer built his backstory up in an attempt to get the audience to emotionally invest in the character.

""Shaping Mind and Body"" takes a look at Bale's preparation for the role. Nolan wanted to get away from The Matrix-style wire-work for a more, visceral style. Bale had to learn a martial arts hybrid known as Keysi and did all of his own fight scenes.

""Genesis of the Bat."" Nolan wanted to stick close to Batman's origins in the comic book and fill in the gaps that the comics had created. Nolan and Goyer worked closely with DC Comics for source material, including ""The Long Halloween,"" `70s era Dark Knight material by Denny O'Neil and Neil Adams, and Frank Miller's Batman: Year One.

There is also a gallery of various movie poster designs from all over the world that feature some really cool looking takes on how to advertise this new take on the Batman mythos.

""Tumbler"" focuses on the designing and constructing of the film's Batmobile. Nolan worked on it while writing the screenplay. We also see it being tested and built.

""Saving Gotham City"" takes a look at the exciting monorail chase scene that takes place during the climatic part of the movie. Not surprisingly, it was done with a mix of CGI, practical stuntwork and miniatures.

Finally, there is a 72-page mini-comic book that includes three stories that inspired Goyer and Nolan's screenplay.",1129593600,6,4961,4.8325471698113205
1573324,5,B00005JNJV,"I've been reading a lot of reviews for Batman Begins here, and a lot of comparisons have been made between Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and this new one. The director who scores the most points depends on whose review you're reading. For many years different artists and storytellers have offered their interpretations of the caped crusader, and I think people have forgotten that Burton's Batman was released in 1989, 16 years ago; a different Batman for a different time.

Keaton's version of Batman was intimidating, and got the job done, but he wasn't the strike-fear-into-the-hearts-of-criminals kind of superhuman that batman really is--- speaking in that low growling voice, like Clint Eastwood, with a touch of psychopathic brio. He never really fit, though he wasn't bad. I think that was Tim Burton twisting things the way he likes to. Like making Jonny Dep Willy Wonka, which is a different complaint I won't digress into. Batman was a great movie by itself, and it was also the artistic vision of Tim Burton which gives it a flavor no one can match it because it has his quirky genius threaded into it.

Batman Begins *feels* like a truer version Batman, because the other Batman films touched on his origin, but only gave us snippets--- scratching the surface, but never digging deeper. One thing about the old franchise was the comic book feel (especially after Joel Schumacher took over). Superman could come flying in to help, and no one would be surprised. But Batman Begins takes a more realistic approach, and shows you the vulnerable side of Bruce Wayne, and what really motivates him, makes him tic and explains how and why there is a Batman.

Batman seems more like Batman, and Alfred is a lot more than just the faithful butler who knows his secrets, we understand (the future police Chief) Gordon's motives, and this film is about the hero and not the multi-million dollar megastar villains. It is down-to-earth and believable--- something only Tim Burton's first two Batman films can compete with, even though there was more focus on the bad guys.

And Batman Begins had all the right people in all the right roles. When I heard Christian Bale was to be Batman I remembered how great he was in American Psycho, and I knew he had it in him. Who could prove to be a more loving a loyal Alfred than Michael Caine? Who could have been a more believable Ducard/Ras Al Ghul than Liam Neeson, if one guy knows how to be a sensei/mentor it's him. He taught Obi Wan, didn't he? Gary Oldman is perfect in everything. Katie Holmes was the beautiful girl-next door, not glamorous and not a damsel in distress screaming from one end of the movie to the other, like our gorgeous Vicky Vale was. You tell me who Bruce Wayne would be likelier to fall in love with. The presence of Morgan Freeman and even Rutger Hauer make this ensemble cast exactly what the Batman Franchise needed.

Some reviewers make a good point about how fear is the theme of Batman Begins, and it's all about facing down fear, controlling it and using it. Maybe they could have roped in the fear angle a little. However, it showed me what I didn't truly understand until Batman Begins--- that the Batman's best device for getting justice was turning fear on people who use fear; for ordinary citizens to see that they have someone on their side that scares the bad guys gives them strength to stand against it, and when its all said and done Gotham will be able to take care of itself and I understand Batman's purpose. So thanks to Christopher Nolan for revitalizing a dying franchise, and here's to more Batman films like this one.

Wow... This wasn't much of a review... It's more like an essay on Batman, but I hope it helped someone.",1129593600,6,3714,4.688650306748467
1573405,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman is more than a superhero, more than movie and comic book entertainment.  He is cold, disciplined justice that protects the weak - yet is tragically flawed.  He is the dark part of the subconcious that lurks in all of us.  Batman represents the border between sanity and insanity.

Batman is more than a cultural icon.  He is a legend and a myth.  Why else is New York City often referred to as ""Gotham?""  In the astounding Batman Begins, the myth is reborn.

Christian Bale is perfect to play Bruce Wayne, the billionaire who is orphaned when a mugger kills his mother and father in cold blood.  When I saw Bale in ""Equilibrium,"" his tiger-like athleticism and dark, brooding demeanor made me confident that Bale was worthy to inherit the mantle of Batman.  For those of you who liked the Matrix, I highly recommend you check out Equilibrium.

In ""Begins,"" director Christopher Nolan (Memento) and screenplay co-writer David Goyer explore how Wayne adopts his alter ego.  On a Siddartha-like quest, Wayne leaves his friends and business empire to find himself in the (Very) Far East.

The talent in this movie is astounding.  Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) plays enigmatic Ras-Al-Ghul, powerful head of a spiritual, ninja-like clan.  Liam Neesan plays Henri Ducard, Ghul's head man, who trains Bruce in the ways of the night fighter.  Wayne is a proficient student.  All of Neeson's dialouge is highly quotable and inspiring.  I can't wait to get my hands on a screenplay.

Wayne returns to Gotham City.  His childhood friend, played by Katie Holmes, knows something is up.  She is now a relentless D.A. bent on eliminating the corruption that is plaguing the city that was once fair in the heyday of Bruce's parents.  Her target is Arkham Asylum, run by the enigmatic Professor Jonathan Crane (played by the amazing Cillian Murphy).

The Wayne's family butler Alfred is played by Michael Caine.  Wayne scientist Lucius Fox is played by Morgan Freeman.  Alfred and Fox are Bruce's only allies in his war on crime.  A younger Police Commissioner Gordon is played to perfection by the chameleon-like Gary Oldman.

1573408,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman fans have been waiting a long time for a really awesome Batman movie, and well, the wait is finally over. Seven years after the franchise was nearly ruined by Joel Schumacher's attempt to make Batman ""family friendly"", ace director Christopher Nolan along with comic-nerd screenwiter David S. Goyer wipe the slate clean and go back to the drawing board. What they've come up with is a brilliant comic book movie. Batman Begins is so good in fact that it even blows aways last year's excellent Spider-Man 2. This is simply an Oscar-worthy movie. It may be a little far-fetched for a superhero movie to be up for Best Picture consideration, but if ever a superhero movie had a chance, Batman Begins is certainly it. Never before has the character seemed so real and believable as he does in this movie, and never before has the audience been so motivated to care about him. Never before have we had an actor of Christian Bale's caliber in the role of Bruce Wayne. With a supporting cast that includes Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, how can you lose? With a brilliant director like Christopher Nolan at the helm, you can't.

The film explores the origins of the character and, for the first time in a Batman movie, actually gives us a plausible reason for a grown man to put on a costume and mask and fight crime. The movie makes the character seem less silly and more believable. For the first time, we get a true portrait of Bruce Wayne: a haunted, bitter man who is angry at the world around him yet wants to make it better at the same time. Batman Begins delves deeper in the psychology of a ""super hero"" than any movie of its sort ever has before. Less believable is the second-half plot in which Scarecrow (the excellent Cillian Murphy) wants to spread a fear-inducing drug through Gotham City's water supply. However, the story is so well conceived and executed that you won't mind its far-fetched aspects.

Batman Begins should certainly solidify Christopher Nolan's status as one of the finest young directors in the business today. He made a seldom seen yet impressive debut (1998's Following), followed by a crime-thriller masterpiece (2001's Memento), then a superb psychological thriller (2002's Insomnia), now he presents a stunning comic book movie to re-energize a dying franchise. I do eagerly await Nolan's next project, nearly as much as I await Quentin Tarantino's and P.T. Anderson's.

Batman Begins was not only probably the best movie of this past summer, it is one of the best movies of the year.",1129507200,2,2568,4.792325056433409
1573409,1,B00005JNJV,"Batman is nothing but Hollywood garbage from a director who has created much better films such as Following and Memento.  The plot is preposterous even though the creators claim they were trying to make Batman more realistic.  The train action sequence at the end, pardon the pun, completely derails the movie from any realism they attempted to create in the first half. Morgan Freeman pretty much recycles the same role he's played a million times.  I have no earthly idea why Nolan wanted to make a superhero film.  Your money is better spent elsewhere such as the new Skinny Puppy DVD The Greater Wrong of the Right.  Don't waste your money on another superhero film.  Give a message to Hollywood that you want something original and creative instead of the same old Hollywood schlock.",1129507200,7,788,4.843283582089552
1573410,3,B00005JNJV,"Is it a bird?

Is it a plane?

No, it's...no not that guy.

It's the one and only Dark Knight, Batman, and this time he's back with a bang. ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"" director Christopher Nolan, along with ""Blade"" screenwriter David Goyer, has crafted a modern and more realistically grounded Bruce Wayne for the new millennium in his interesting yet flawed ""Batman Begins.""

We start off in some Asian prison where Bruce (a terrific Christian Bale) has ended up from trying to learn the ways of criminals and their ways. He puts a pounding on some bullying prisoners and ends up talking with a mentor named Ducard (Liam Nesson). He tells him of the League of Shadows, a society bent on seeking justice at any cost, swiftly and harshly. He makes Bruce an offer he can't refuse. He tells him he can make himself into an everlasting symbol.

""Legend, Mr. Wayne.""

He goes through his training-martial arts, sword fights, emotional counseling- and finds his true calling. After a misunderstanding gone wrong with Ducard and the League, Bruce decides to return to his beloved Gotham.

The city is now a nest of crime and corruption, and, according to some, beyond salvation. Bruce feels he can save the metropolis and its citizens. But he'll need some help.
There's his faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine), and his gadget man Lucius (Morgan Freeman). There's his childhood friend/love-interest Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) who works for the D.A. and shares Bruce's/Batman's passion for vengeance and justice. There's also possibly the only honest cop left in town Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman). Most of the paid-off cops see Batman as a nuisance, but Gordon thinks he's ""just trying to help.""

The cast is solid across the board, except for Katie Holmes who just doesn't seem woman enough yet for this role. Bale gives Bruce Wayne flesh-makes him real, genuine, human. We see him make wrong decisions, fail at times, fall or slip while trying to Evil Knievel-it across the skyscrapers, place false hope and trust on others. Cillian Murphy is creepy as Dr. Crane, aka The Scarecrow. Nolan and Goyer fill the script with terrifically refreshing popcorn dialogue that seems simultaneously based in realism. He coats his Gotham City in harsh light and shadows, bringing back the dark tones of Tim Burton's originals.

But Nolan does forget to throw some elements in here to make ""Begins"" a classic. He fails to achieve any real sense of excitement or fun into the action, which seems a bit tame for this dark film. He steals a train sequence right out from under Sam Raimi's nose from his astounding ""Spider-Man 2."" if your gonna steal from a classic, at least try to do it justice. The villain here is not supposed to be emphasized as they were in the previous films, but he doesn't feel at all like a match for the bat. And for the most part, ""Batman"" is sluggish at times. Now, understandably, it is mostly exposition into the drive and psychological birth of the Dark Knight, but could have had much more brisk pacing.

In the end, Nolan and company have refreshingly bring Batman back into familiar, dark, and gothic territory. He has made an interesting and plausible explanation for the beginnings of the legend, and given his story great acting weight to accompany it. He may have stumbled a bit along the way, but he does a fine enough job to make one genuinely mean this:

It's good to have you back Batman!",1129507200,3,3411,4.8136752136752134
1573411,5,B00005JNJV,"In 1989 the long awaited film debut of the Dark Knight, BATMAN, was released. The movie was directed by Tim Burton and Burton, with his child-like imagination, gave the world a BATMAN movie that was worth waiting for. Despite the ""controversy"" about the nipples on the Batsuit and the casting of Michael Keaton as Batman, Burton's BATMAN has remained as the best of all Batman films and one of the better film adaptations of a comic book. As brilliant as Burton's film was, in his own way he began the downfall of the franchise with BATMAN RETURNS. That movie, like the first was rather dark and sinister, but too much so and the characterizations which had developed in the original were thrown by the wayside in favor of a macabre worldview. After Burton gave up directing the franchise, things went totally downhill, first with BATMAN FOREVER and then with the cartoonish romp, BATMAN AND ROBIN (the Batman tv series was better than that).  Warner Brothers was in deep trouble and with a flagship franchise on the verge of completing sinking, they got serious and took help from those who knew best.

After years of entaglement, rewrites, changes in directors, etc. BATMAN BEGINS arrived. It was worth the wait.

BATMAN BEGINS revises the original Batman films. Christopher Nolan and company probably knew there was no point in trying to continue the series (and there was no way to salvage anything from the last two films in the series), so pulling their own ""DC revision"" they rewrote Batman's origins.  Batman doesn't even appear on camera until about 1/2-2/3rds of the way through the film. Instead, the audience is presented with the struggles of Bruce Wayne.  His fall down into a cave where hundreds of bats swarmed around him, the callous murder of his parents (sadly the Zorro reference has been altered in the film), his aimless wanderings around the world to discover his identity are all explored. These experiences make Bruce Wayne the man he is and in turn, allow him to become the Dark Knight.

Those who are more inclined for an action-filled picture will abhor the first 1/2 of the movie. However, it is essential to the plot and makes the characters on screen much more believable and realistic.  However, once Batman shows up, the action quickly picks up until a dramatic showdown on a runaway train.

For a picture based upon a comic book, the acting is superb.  But of course with a cast that includes two Oscar-winners and a few more nominees, one shouldn't expect less. Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman is the best person in the role to date--he fits both as Bruce Wayne and as Batman.  Michael Caine is a wonderful Alfred, Morgan Freeman is perfect portraying Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman (one of the most underrated actors today) does a remarkable job of pulling off a young Jim Gordon. Katie Holmes looks beautiful, but despite the working-class roots of her character comes off as little more than a piece of eye-candy. Unlike Man of Steel, Batman is a knight, and a true knight can never be with the lady he loves.

All in all, BATMAN BEGINS is a great action movie and the best Batman picture since Burton's 1989 adaptation.",1129507200,5,3160,4.779816513761468
1573412,5,B00005JNJV,"I went to see this film the nite it opened in theaters and I was very impressed! I kind of had the feeling the film would be good since the producers got alot of the ideas for this movie from Frank Miller's ""Batman: Year One"" comic series. Thanks to Miller, comic books enjoy the popularity they have today since he injected real-life elements into comic book character's lives. In the case of Batman, Miller was able to reintroduce Batman as an obsessed crime-fighter like Batman's creator, Bob Kane, made him. This version of Batman is a reflection of Miller's ingenuity and towers above Burton's film since it has all of the elements of what a good movie should have: a believeable story-line, great special effects and action scenes, solid acting and good chemistry between the cast. Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne and I like the performances of Neeson, Crane, Freeman and Hauer too. Katie Holmes was good and, in a way, its too bad that she won't be returning for the film's sequel. When I saw Burton's films, I felt they tried too hard to be like comic books. This film, however, approaches Batman in a much more realistic manner. I can't wait for the sequels!",1129507200,4,1168,4.647342995169082

I liked the more creative look at batman as Burton portrayed. This movie had some good action scenes, but if Burton had today's special effects, who knows what he could have created. Nolan did a good job re-telling the tale. He stayed closer to the plot of the comic book. In my opinion,Bale was a close second behind Michael Keaton as the best Batman. he did a good job though! I am looking forward to seeing who portrays the joker in the next Batman. Jack Nicholson will be pretty hard to top  considering he's one of the greatest actors of all time. Overall, if you like a batman closer to the comic books, then buy this movie. I'll buy it because I am a hardcore fan. Michael Caine was great as alfred and Morgan Freeman was good too. but, Katie holmes in my opionion, had no business being in Batman Begins. This movie was good but not excellent. Also, the music score for the original batman was far better then this one. The original music fit batman better then Hanz Zimmer's score. Danny Elfman and Hanz Zimmer are both great composers though.",1129507200,,1204,4.423423423423423

There should NEVER be a glowing blue bat-mobile.  There should NEVER EVER be nippples on the bat suit.  That is an atrocity.  Possibly a war crime.

The earlier films lined up four men too small to be the Dark Knight, and ended up making the films about the villains, not the hero.  Batman Begins embraces the darkness spun around the myth of Batman in the decades of comics.  Batman isn't cute.  Batman punches hard.  Bale buries himself in the role, and is the best Caped Crusader to ever play the role.

With Bale, Holmes, and an incredible allstar supporting cast (Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldham) who combine for 3 Oscars & another 8 nominations, this is easily the Best Batman film to date, and possibly the best comic book film ever.  Sorry Spidey.",1129420800,13,931,4.74375

The Movie:

Batman Begins, this summer's entry into the Batman film legacy, redefines the series. Director Christopher Nolan, who has already captivated me with his takes on ""Memento"" and the Al Pacino vehicle, ""Insomnia"" finds the story and the star to tell it. It's a dark piece, and owes far less to the comic book than the Tim Burton versions. All of the action and adventure is tied to the psyche of the man who becomes the dark hero. I don't think Nolan worried about that, because it is obvious that the fan base and the money men wanted a return of the harrowing aspects of the Dark Knight, following the successes in bringing the Marvel comics to the screen, and wanted the cartoon (Jim Carrey, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Batgirl and Poison Ivy) parts gone.

To get there, Nolan relied on storylines and backdrops from the excellent graphic novels that have grown up around the Batman legend, then paired with David Goyer to write the screenplay. The result is that this film is far and away the best of the five, and edges out the third film in the Star Wars trilogy for the best big screen adventure movie of the year, so far.

Christian Bale plays a stripped-down, emotionally unavailable Batman, and his character is thoroughly outlined.  You know exactly what his demons are, and you go through the decision-making process he takes with Alfred (the outstanding Michael Caine) to build the Batcave, and find the identity of the hero who will finally make criminals feel his presence.

The origin of Batman's training, the ninja backdrop, and the presence of his fearful mentor, Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson, better as a Ninja than a Jedi), open the film, and we see Bruce Wayne traversing through some of the most dangerous spots on the globe, in Asia, to meet the fearsome Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, on the screen for too short a time). Ghul is fighting against crime as well, but has chosen Gotham City, Bruce's former home, as his battlefield. His League of Shadows wants to destroy the city, and the crime with it. Wayne cannot go along with the plan, and his escape from the Tibetan stronghold is perilous and destructive.

Wayne's return to Gotham City introduces those he aligns himself with; Assistant DA Rachel Dawes, a childhood friend (Katie Holmes), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman, a scientist at the Wayne foundation whose work has been buried by the big business aspirations of Empire Wayne and the head of the company, Mr. Earle (Rutger Hauer digs himself out of B movies for a guest shot), a youngish police inspector, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman in a great cameo), and of course, the stylish presence of Alfred.

The villains here in Gotham, the Scarecrow and mobster Carmen Falcone are less interesting than Ducard and his men, but, in the end, they nearly succeed in their own destruction of the city. Cillian Murphy was cast as the Dr./Scarecrow, but I found his onscreen resemblance to Lara Flynn Boyle, albeit decked out as a guy, too distracting. Tom Wilkinson played Falcone with some over-the-top flair.

The actual battle scenes are tense and inspiring, the Batmobile is undoubtedly a star of the movie all on its own. Camera shots and cinematography are second to none in this production, and all of it carries out Wayne's/Batman's message....

""I went around the world, searched in all the shadows. And there is something out there in the darkness, something terrifying, something that will not stop until it gets revenge... Me.""",1129334400,,3945,4.756954612005856
1573549,5,B00005JNJV,"This movie was great. My ONLY pet peeve (you gotta have one..)was the child's acting during the murder scene. It just wasn't very good. He didn't even cry or scream. Yes, i realize thats petty but it really did bug me. If your parents were killed in front of you..  chances are you'd do more than sit there looking sour. Thats all i'm sayin'. But don't get me wrong, am i gonna buy the DVD?! hell yeah!! Great movie and i look forward to the next one with the Joker! Wonder if Jack Nicholson's too old to return...  he was awesome.

The bonus DVD is really kind of a hassle. Its cool looking but not very user friendly. Sort of annoying, actually. To get to a particular feature and bypass others... its a headache. And forget it if you pick the wrong one..  The idea is great but its not worth the effort.

I agree to some extent with a review who said when he talks as Batman its a bit much. The gnashing teeth and growl is a bit much but only enough to notice. I wouldn't say it ruined anything for me. However i hope for more action next time around now that the character has been set up.",1129334400,,1093,4.161137440758294
1573550,5,B00005JNJV,"I thought that we had lost our beloved mysterious hero Batman with the disastrous 1997 baloney pile entitled ""Batman & Robin"" and unfortunately it did kill off what was then the current franchise of the comic book series. I was also completely astounded how they turned the series from a dark and beautiful series with ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" and made it into a cartoon show with the fourth one. Even the first two ""Batman"" movies as great as they were, sometimes had problems with occasional cartoonish character and too much flamboyance that diluted the foreboding nature of the comic. But a full eight years and a different era altogether later, the entire movie adaptation is given a MUCH needed makeover and is completely revamped with the newest in the entire Batman saga entitled ""Batman Begins"" and let me tell you, WOW! This movie is totally awesome!! Forget every movie based on the two-sided individual even the ones done by Tim Burton. ""Batman Begins"" is the beginning of a whole new era in the saga and completely does away with any of the styles of old. I was shocked by how great and different BB really was.

 As the title suggests, ""Batman Begins"" is the movie that takes Bruce Wayne back to his roots starting as a young boy who witnesses the gruesome murders of his parents during an attempted robbery outside a theatre. Increasingly alarmed by the increasingly corrupt justice system in Gotham City, Bruce Wayne  escapes to Tibet but is captured and is in a prison in the mountains where he meets a powerful mentor named Ducard (Liam Neeson) as well as Ra Al Ghul (Ken Watanbe) persuades him to join the League of Shadows and train him in various fighting skills and how to bring `real' justice to the world but Wayne does not buy into their extreme methods of `correcting' the wrongs of society and returns home to bring forth his own way of fighting for true justice. But Gotham City is under a threat from a fear pandemic caused by a `super drug' that is being engineered by someone named `Scarecrow' as well as by someone familiar from Wayne's past but who it is will be a major surprise and a major mistake in trusting.

 Out of all of them, Christian Bale's rendition of Batman is by far the best out of all of them! I never thought I'd say but Bales performance outdoes even Michael Keaton's version of Bruce Wayne/Batman and the expressions are far more frightening yet more respectable than ever before! The expressions are highly realistic. My favorite however would be Liam Neeson's role as the mysterious Ducard. His character is without a doubt one of the greatest villainous roles that I've ever seen and it proves how Neeson is incredible at playing sophisticated villains.

 I never thought they could ever do anything good with Batman after storming out in disgust with Schumacher's last movie (even Forever was worlds better than Robin) but I was proven wrong! Chris Nolan as director may have outdone himself in ways that we may never be able to estimate. Forget the old movies. They belong in the last century. ""Batman Begins"" is a brand new beginning of a new era in Batman's history!",1129248000,11,3131,4.712979890310786
1573551,5,B00005JNJV,"As a young child, i remember seeing batman returns in theaters. I being only 8 years old and not knowing much about batman or the back issues of the comics, fell in love with the story and the idea of a normal man dressing up like a bat to fight crime. Sadly though, i was only hooked up in the flash and dazzle of the movies and tv, and not with the core story of batman.

As i got older, i desided to re visit the batman films of the 90's and to my disapointment, these films were alot worse then i remember. i distinctly remember thinking, ""wow, these films are for kids"" and they were, espically the later 2 films. Burtons take on batman now seemed unworldly and gothic, were the other films seemed like the campy 60s tv show with better special effect.  In all, out of 4 films, not one managed to really capture the story and emotional pull of batman, and just treated him as if bruce wayne just one day awoke and said ""gee, ill dress up like a bat""

Then came batman begins, a film i followed since the pre production stages. When i herd that batman would be alot more realistic, i thought, wow what a great idea. It worked for the xmen, why not take a respectful, realistic aproach for batman?

and to my suprise, it worked, and worked extremly well. For once we're told why and how bruce wayne became batman, why he desided to dress up like a bat and how he got ""those wonderful toys"". And for once, he was the focus of the movie, and not the villian.  Also, the villians weren't overly flamboyant, or wearing silly cosutumes, but were done well and believable. Scarcrows mask isn't just for show, same as the bat suit. Each has its purpose. Also, the action isn't over the top matrix style nonsense. Ive often found myself chringing at the fight scenes as people are sent flying and end up hurt.

As for the story, pure genus. It takes its cues from the best of the batman graphic novels, and yet combines them together to form a well thoughout and told story that shines new light on batman and his motives for what and why he does what he does.

overall forget the 90's batman. there last centuries take on the dark night. If you wana see the real batman, check out batman begins.",1129248000,,2191,4.303398058252427

I'm amazed they packed it with so much and still kept it moving right along. I'm curious to see an ""extended cut"" should one ever become available. Pay attention to the little details for some ""answers"" to lingering questions.

Looked and sounded awesome on the big screen; I expect it to hold up well on a nice DVD home theater set-up. So, if you haven't seen it yet, see it! Just make sure it is not on a tiny TV or laptop, etc.

I can't imagine how a sequel to this film could compete as this was one tough act to follow. I did read a few negative reviews on here and quite frankly, I have to shake my head at those. I'm a tough critic myself that typically loathes Hollywood garbage but how could you not think this movie is AT LEAST pretty decent? Did we see the same film?! Anyway, 95% of the reviews all over the world about this film are very positive so that should speak volumes.

Batman - ok, decent

Batman Returns - not very good

Batman Forver - barely passable

Batman and Robin - awful, unwatchable

Batman Begins - INCREDIBLE!

Instead he is a menacing, tormented soul, who in contradiction to a previous review, resides in the real world. Batman IS the only real world hero. No super powers, no roots on another planet. This is a rich guy, that experienced some horrible things as a child, discovered he had the means to prevent this type of thing from happening in the future, and did something about it. The way the weapons were created by hand, and the functions of the cape explained made it all the more possible, if not probable, that this could happen. The small touches such as the summoning of the bats using the frequency emitter was a fantastic touch. Simply because you realize that to the public, this cannot be a mortal man, but you as the viewer, having been exposed to his secrets, realize he is all to human. This is by far, the best Batman movie to date. My only hope is the sun does not rise of this title and begin to lighten it. Keep it dark and threatening. A Batman movie should be rated 'R'. People should get hurt and killed. The comic book never held any punches, neither should these films. This is the 1st movie I have ever attended where the entire audience stood and applauded at end.

1573653,3,B00005JNJV,"I'm a huge fan of the Burton-led BATMAN movies.  I find Burton's eye for the outlandish and Keaton's quirky take on the character to be one of my top five interpretations of this aged classic.  I'm not trying to dredge up more Burton vs. Nolan debates (there are plenty of those out there), I'm simply stating that the reasons I loved Burton's movies are the very reasons I find Nolan's BEGINS to be flat and, dare I say, boring.

In Burton's films, much is left open to interpretation.  The story and characters are primarily developed using visuals.  This is why, if you were ever curious, there is some debate in the geek community over whether or not Selina Kyle inherited ""cat powers"" from the cats who saved her after her boss tried to whack her.

Nolan's film, on the other hand, pretty much spells everything out for the audience.  That's a nice way of putting it.  I personally felt assaulted after seeing this movie.  ""Fear, fear, fear, it's all about fear, what's your greatest fear, I want to strike fear"", blah blah blah.  In my opinion, there's no real sense subtlety or, for that matter, urgency.  I knew that Batman would save the day in the end and that's boring.  Contrast that with Burton's Batman, who had a lot more at stake than innocent lives in RETURNS- his potential happiness with Selina, his need to shut the Penguin and Shreck down for keeps (beyond just sending them to prison, he needed to know that order can prevail against chaos), etc.  Everything Batman believed in and his very soul were at stake which, as a viewer, is an easy thing to latch on to.

I found the Gotham City production design in BEGINS to be absolutely bland.  It looks like someone just rigged up some cameras in downtown Chicago and taped some dude running around in a Batman costume... which is essentially what happened.  Gotham City, as it's presented in BEGINS and in keeping with the ""realistic"" tone of the film, doesn't feel like an otherworldly place where people like Batman and the Scarecrow are common place... which is, in my opinion, one of it's biggest failures.  It is absolutely jarring to see an utterly realistic party scene with Bruce Wayne one minute and then see Batman (an instantly ridiculous site in the real world) beating up criminals the next.

Burton's Gotham City (in RETURNS, at least) was an expressionistic, claustrophobic nightmare where freaks like Batman, Catwoman, the Penguin and such are completely at home.  The gothic atmosphere perfectly serves both the characters and the plot.

In BEGINS, we get some good fight scenes, a ""realistic"" tone, an admittedly impressive car chase, some fanboy-friendly interactions between Batman and Gordon and a generally epic feeling... and also some really terrible dialog, a script that spares no expense in making sure the lowest common denominator ""gets"" the theme of fear, Alfred the butler reduced to window dressing, etc.

I didn't *love* BEGINS, but if you prefer films where the story and character development lay in the dialog instead of the visuals, this is the Batman for you.  Knock yourself out!

But what surprised me was;This Movie is EVEN BETTER THAN TM BURTON'S Batman movies!!Let's face it,Tim burton is a man with great talent,but he was more interested in telling fairy tales then the real dark story of batman,and he lacked the talent to make a fast,spinning,dark action movie. Batman 1 and 2 was good but they were so slow,so disconnected;especially the second one.

i'm not a fan of batman comics,i've hardly completed reading an issue or two.and i wasn't a fan of batman either. Since i watched batman begins..

This batman movie is no kid movie like the previous ones.this time it tells a real,noir story.it is dark and edgy.it doesnt have a catchy main theme,instead it has a dark score almost like a horror movie,which perfectly fits in telling the story of the character. The script is a masterpiece. Every word,every item you hear and see in the movie has a purpose,nothing is a waste of time and everything comes back in the right place as they should be. The directing is as great as the sceneriowriting and the music.i mean;even KATE HOLMES acts good!!C.Bale is the best batman ever,his voice,his standing,a perfect fit. With the great team work of the actor and the director,they not only tell the ongoing story,but also focus into the character's own soul as well. The only thing bad about the movie is that;you cant see ""batman""in the first half;which is possibly a bad thing for many people who want to see batman,but for me it worked fine;the wait made the plessure higher.

i'm telling you,this is with no doubt the best batman movie,and there is more;this is the best comic book movie made so far,it is as dark as blade runner or sincity,as entertaining as spider man 2,as professional as Hulk movie.

Buy this movie,and don't listen to those kids who didn't like this movie,who yearn to see batman as a dark spider man who jumps over the roofs and beats a dozen of thugs,jump to his fascinating sports car and act in cartoon logic.you don't have to be a fan of batman,i'm not and i don't care,this is a great movie,and i cant wait to see the squel.",1128643200,2,2368,4.735436893203883

1573709,5,B00005JNJV,"Jameson L. Thottam Review of Batman begins

I, Jameson L. Thottam, found that Batman Begins is a return to glory for a franchise that was once thought to be sunk by Mr. Ocean and Joel S. Gone are the flashy colors that prevailed in the last 2 installments, and gone are the tongue in-cheek sexual references that try to make the characters more than they need to be. Instead, Batman is reinvented in this film, by the steady hand of Director Christopher Nolan.

Those, like me (Jameson L. Thottam) who have seen his films Insomnia and Momento, know that this is a man who can see the dark side of things, and boy does he take this film down a dark road. Relying more on the psyche, and less on flashy effects, Nolan has taken Batman back to its roots, and improved upon the story ten-fold. What had been a disgrace to comic book fans in previous films, Batman is given a new style, a new outlook, and a new car.

Batman Begins of course centers around the main character of Bruce Wayne. Having seen his parents killed right in front of him, he has filled his heart with not only doubt, but with many fears as well. Hoping to find a solution to these fears he basically gives up on what once was a bright future, and turned instead towards discovering why criminals do the things that they do. This has led him on a journey that places him somewhere between lunatic and savior. He cannot even deal with the pain that he has inside, so he doesn't really see how he can fit back into society. This leads him right to the door-step of Ra's Al Ghul, who plans to teach him how to harness all of his fear and anger, and take vengeance upon all those who have taken the wrong path in life. Wayne goes through this training, only to finally fully discover what he really should be fighting for, and that he does have a purpose after all.

Christian Bale dons the cape and cowl in Batman Begins, and I, Jameson L. Thottam, felt did a great job in the role. His brooding is just as good as Keaton's was, and he far surpasses what Kilmer and Clooney were able to do. Bale stands on his own, and really makes the character of Batman his own, by not falling prey to all of the stereotypes that the former actors had fallen under. This wasn't a lesson in showing off just how good looking Bale could be, and Bale does a great job of being part of the story, rather than being the story. To explain better, the movie was more about a man's struggles with his own demons, and less about kicking butt. Don't get me wrong, Bale has his scenes where he is able to show off everything he has learned, but at the meat of the movie we are able to cling to something more than just a few spectacular fight scenes.

Surrounding Bale in this film, are many other great actors who lend their acting talents in great fashion. Gone are the over-the-top supporting characters who are designed more for star appeal than what they really offer the film, and they are replaced with accomplished actors who know just how to turn a phrase or create drama within a scene. Included in those actors is Liam Neeson as Ducard who takes Wayne to Al Ghul and begins his training, Gary Oldman who plays Detective Jim Gordon, Michael Caine who plays the Wayne's butler Alfred, and Morgan Freeman Lucius Fox, an expert working for the Wayne Company. They are all given parts that play to their talents, and it is very enjoyable to see any one of them on the screen at any given time. In addition, we have smaller roles played by Ken Watanabe and Rutger Hauer who are also fun to watch.

Playing the female lead is Katie Holmes in a role that very well could push her over into starring roles in film. Being a supporting character has been her bread and butter since Dawson's Creek, and this film might be the one she needed. She is pretty good in her role, and does end up being the Mary Jane to Bale's Peter Parker. In my mind, Jameson L. Thottam's, she was decent, but she is no Kim Basinger. The final character we have in the film is Dr. Jonathan Crane who seems to have something to hide from the beginning of the film, and we are soon shown his true colors, and who the people that he deals with are. Crane was very good in this role, and seeing the film will provide the explanation as to why I don't over-indulge my assessment of his part. All in all, the cast of Batman Begins was a great one, and I, Jameson L. Thottam, was really glad with all of the choices made for the film.

Batman Begins could have been one of those films that went too far over the top, or tried to re-hash old ideas that either had been done better, or just plain didn't work. Instead, what we have here is a homage to the comic book, and a true story that goes back to the roots of Batman. Don't expect it to be like the TV show, and don't expect it to be as light-hearted as the past few films. What we have here is a really dark film, which explains the transformation of a boy into a man, and everything that he hoped to accomplish. After the last movie, the franchise really needed a jump-start, and by going back to the beginning, rather than trying to build off Clooney's failure was the right way to go. I, Jameson L. Thottam, found myself almost applauding at the end of the film, and when there were emotional scenes involving the young Bruce Wayne I, Jameson L. Thottam, could really feel those emotions. Great acting, great story-telling, and the perfect cast helped to make this one of the best movies of 2005 so far. I, Jameson L. Thottam, cannot wait till the next Batman film comes out.

Hope you can't either,

1573710,5,B00005JNJV,"I have been a Batman fan since I was 7 years old (I'm 48 now). Have been collecting comics of Batman & Superman for over 25 years. I have videos of all the versions of Batman (including the 1940's serials). Believe me, when I saw Batman Begins, I almost screamed at the screen: FINALLY SOMEBODY GOT IT RIGHT!!! Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman was incredible. The only flaw is that Batman should have a real killer instinct. Absolutely no compassion for criminals. The rest of the cast was excellent except in my opinion Katie Holmes. First of all, her character doesn't appear in the comics. Second, she looked way too young for a district attorney. But that's my opinion. Aside from that, the storyline was first rate. You actually believe that this kind of tragedy can happen to anyone. Sometimes it really does. Even though the movie over 2 hours long, to me the time passed way too quickly. I didn't want it to stop. Can't wait for the sequel. I wonder who will play the Joker? When the DVD comes out, you can be sure that I will be the first in line to buy it. If you are a diehard fan, you won't be disappointed.",1128556800,4,1123,4.429951690821256
1573711,5,B00005JNJV,"Since there have been hundreds of other reviews already written, I will keep my remarks brief. Suffice to say that I found Tim Burton's work with Batman, 1) Self-indulgent (I didn't want Gotham City to be the work of Beetlejuice), and 2)overrated. The script was a travesty, and the second movie wasn't much better. The real tragedy in this is the fact that so many *fantastic* graphic novels have been written for the Dark Knight in the last 20 years, there should have been no shortage of good material.

Finally Nolan gets it right. Borrowing heavily from the superb ""Batman: Year One"", we finally understand how a scarred child like Bruce Wayne can become this seemingly unstoppable superhuman legend such as Batman, The Dark Knight. Heck, plenty of people lose a loved one in violent fashion, but what would make a man punish himself to become what Bruce became? Even with great wealth, that isn't easy. Nolan spends about 50% of the movie taking us on that journey, and it is a journey well worth taking.

Those of you looking for constant action in the cape will be somewhat disappointed, but this origin story is extremely well told. Once again, it is proven that even in a superhero movie, a good story well told is worth more than a billion in special effects. We're introduced to many characters that comics fans know and love, Morgan Freeman as Lucious Fox, Liam Neesom as Henri Ducard are two that I suspect will be recurring characters, and Gary Oldman absolutely nails a young Jim Gordon, a character that was totally neglected in the previous Batman movies.

Not only was this a great movie, it sets up the sequels (yes, plural) in a big way.",1128556800,8,1658,4.690721649484536
1573712,5,B00005JNJV,"To many, I may come across as blasphemous to say that Tim Burton's Batman sucked eggs. As a 'Joker Movie' it was allright, but it captured nothing of what Batman was about. Batman is not an 'Everyman' and the 4 preceeding movies had him as some hapless shlub in a rubber suit totally dependent upon gadgets. How good could the 'Batarang' be if a freakin POODLE can catch it in his mouth and run off with it? What kind of Batplane could be knocked out of the sky with one shot?!?Sure, the movie was dark, but when can you find a Tim Burton movie that didn't have his nihilistic slant to it? Michael Keaton could've made a better Joker, but the guy didn't do squat for/as Batman, except show the world how NOT to be Batman.

  Christian Bale portrayed the many facets as well as the driving fear and anger which lingered and grew from childhood. Like the movie ""Equilibrium' he showed a cool, stoic side, obsessed with his mission. He also gave you the impression that there was only ONE Batman, and that he's more than a Rubber suit. I BELIEVED that this guy was going to SAVE Gotham, and that he was the ONLY thing standing in the way of total chaos! His first foray into the streets of Gotham was the classic 'Night of the Batman' much like 'the night of Superman' where in the movie, he saves Lois , the President, foils 2 criminal acts and gets a cat out of a tree.

Bale gave the criminals reason to fear him, especially by his 'swooping from the shadows' attacks. Everything that was essentially Batman had it's reason for being, right down to the scallops on his gloves. Like a True Ninja, he worked everything into his repetoir. When the bums on the rooftop shot and knocked Keaton on his butt, I rolled my eyes in disgust. After he got back up,MY first response would be to aim at the face, next time. And that wasn't the ONLY time he fell onto his backside. Tim Burton's Batman was a clumsy pretender in a town of incompetents. But THAT is a rant for another time...

  Believe me, If you're a Tim Burton fan, you may like the originals, but if you're a BATMAN fan, Batman Begins is the ONLY batfilm you NEED TO SEE and OWN!!!!!",1128384000,7,2137,4.3542713567839195

Also, I like the way the guy playing the cop in the film is no macho stud (like Tom Selleck) but is still allowed to be heroic. I also like the brief scene with the loose women and the pool.",1128297600,3,547,4.074074074074074
1573812,5,B00005JNJV,"Forget about all the previous Batman films. ""Batman Begins"" blows every single one of them out of the water.  No Contest.
Christian Bale is Batman/Bruce Wayne.  This is the first film of the series where the hero is the focus resulting in a much more compelling and more focused storyline.

This isn't ""The Joker"" co-starring Batman, ala the 1989 film and the strongest of the previous incarnations.  The problem  with that film was that Jack Nicholson was just too over the top as the Joker (if that's possible). It seemed for the audience that it was all about ""hey , look at  the chances Jack is taking in this role"" rather than getting lost in the character.  Jack's hammy acting seemed to place the story in a secondary role.

Not the case here.  There were two themes present in this movie: 1) Fear and 2)Relationships.

When we meet Bruce early in the film, we see he originally has a fear of bats after a very harrowing(and fateful) incident. We then see Bruce's attempts to conquer his fear after the tragic and very brutal murder of his parents, by throwing himself into the heart of the criminal element. This eventually leads Bruce to a ""Monastery"" where he meets Ra's Al Ghul and comes under the tutelidge of the enigmatic Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) who teaches Bruce how to use fear as an effective weapon.  This weapon, the most important in The Batman's arsenal, is used skillfully in this film, showing us, from the perspective of the criminals, what it's like to be hunted by The Batman. Fear is also the weapon of the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) used to chilling and sometimes disturbing results.  Finally, The Batman must overcome fear to defeat the Scarecrow and ""Ra's Al Ghul.""

""Batman Begins"" has more emphasis on strong relationships than any of its recent contemporaries.  The strength of young Bruce's relationship with his parents, especially his father, manages to make their inevitable deaths all the more horrifying.  Equally important is the mentor/student relationship of Henri Ducard and Bruce. Ducard becomes a father figure to the young man which figures prominently in the film's climactic battle.  Thomas Wayne instills in his son moral strength and the courage to stand against evil. Henri Ducard instills in Bruce unwavering focus and, when needed, ruthlessness.

I especially loved the relationships between Bruce and the supporting cast:
Bruce and Alfred - Hearfelt, touching and believable. Michael Caine is the best Alfred. Period.

Batman and Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) - Loved the intial mistrust, turning into mutual respect. Lt. Gordon is one good cop in a sea of corruption in the Gotham Police Force.  Batman needs Gordon and Gordon needs Batman, a truism only alluded to in Tim Burton's initial outing.

Bruce and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) - Addresses the question of how and where Batman gets his gadgets (especially the very cool Batmobile).  Loyalty and trust are very important in this relationship. As mentioned in a previous review, Fox is like James Bond's ""Q"".

As for Katie Holmes, she's not as weak as many reviewers have reported. Her role as a tough attorney who grew up with Bruce worked for me. She was certainly the most resourceful and down- to- earth of the all the series' love interests.

Great action sequences, excellent acting and a compelling back-to- basics story make this the ultimate Batman film.",1128297600,11,3373,4.930973451327434
1573813,5,B00005JNJV,"First of all, to the person who gave Batman Begins a 1/5 and is saying that ""Stan Lee"" did not edit Tim Burton's work for the new Special Edition DVDs: you're an IDIOT. Stan Lee did NOT create Batman and he does not own the rights to Batman. Stan Lee created Spider-Man and he is part of Marvel Comics. Batman is a DC Comics character, created by Bob Kane and owned by his family since he died quite some time ago. So, now that I've destroyed this reviewer's credibility, I'll destroy his review.

Batman Begins is one of the best movies of 2005. The acting is wonderful. Bale is perfect as not only Batman, but more importantly as Bruce Wayne (something that cannot be said of Michael Keaton who was not young enough and certainly did not have the look described in the comics). The supporting cast is great, except for Katy Holmes. She's okay, but everyone else does such a great job that they make her look very mediocre. Michael Caine brings heart and a ""fatherly"" presence to Alfred that has not been seen in the previous Batman films. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as Lucius Fox, a James Bond ""Q"" type character who creates all of Bruce/Batman's weapons. Liam Neeson does a great job as Bruce's mentor Ducard. Gary Oldman is wonderful as a young Commissioner Gordon (although he's just a sergeant and lieutenant in Batman Begins). Cillian Murphy does a great job as the sinister Dr. Crane/Scarecrow. As I said before, the acting is just wonderful.

The script is well-written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan. Nolan's direction is awesome as well. The film is as real as possible and uses the least amount of CGI possible for an action film in the 21st Century. Nolan makes this film a character development story, a heart-pounding action film, and at times a pretty scary horror movie (Batman actually is a predator and the audience gets to see how street thugs feel when he's hunting them). Batman has been re-invented. Thank goodness someone finally actually considered the COMICS for a reference when making a Batman film. Batman Begins is without a doubt the best Batman film ever made and it is certainly one of the best films of the year. The acting, script, and direction are all superb.

The only drawback of this film is that the plot starts out great but sort of becomes chaotic while still being cliche. The beginning gives the audience an in-depth idea of how Bruce Wayne decides to conquer his fear and guilt. This part of the plot is wonderfully done by Christopher Nolan. Even when the plot becomes rather cliche (superhero saves a city against a mass destruction plot), the action sequences and one-liners make up for the lack of creativity with the general plot.",1128297600,8,2691,4.6849894291754755
1573814,5,B00005JNJV,"Let's all take a moment and try to remember (or forget) just how bad the last two Batman movies (""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"") actually were. They were horrible. Neon Lights in Gotham?? Nipples on the bat suit?? Bat-cracks? Alicia Silverstone in a Batman movie? As Batgirl???? All this left the general movie-goers with a clear picture of what they thought comic books and the movie adaptions from them were all about, and it has haunted us true and loyal comic book fans for a long time.

Now think about the last few years, in particular the ""Spider-Man"" movies. They proved, finally, that hollywood can invest a ton of money, get a great ensemble cast and (cherish the thought) be faithful to the source material. The result? Two great movies (spidey).

Now comes ""Batman Begins"", and thank you very much it follows the story more than very well. It is dark, gritty, emotional and everything a Batman movie SHOULD be. But before we get Batman, we get Bruce Wayne and the movie is 100x better for it. We can't empathize with Wayne unless we see his journey, his struggles and his mistakes. And this film shows us all of that.

When the moment comes that Batman finally makes his appearance in the dark shadows of a Gotham dock, you almost have forgotten your watching a Batman film. The first hour or so focusing on Wayne and all the supporting characters (all amazingly well acted) is a great film in and of itself, and then we get an hour or so of Batman on top of it!

The film moves along well, and is just a great great flick. Fans of the comic walk away having seen there favorite caped crusader finally told right and told well (not to take away from Burton's two films, but they aren't even on the same level as this). And newcomers get an amazing story.

The Deluxe Edition DVD is definetly the way to go, as the single disc version has nothing, not even a trailer. This version, aside from a nifty comic book featuring three Bat-tales that inspired the script of the movie, has about a dozen featurettes ranging from 7-15 minutes on the script, the costume, the batmobile, stunts, etc. Also a great comic book interactive menu sits on the 2nd disc, which is really fun.

The sound and Picture quality are top notch, and this DVD is very Highly recommended!",1128297600,18,2279,4.559902200488998

1573817,5,B00005JNJV,"First of all, let me just say that the review entitled ""I hate you people"" is written by a person that simply doesn't quite know what he/she is or how to express their uniqueness in a way that isn't tired and boring.  Lamenting the belief that ""Batman Begins"" is another barrage of Hollywood CGI whereas Burton's ""Batman"" was not is not accurate at all.  This person needs to be reminded that Burton's ""Batman"" was a HUGE summer blockbuster popcorn flick for it's day (even more so than thte current movie) with Burton as the defacto ""it"" director of the time in Hollywood.  So, put the two movies side by side and they're very, very similar.

Aside from that, my personal view on this movie is that it is an excellent re-birth of the Batman series (hoping that more will follow, of course).  Tim Burton's ""Batman"" was great for it's day and was just what us geeks were waiting for.  Keaton and Nicholson were fantastic in their roles of Batman and Joker, respectively.  In my opinion, no one will be able to match Jack as the Joker, but we'll see what may come for any future movies.  They can't just throw in Jim Carrey as another reviewer suggested.  They need an actor who can play a wickedly evil, yet perversely funny, villain and pull it off with flair.  Let's leave Carrey as The Riddler as that fit him much better.  It would be great to see, possibly, Mark Hamill in this role since he voiced the animated Joker so well.

I usually tire of origin stories, but this one was outstanding.  Following the same vein as ""Spider-Man"", Nolan shows us the very human, and very flawed, Bruce Wayne and his agonizing journey of self-realization after his parents' deaths.  I was drawn into the story and understood in a more vibrant way than ever before of why Bruce became the Batman.  His emergence of the hero we all know and love was great to see; from how he got many of his gadgets and the Batmobile, to how he and Alfred had to come up with sneaky ways to order the bits and pieces of his costume.

With the exception of Katie Holmes, whom I personally don't care too much for, all of the other actors were great choices for their roles.  Morgan Freeman was excellent and should have had more screen time.  Gary Oldman portrayed Gordon in a very honest and caring way that made me appreciate him as an actor and Gordon as a character.  Michael Caine, of course, was absolutely fabulous and embraced Alfred as his own.

The one thing that initially concerned me before the movie came out was the new Batmobile.  I literally groaned, ""Oh, no. Not that, please.""  But I am glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Where I once hated it, I now love it and it's perfect for this storyline.  If Bruce gets his gadgets from unused government contract prototypes, why not his car?

Bottom line . . .

Blockbuster action flick?  Absolutely!  But one done very well with an excellent storyline and great actors.

Overloaded with CGI?  I don't see that at all.  Hardly any CGI that I remember.

My wife, who normally doesn't care for superhero/action type films, really liked this movie.",1128038400,10,3087,4.536231884057971
1573818,5,B00005JNJV,"Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors and christrian bale has become of my favorite actors after seeing BATMAN BEGINS.Totally different from the very first one in that it was a lot more visual as far as atmosphere,which is classic for gotham city,which is known for it's dark and merky settings (if you've read as many comic books as I have).Pure entertainment!",1128038400,3,373,4.936507936507937
1573819,5,B00005JNJV,"This Batman was, somehow, better than the original Batman with the Joker.

The storyline of where Batman came from was absolutely incredible, and Christian Bale did amazing as Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The part came alive with him as it had never done before.

It seems that the producers aren't thinking about it, but I personally think they should redo the Batman Legacy with Christian Bale as Batman, and follow in the vain of Batman Begins, keeping Rachel Dawes as the Love Interest (I don't like the idea of the same guy ending up with different girls every few days... and each movie did not pan out over many years, so... while they were hot, I did not like the idea of the ""Bat-Babes"").  I would love to say how they do the Joker.  My two ideas for who could play the Joker are (in order of my best bet):

Johnny Depp

Jim Carrey

Kids would, at first, wonder: Is this really Batman? Daddy, did we go to the wrong movie? Haha, this is actually a good thing, because the depth that builds within the character- BEFORE he dons the outfit/costume, has to be seen to be believed. He doesn't pull his ability of hand-to-hand combat out of thin air. He doesn't glide through the night just because he can, and he doesn't dress like a bat because he loves bats. No, he actually hates them with a passion. The mightiest moment of the movie to me is when he flicks away a taser like it's nothing. The moment isn't spoiled by the fact that it isn't a super-power, but rather it's enhanced because it shows how prepared Bruce Wayne is to now take on the Gotham underworld. Just a powerful movie! It is one of my favorites. As a youngster I loved the earlier versions for their glamour and action, and as an adult I love the newer movie for its inspiration and powerful story...",1127865600,2,1133,4.425837320574162

1573893,5,B00005JNJV,"What makes a hero movie is faithfulness. Is it faithful to the character?  Is it faithful to his/her motivations?  Pathos?  And in a case such as Begins, is it faithful to the history and character boundaries set by the creator?

Only a few minutes into Begins, and we're already deeper into backstory than all of the previous ""Bat"" films combined.  It only gets better.  It's more than the when's of Bruce Wayne/Batman.  It's the what's, why's, who's, where's, and how's.

What happened to him?  Why choose to leave Gotham?  Who influenced him?  Where did he travel to?  Who did he meet?  What did he learn?  Why does he choose that life?  Why does he return to Gotham?  How does he become Batman?

With a deep root in Long Halloween, a nod to Frank's Year One, and zealous direction that chooses realism over cartoon--this is it.  For longtime fans of the character of Batman, this is the film that most gets it.  In a word, worthy.",1127520000,9,934,4.551515151515152
1573894,5,B00005JNJV,"Finally they cast a good Batman. Christian Bale should be the only actor considered as Batman, he did a great job in this movie. I am glad they didn't overdue the story, the previous Batman movies where always to overdone. This is a must for the Batman fan.",1127433600,6,257,4.375
1573895,5,B00005JNJV,"This movie was so darn good I don't even know where to start.  Batman is the ""dark knight"" for a reason.  Something that hollywood apparently never decided to notice until two comic book geeks themselves (writer David S. Goyer and director Chris Nolan) were given the reigns to the best comic hero ever.  This movie is phenomenal.  It is the truest, and in my mind, the only, representation of Batman to ever hit the big screen.  What does it do that the others don't?  Many things.

First of all, Batman Begins tells the story of Bruce Wayne.  It doesn't just start him out as some aristocratic loverboy heir like every other movie seemed hellbent on doing.  This movie lets us know Bruce Wayne BEFORE we know Batman.  Knowing the man behind the mask is half the fun when it comes to superheroes and costumed figures.  Without knowing an individual's inspiration for his actions, we're left to just think, ""wow, this guy is some superhuman weirdo,"" but this has never been the case with Bruce Wayne.  He is a normal (albeit extremely wealthy and intelligent) human being.  He has no superpowers except his mind and his friends.  He is a person.  Goyer and Nolan captured this perfectly with Batman Begins.

Secondly, Batman as Batman is more fun than ever before.  Christian Bale is absolutely perfect for both the role of Bruce and Batman.  He is an extremely talented actor who has honed his chops on brooding/buff roles in many of his previous films (see Equilibrium for example...it's basically Batman) and it shows.  Christian brings a life and funness to Batman that was never really there because none of the others actors who have ever played him even knew who Batman was supposed to be.  Christian's Batman is distraught, he's enraged, he's new to the game, and he's fresh and excited to be out doing what he thinks is good.  Bale nails Batman, which lets Batman be the Batman all us comic fans have been craving.

Finally, not only does this film have an absolutely stellar cast, but it has an amazing plot and great action scenes.  Finally, a story that is interesting, intriguing, and worthy of being turned into a movie.  And for all the comic action fans out there, there is action that is (for the most part) believable and very entertaining.  Of course the Tumbler could probably never really drive on roofs, but come on, it's fun and it actually goes with the plot really well!  Batman Begins is hands-down the greatest comic movie since the original Brandon Lee ""Crow.""  Spiderman 1 and 2 were fun, X2, was a blast, but Batman Begins is a movie.  It's perfectly executed on all accounts and should be viewed by everyone.",1127433600,10,2639,4.690631808278867
1573896,5,B00005JNJV,"This movie doesn't just raise the benchmark for comic to big screen translations, it reestablishes the more subtle and realistic style of action flick. Gone are the gross absurdities of the Matrix and cartoonish violence of Kill Bill, and in their place is an action flick fit to compete with the best of the James Bond movies. It's well written, directed deftly and manages to be both true to the essence of Batman and a worthy movie unto itself.",1127347200,4,447,4.670886075949367
1573897,4,B00005JNJV,"There's certainly some fun to campy versions of comic books -- such as the previous batman movies -- but for my money this is the way a comic book is meant to be adapted. At least this series.

This movie has resonance and relevance. It has heart, soul, and action. It has an interesting, engaging plotline filled with multi-dimensional human beings, struggling with human emotions.

All of which heightens the action-adventure because it gives it real stakes.

Like Spiderman I & II, Batman Returns heralds a new age of comic book and action films. Films that are intelligent, written as well as any highbrow drama. And the audience interest is obvious. They bought tickets for these films. They didn't buy tickets to STEALTH, which lacked these resonant elements.

Similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, these films all have the chance of resurrecting the power of myth in our movies. And as we become used to them, there is the very real chance of creating new myths for our new millennium.

Truly, Batman has begun again in BATMAN BEGINS, and I truly appreciate the skillful and soulful work of Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer.

1573898,5,B00005JNJV,"Director Christopher Nolan (Memento & Insomnia) and star Christian Bale (The Machinist) resurrect the popular caped crusader in the remarkable summer blockbuster ""Batman Begins"". After the tragic loss of his parents, young Bruce Wayne (Bale) travels the world to understand the criminal underworld and learns the means to fight injustice. With a striking new disguise and some high-tech gadgets, his dark alter-ego Batman begins his quest to protect Gotham City from crime and corruption. ""Batman Begins"" is one of the finest comic book adaptations to hit the big screen. The movie avoids the colorful silliness and the bland one-liners that deteriorated the ""Batman"" franchise. This impressive comic book movie contains a well structured and engrossing plot, solid emotional depth, dazzling action sequences and fine performances. Christian Bale is certainly engaging as the emotionally tortured Bruce Wayne. The all-star cast also includes Liam Neeson, Michael Cane, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Ken Wantanabe and Morgan Freeman.

If you already purchased ""Batman Begins"" on HD DVD then you might be disappointed that Blu-Ray holds no big surprises. ""Batman Begins"" is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 widescreen format. The picture quality is the same as the previous HD DVD release but is still an excellent transfer. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Dolby sound offers a great home theater experience. The special features are the same as in the previous 2-disc DVD and HD DVD versions. They include eight short behind-the-scenes featurettes that deeply explore the making of the 2005 blockbuster, a few picture galleries and its theatrical trailer. ""Tankman Begins"" is a funny spoof of the film that was broadcasted during the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. With such terrific presentation and worthy extras, ""Batman Begins"" gets a solid ""A"".",1127347200,,1828,5.436619718309859
1573999,5,B00005JNJV,"I went and saw this movie with high expectations because of all the hype and I have to say that I was NOT dissapointed.  It held it's own as the best batman movie to date.  Christian Bale was the PERFECT batman, well, moreso the PERFECT Bruce Wayne and that is precisly the point of the movie.  This movie is more about Brce Wayne than batman and that is half the reason why my kid brother wasn't as impressed.  The action is reserved for the end, the guts of the movie is more Bruce growing up, realizing his destiny and coming to grips with the murder of his parents.  Besides Bale Cillian Murphy and Liam Neison do AMAZING jobs with what little screen time they are allotted and Katie Holmes, while not spectacular is still sweet and charming.  The storyline is great, the plot is worthy of the title and this movie hopfully will catapult with an amazing series of SERIOUS and DARK movies that do the batman justice, the way he was always meant to be portrayed.",1127347200,3,964,4.418079096045198
1574000,5,B00005JNJV,"When I saw Batman Forever & Batman & Robin,I wanted to throw myself out the window knowing that Jerry Bruckheimer killed the Batman legacy in the movies (espicially with Batman being my favorite superhero and idol).

 But when I saw Batman Begins,I was in beyond awe of the such perfection Christopher Nolan has given the 5th movie.

 1st of all Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale have definately outdone Tim Burton and Michael Keaton (which by the way did remarkabely for the first 2).

 2nd not only did Bale do a top-knotch performance but got into the Batman psyche better than Keaton, Clooney, and Kilmer.

 3rd the action scenes and visual effects were great;espicially since a lot of it was shrowded in darkness which a lot of people disagreed with but I thought was clever and great for the DARK Knight enviromentally speaking.

 4th Michael Caine and Morgon Freeman seemed to be pretty into the rolls they were given making them good in the movie as well, and was a wise desicion on the movie casters part.

 5th the plot and storyline went somewhere and served a purpose and didn't just have a bunch of action scenes for nothing.

 And finally with there being upcoming sequels to Batman Begins and a great visionary director, high talented crew, and a cast more than fit for Batman...there is only one thing i didn't think I would say after Batman & Robin came out...BATMAN LIVES!!!",1127260800,,1395,4.734439834024896

It's time my enemies share my dread"" This movie shows the training that Bruce goes through to become batman.  I think that Christain Bale (Equilibrium, Reign of Fire, American Psycho) is the best Batman to date, I believe that he will be in the next movie which is at this point untitled.

But Joel Schumacher ruined the franchise and I was saddened by the last two Batman films preceeding Batman Begins.  Thank God I can be enthuzed about Batman movies again and I can't wait until the next one to see my favorite villain of all time, the Harlequin of Hate, the Ace of Knaves, the Clown Prince of Crime, ""The Joker""!!!!!  Rumor has it that Johnny Depp may play the Joker in the sequel, I think this is a good choice, but it is hard to fit the shoes of Jack Nicholson, he played such a great demonic clown.

1574003,5,B00005JNJV,"The smash hit of 2005, and truely the best movie of 2005, ""Batman Begins"" is not a disapointment to comic book fans, and movie fans.
Christian Bale is Bruce Wayne, a Gotham City socalite, and orphan when his parents are murdered right in front of him. Wayne goes soul searching in the Himalayas, and learns the ways of the League of Shadows, a secret ban of ninjas. After, Wayne uses the skills he learned to fight crime and clean up the scum that runs rampant in Gotham.

Morgan Freeman costrats as Lucios Fox, the technicion that supplys Wayne with all his gadgets that make up the Batman suit. Michael Cain costars as Bruce Wayne's trusty butler Alfred Pennyworth, and Cicilian Murphy gives a chilling performance as Dr Crane, aka Scarecrow.

Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman in this movie is as definitive as Christopher Reeve's performance of Superman. Bale had the charisma of Bruce Wayne, and the darkness of Bruce Wayne as well. I will also say that this is Bale's best performance since ""American Psycho""
To classify this as a comic book movie would be wrong. It is actually a realistic view of what Batman would be like in today's world. So do not expect this to be like ""Sin City"",""Superman III"", or any campy lines and over the top fight scenes. Expect fight scenes like in ""Walking Tall"", or ""Lethal Weapon"".

The extras are very good. There is a short on the incarnations of Batman from the late 80s till now, a short on how they designed the costume, a feature on the Batmoble in the movie, a feature on making the movie, theatrical trailer, and a photo galary as well.

Overall, ""Batman Begins"" will not dissapoint. It will gain new fans, and win back old fans who were turned away with the turd sandwich that was ""Batman & Robin"".",1127088000,5,1751,4.620578778135048
1574004,5,B00005JNJV,"This was the first within an epic trilogy of recent films that has very quickly become my three topmost favorite Batman movies of all-time. ""Batman Begins"" portrays and fleshes out the story of Gotham City's Dark Knight in the meticulous manner this character has always deserved. Christopher Nolan, as well as everybody else who gave of their time and dedication, deserves a well-earned pat on the back. This movie sponges away the bitter candy-coated aftertaste left in the wake of ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin,"" and gives us the brooding, formidable Caped Crusader we have all longed for since Tim Burton's landmark original.

Nolan's extraordinary film takes us back to Bruce Wayne's troubled past, to all of the intermingling events that led to his parents' abrupt murders. Haunted by their deaths well into the years of young adulthood, he flees Gotham to travel the world; to try and make sense of what his life has become. His ongoing desperation to uncover a means of battling the injustice of his personal loss leads him to the doorstep of Rhaz Al' Ghoul and the ""League of Shadows,"" a secret society of warriors that collectively shapes and molds Bruce into something the residents of Gotham City might very well have never seen before.

Do not look for any of the corny, kid-friendly scenarios from the kitschy Adam West series, because it is not here. This is as fantastically serious and emotionally gripping of a Batman film as you are ever likely to find. From start to finish, I was completely captivated. Christian Bale IS Batman. It's a role he was clearly born to play. This film also boasts the impressive talents of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Rutger Hauer, AND Cillian Murphy; just an absolutely incredible and altogether irreplaceable cast of awesome actors.

This captured everything, the entire all-important essence of what watching these types of movies is all about. It really is THAT damn good!

And, just so we're clear, I want that Batmobile! I've been watching these movies from the day I was eighteen years old and I can testify, with all clarity, that I have never been so totally wowed by any one vehicle in my entire life! This isn't a car, it's a TANK!

Believe me when I say, if you have ever followed this character's journey through the comics pages or within any of the prior unrelated films, you ABSOLUTELY MUST see ""Batman Begins."" It is, in every conceivable manner, a game-changing five-star classic.",1127088000,5,2483,4.902380952380953

Batman Begins takes the character back to his origin, and portrays what drives the man behind the cape. The excitement throughout is incredible as you know what this is building up to, but the ride beforehand is fabulous. Adding Ra's Al Ghul to the early days was a nice touch, but not the original plot. From the comic book historical reference though, it fit quite well. Add to this the Scarecrow character who in a twisted way is assisting in the conquest of Gotham as part of the Ra's Al Ghul plan, and you have a film that sticks very close to the roots of a dark but heroic character. If you favor the Batman comics and the stories that accompany them, this is your film!",1127088000,4,807,4.572413793103448

The action scenes were frenetic and hard to follow as in who was fighting whom.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were good additions to the cast, but following the plot was like slogging through mud.  The special effects shots were good, but by the time the big-deal climactic battle arrived, I had already given up on this waste of time.  I can't believe that so many national critics gave it good reviews.",1126915200,16,578,4.627450980392157
1574007,5,B00005JNJV,"I hate to admit this, but Batman Begins has just replaced Superman the Movie as the greatest comic book movie of all time.  This is saying something.  Superman set the bar for storytelling and special effects in movies.  And until now, only two could ever have rivialed it, the two X-Men films.  I know there are Spider-man fans out there who feel that those two were the greatest, (and I think they're good) but they just don't compare to Superman, Batman, X-Men and X-2.

When I walked into Batman Begins, I was somewhat nervous about the film.  The Batman films from the ninties just weren't up to par and I felt this one could fall into the same trap.  But I was wrong.  The film starts off strong by showing that this was no prequel.  Thank goodness.  It is it's own start to a series of it's own.

The story is compelling from the start.  Bruce Wayne tourtured self is found in a Chinese prison camp, shutting himself in with criminals to fight them.  He is then released and finds himself mentored by Liam Nieson and the League of Shadows.  I won't give anymore away to the film, except to say that every single person gives awsome performences and the story allows us to show that Batman this time is not out for revenge as he was in the previous four films, but he is out for justice.  And the action is top notch.  I only hope the sequels will be half as good.",1126915200,6,1370,4.334645669291339

1574089,3,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" to take the foul taste out of my mouth left by Joel Schumacher's versions. Christian Bale looks the part of Bruce Wayne, and you can believe he's a spoiled millionaire, oh that's right, he's a billionaire now, who secretly believes in noblesse oblige. However the movie overall was too much of a recap. The idea of the brooding Batman is getting old too.

When Bob Kane and Bill Finger first established Batman's tragic background it was almost as an after-thought, tacked on to their sixth issue, followed by a seperate adventure. I would suspect the idea of the hero as an orphan was to make it's easier for him to keep a secret identity. We can't have his mother sewing his name into his Bat-panties.  Batman is like the gunslinger from the old Westerns who saddles up to the saloon bar to say, ""I'm looking for the man who shot my pa.""

The ""dark Batman"" appeared well before Frank Miller, and came out almost immediately after the campy TV series to help us forget the show. I suspect they were trying to compete with Marvel Comics moody heroes like the Thing, the Hulk, Captain America, and Spiderman. The first two were monsters, CA was out of time and place, and if Spiderman's aunt wasn't in the hospital, he was fighting his allergies. However, ""Batman Begins"" is nothing to sneeze at.",1126656000,,1311,4.642241379310345
1574090,4,B00005JNJV,"Finally, a writer/director has finally given the avenger of the night his due. I'd like to give it 4 1/2 stars but it's not possible. This was a nicely done action/comicbook drama that should have been done in 1989. TIM BURTON's first 2 BATMAN films were decent but it didn't do the main character justice, the other movies  went downhill, Batman and Robin being the worst! CHRISTOPHER NOLAN (director of memento,Blade)has finally done his homework and came up with a movie that actually is a close persona of the Batman after his re-vamp in the late 80's.

Christian Bale does an excellent job potraying Bruce Wayne, you can feel his pain and obsession with avenging his parents. The WAYNE PERSONA is important because he is the driving force why the Caped crusader is the best at what he does. The movie does a very good potrayal of how he came to be, where he gets his gadgets and stuff. Liamm Neeson is great and the scarecrow was well, scary.

The only complaint I have would be the costume design. It still looks bulky and the cape is a mistake. If you really want to see what Batman is suppose to look like, check out the fan film, BATMAN:DEAD END. The mask and the eyes are perfect. The Batman is believable as a terrifying winged creature of the night.

Overall the movie itself was great. Set designs were in infallible, the new Batmobile was unstoppable and Morgan Freeman was Lucius Fox. Ras al Ghul is my favorite villain. I just hope Nolan does a good Joker  like in the fan film mentioned above.

1574091,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman is a thread in the fabric of everyday life in the U.S. There aren't many little boys who haven't once dreamed of being Batman.

Batman is different from Superman, the X-Men, Spiderman, Aquaman, or the Green Lantern - he's simply a man. He has no super human powers. He doesn't fly, wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider, isn't a mutant, and cannot breathe underwater. Batman is nothing more than the secret identity of the very human Bruce Wayne.

Bruce sought solice in revenge and empowerment in order to fight the very forces of evil that destroyed his family. Oh, he's a very priviledged man (he'd have to be in order to have access to all the very expensive gadgetry that he has at his command), but he's still nothing more than a very strong man - with a iron steel will and fortitude that is quite oftem more strong and resourceful than any of those displayed by the super humans elsewhere written about in comics.

Batman Begins takes us on a journey as described in the Dark Knight comic series. It reinvented the Batman in a very human and more accessible manner. The film does the same.

Nolan's Gotham City may not be New York, but it IS a city from the look of it, not some nightmare vision of a city as Burton envisioned.

Rather than create a nonexistent mythos, Nolan gives us believabe corporate greed and believably corrupt police. Even the ""super villain"" of the film is one that is truly grounded in reality: he's not super at all - he's just really really creepy: the Scarecrow.

The Scarecrow has always been one of my favorite villains, because he is so truly believable. The Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler were all created during WWII. They were villains of the Dick Tracy variety: sinister and evil, but not quite real.

The Scarecrow is nothing more than a psychiatrist who knows how to get inside people's heads using hallucinogenic drugs. Batman Begins' Scarecrow is a business suit wearing creep, who dons a scarecrow mask after he's dosed his victims with his paranoia-inducing drug. The effect is quite creepy on screen. Further the reality quotient of it is high.

Batman Begins is a drama at its heart. It is an action film in its soul. And it is a super hero film in name only. Batman Begins could be a Jackie Chan film, Clint Eastwood, or film of  some similar genre. It falls not too far afield of reality and in doing so builds believability and stregnth.

Finally, there's the thespian chops this film boasts. This is no super-duper big budget name dropping film (there's no terribly miscast Arnold Schwarzenegger).

This film has actors not names. Just off the radar actor Christian Bale stars as Batman. Bale is known to many for his thoughtful and intense portrayals in lesser known Hollywood and independent films.

Alfred, the dutiful butler is played by Michael Caine (not overacting or lazy as he can often be); the incredibly fine actor, Morgan Freeman, gives this film further believabity in his subtly nuanced performance as Lucius Fox. Detective Gordon (who later becomes Commissioner Gordon) is underplayed wonderfully by the incredible Gary Oldman. Rounding out this impressive cast are Katie Holmes (who is quite good and who's character is actually allowed to exist beyond mere window dressing) as Batman's childhood girlfriend; Rutger Hauer as the president of Wayne Enterprises, delivering a performance that may put him back on the radar; irish actor Cillian Murphy gives us the super villain as organized crime's pawn - or is he?; Ralph Fiennes as Ra's Al'Ghul is perfectly cast; and Tom Wilkenson is the head of Gotham's organized crime demonstrates that crime in Gotham doesn't need a mask to be powerful.

Batman Begins is the version we have been waiting for since Warner Brothers announced it was making one (back in 1985). We've been waiting twenty years for the real thing to be delivered. One decent version and three no show versions of Batman in the past twenty years... Where is the real Bathman?

1574093,4,B00005JNJV,"After watching the movie, I finally went out and got issues #404-#407, the issues in which this movie is supposedly based. After reading the comic, there is nothing in the movie that was drawn from this 'Year One' storyline, other than the premise that it shows Batman in the starting years. These issues do not account for Bruce Wayne's 7 year absence, do not refer to any training, does not mention Rha Al Ghul, and spends half the time centered on a young lieutenant Gordon who has just arrived in Gotham.

To review this movie, I wanted to know how true it was to the comic book. And having read the Year One storyline, I still do not know. Having said that, this is probably the best Batman movie made. It establishes a more serious, darker insight into the character. More true to the modern era of Batman, not the kiddie stuff we grew up with in the 70s. It was interesting to see Batman's training, and the rationale as to why a man would want to become a bat.

Cristian Bale is great, and I'm glad to hear he has signed up to do more movies. Katie Holmes had a smaller role than I expected, and this is the first time I've seen Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow), who plays a great villian.

It stays true to the source material, and as true to reality as possible.  Be warned though, this Batman is not for the faint of heart.  Clooney and Kilmer were laughable in their batsuits.  Michael Keaton looked cool enough.  But Christian Bale as Batman is downright scary.  If you think Keaton pulling a thug close to his face and whispering just who he is was scary back in 1989, you've got another thing coming when Bale growls and hisses and hangs criminals upside down over the sides of buildings as they more than likely soil themselves.  All of that, plus the villain (Scarecrow) makes Nicholson's Joker look...like...well, a clown.

1574295,5,B00005JNJV,"In the midst of a rising number of superhero/comicbook films, ""Batman Begins"" stands as a mark against which all others should be measured from here on. Until I saw this film this summer, I said as much about both Spider-Man movies. Sam Rami's take on Peter Parker focuses on his character as much, if not more, than on his powers and daring deeds. Yet both S-1 and S-2 nearly fell into the same trap created by the earlier Superman and Batman films in that we got more about the villians than the main characters.

""Batman Begins"" is a great movie, period. You can enjoy it if you've never seen another Batman film, or another superhero film for that matter, or even if you've never read a single issue of the comic. It may start a bit slow, showing Bruce Wayne's evolution into the Batman, but every second of screen time devoted to it is necessary to the story and allows even those well versed in the character to see and understand this tortured man's evolution into the avenging Dark Knight. And it is the most faithful redition yet of the character as he has been presented by Bob Kane, Dennis O'Neil and Neil Adams, and Frank Miller.

Drawing inspiration from all of the above, the screenplay by Chris Nolan and David Goyer is tight and emotion-packed as well as filled with marvelous action pieces. Their Batman is indeed a ""creature of the night...black...terrible...."" Several moments during the Batman's first appearance will make you jump as if you're watching a tense thriller or horror film. And Christian Bale's performance nails the character from every angle. There a subtlties in his portrayal--body language, expression--that in some scenes project far more than any amount of dialoue could. He carries off Bruce's numerous emotional states, as well as his facade as the ""millionaire playboy"" in a way that no previous actor ever has. The highest compliment I can give him is to say his presentation of the dual character Bruce Wayne/Batman ranks on par with Christopher Reeve's rendition of Clark Kent/Superman in ""Superman, the Movie.""

As for the supporting cast, I never thought anyone could replace Michael Gough as Alfred from the Burton films, but I shouldn't have worried. Though Michael Caine looks nothing like the comic's portrayal of the faithful Wayne butler, he brings off the part with the perfection I've come to expect in Caine's performances.

The big surprise to me was Gary Oldman. I've known for years that the man was an absolute chameleon of an actor, but his casting as the young Jim Gordan also raised some doubts. Until I saw the film. His Gordon is perfect. He looks, acts and sounds like Jim Gordan should. No one has ever played this character better, and it's my sincere hope that the next film(s) explore the relationship between him and Batman.

As for the villians and the lead actress, here is where my only quibble with the film appears, and it's certainly not enough to eliminate a star from my rating. Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes are all marvelous in their respective parts; however, ""Batman Begins"" continues the tradition of the ""two-villian+love-interest"" motif that now plague the superhero film genre. While not nearly as much time is devoted to their storylines or the relationship between childhood friends Bruce and Rachel Dawes, the fact that they are present gave me an, ""Ugh, here we go again"" moment. Without giving anything away, the next film needs to devote its plot to Batman versus a single nemisis just as the original Burton film did. And this time leave the girl out of it. Bruce may have plenty of arm-candy as Gotham's most eligible bachelor, but as in the comics, they should be only that. He shouldn't be close to, and certainly shouldn't wind up in bed with, ANY of them. Fortunately in this film the closest we get to any kind of sex between Rachel and Bruce is a somewhat chliched film-ending kiss, something that made me voice a very relieved ""whew!""

This is by far the best Batman film ever made. It may even be the best superhero film ever made. I'll need to see it a few more time before I decide, but now that it's coming out on DVD, I'll be able to do just that!",1125532800,5,4170,4.729023383768913

Instructed in the Eastern Martial Arts by a strict mentor, played by Liam Neeson, Bruce Wayne learns to conquer his fear of darkness with zen-like mastery and uses his talents to fight crime and corruption in Gotham City. Over time, Bruce learns that fighting crime entails more than just defeating bad guys and taking revenge.  There is a more sinster and familiar threat that is wreaking havoc on Gotham.

Katie Holmes was brilliant as Bruce Wayne's long time yet not quite fulfilled love interest.  Both share a passion for fighting injustice, but is there time to lay aside duty for a moment to be with each other?

This is Batman. This is the Batman, I, my Father, my Mother, My Fiancee, my Brother, and everyone I know has been waiting for. As a fan of the Comics, and of Paul Dini's masterpiece, Batman the Animated Series, I had high expectations of this film.

I didn't particularly care for Burton's Batman, and I couldn't stand Batman Returns. Burton was always more interested in why the villians were the villians, and most of the screen time in both of his films are dedicated to showing us the Villians' origins. Well this movie does not have that problem. This is about Bruce's motivations. This is about a wounded Child, a monster set free by a murderer, and reigned in by self-disipline.

  This is BATMAN:YEAR ONE done right. We see a young Bruce wrestle with the demons of his past, and finally realising that he can never fully exorsize them, he must control them, or they will control him. He has help in the the form of Michael Caine as Alfred, spot on and ego free. I was worried that Michael may be too big a name to play the butler. But Alfred is more the father in this than the Butler, and his worldly advice is always spot on.

Morgan Freeman plays Lucious Fox, Former CEO of Wayne Enterprises, and holder of all those ((if I may steal from Burton and Jack for a Moment)) ""Wonderful Toys"" Morgans has such a wonderful Twinkle in his eye every time he shows off a new toy, you are very very excited for the possibility.

Katie Holmes is a womderful Rachel. A grounded Love interest for Bruce, that keeps him centered on the past that was, and that which was happy.

The always Underated Liam Neeson is an excelent foil to Christian Bale. He proves that Youth and Speed do not trounce Age and Experience.

Ken Watanabe is awesome as Ra's Al Ghul. A vigillanty of the global Order.

Cillian Murphy makes the Scarecrow truely scarry. I was worried that he would just be silly, but I actually jumped in my seat during his scenes.

and Gary Oldman is just fantastic as Lt. Gordon. Not quite the confident ally of Batman yet, he is new to the scene, and is feling things out.

This film is dark. This is the Batman of the comic. There is no neon save the flickering light in the front of a pawn shop. There is nothing gothic other than the oppressive structures of Chicago, New York, and London ((all of which stood in or Gotham, and made me partial to the film from the get go, as a Chicago Filmmaker))

1574300,5,B00005JNJV,"I became a fan of the Dark Knight following Frank Miller's genius ""The Dark Knight Returns"" in the mid-80s. I loved the reinvention of the character, making him darker, brooding, and bordering on psychotic. It was this reinvention that most likely allowed the making of the original Batman movie, as well as its 3 successors. However, I found myself dissecting each of those movies as I exited the theater, feeling dissatisfied with each.

After four previous attempts, two of them bordering on catastrophic, Hollywood has finally gotten it right. This is not your big brother's Batman.

Director Christopher Nolan has stripped away all the flash from the previous two movies, making Gotham City appear to be more like an enormous amusement park, and made it the gritty, murky urban sprawl that Batman fans have come to embrace as the home of Bruce Wayne. We also get much more of a feel as to why Wayne is so tortured and driven to do what he does for the city. The character of Bruce Wayne is the focus of this movie, whereas the villains have been the focus of the previous movies. We learn why Wayne is so tortured, and how deep his psyche is scarred. Story holes are plugged that were left gaping in previous efforts. In time, I believe that Christian Bale will replace Michael Keaton as the general consensus favorite in the role of the Guardian of Gotham, as he truly puts the Dark in Dark Knight.

Perhaps the best part of this edition of the Batman series is the long overdue establishment of the relationship between Batman and Jim Gordon, a police sergeant in this early stage of the legend. In previous movies, the character of Gordon was all but made irrelevant, and in some cases, a buffoon. Gordon is not only a tough cop, but is the only member of the police force that Batman will allow to get close to him. That element is presented flawlessly here.

The acting is better than your average comic book flick. Christian Bale captures perfectly the brood of Batman, as well as the careless, playboy persona of Bruce Wayne. Katie Holmes does a good job in shedding her ""Dawson's Creek"" image, and handles the character of Rachael Dawes well. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the support cast turn in worthy performances in their respective roles. The plot is thicker than previous efforts, and the villains' role in said plot is far from insulting to the intelligence of even a casual Bat-fan.

While this movie has plenty of bangs for the buck, it does not feel like a gratuitous effort. Each special effect has a meaning, and if this movie's intent was to wipe the slate clean, and offer an apology for the previous four Batman movies, then mission accomplished. This is a comic book movie that does not present itself as a comic book movie. Each character and story element is believable, and I sincerely hope that the key elements from this project will be back for a sequel in a few years.

 - Batman consoles Rachel Dawes, as Gotham City's legacy of corruption ends & ""Batman Begins""

""Batman Begins"" is the best ""Batman"" film, to date & is also one of the best films of 2005. Christopher Nolan takes the source material and does something Tim Burton & Joel Schumacher could never do... delivering a worthwhile ""Batman"" you actually care about.

After witnessing the murder of his parents, at the hands of thug, Joe Chill, a young Bruce Wayne is taken care of by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.

Fast forward roughly a decade later as Bruce Wayne returns to Wayne Manor, leaving college, to watch & see if Joe Chill recieves an early release from prison after ratting out Gotham mob boss, Carmine Falcone. When Chill is released, Bruce finds out that the Gotham City he grew up with, has changed into an evil corrupt hellhole run by the mob. His point is proven as a newly freed Chill is shot in cold-blood on the courthouse steps, thanks from hired thugs payed off by Falcone.

Disillusioned, Bruce searches the world for a way to fight injustice. Trying to learn & understand the criminal underworld Bruce is caught as a thief & lands up in a Chinese prison where he meets a mysterious man by the name of Ducard. Ducard offers Bruce a chance to learn what he has been looking for. Bruce accepts his offer & meets Ducard's master, Ras Al Ghul, a sorcerer & extensive master in many martial & mental arts, who has trained Ducard in his ways.

Taken under Ducard's wing, & through extensive & arduous training both mentally (Bruce has to learn to face his fear) as well as physically, Bruce becomes what he had so longed for. But, everything comes with a price & Bruce finds out the true meaning of his training. After passing his final test, Bruce is given an ultimatum. Either, commit his life to serving Ras Al Ghul as a member of his League Of Shadows & help destroy Gotham City, or die. Bruce makes his choice & dedicates his life to saving Gotham City.

Once back in Gotham & with the help of Alfred, Bruce begins to search for items that can help him in aiding his fight on crime. Through his father's former company (now Bruce's), Wayne Enterprises, Bruce finds Lucious Fox, an old friend of his father's who is glad to help him out.

""Does it come in black?""

With the help of a lot of discarded army prototype's that the company gave up on, light weight, bullet-proof armor becomes the batsuit, while memory fabric becomes the basis for the batcape, & a vehicle called the tumbler, that makes the new model Humvee look like a Yugo, becomes the hell-raising Batmobile.

Justice has a new face & for the filth & scum of Gotham City, fear has a new name in the form of..., Batman.

""Why bats sir?""
""Becuase I fear them. It's time my enemies share my dread.""

With the help of former girlfriend turned city attorney, Rachel Dawes & an alliance, partnership with, a future police commisioner, Jim Gordon, the first order of Batman's business is to destroy Falcone and his mob. But, Falcone isn't the only trash that Batman has to take to out. A mad psychiatrist who goes by the name of Scarecrow, who uses a toxin that hallucinates the victim's worst fears, is secretly in league with darker forces. Forces that have a link to Batman & Bruce Wayne's past.

""I can't kill you. But, I'm not going to save you.""

After the horrendous ""Batman & Robin"", I thought this was the end for the ""Batman"" films. There were some rumblings about trying to do something with ""Batman"" in the late 90's, but, nothing concrete to go on. With the success of ""Spider-Man"" & the ""X Men"" films, & not wanting to let the latest comic book to movie fad pass them by, Warner Bros. gave the greenlight for a new ""Batman"" film.

""Why do we fall?""
""So that we learn to pick ourselves up.""
""I thought you'd given up on me.""
""Never.""

Christopher Nolan agreed to direct the film, after being influenced by the ""Batman"" comic serial ""The Long Halloween"" (starting in 2000 ""The Long Halloween"" spanned over a year & is considered to be one of the best ""Batman"" stories of the new millenium). With great respect towards the DC comic & it's long running legacy, Nolan began searching for the new Batman.

He found Batman in the form of Christian Bale. Bale's resume includes the cult film ""American Psycho"", as well as ""Reign of Fire"" & ""The Machinist"". Out of the four actor's who have portrayed the character, for me, Bale is the best Batman (Keaton comes in second, Kilmer third, & Clooney gets the consolation gift). He brings a certain physicality to the role that was somehow missing in the past. Bale, also, seemed to slip into the role easily, since he played this sort of character in the past. A dark revelation that's a bit uncomfortable, is that Patrick Bateman is no Batman but, both Bateman & Bruce Wayne have dual personalities.

The rest of the cast is terrific. Michael Caine gracefully takes over for the great Michael Gough as  the butler, Alfred, bringing warmth & charm to the fatherly figure that Bruce needs.
Katie Holmes is perfect as Rachel Dawes, instead of being the usual Bat-dame, she gives the role smarts.
Rounding out the cast is Morgan Freeman as Lucious Fox, Cillian Murphy, Rutger Hauer, & in an awesome role that I hope he reprises in the sequel (like there isn't gonna be one?!), Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Jim Gordan. Oldman nailed the part of Gordan so well it gave me the creeps. From the feathered back graying hair, the bushy moustache, & the classic glasses & weather beaten trenchcoat Gordan jumped out of the comic book & right onto the screen. Oldman's performance is that good.

I really didn't have any problems with ""Batman Begins"", like I did with the other ""Batman"" films. With Tim Burton's two ""Bat"" films the problem, for me, was that even though the films were dark & gothic (that's not the problem) it was that the films seem to take place in a different part of history, in a different place, just off kilter. Don't get me started with the two Schumacher films! I would be here all day!

1574379,3,B00005JNJV,"I am not a Batman zealot and in fact only saw the first two Batman movies, the first of which was excellent. Therefore, I approached this movie with an open mind: looking for stylishly presented entertainment. Well, hmmm. This movie has a very convoluted story line with lots of characters who look almost identical, and is shot apparently without the aid of any lights. The only person that can be seen clearly is Michael Caine, who also is the only charming and/or accessible character in this morass. For almost 2/3 of the movie I could not tell what was going on because it was simply too dark. I was not alone in this opinion as my four companions (age range from 5 to 66) concurred. That said, the fear-inducing substance part of the story resulted in some great scary effects, Mr. Cruise's girlfriend has a lovely face, and the Batmobile was cool. The movie pays significant homage to the first Batman movie, which is a positive.
Just a note: so the bad guys (Liam ""Qui-Gonn"" Neeson whose still waiting for a role without a samurai sword) vaporize the hallucinogen-tainted water with a giant microwave. However, Ms. Holmes and some extra child hunker down right in front of the thing and all that happens to them is their hair gets decorously blown around. Remember, humans are over 70% water. What would happen in real life?
Now before you diss my review think: how was this movie really, aside from it's heavily marketed mystical appeal? Be honest.",1125014400,3,1457,4.7176470588235295
1574380,5,B00005JNJV,"One would have thought that Batman and Robin would have been the end of the Batman film series but Batman Begins pumps new life into the franchise.  Gone from the new Batman are all of the gimmicks that turned the original series into a parody of the original film directed by Tim Burton.  Christian Bale makes an excellent Bruce Wayne, a figure who is truly haunted and searching for a meaning to life, taking the road less traveled into becoming what he hates until found by the mysterious Ducard.  Mr. Bale is excellent in the exploring the depths of Bruce Wayne as he goes from being a vengeful college student, to being a petty criminal, searching to find himself as Ducard's pupil and finally determined to rid Gotham of crime rejecting the violence of the League of Shadows.

The film is beautifully cast, down to the smaller roles.  Michael Caine does a wonderful job as Alfred, providing a great deal of the film's humor and the necessary reassuring figure for Bruce Wayne.  Before him Michael Gough was the quintessential Alfred but Mr. Caine has made the part his own.  Katie Holmes does well as Wayne's love interest in a part that has little of the sexuality of the prior films but stands as a disapproving figure to Bruce Wayne's playboy image.  Gary Oldman was an inspired choice as Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman is wonderful as the Wayne Enterprises head of Applied Science and Liam Neeson makes a tough minded mentor and later an effective adversary.  Cillian Murphy is very suave as Jonathan Crane transforming himself into the ""Scarecrow"" with a help from the mind altering drug that will shortly be used on Gotham.  I also liked seeing Rutgar Hauer (Blade Runner) in a mainstream movie; most of his film roles seeming to be released only to video.

The film portrays Gotham as a gritty, crime-ridden city with criminals without gimmicks. The effects are limited to just telling the story, avoiding sensational extremes.  Most important, Batman Begins brings back the feel of the comic books, telling a great story.",1125014400,5,2031,4.804597701149425
1574381,4,B00005JNJV,"With a new cast, a new director and a new Batman movie, things could only go up for this, at the time, crumbling franchise. In 1989, Tim Burton brought a new face and look to what people remembered Batman as being in the 60s. Sad to say, that new look lasted six years and before you know it, Batman was as campy as ever, and with nipples.

Well let me tell you there is no Shark Repellant Spray around the Dark Knight's belt, as this time he IS the Dark Knight. Batman is as scary and ruthless as ever, to the point where I expected Michael Keaton to be under that mask.

Batman Begins has one of the best ensemble casts in comic book movie history, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine , Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman (the bad guy from Air Force One for the kids who don't know)and Morgan Freeman amongst others. They all deliver great performances, and made me wonder, what has Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone done lately?

What made this movie so satisfying to me was how much time Batman/Bruce Wayne's background was explained. From Wayne's training to the creation of the Batcave and Batsuit, his almost entire history is explained, something 5 other movies and a handful of TV series forgot to mention.

Overall, this movie was very well done, and I applaud the filmmakers for daunting a hard task; make a Batman movie, and make it GOOD! And they did just that and more. The villains are as evil as Gotham City's worst, and they are involved in some scenes that should I say are...scary? All that I can say is that I eagerly await a possible sequel, but with all the fans this movie has, it would be hard not to make one.",1125014400,3,1628,4.416666666666667
1574382,5,B00005JNJV,"It is rumoured that this film may get nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, and it very well deserves it. I am 15 years old and have been a fan of The Batman for over 11 years. I could not forget that stunned and confused look on my face back in 1997 when I saw Batman & Robin. iwas the type of kid who enjoyed the two Burton films more than Schumacher's films in which back in those days kids enjoyed the last two more than the first two. After watching the slow downfall of the franchise in that film alone (especially when Robin was thrown into that green melted ice cream if you know what scene I mean) I thought that there was a very high chance that another film of Bob Kane and Bill Finger's character would not be made again. There were rumours in the coming years of a Batman Superman film and a Batman Beyond film, but both ideas flunked.

So here I am almost eight years later watching a complete restart of the franchise and it is finally done absolutely right. Bale is by far the greatest portrayl of the character I have ever seen, EVER! Michael Cane is right on the money as Alfred Pennyworth and the supporting cast including Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy and a lot more come together to create a most excellent film which doesn't even feel like a typical comic book film.

It has that mood you must have for a Batman flick, without a type of pseudo-universe created for him like the Tim Burton movies. Too bad Halle Berry didn't wait for this film to become Catwoman.

1574386,5,B00005JNJV,"As a fan of Tim Burton, I like his Batman films, but as a Batman fan, they couldn't have been further from the Batman flavor. Or that's what I thought till Joel Schumacher killed Batman with his 'films'. It's sad when a cartoon has better writing then FOUR feature films combined, but that's all the real Batman fans were left with if they wanted well told intelligent stories about Batman and his multi-layered villains aside from reading the books. That is until a ballsy director and writer came along, those people being Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, and FIXED Batman. Goyer, I had faith in. I'd just hoped he could retain the characters' personalities. Nolan, has MORE than proved he can deliver a dark and gritty Batman film without turning it into dark camp like Burton,or something so insane and flamboyant it would never happen, like Schumacher. I think that's why this film succeeds where the other films failed miserably, because aside from a man in a rag/mask calling himself Scarecrow, and another man in a Batsuit calling himself Batman, the film is camp free, a first for ANY live action Batman representation.

Nolan gives us a gritty city with slums that echo the worst from around the world, AND he makes it dark enough to be very 'Batman' without making it look unnatural. Gotham City is supposed to be ugly and decayed, a virtual urban cesspool of crime, and a nightmare for the viewer. I loved Burton's Gothic flavor, but he couldn't capture reality. Everything felt like a fantastic set, but what Nolan does, is give us something that exists. Part of the nature of this film is the internal. Fears, primal impulses, what drives us to do the things that we do. How does a well meaning person go down a path of corruption? What is a person willing to do for justice and is it that far away from vengeance? These are the things the other films NEVER touched on, or if they did, it was never done right. This film does that. It's gritty, it's a crime movie. I think it's the first time since Batman'89 where organized crime was touched on at all, which is a large staple of the BATMAN comics. Simply put, a great comic book movie with a fantastic digital presentation and the DVD extras are fantastic.",1124841600,4,2227,4.623737373737374
1574387,5,B00005JNJV,"This Film goes back to the basics, and these basics haven't even been scratched by the previous Batman Films. Batman (1989) was great and really enjoyable but unfortunately wasn't timeless. I give it credit because it got non-Batman Fans to explore into the comic books thereby expanding their horizons on the characters in general. Batman Returns & Batman Forever....well they had their ups and downs. (Batman & Robin I exclude totally).

  After a complete out-burst of comic book films post 1999 we see the full grand scale cinematic appearences of all the Marvel Comic Book Heroes. Again, lot of ups and downs! The X-Men Series leaves a good concrete impression as does the Blade Series. Spider-man and Spider-man 2 make their mark in a sugary diabetic sort of way but still leave the viewer a very satisfied customer. Daredevil (highly underated) stays true it self beginning to end. Hulk, decent special effects and style The Punisher, Elektra etc etc.... I honestly have no real complaints as to how these comic films have turned out; I consider them enjoyable, each in their own way.

  Enter 2005, enter Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. It not only Tops the Marvel Universe Movies, it pretty much knocks all of them out of proportion. Christian Bale makes the finest Batman ever, One of the only superhero actors to play his alter ego with the same amount of enthusiasm as he does the title role. This Movie is altogether about Christian Bale as Batman and the rest of the cast (superbly played) blends into the scenes with him (The Main Character). According to me, this in the only comic film that accomplishes that. A Superior Story (David ""The Dude"" Goyer), a Brilliant Cast and an extremely talented Director Nolan make this the most memorable superhero movie ever and one of the greatest contributions in 2005.

Christian Bale played the perfect Batman, showing leadership and fear like the character should be. When I saw Christian Bale in the batsuit, I thought ""Now that is Batman"".

1574484,5,B00005JNJV,"When Marvel comic books begin, their intro before the opening credits is a montage of images similar to those found in their colourful comic books. Marvel have had this intro since `Spider-Man'.

Now with a resurgence of interest, if somewhat forced interest in

Batman, DC Comics has a similar opening title. The previous, later four Batman films do not.

I also feel `Batman Begins' is trying to add more to a story

that does not need much if any back story. For instance there is no Rachel character portrayed by Katie Holmes. So here I think they are trying to give Batman a love interest and he didn't originally have one. I see `Spider-Man' again in the characters of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. Don't get me wrong I LOVE stories like this between childhood sweethearts, but here I don't think it really worked.

I only saw this movie for Katie, who I enjoyed since I enjoy her

other films. In this she is like a different actress. I was VERY

impressed! I have seen all Katie's films except `Pieces of

April', and `First Daughter'. I'm sure to see these movies one

day. I am currently watching her grow up in `Dawson's Creek'. Like watching Ronny Howard transform before our eyes on `The Andy Griffith Show' and `Happy Days', I enjoy watching young actors grow up, and see where they go.

I can relate more to Marvel Comics. Their heroes and villains exist in a world not unlike our own. While Gotham City exists only in one's mind. I can't really relate. It's not real. Sometimes it helps to be real sometimes it doesn't.

`Batman Begins' villain is `Scarecrow'. He feeds on

the fear of the public and the fear of Batman. For Marvel fans think of `Daredevil's dilemma. He is sometimes called `The Man Without Fear'.

I enjoy the other Batman films. I particularly like `Batman

Forever' and `Batman & Robin'. They don't take themselves too

seriously, and are funny. `Batman Begins' is a much darker film like Tim Burton's interpretation, but different. Instead `Batman Begins' adds credit to `Batman' with a Joker card and Batman's line ""I'll look into it"".

There is a totally huge list of famous celebrities for this

instalment of `Batman Begins'. Christian Bale (American

Psycho) doesn't do much for me. Neither does Michael Caine but he suits the part of Alfred. The whole cast is impressive. I also was impressed with Christopher Nolan's direction. I was glad he was director because I had seen his previous film, `Insomnia', with Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank and loved it.

I'm glad I saw this movie. I love the image of Katie Holmes lying

limp in Batman's arms. It really is quite beautiful to me.

I'm sure this film will not disappoint fans of the comic books or

previous films. No one has to go through dark times alone. I know Batman is a hero for many young children so all the more power to you all. Everyone was a child at some point in their life. I think it is important to never loose that child like sensibility. So no matter what you do when you're young keep it fun! You'll grow up before you know it!",1124755200,,3060,4.586397058823529
1574485,5,B00005JNJV,"When i first heard they were making a new Batman movie, i thought, it won't be better than the old ones. That was before i went and watched the old ones again, as I hadn't seen them in years.  The first one in 89 was good, but after that, they all completely blowed.  I mean, they just sucked.  The acting was horrible, it was so stupid, it seemed like a comedy.

Then I saw the trailer for Batman Begins, and it was amazing.  I have seen the movie 3 times so far, not to mention once in IMAX, and am going to see it again.  It was just awesome.  At first, i didn't like the different look of batman or the batmobile, but you grow to like it, and now i absolutely love it.  The acting was great, and Liam Neeson was a great actor for Ra's.  I liked the new,tougher, almost criminal, Bale as Batman.  He was a great actor as well.

As the other review mentioned, the music for a movie can destroy it, or make it incredible.  The old batman movies had freakin circus music and Prince, what the heck.  Hans Zimmer is amazing with this movie.  Already creating incredible soundtracks for Gladiator and King Arthur, for example, he was perfect for Batman.  The music makes the exciting action scenes 20 times better.  I honestly got chills when i watched this movie, it was so good.  For example, the final scene of the train, the music made the scene so much more action packed.  And the ""scary"" parts, or more disturbing parts with the toxin being inhaled by batman and other people, made THOSE scenes perfect as well.

The new batmobile is simply amazing.  When i first saw it, before i saw the movie, i was like ""o no, not a dang tank!""  But i later loved it, more than the old crappy ones with the flimsy ""wings"" on it.  It is just more tough and has better gadgets, like the spike strips, or more spike balls, for that matter.

Batman's outfit is much better in these movies.  It doesn't look like crappy rubber or stuff like that, cuz its not.  And the guy who said earlier that he can barely move his head, well, he moves it plenty.  Compared to the old movies, he looks like he isn't even wearing the cowl. In the old ones, there wasn't any head movement at all, he had to move his whole body.  Then there is his cape.  This is the best cape ever made. Batman doesn't have to hold sticks out to make it look like his cape is up.  He can actually glide on it.  Its just so much better.

Anyways, that finishes my review. This movie was the best movie i've seen in a long time.  It makes me happy to know that it wasn't really associated with the old ones, and it isn't part of that franchise.  I wouldn't want to be known for those pitiful attempts.  I can't wait till the deluxe edition comes out.  I also can't wait till the next movie comes out, with the Joker and all.",1124582400,16,2775,4.2110266159695815
1574486,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is in no way linked to the previous 4 movies in any way (and thank god, in my opinion).

The cast in the film is superb. Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. As many know, these are really two different parts because Bruce Wayne is really the fake, public persona wheras Batman is when Bruce Wayne shows his true identity. They finally touch on this, and it is done beautifully. Also, Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lt. Jim Gordon - and thankfully this character is done in such an awesome fashion. He is Batman's only friend and a great cop on a terribly corrupt police force in this movie, the way the character was meant to be. Michael Caine really shines as Alfred and the character is portrayed wonderfully. Liam Neeson is spectacular as Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor. Cillian Murphy is twisted and creepy as the Scarecrow without being over the top whatsoever. And Morgan Freeman's performance is great  in the few memorable scenes he is in. Katie Holmes also really gives a great performance as Bruce's lifetime friend and Gothams Assistant DA.

As far as the plot goes - it is fantastic. Christopher Nolan and David Goyer wrote a great script with an incredibly touching and suspensful plot. The action scenes are really incredible as well, and all of the action is necessary to the plot and extremely well edited.

One of the most wonderful things about this movie is the realism that is consistent throughout the movie. Gone are the ridiculous neon lights of Schumacher's movies and the extreme Gothic tone of Burton's. You really feel that Batman could exist in this Gotham City - even so much that this movie doesn't feel like a ""superhero"" movie,it feels like a man going out for revenge. It really goes above and beyond the genre to create a very realistic movie.

This movie is a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and a MUST OWN for anyone who likes having great superhero movies. This film is by far the most realistic comicbook movie ever made.",1124582400,8,1996,4.659090909090909
1574487,5,B00005JNJV,"In my opinion, no one can top the Batman movies that Tim Burton directed. However, Tim Burton aside, this was the best Batman movie ever and I can't wait for the next one. First of all, it actually had good actors in it. I think Keaton is the best Batman/Wayne but Bale did very well. Kilmer wasn't that great and Clooney was the worst choice of Batman EVER. Caine was perfect as Alfred (though I will miss Michael Gough) and Gary Oldman (a great actor anyway) reminded me exactly of Gordon from the animated series from the 90's. Also, the addition of Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman was just amazing. Secondly, the storyline was awesome; they went the best way about it. It brought the dark back in the Dark Knight and showed the origins and training with the ninjas. It set up the process of designing the suit and Batcave. And also showed how actually frightening bats can be. Lastly, the bad guys. The scarecrow was a perfect villain to have and a great addition to the Joker (Nicholson), Catwoman (Pfeiffer), and the Penguin (DeVito) and was actually somewhat scary. Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman being the only good actor in Batman & Robin) and Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent are left out of that list because of just how crappy Batman Forever and Batman & Robin were (correction -- are). And the Riddler is left out because Jim Carrey played him too much like the Joker, however Carrey would have been a great Joker he is not a great Riddler. The one thing I didn't like about the movie was the ass-ugly Batmobile and I seem to be the only one who thinks it is ugly, however, it had all the cool gadgets that are complete Batman style.

The story is great, as well as the story, cast, writing/directing, and morals. The best Batman since ""Batman Forever"", this one's definately worth your time, and money.",1124409600,4,636,5.165048543689321
1574489,5,B00005JNJV,"DC is doing it again. Let's face it, when one pictured the ""Dark Knight"" of Frank Miller, did they expect a Cesar Romero Joker in Burton's Batman? No. Did they expect pop music and ""chick's dig the car""? No. And who didn't think of ""Scooby Doo Meets Batman"" when Clooney pulled out the Batman Credit Card?

Honstly I was expecting Batman V to have Alfred serving bat cookies.

Finally they get it right! Batman is above all a drama. It is about the humanity behind these characters, not the joke cracking Webhead.

DC realises that Batman is an intelligent comic. While certainly some of the character over the years were over the top, my generation found a Batman and his archvillians who were DANGEROUS. They were characters who were three dimensional. They were flesh and blood and could be coming to a city near you.

Who doesn't laugh with the line, ""love that Joker""? This time, Batman's enemy Scarecrow was a freaky character with an actor who, no offense, looked like Joan Rivers in cosmetic surgery heaven. If that isn't scary, I don't know what is.

Batman needed to be fleshed out and in this film he was. Yes, it was more about Bruce Wayne. And Smallville is about Clark Kent. But this is what makes Batman interesting, in that he is an alter-ego, not the person himself. By coming to gripes with people we reach an emotional attachment, an in depth analysis of how they tick. We care for them. And this is the purpose of drama, which Batman is.

I honestly have no desire to contrast Keaton with Bale,because they are two different versions of Batman. Keaton was good at what he did. In fact, when comparing to Kilmer and Clooney, give me Keaton all day and all night. However, Bale's Batman is what we have all been dreaming about, namely a Batman that showed true purpose and that became real.

My apologies because I think most here have been much more eloquent and detailed in their reviews.

Looking forward to the next one.",1124409600,10,1942,4.592485549132948

Batman Begins comes as a nice surprise.

The film draws a lot of visual inspiration from the actual comics and looks all the more impressive for it. The storytelling is done at a decent pace, giving each stage just enough time to have an impact before moving on. On the acting front Liam Nesson is excellent as always, Michael Cane as Alfred is brilliant as well serving as the comic relief. Katie Holmes is a bit disappointing but her role is largely forgettable. Christian Bale does an excellent job of re-imagining Bruce Wayne. Watch out for Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow....genius in the making.... Just goes to show, with this and Sin City looks like Hollywood is turning a to a ""real"" look for comic book films.",1124409600,3,959,4.77710843373494
1574491,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman has been brought back to full life and over powers all the rest except the fist one, because I'm still a fan of the first Batman but this one is purely fun and exciting with satisfaction written all over it. Christian Bale (American Psycho) jumps into the role as Bruce Wayne, who has had a fear of bats all his life. His father Thomas Wayne, played by actor Linus Roache (The Forgotten) and his wife were killed by a thug. Wayne grows up in the hands of Alfred Pennyworth, played superbly by Michael Caine (Get Carter). Years later the thug that killed his parents is found not guilty and is shot coming out of the court room. So, Bruce Wayne turns to the life of crime and ends up in a prison camp where later he meets a man named Henri Ducard, played nicely by Liam Neeson (Kingdom Of Heaven), who tells Bruce Wayne that he can become a ""legend"". So, Bruce Wayne goes to the temple of Ra's Al Ghul, played by Ken Wantanabe (The Last Samurai), and begins his training but Ra's Al Ghul has devious things in plan which Wayne doesnt want to be apart of, so Wayne fights his way out of there saving Ducard's life. So, Wayne returns from being gone 7 years and his father's company being run by another man, who is played by Rutger Hauer (Sin City). Plus, Gotham City is corrupt all over by the hands of Falcone, played with a overhammed Tom Wilkinson (Rush Hour). Wayne's childhood sweetheart Rachel, played by Katie Holmes (The Gift) is on the verge of getting rid of Falcone and his scum. Enter Dr. Jonathan Crane, played with balls by Cillian Murphy (Red Eye), who puts on a orangish sack over his face spraying his victims with a powder substance that the victim can see what they fear....his villain name is called The Scarecrow. Soon, Wayne becomes Batman...a very buff Batman with help from his father's friend Lucious Fox, a very groovy Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) and Wayne also has the help from cop Cheif Gordon, played by Gary Oldman (State Of Grace). Soon, Wayne finds out that the baddies are trying to poison the water supply and an old friend is behind it all. Fast, fierce and exciting....much, much better then 1997's Batman and Robin which was a big disappointment with the Batman suit having nipples and Clooney's unconvincing performance. Bale makes his role his own putting a twist on it and he works it out perfectly. Also starring Mark Boone Juinor (Se7en) as Gordon's corrupt partner.",1124409600,,2424,4.574712643678161

  Folks,if you haven't seen this 'Bat movie',and are planning to,then before you do,watch the following movies:

  Batman '89

  Batman Returns

  Batman Forever

  the Shadow (with Alec Baldwin)

  Spider-Man

  any James Bond movie

  Nolan,and Goyer totally steal/rip-off concepts from all of the above mentioned movies,and they do not even try to be subtle about it.

  Batman '89: black rubber suit,villian is responsible for the death of Bruce's parents hence motivation for being Batman is resolved,and over the top Batmobile.

  Batman Begins: rip off of Batman '89.

  Batman Returns: black rubber suit,'glider-cape',and stun gun is used to defeat one of the villians.

  Batman Begins: rip off of Batman Returns.

  Batman Forever: Two different rubber suits,and Bruce makes peace/accepts being Batman as a choice,no longer 'captive' to the 'ghosts' of his parents' death.

  Batman Begins: rip off of Batman Forever (pay attention to Kilmer's second suit,compare that to Bale's suit...hmmmmmm...

Also,does Bale wear some type of second suit [perhaps slight modification]? Pay attention to last scene of Begins.

  the Shadow: Begins rips off the beginning of the Shadow for the idea of Bruce's training.

  Spider-Man: Begins rips off Spider-Man's resolution for its' love story.

  James Bond: Begins rips off the Bond/Q relationship in order for Bruce to come upon his 'Bat stash'.

  Folks,you have read/heard about how awful the action scenes are edited,yes? It gets worse! The non-action scenes are truly edited for the ADD/ADHD crowd. (I suspect that Nolan was a huge fan of MTV while growing up.)

  Bale,you had a chance to be a great Bat,but thanks to the awful script,and editing you never had a chance. You are,sadly,in the same boat that Clooney found himself in.

  In time,this movie will be revisited,and acknowledged for the pointless waste that it is.

  Alan Horn,you greenlighted this piece of dreck. You should be ashamed.

  Folks,one more thing. What do all the previous Bat movies have in common? Big 'over the top' endings. What does Begins have? A big 'over the top' ending,and that is the last thing you should have for when Batman is just beginning!",1124409600,8,2380,5.137931034482759

Liam Neeson is superb as Ducard and the character of the Scarecrow is great.  The hallucinations that people see while under the effects of Scarecrow are some of the best, intense special effects in the film.  Katie Holmes?...no! no! no!  Find someone much more suited to be an assistant D.A.!  She added zero value to the film.

The fight scenes at times were hard to follow.  Almost too much action and they always seemed to be a minute too long.

1574573,3,B00005JNJV,"yes, its true, bale was boring in this. heck, the whole story was boring. i felt like hollywood was trying so hard to up beat this franchise while i was watching this, i just couldn't by into it. this is not about batman. its about bruce wayne. and theres hardly any batman in it. cmon. hollywood, don't you know that you can make a serious batman AND have batman in it too? guess not. heh, maybe the sequel will be cool. i mean, its gonna have joker (i hope). the villians were boring in this one too. and whats with these nolan-ites (i like to call them that) putting down keaton for? he was a great batman, and IMO is the still the best. i really had high hopes for bale but he just didn't click with me. his bruce wayne was good, but his batman really went into the deep end. keaton hardly spoke, and when he did, it was staright foward and sound badass. bale just wouldnt stop talking, and the way he made his lips move like when in the scene when he was talking about the ""panicinducingtoxin"", can you say ""marble mouth""? the cowl was on his face too damn tight, and it annoyed me. he could hardly turn his head, even after all the hype he barely could move at all. and whats with this ""microwave emitter"" crap? what was it? what did it do? it took me 3 viewings to figure that out. its simply just canon. also, i just wasn't diggin the batmobile in this film, again, ANOTHER huge change i didn't like. it was TOO BIG, not sleek and cool like the 1989 batmobile that keaton drove. NOTHING beats the keaton car, for me at least. there just wasn't anything i really liked about this film except some of the performances, like michael caine and gary oldman (though he wasn't much different from past roles). the ""origin"" was fine, but i guess i just wanted a bat- movie that wasn't overly campy with good story and batman action, this was just TOO much bruce wayne and WAY too much katie fricken holmes. she was just horrible. pissed me off most of the time. just like these keaton haters are. don't listen to them. there just goin along with the crowd. keaton is the best batman and im pretty confident you feel the same way. keatons voice was deadly and cold, while bales was just blabby and ""oh i had to much to eat, thats why im talking funny"" voice. bale also over-did the ""angry"" thing, like some stupid annoying goth kid, annoyed me. and what was corny was the way they shot those ""swooping"" scenes where bale would ""swoop"" from the top of the cave to the bottom, oh brother! and whats with this lucious fox guy pretending to be Q from james bond? ugh. and why do i care where batman gets all his stuff, duh, he works at wayne enterprises! he can get anythging he wants!! it doesnt take a genious to figure THAT out. hollywood is just trying to spoonfeed the audience WAY to much in this movie, acting like we're stupid. ugh. bale simply couldn't top michael keaton as the dark knight in my eyes, and i just didn't get the same fun, awsome feeling that i got/get when i watch the burtons films. and bales ""im batman"" simply couldn't match with keatons quiet, controlled ""im batman"" from 89. bale was doing a bad ripoff of keatons line, we i agree with the below poster, he OWNS.

in short, i give this a three for good performances by the actors, but not my favorite bat -film and not what i expected from a batman movie. at all. keaton is still my favorite and maybe in the sequel, bale will prove me otherwise.",1124323200,5,3422,4.313664596273292
1574574,5,B00005JNJV,"They got it! Other than BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES no other Batman movie or TV show has ever ""got"" Batman. I'm a big Batman fanatic, been reading and collecting Batman comics for over 25 years, have a room full of Batman related merchandise (nothing from the movies though) and I had given up hope of there ever being a good non-animated Batman film. I hated BATMAN & ROBIN but who didn't? I also absolutely HATE Tim Burton's Batman films. Burton did what HIS version of Batman would be not THE Batman that has been around 60 plus years.

BATMAN BEGINS is Batman, Bale captured the rage that hides behind Bruce Wayne's harmless facade. The filmakers understand that Batman IS the man, Bruce Wayne is the mask. This is a man on the edge, a grown man still traumatized by his parents murder, he s full of rage at the world that allowed it to happen but he is NOT insane as some seem to think. The fact that he still believes that the world in general and Gotham City in particular is what helps him hold onto his sanity.

The movie is dark, visually and thematically as it should be. It is also grounded in reality, all the tools and villians are plausible in a real world (the car is one low point, it would have been a cool vehicle in another movie, maybe a Bond film but it didn't feel like a BATMOBILE).

1574577,5,B00005JNJV,"Before this movie, Batman had never really been accurately portrayed on the silver screen. But, now he has...  This IS the definitive Batman film.  Not only is it a great superhero/action film - it is a wonderful film in general.

Batman Begins is a reboot for the Batman movie franchise; it is in no way linked to the previous 4 movies in any way (and thankfully, in my opinion).  It is an origin story of one of America's most popular characters and it delves into the character of the Dark Knight in ways that have not been seen on the silver screen before.

We ""begin"" with a young Bruce Wayne and get a feel for the wonderful, loving childhood he had until his parents were tragically murdered in front of his own eyes by a bum on the streets of Gotham.  We then follow a grown up Bruce all around the world as he learns what it is like to live without a home or money and as he seeks the means to fighting injustice some time after the death of his parents.  We learn why it is that he chooses to become a man dressed like a giant bat and how he acquires the weapons and technology needed to fight the criminals of Gotham and to restore peace to his beloved city.  Even the functionality of every part of the suit from the cape to the ears on the cowl is explained.  That's just a glimpse of the attention to detail that this movie takes into allowing us to know this character.

Also, we really get to know Bruce Wayne in Begins.  He really has such a great character arc and we really feel for the character long before he ever dons the cape and cowl. Bruce Wayne/Batman is clearly the central character in this movie, which the previous live-action films failed to accomplish.

The cast in the film is superb.  Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  As many know, these are really two different parts because Bruce Wayne is really the fake, public persona wheras Batman is when Bruce Wayne shows his true identity.  They finally touch on this, and it is done beautifully.  Also, Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lt. Jim Gordon - and thankfully this character is done in such an awesome fashion.  He is Batman's only friend and a great cop on a terribly corrupt police force in this movie, the way the character was meant to be.  Michael Caine really shines as Alfred and the character is portrayed wonderfully.  Liam Neeson is spectacular (as always) as Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor.  Cillian Murphy is wonderfully twisted and creepy as the Scarecrow without being over the top whatsoever.  And Morgan Freeman's performance is great (as always) in the few memorable scenes he is in.  Katie Holmes also really gives a great performance as Bruce's lifetime friend and Gotham Assistant DA.

As far as the plot goes - it is fantastic.  You are really drawn into this movie for its entirety.  Christopher Nolan and David Goyer wrote a great script with an incredibly touching and suspensful plot.  Nolan also directed flawlessly.  The action scenes are really incredible as well, and all of the action is necessary to the plot and extremely well edited.

One of the most wonderful things about this movie is the realism that is consistent throughout the movie.  Gone are the ridiculous neon lights of Schumacher's movies and the extreme Gothic tone of Burton's.  You really feel that Batman could exist in this Gotham City - even so much that this movie doesn't feel like a ""superhero"" movie.  It really goes above and beyond the genre to create a very realistic movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy and appreciate at the same time.  It may be a little bit on the scary side for younger kids - but there is hardly any objectional content in this movie otherwise (which I greatly appreciate).

This movie is a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and a MUST OWN for anyone who likes having great movies to watch any time.  Check this one out.  It is an extremely fine film, and one of my favorites that I have ever seen.",1124236800,3,3948,4.520451339915374

1574579,5,B00005JNJV,"This movie returned Batman to his dark roots, and don't get me wrong, I like Batman with Michael Keaton, despite its many flaws, but that doesn't even come close to touching Batman Begins. The only thing that does is the animated series from the 90s. (Mark Hamill will forever be The Joker in my mind, and let's face it Jack was just being Jack, not the Clown Prince of Crime) Great film, score, acting, action, plot, etc. I can't say enough good things about it. The ending just sets up the sequels so beautifully. It makes reference to Batman: Year One. Batman Begins is the Batman film I've been waiting for.

As for the other guys comments on Bale's Batman sucking. I don't get how you get sucking, especially since sucking would imply something horrible and nothing could be worse than either Kilmer or Clooney's Batman. Batman Begins was about Batman/Bruce Wayne. Batman was about the Joker more so than Batman. And Bale made Batman frightening (i.e. the scene where he takes out Falcone's thugs, and the scene where he interogates Flass) Anyway, it's not just an amazing comic book movie, it's an amazing movie, and the first live action Batman movie to get it right.",1124236800,10,1174,4.699029126213592

Bale was a good bruce wayne, but a horrible batman. ppl who are expecting a batman movie will be a bit dissapointed. this is more like (im not making this up) ""bruce wayne"" begins, and i just wish there was more ""batman action"" in it. i enjoyed the movie as a ""movie"", but not so much as a ""batman"" movie. that one is for keaton.

in short, bale is a great bruce wayne, horriblr batman.

 the rest of the cast is good, great even. i recomend this film to anyone who loves a good al round movie, but if your looking for batman action and iconic moments, look no further then BATMAN (1989) and Batman Returns (1992).

oh and christian bales ""im batman"" sucked. just thought i'd let you know. keaton owns that line.

ppl who say that jack stole the show in Batman (1989) should be slapped, cuz he did not. i hardly remember anything about the joker, all i remember is keatons awsome seriousness and brooding nature, IMO the PERFECT batman, the way he should be. also, that scene with flass made me hyserical. i just couldn't take his constipated-looking forced-angry face seriously. his mouth in that scene looked like he was about to blow up, LOL. srry, just the truth. and whats with ppl saying this batman ""finally got it right"" B.S.? keatons batman and the seuqel batman returns seemed to hit the spirit of batman quite good and stood true to the spirit of bob kane, creators, original vision of the character, so no point in saying ""bale got it right"" when thats not entirely true. in the comics, liam neesons character ""ras al guhl"" NEVER tranied bruce wayne, and was NOT also called ducard. its simply canon, alsong with that silly ""microwave weapon"" plot canon. meant to be real? okay....ive heard some wacko explanations for this thing, but its simply canon, just like the jokers ""smilex gas"" weapon in B89 (whcih i find more believeable then this ""emitter"" crap). also, bales batman simply wouldnt SHUT UP. thats what i loved about keaton, he was angry but with a sense of restrant and controlled anger, all the while not blowing up in ppls faces like a crazed bale, oops, i mean batman.",1124150400,3,2305,4.5047846889952154
1574682,5,B00005JNJV,"This is, hands down, the finest movie I have seen in years.  To compare it to other *good* films in recent memory, it has the visual depth of Harry Potter 3, twice the emotional resonance of Spidey 2, and enough total satisfaction to have me seriously consider burning my Batman DVD collection of the Burton/Schumaker films in effigy.

I remember all of the hype leading up to Batman in '89, only to leave the theater feeling disappointed in a movie that had less to do with the title character and more to do with his arch-enemy.  When it came out on video, the AV place where I worked kept it in the VCR 24/7, and I quickly realized how annoying the movie became in the second hour with Vicky Vale's incessant screaming (this from a woman who supposedly photographed smouldering bodies on the front lines of war). I remember hating Batman Returns upon its release, only to gain some respect for it over the years as I've grown to appreciate Tim Burton's visual style.  And with the revolving door around the man in the cape and cowl, I watched the franchise ultimately descend to B&R, the biggest pile of garbage in recent movie history, hated more than Battlefield Earth because it ruined characters that we were already connected to.

In a rare move of genius, the WB suits allowed the filmmakers to  reboot the whole franchise with this film.  The result is a film that isn't bound to established rules.  It stands on its own and shines in its darkness.

Batman Begins ranks with Superman: The Movie as the greatest comic adaptation of all time.  But it transcends being a comic adaptation.  It's a stellar movie all on its own.

Hans Zimmer's is simple, riviting, emotional. A score can make or break a film, and Zimmer once again does not disappoint.  It underscores how weak Danny Elfman's Spider-Man scores are, and it even eclipses Elfman's Batman scores.  Accomplishing what Elfman can never seem to do, it heightens the tension and manipulates the audience's emotions, invoking the proper emotion for each scene.

Nolan is more than an auteur -- he is an artist, and this will be the pivotal moment in his career, much as Jaws was for Spielberg. The press leading up to this film noted that Nolan effortlessly pulled the whole thing together, turning in the film on time and on budget, as though already he had years of experience directing big budget epics. Clearly his confidence and lack of pretentiousness allowed the actors to deliver pitch-perfect performances. If the cast isn't strained, that comes through in a film.

Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne in a fresh way, with a youthful vigor that the ""older"" character hasn't shown, and yet much darker and scarier.  This is the Batman you don't want to meet in a dark alley.

The supporting cast is rife with talent whose names preceed them -- but this has been true of every Bat-film.  What makes this cast stand out from the films of the past is that they have checked their egos at the door, and clearly showed up to act.  None of the performances are phoned-in here.

Regarding Katie Holmes, as one who never watched an episode of Dawson's Creek or any of her previous films, I was able to judge her performance in this film quite objectively.  She rose to the challenge of her more seasoned costars, delivering an excellent performance that hopefully will result in her character's return in future films.  Having a female interest who returns in a Batman film is a chance for Bruce Wayne to truly develop emotionally.  And it can even lead to the catalyst for the much-wanted Batman vs. Superman.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

I reiterate, this is the finest movie, end to end, that I've seen a long while.  We have come to accept mediocrity in small and large doses in recent cinema, but I experienced not a single cringeworthy moment in the entire film.  Not one.  I have not been so throroughly entertained at the movies in years.  The Matrix sequels, The Harry Potter movies, Lord of the Rings, the X-men movies, the Spider-Man movies ... these are all films that I've loved in this decade and watched again and again. But Batman Begins blew them all away for me. If those movies were home runs in their own right, Batman Begins is a grand slam.",1124150400,32,4234,4.651881720430108
1574683,5,B00005JNJV,"Before this movie, Batman had never really been accurately portrayed on the silver screen. But, now he has...  This IS the definitive Batman film.  Not only is it a great superhero/action film - it is a wonderful film in general.

Batman Begins is a reboot for the Batman movie franchise; it is in no way linked to the previous 4 movies in any way (and thankfully, in my opinion).  It is an origin story of one of America's most popular characters and it delves into the character of the Dark Knight in ways that have not been seen on the silver screen before.

We ""begin"" with a young Bruce Wayne and get a feel for the wonderful, loving childhood he had until his parents were tragically murdered in front of his own eyes by a bum on the streets of Gotham.  We then follow a grown up Bruce all around the world as he learns what it is like to live without a home or money and as he seeks the means to fighting injustice some time after the death of his parents.  We learn why it is that he chooses to become a man dressed like a giant bat and how he acquires the weapons and technology needed to fight the criminals of Gotham and to restore peace to his beloved city.  Even the functionality of every part of the suit from the cape to the ears on the cowl is explained.  That's just a glimpse of the attention to detail that this movie takes into allowing us to know this character.

Also, we really get to know Bruce Wayne in Begins.  He really has such a great character arc and we really feel for the character long before he ever dons the cape and cowl. Bruce Wayne/Batman is clearly the central character in this movie, which the previous live-action films failed to accomplish.

The cast in the film is superb.  Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  As many know, these are really two different parts because Bruce Wayne is really the fake, public persona wheras Batman is when Bruce Wayne shows his true identity.  They finally touch on this, and it is done beautifully.  Also, Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lt. Jim Gordon - and thankfully this character is done in such an awesome fashion.  He is Batman's only friend and a great cop on a terribly corrupt police force in this movie, the way the character was meant to be.  Michael Caine really shines as Alfred and the character is portrayed wonderfully.  Liam Neeson is spectacular (as always) as Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor.  Cillian Murphy is wonderfully twisted and creepy as the Scarecrow without being over the top whatsoever.  And Morgan Freeman's performance is great (as always) in the few memorable scenes he is in.  Katie Holmes also really gives a great performance as Bruce's lifetime friend and Gotham Assistant DA.

As far as the plot goes - it is fantastic.  You are really drawn into this movie for its entirety.  Christopher Nolan and David Goyer wrote a great script with an incredibly touching and suspensful plot.  Nolan also directed flawlessly.  The action scenes are really incredible as well, and all of the action is necessary to the plot and extremely well edited.

One of the most wonderful things about this movie is the realism that is consistent throughout the movie.  Gone are the ridiculous neon lights of Schumacher's movies and the extreme Gothic tone of Burton's.  You really feel that Batman could exist in this Gotham City - even so much that this movie doesn't feel like a ""superhero"" movie.  It really goes above and beyond the genre to create a very realistic movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy and appreciate at the same time.  It may be a little bit on the scary side for younger kids - but there is hardly any objectional content in this movie otherwise (which I greatly appreciate).

This movie is a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and a MUST OWN for anyone who likes having great movies to watch any time.  Check this one out.  It is an extremely fine film, and one of my favorites that I have ever seen.",1124150400,14,3948,4.520451339915374
1574684,3,B00005JNJV,"Batman has always been a cool character.

In the old days he used to carry a gun and had that wondrous utility belt filled with who-knows-what to thwart his enemies. Later through various television takes, he was the 'detective' solving riddles and jokes staged by the appropriate villains. (Followed by an occasional dance here and there.) Nevertheless, it was still pretty cool if not entertaining. Much later in 1986, Frank Miller's take on 'The Dark Knight' was just that 'Dark'. Wonderfully futuristic and fabulously written with that nail biting hard edge that finds it's way into every Miller story (Sin City, 300)

There's no denying that Tim Burton's 'Batman'(1989) reflects Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns' mini series. For one, Keaton played the voice dark and sinister when wearing the mask. The way we heard it in our minds as we read through Miller's masterpiece. Up to that point Batman had only been voiced in cartoons and live television as a problem solver, with an almost 'Sherlock Holmes' quality. Hardly reflecting the gritty 'I'm Batman' line that was so viciously spat in the faces of unsuspecting criminals of both Burton's and now Nolan's 'Batman Begins'

CONCEPT GRIPE:

So why only three stars for B.B.? Well, lets just say, simply, it had it's good and bad points. I guess I had expectations for a better movie.

These things happen.

As an obviously more realistic take on the 'Batman' story, for me B.B's flaws start with just that topic. Should the Batman series be so realistic? No one questions this because they automatically think that realism is a plus when dealing with comic book stories.

Well, we've all seen that guy dressed as Batman at the comic conventions or during Halloween. It doesn't get any more realistic than that. As he walks by, we can't help but sneer to ourselves, 'he doesn't look like the real Batman'. In retrospect, I think we're sneering because this guy is in a costume that looks its best leering over rainy rooftops in the dark of night....however, this caped crusader is casually walking through the convention with a chili dog in one hand and a diet soda in the other. I guess my point is that realism doesn't always work for every character. I feel that Batman works best in comics and animation and if you're doing a take on him for live action, it should have those elements noticeably involved.

Batman Begins does have it's 'comic book' moments, but over all (and according to the praise of most critics) I think they were really trying to impress us with the 'realistic' approach. Unfortunately, at times, when Bale took the screen in costume, I couldn't help thinking about that guy at the convention with the chili dog...

MOVIE: GRIPES AND CHEERS IN BRIEF

GOOD: The film answers (in it's own way) lots of 'why' questions about the Bruce to Batman faze.

BAD: Bruce Wayne trains with ninjas for months or years or whatever and doesn't realize their philosophy about killing.

BAD: Fight scenes are too dark and too fast. Pull back for a sec...

GOOD: Oldman's take on Gordon is one piece of realism that grounds the movie. His acting is surprisingly subtle.

BAD: Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow is fine and all, but I'd rather have had a villan that didn't need to take his mask on and off when on screen.

GOOD: Michael Cain's Alfred is well played and written.

BAD: Katie Holmes: a threat to the Mob? Really?

BAD: The Bat Tank made it's appearance too soon. Save it for Frank Miller's futuristic take on an aging Bruce Wayne in 'The Dark Knight Returns'.

GOOD: Bruce Wayne's playboy antics involving wet women and buying a Hotel. Nice.

BAD: B.B's climatic ending is a bit cliche involving former masters and train crashes. I would expect more fight out of the man who trained Batman.
Should have let him escape.

BAD: The relationship between Christian and Katie. I wasn't buyin' it.

BAD: No strong 'bad guy' presence even though the story had plenty of them in it. Nolan's film is primarily viewed through Batman's eyes and focuses on his origins. As this is the case, I felt that the Scarecrow, the mob involvement and the former master story lines detracted us from getting to know and loath one good villain.

BAD: Bale's Batman voice: too raspy!

DVD:

Looks like a tight 'Deluxe Edition' and will probably pick it up as a present for my wife. I think she wants us to get it so she can drool over Bale and Murphy...mostly Murphy;)

FINAL THOUGHTS:

Burton's take on Batman (which comes out on special edition DVD on 10/18 along with the rest of the previous live action films) was a breath of fresh air for the franchise. Unfortunately he 'weirded' folks out a bit with his typical Burton antics in the sequel. Shumacher's versions, noticeably boring after you get past the bright colors, didn't fare much better. (Although I thought Jim Carey was a perfect Riddler)

Nolan's should have left them all in the dust, and in my opinion didn't. He just toned down the colors and added another flawed movie to the series. Hope the next one plays better the way Spider Man 2 did for that series.

Surprisingly, I really enjoyed 'Batman: The Animated Series' and it's subsequent full length releases the most. Dark and full of retro 40's charm. A nice mix of the 'brooding Batman' from Miller's 'Dark Night' and a respectful dose of the ,detective Batman' from creator Bob Kane - And lets face it, Kane is the only man who truly knows who Batman really is.",1124150400,4,5434,4.733828207847296
1574685,5,B00005JNJV,"I've been a Batman fan since I was 10 years old. I loved him because he was an ordinary human...no super powers. Plus he was dark and had the worst criminals shaking in their boots. Adam West certainl didn't fit the bill. And while Michael Keaton in the 1989 movie was significantly better, the movie was really about Nicholson's Joker.

CHristian Bale portrayed the Batman exactly as intended, a frightening, obsessed vigilante who used his brain, martial arts, and tools to find and apprehend criminal scum. I only wish Bob Kane, the creator of Batman, had lived to see this film. He would have loved it too.",1124150400,7,610,4.700934579439252
1574686,5,B00005JNJV,"Better than the previous four live-action Batman theatrical releases put together - by far - this is the Batman movie we never thought we'd see.  THIS is the Batman and the Batman mythos of the comic books, and while it's not dead-on in every aspect, it doesn't have to be.  The heart and soul and feel of the books are here at last; for the first time a Batman that actually Is Batman in more than name and appearance is present (the previous closest was the Batman of the 90s animated series and the animated ""Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm"" and its sequels - all recommended and all better than the previous live-action stuff, although toned down and simplified from the modern comics).

  Much more believable than previous entries, and with far greater characterization; a few of the characters are not quite in line with their comic counterparts (Ra's Al Ghul, for example) but they're close enough, they capture the essential esscences of their characters (something I don't believe the previous four movies even tried to do), and it's not mandatory - or even preferable - to bring in a carbon copy of any given comic arc anyway; merely that it be in the spirit of and faithful to the source material.  Which, again, is something that I don't think was really an objective for the previous films (Certainly not for ""Batman And Robin"").

When I first heard that there was going to be another Batman movie I wasn't really interested; when I saw some of the still shots and recalled how filmmakers have in recent years shown that it is possible to do comic adaptations right (""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"", etc.) I began to become a little hopeful; when I learned that David S. Goyer - who's written DC series like ""JSA"" as well as worked on movies like ""Dark City"" I began to very cautiously believe that we might have something approaching what I wanted the movie to be.  It turns out it didn't just approach it, it was it: a Batman movie that reaches the level of the Batman comics of current times.

Beginning in the past with Bruce Wayne as a child and flashing forward to his years in exile, believed dead while really honing his skills even as he's lost in his own inner demons, and continuing on with his first meetings with Ra's Al Ghul and later Jim Gordon - not yet Gotham's Commissioner, just an honest and decent sergeant doing his best in a seriously corrupt city (incidentally, this is the first of the live-action theatrical movies that hasn't treated Gordon as either an afterthought or an outright joke; kudos to the filmmakers for treating this character with the respect he deserves, and kudos to Gary Oldman for playing the part so brilliantly.) and into direct confrontation with the crimelords of Gotham and, later, more exotic adversaries, ""Batman Begins"" is a roaring success on every level, including romantic and comedic touches that don't seem the slightest bit out of place with the intensity of the movie.  Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Ken Watanabe, the previously noted Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and the whole cast do outstanding jobs.  I'm not even going to mention all the characters who turn up here; it's better when you discover it on your own (though not everyone who's familiar to the comic readers will be known by the larger audience).  Some of the grandest action in film history - very, very rarely has such a scale of action come off this realistically.

For a sequel (assuming there is one) I'd say forget about tying it into the previous movies (I don't mean to keep dumping on them, they were usually entertaining, but they just weren't the real deal); it's too late for that anyway considering that ""Batman Begins"" retold the origin in a different way than 1989's ""Batman"".  Just go on from here, keep bringing in people on both sides of the camera as talented as those who worked on this (keep Bale, Freeman, Michael Caine, and every other performer who fits each script; feel free to bring back Goyer and director/co-writer Christopher Nolan, but if you also need new blood for some of the future movies consider looking to the likes of Devin Grayson, Greg Rucka and Doug Moench) and the sky's the limit.  And if you see this and want more, you don't even have to wait for the sequel; check out the comics, many of which are available here on Amazon in Trade Paperback or Hardcover form.

1574687,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is the fifth live-action movie since 1989 to bear the name of the Caped Crusader, but it might as well be the first. So completely does writer-director Christopher Nolan reinvent, reimagine, and reinvigorate this franchise, you may well entirely forget about the campy casting (Clooney as Batman! Ah-nuld as Mr. Freeze!), leaden dialogue, and nonexist plotting that Joel Schumacher used to try to kill off the series in the 1990's. (And please, don't even get me started on the Batsuit nipples.) Nolan, the auteur behind Memento and Insomnia, likes his thrillers dark and twisted, and this one is no exception. The incredibly talented Christian Bale (American Psycho, The Machinist) is riveting as Gotham billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose anger over the murder of his parents leads him into an intense study of the nature of evil, and ultimately to his emergence as a cowled and caped vigilante. The film touches relevantly on both corporate corruption (Wayne Corp. is run by an ultrasleazy Rutger Hauer) and on post-9/11 urban fear. Images of derailing trains and clouds of poison gas enveloping Gotham will bring chills to anyone who has watched the news in the last four years (or been unfortunate enough to have lived it.) The supporting cast is full of heavy hitters in fine form - Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanabe, a sweetly subdued Gary Oldman (as Jim Gordon), an Oscar-worthy Michael Caine (wonderful as wry, indispensable manservant Alfred) - but for me the real standout is Irish actor Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later, Cold Mountain) as the fiendish Dr. Jonathan Crane, who runs the local asylum; in his supervillain guise as the Scarecrow, he is truly the stuff of nightmares (and just one reason I have to warn you, DON'T bring the kiddies to this one!)",1124064000,10,1783,4.9865771812080535

NOT TRUE!!!!!  yes, bale did burn down his house, but he did not leave him in a burning house ready to die, he picked him up and ran out.  he left him in the car of a neighbor.  HE DID NOT LEAVE HIM TO DIE!!  HOW COULD THEY LET THAT LINE PASS!!!!  that on line nearly ruined the film for me.  but there were other parts to help that.  Gary Oldman, such a graet actor, but he had an uneasiness that Sean Penn usually has.  I kinda doubt someone like that would be a sargeant or luteinant of the police department in a city like gotham where the crime is equal to the bad parts of detroit.  christian bale simply did not cut it as batman either.  he seemed like a college kid trying to find himself in the real world.  putting on a black suit and fighting crime at night seems to be a wierd way to discover your interests, but im only 17, what do i know.  and yes, i expected more from christopher nolan.  but it wasn't all his fault.  the scripts these days REALLY REALLY SUCK!!!!!  the two best written movies ive seen in a long time were sideways and the aviator.  charlie and the chocolate factory was decent, but thast it.  the screenwriters and directors really need a fire under their butt.  or it could be the producers or companies like MGM or Warner Bros., or DreamWorks...

I am a big fan of Tim Burton's original Batman and I think this one is every bit as good as that one. Christian Bale is the best of all the Batmans to date. Michael Keaton held his own and did a good job, Val Kilmer just brooded through the movie and looked like he was constipated, and George Clooney, holy hell that smirking jack-ass performance killed the series for a time.

The whole cast is great, with the exception of Katie Holmes and her sitcom quality acting, I'm glad to hear she won't be back for the sequel. This movie has the best developed Bruce Wayne and still has great action sequences.

1574793,4,B00005JNJV,"Between 1989 to 1997 four Batman movies were released with three different actors (Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney) portraying the caped crusader.  We were also treated to a slew of over the top villains including the Joker (Jack Nicholson), the Penguin (Danny DeVito), Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  But, after 1997's ""Batman and Robin"", it seemed as if Bruce Wayne hung up his cowl and left Gotham behind.  That was until this year's ""Batman Begins"" was released.

As the movie begins, we find Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a prison far away from his family's home.  This is where he catches the eye of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who takes Bruce under his wing and brings him into the fold of Ra's Al Guhl (Ken Watanabe).  During the time of Bruce's training, we also learn a great deal about his past including the murders of his parents, his fears and his relationship with Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes).  However, when Ra's Al Guhl's true plot for Gotham is revealed, Bruce Wayne decides to return to save his beloved city.

In the meantime, Gotham has fallen into the clutches of some sinister evildoers.  Crime boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has the city under his thumb.  Add to the mix Dr. Jonathan Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) whose seemingly normal patients (mostly thugs of Falcone's) are quickly diagnosed as insane.  However, there is more than meets the eye about the good doctor and it eventually becomes clear that he is only a small part of a bigger sinister plot.  Can Batman save the day?

While some people may have been hesitant about Christian Bale portraying Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman, he seems to be a good choice to fill the shoes of the caped crusader.  Not only does he make the character come across as somewhat realistic but also flawed.

Co-stars Michael Caine (Alfred), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) and Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon) are excellent as Batman's allies.  The same holds true for Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy (who originally auditioned for the title role) as one of Batman's nemesis.  When these actors appear in a movie, you expect a good performance and each one delivers with ""Batman Begins"".  This is especially true of Michael Caine's performance that shows more of the bond that Alfred has with Bruce Wayne.

The plot of the movie is also plausible.  It takes you away from the comic book feel of the previous Batman movies and seems almost realistic.  This time around, with much of the movie filmed in Chicago, the city of Gotham even looks lighter with more of a metropolitan feel.  A few nice touches to the movie are the explanations of why Bruce Wayne decided to call himself Batman, how he found the Batcave and where his weapons and the Batmobile (a lot different in this movie than in previous films) come from.  It's also good to see that Batman isn't secondary to the villains in this movie.

""Batman Begins"" was good but there were some parts that were lacking.  It didn't seem that Bruce's relationship with Rachel added much to the plot of the movie.  This probably could have been dropped altogether or maybe some extra time might have been added for a little more chemistry between the two characters.  It would have been nice to have known a little more about Henri Ducard, who's more than he appears to be, and Earle, the character portrayed by Rutger Hauer.

Plans are already underway for another Batman movie with most of the cast set to reprise their roles.  The end of ""Batman Begins"" should give you a clue who the villain will be in the next film.  While this isn't the greatest movie to ever come out of Hollywood, if you're looking to escape into the theater and be entertained for a couple of hours, then you won't be disappointed!",1123027200,3,3770,4.7553846153846155
1574794,5,B00005JNJV,"Christopher Nolan's version of DC Comic's Batman takes itself very seriously -- it's far from Adam West's TV version in the 60s.  There is no ""Robin"" and no ""Batgirl"" for that matter.  It is about how Bruce Wayne becomes the Caped Crusader, and the film has enough actions to be called a summer season blockbuster (which it is) though the tone is slightly darker than any other previously filmed versions.

But David S. Goyer/Christoher Nolan gave a decent script for the film, in which we see Bruce as young boy of emormously rich family has to confront his ultimate fear when his parents got killed -- but if you don't like this rather serious 'looking into abyss' part, just forget it.  It is another story about one discontent youth looking for the meaning of life, which turns out being a superhero.  And you know that part before watching the film.

After wondering in Asia, being trained by a mentor Liam Neeson (again, like in ""Episode I""), grown-up Bruce (played by Christian Bale with no British accent) comes back to Gotham City, the city of crimes and injustice.

[BATMAN IS THE HERO]  Of course he is, but in the previous films Batman (or Bruce Wayne) was a curiously umimpressive figure, for the villains like Joker or Riddler stole every scene.  In 'Batman Begins,' Nolan is very careful in making  Batman the center of the film.  It is his film, and Batman is always there, in the middle of good action scenes (including that of souped-up Batmobile).

Two interesting things.  One is that the film repeatedly refers to 'falling' (many actions involve vertical movement one way or another), a clever metaphor used by Nolan.  The other is the cast, among whom you see only two Americans -- Morgan Freeman and Katie Holms.  Londoner Nolan's choice is quite unique -- Jim Gordon is played by another Londoner Gary Oldman; Alfred is by Michael Caine (again, born in London), Falcone by Tom Wilkinson (English), Ducard by Neeson (Irish),  Dr. Crane (aka Screcrow) by Cillian Murphy (Irish), Earle by Rutger Hauer (Dutch), Ra's Al Ghul by Ken Watanabe (Japanese).  Even the homeless guy is Rade Serbedzija (Croatia).  Where is Amreican actors?

The film might be a bit too serious at times, but that is exactly what this new version is trying to do.  But the seriousness does not weigh down the whole film, which has effective actions that do not rely on CGI techniques.  In this sense, and with all name actors, 'Batman Begins' is like Christopher Reeve's 'Superman' -- it takes itself seriously, and very entertaining as well.",1122940800,4,2537,4.799539170506913
1574795,5,B00005JNJV,"This is the best batman movie ever, its how it should be. I thought this one was a classic, added to the first 2 films. (Chirstian Bale) did great! (Michael Caine) did a great Alfred as well as the last one. (Katie Holmes) did a nice job as Bruce Waynes close friend and love interest. There was something about her that reminded me of (Kim Basinger) from the first movie.  The villains were awsome, (Cillian Murphy) he did a termentious job as Scarrcrow, he was my favorite. He played the guy like a normal person but with a twisted way that you knew he was crazy. Thats how the bad guys should be, not cheesey like in the last batman movie, with (George Cloony)and (Arnold Schwarzenegger)as Mr. Freeze give me a break. Batgirl played by (Alica Sliverstone) was one hot chick, but her acting was terrible and she was way too stiff when fighting, and she did not have much of a big part in that last film. Posion Ivy was great, she was the only one who did a great job, while everyone else went down with the Titanic because of the  ice burg (Schwarzenegger) built with his stupid gient freezing gun made from a teleiscope and with dimonds he stole from an over sized jewler. (Uma Thurman) known as the plant lady. She was the only survivor left, that did not hit Arnold's Ice burg. The last movie was a horror, I  don't know why (Tim Burton) did not direct the last 2 films? I don't get it why (Joel Schumacher), had to finish the last 2 batman movies ??? Thank God (Jim carrey) as the Riddler was there to rescuse the 3rd movie. If it was not for him, it could have been much worse.  (Tommy Lee Jones) as Two-Face did not do that bad,I give him some created for taking on a crazy role.  For the last movie , I could see (Jack Nicholson) lauhing his ass off, so hard cuz that last one was a real big time joke. (Micheal Keaton) would have said , what the hell are they doing, if I would have stayed with the contract things probibly would have been better.  The other villians in Batman Returns (Danny DeVito)as the Penguin and (Michelle Pfeiffer) as Catwoman oh ya baby! Were a bad ass kicking team.  I liked the new car, in Batman Begins but I wish they could have made it alittle fancier,like in the first movie, but don't worry, this one is going to maybe lead to a sequal??? I hope. I know they are going to do the whole series over, which is good, they better stay with the same tone and Gothic style as the original movie.  I did also here they are going to do the all the villians over from scratch.  I wish the other cast member would return to do over there parts, everyone except (Arnold Schwarzeneger). (Chris O'Donnell) did a great Robin, for his first apearance in Batman Forever, but for his second time around in the last one, oh boy, did they turn him into a real spoiled brat and like a smart ass know it all. Let me say one thing, he was obesseded over poison Ivy like she was a real hot stuff and thought he was really in love with her but mostly likely wanted to kill him duh. As like most high schoolers today. Little did he listen to batman as a best freind or a big brother to seek help like most teenagers today in some relationships over girl/boy stuff and stupid things not like oh I know about trust someone. I know the true meaning of  love and all that  lecturing crap. How to become the bad boy on campus. They made that movie so bad, it does not go well with the last 3 movies.  Batman Begins is 100 times better, most of all it true to the Comic book story the way they should have made it a long time ago. The comic book verison is darker and more fast pace and enjoyable and  go to show you his true Origins, how he came to  to be who is he as a famous icon of all time. This movie is not some screen play or writen up story.  I gave this one 5 stars because its how batman has Returned, not only that but how he will remain  a LEGEND Forever!!!

1574796,3,B00005JNJV,"I consider Batman Begins to be a whole new Batman franchise- absolutely no relation to Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.

Baring that in mind, I approached Batman Begins with fresh perspective. I found it to be good but not great. No fault to the actors really. The film just didn't excite me much since Batman is not my favorite hero.

I'm sure there are lots of people out there that loved this movie. I simply liked it.",1122854400,,447,4.506172839506172
1574797,5,B00005JNJV,"Why? Lots of reasons. For one, it's got Christian Bale in the lead role, Michael Caine as the strongest Alfred ever, Rutger Hauer as a Donald Trump lookalike, Morgan Freeman acting about like James Bond's Q, and a bunch of other good talent. That cast just won't let a movie go down the tubes.

Except for Batman himself, this doesn't look like a comic book movie, and I mean that in the best way possible. It opens on a grey and gritty prison, then turns into a Himalayan trek, then flirts with Ninja stuff before returning to Gotham. The fight scenes are good, but oddly indistinct. It's not always clear who's doing what to whom, but that's even more effective than standard fight choreography - it reinforces the sense of Batman swooping in unseen on the bad guys, taking them down before they know they've been hit.

And Gotham City is good, too. It appears in earlier and later times, with a clear display of decay in between. It's a good vision: tall, sweeping Art Deco lines, especially in that monorail. Other parts looked like Cubist landscapes, in their organic sprawl. The Plot Device was a disappointment. I won't give it away, but when you see it, think: people are mostly water, too.

This one's really good, even if you don't usually like comic book movies. It's got good, varied action, and good characters, or good enough. In a summer of good summer movies, this is about the best so far. Enjoy!

Finally, Batman has been made the way it should have been.  Batman Begins puts Batman into the real world, while at the same time perfectly capturing the mystique of the comic.  Congratulations Christopher Nolan.  First the casting of Christian Bale was right on.  I've seen Bale in many pictures from Shakespeare to psycho, so I was confident he would do a good job, but he did better than expected.  He captured the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman perfectly.  The rage that shows on his face is at times totally intense, but he easily plays the fop (the scene where he pretends to be drunk is fantastic).  This movie dazzles in its simplicity.  The story is strong,the special affects are not overdone and the acting is perfect.  Plus it sets up perfectly for a sequal.  Well done all involved.",1122681600,3,990,4.730994152046784
1574799,5,B00005JNJV,"When i went to see this film, i was filled with both hope and fear. I hoped Nolan would make a return to the dark and gritty world that Burton had made in the first two movie, and i feared he had done a ""Shumacher"" on the world. Luckily, he had done the first.

Batman is such an intriguing character. He is not a superhero, such as spiderman or superman, he has no powers. So that is the platform that allows Burton and now Nolan to create a more mature storyline, it does not need to be colourful and bright. It is a storyline that is believable to adults.

Burton originally created the dark fairytale, he turned batman from a dark comic book character and turned him into a believable vigilante with a story line that was plausable, if slightly far-fetched. Nolan has now carried on with this approach to the fable, and it can be seen with most of the movie being related to a more modern day issue of drugs, and with the villans in the story not being ""Supervillians"", but insted just mortals with a taste for havoc.

Now, when finding out that this chapter is seperate to the former versions of the Burton/Shumacher series, I like many of you were afraid that their work was thrown away(if you can call what Shumacher did work). But then, you will realise that this instalment is no different to ""Batman"" or ""Batman Forever"". All three of these films were the start of individual views on th franchise. Burton created the dark fairytale that was so chillingly made, while Shumacher made a ""Child-friendly"" version, without all the darkness and with the colour, and Jim Carrey. All three directors have taken individual parts in the series. Nolan is createing another darker version, with a much more modern role within it.

However, when i heard that the new film was not linked to the older films, i felt worried that the films would be scrapped from memory, but i will not worry because i have now realised that each director has made his own series, there is already a split within the franchise. This was never picked up before because the two series never clashed so obviously as the new film does with the original films.  Thankfully, one of the differences within the stories told is that in Batman Begins, we finally have a good insight into his parents death. Burton chose the Joker, in his human form, would be their killer. However, the batman legend tells us that batman never get vengence from the killer as it is belived he would loose his motivation. Schumacher then tried to tell us that Two face, despite previously a upstanding DA as Harvey Dent and not becoming a psycho killer until years after the murder, killed his parents. He then ran out of the funeral with a red book, through a wood in the rain, before being scared by a solitary bat flying in slow motion. This time, it combats the stupidity of Schmachers version while keeping to the legend, which Burton did not. It is said that it was ""crime"" that killed his parents(or at least a man forced to rob and kill through a depression)and that he never got a chance to get vengance for the murder. this means that he wil never loose his motivation. This is finally a plausable explination without disturbing the legend, something the series has always needed.

Overall the legend has been split before between the directors, instead be happy that Nolan has restored the element that has been mising with Schumachers movies, The part that made it a favourite for many people. The darkness and realism that sets it apart from all the other superhero films.",1122681600,2,3535,4.603174603174603
1574800,3,B00005JNJV,"One of the inevitable things about summer, ever since ""Spider-Man"" surprised us all in 2002, is that movie studios rummage through their license bins and ask themselves: ""What comic book hero haven't we made a film about for a while?""  Apparently, Warner Brothers asked themselves this question and decided to dust off the venerable Batman franchise and slap another superhero film on our cinema screens.

 ""Batman Begins"" is the latest in a long line of comic book movie adaptations in the last three years.  As usual, it focuses on the origins of the caped crusader, while trying to show every icon of the series that it can.

 The story is familiar to anyone remotely aware of the character:  Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) witnessed his wealthy parents' murder as a small child and vowed to rid the world of evil by any means necessary.  And he has plenty of means, what with inheriting his parents' immense fortune.  But this movie shows that Bruce did more than just buy a fancy outfit and a really cool car and call himself Batman (though, for some reason, he believes he needs to talk in a laughably deep and threatening voice).

 The opening of the film shows Bruce's training with the League of Shadows, a brutal ninja group obsessed with destroying evil and corruption at all costs.  But they prove to be too intense even for Bruce, so he abandons his training, and returns to Gotham, which anybody with more than ten brain cells can tell is New York City.  Once back home, he begins fighting the crime that runs rampant in the city, and must prevent Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy; playing the obligatory creepy supervillain) from contaminating the entire city with a panic-inducing toxin; Terrorism in its most literal sense.

 One of the things this movie has going for it is a strong supporting cast.  When the likes of Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman populate a comic book movie, it's time to pay attention.  Neeson is excellent as always, as Ducard, who trains Bruce during his exile.

 Ironically, the beginning of ""Batman Begins"" is the most interesting part.  There is real drama here, and I was prepared for more than just the average superhero movie.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what this film turned into by the end: Another average superhero movie.

 My biggest gripe with this film, however, is that it is far, far too dark.  Yes, I am aware that I highly praised ""Revenge of the Sith"" for its darkness, but that was dramatic, rather than merely brutal.  ""Sith"" was sobering and touching, while ""Batman"" just makes you cringe.  I am also aware that the Batman comics have always been very dark, but then, I never said I liked the Batman comics, did I?

 If you are a fan of the Batman franchise, this film will certainly please, with the origins of all the iconic Batman things: The mask, the Batmobile, the spotlight, and the utility belt with its amazing storage capabilities.  But for the casual movie-goer, this film may prove to be simply too much.",1122595200,3,2990,4.762645914396887
1574891,4,B00005JNJV,"Just when you thought you couldn't stand even one more movie based on a comic book superhero, along comes ""Batman Begins"" to redeem your faith in the genre.

This film serves the same function for the previous ""Batman"" movies that the ""Star Wars"" prequels do for the original ""Star Wars.""  In this film, we learn how it is that a shy, sensitive young lad named Bruce Wayne grows up to become a crime-fighting superhero known as Batman, replete with flying cape, mask and a heavily armored vehicle called the batmobile.  We learn what it is that causes him to dedicate his life to eradicating evil and righting wrongs in the fictional enclave of Gotham City.  I don't want to give away any of the major plot points, but suffice it to say that it involves a childhood tragedy, a desire for revenge, and the love of a morally pure young woman who sets him straight at a key moment in the story.

""Batman Begins"" succeeds primarily because it paints its central figure in realistic, believable terms.  It takes us step by step through the process by which Wayne transforms himself into Batman, not just in terms of the physical accoutrements that go into making up his superhero persona but the psychological development he must undergo before he can fully take on the superhero mantle.  Thus, ""Batman Begins"" works on the dual level of an action/adventure picture and a human drama.

""Batman Begins"" boasts fine art direction and special effects, exciting action sequences and first-rate performances by Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Morgan Freeman, and (a distressingly emaciated) Liam Neeson.

This is the best ""Batman"" movie to hit the big screen yet.",1122595200,3,1666,4.879432624113475
1574892,5,B00005JNJV,"After the Batman franchise started to become as fermented and corrupt as Gotham itself, devolving into silliness and big men in small tights (think Arnold Schwarzenneger's Mr. Freeze), and with comic book movies in general becoming ever more formulaic and predictable in the quest of the almighty mass market buck, it was refreshing to see Hollywood and Warner Bros. wipe away the old franchise and start anew, handing it to an auteur director, Christopher Nolan; an intense mid-level star known more for his serious work (the excellent Christian Bale) than for his comedy (Keaton) or his looks (Clooney, Kilmer); and to give them a budget, script and the acting muscle (Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson) to pull it off.

This is a quieter, more thoughtful, darker Batman, but not a kindler, gentler one. By seeing more of the back story, there are layers in complexity to the brooding and the cartoon becomes less, well, cartoonish and feels far more real. I want to particularly laud the script, which involves an intricate and deep plot that weaves delightful circles and surprises that I won't give away here. Unlike in 'Spiderman' -- which at the time was probably the best of the genre despite its formula-driven story -- this is thankfully no 'coming of age' tale of another awkward teenboy, this is about the chiseling of a young man full of anger and guilt into a benevolent creature of the night. Which is far more believable and definitely more satisfying.

***

Other notes. Sadly, despite all of the praise I heap upon the movie, I still didn't get as lost in it as I would have when I was younger. This is not the movie's fault. I mourn for my lost youth, that magical time when you could instantly believe everything that you saw on the screen and not get caught up in analyzing how the movie makers made it happen. I guess that's a sign I'm leaving the 18-34 demographic and entering the 35-49?

And I also wanted to say a kind word about Katie Holmes. She may be a nutcase for marrying Tom Cruise, but I thought she came off well here, and provided a necessary feminine heart and counterpoint to the darkness of the movie (not that there's much romance to speak of). She comes across as sweet, sharp and brave -- exactly the kind of woman that Batman would want to protect.

1574893,5,B00005JNJV,"In this fifth installment of the ever popular Batman feature film series, Christian Bale suits up as our caped superhero.  Overall, Christian handles the role of Batman very effectively, complete with the scratchy, raspy voice that is downright creepy.  He is a little bit less convincing as Bruce Wayne, although who watches a Batman movie to see Bruce Wayne?  I thought the fighting scenes were done well, but most were shot so close-up to the action I felt like I wasn't seeing half of the scene.  That is the one downside to this movie, if it has any downsides.  Supporting Bale are Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow.  Michael Caine brings the character of Alfred to a whole new great level although I would still take Michael Gough as Bruce's butler anyday.  Katie Holmes I thought did a decent job as the assistant DA/Bruce Wayne's love interest, although I feel the film could have gone on without her.  Finally Cillian Murphy does a great portrayal of the big villain in the fim, the Scarecrow/Dr. Jonathan Crane.  Unlike in previous Bat films, where there is usually one or two villains or bad guys, in this film there is at least 5 if not more.  The Scarecrow is a genuinely alarming and menacing bad guy and is definitely a step up from the goofball Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin, the worst film in the series.  Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are great additions to the cast as well as great portrayals of their characters, Neeson as Wayne's mentor and Freeman as Bruce's ally in Wayne Enterprises, remeniscent of Q in the James Bond series.  Basically, this is the story in a nutshell: Bruce Wayne, seeking to restore Gotham City to its glory days before crime and corruption eroded it, sets out to be trained and taught all about the fundamentals of putting fear into the hearts of those who do evil, and the physical force necessary to stop them.  Ra'as Al Guhl (Ken Wattanbe), along with Ducard (Liam Neeson) train Bruce on the skills that he desires.  Scarecrow, along with a slew of corrupt cops in the Gotham City Police Department, set out to unleash a fear toxin upon the city using Gotham's water supply and a microwave transmitter.  There are also some plot twists involving Ra'as Al Guhl and Ducard as well, but telling them here would seriously pretty much reveal the whole movie.  It is up to Bruce Wayne, who designs the Batsuit and the Batmobile with the help of Morgan Freeman's character, to put a stop to the Scarecrow/Dr. Crane's plans.  A very well told story, it thoroughly explains Bruce's youth and the entire backstory of the film that ultimately turns Bruce Wayne into his alter-ego, Batman.  A superbly casted, and well directed film by Chris Nolan, this movie represents Batman's best.  Gone are the silly anatomically correct Bat costumes, and the cartoonish villains, as well as the so-so Batmobile and gadgets.  There is nothing silly, cartoonish or so-so about this great movie.  The best movie of 2005 hands down, Batman Begins.",1122595200,4,3045,4.772900763358779
1574894,5,B00005JNJV,"As a lifelong Batman fan, I tend to be very critical of any attempts at filmed adaptations of the character.  In the case of Batman Begins, there is little to criticize, which coming from me is high praise.

Here we see Gotham City as a quasi-realistic urban jungle in which organized crime has taken over.  Having suffered a 'Depression,' Gotham has never recovered.  Most of the police force is under the influence of mob boss Carmine Falcone, played with gusto by Tom Hutchison.  Bruce, Alfred, Gordon, and few others believe that there is hope.  Batman emerges as that hope in the second act of the film.  We see him as human, which is crucial in relating to the character.  He makes mistakes.  His 'toys' are explained very nicely.  And at the end of the film we want to see him continue.  Speaking of which, wait for the excellent sequel set-up.

The story matches the tone of several comic book stories of the last 19 or so years, most notably the work of Frank Miller.  Here we see Christian Bale as a very focused, obsessed, determined Bruce Wayne, who blossoms into the weird and scary Batman.  It is Bale who really makes this movie work.  He fleshes out the many aspects of Bruce Wayne: the playboy act, the driven kid who sees vengeance robbed from under him, and the guy who finds satisfaction in thwarting the criminal element.  Michael Caine is stunning as Alfred, Morgan Freeman is a breezy pleasure as engineer genius Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman gives a note-perfect performance as Jim Gordon, and Cillian Murphy is just creepy as Crane/Scarecrow.  Rounding out the cast is Liam Neeson, whose performance is more complicated, but he certainly does a commendable job.

From production design to acting to script to direction, this is a great, fun film!  The Batmobile gets a bizarre but cool redo; we see the cave as a realistic, dank hideaway, and the suit gets a decent explanation.  On film, Batman doesn't get much better than this!

After The Island, it is my number two theater pick of the summer.",1122508800,3,355,4.5625
1574896,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is a reinventing of Bob Kane's original comic book hero, and it is generally a successful transition into the 21st century with some nice wrinkles and updates.  The comic book hero from D.C. Comics has captured the imagination of the public in print, television, and film.  Director Christopher Nolan's vision cleverly takes threads of the original story and merges them with unique twists and turns.

The wealthy Wayne family of Gotham City is well lauded, and young son, Bruce, lives an idyllic, pampered life with childhood friend Rachel.  A chance accident lands him in a cave of bats which begins a cycle of trauma that will culminate in the murder of his parents in the city streets.  A wayward, lost soul, Bruce (Christian Bale) grows into a young man who remains distant despite the support of family butler, Alfred (Michael Caine).  Seeking meaning in his life, he travels the streets of the world to understand the criminal elements until a fateful meeting in Asia with a mentor, Ducard (Liam Neeson), who beckons Wayne to a temple/fortress in a remote mountain.  There, he meets a group of avengers who have great fighting skills and unyielding, harsh justice.  Bruce learns from Ducard to shed his inner fears of bats and harness the feelings of his parents' death.  As Wayne masters his physical and mental prowess, his sense of humanity ultimately collides with the shadow group's ruthless sense of justice.

Wayne returns to and assimilates into Gotham City as a `millionaire playboy' who secretly assumes the symbol of a bat to fight crime as Batman.  In a city of increasing corruption and crime enters crime lord Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) and his cohort, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) whose alter ego, Scarecrow, will figure in an ever complicated plot.  With support from Rachel (Katie Holmes), who works for the District Attorney, and Detective Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), Wayne also finds within his corporation an advanced weapons division overseen by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) who helps to arm Batman with state of the art body armor and sophisticated devices.  As Batman commences his crime fighting, Scarecrow and ultimately a figure from Wayne's past will threaten Gotham with ultimate doom.

This film stakes a claim to its own vision and resists previous, formulaic blueprints like Spiderman for depicting super heroes.  With the most recent Batman films reducing the franchise to an uninspired shadow of its former self, someone had sense enough to let visionary director Nolan (Momento, Insomnia) have a crack at it. He has a great knack for incorporating his nightmarish imagery and integrated flashbacks into a brooding, dark exploration of human paranoia, memories and fear.  Nolan cleverly traumatizes young Wayne with bats which ironically will be his salvation.

This is a different kind of narrative with more mood, psychological depth, and deliberate pacing.  When Batman appears from above, it is an iconic vision of terror and swift justice, the perfect distillation of urban redemption in the guise of a bat facing down evil.  Comic book aficionados will revel in a faithful rendering that stays true to the original's roots and at the same time pays homage to recent updates like the critically acclaimed, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight.  Fans will also be amused at the new interpretations and somewhat poetic license taken on such established conventions as the bat cave, the bat signal, the coming to be of future Commissioner Gordon, and Alfred the butler.  It is refreshing that the hero and villains are not really superhuman like Superman but rather ordinary people who are driven by a psychological bent.

The only real letdown is that while it starts out on a promising path, it degenerates into a conventional, by-the-numbers action formula in the last fifteen minutes. The story, which admittedly takes its good time to unfold, starts to run out of steam and momentum about three quarters of the way through and drags a bit until the revved up end.  One could almost forgive the obvious teaser at the end which is a deliberate setup for a future sequel. It's ironic that as much as the filmmakers tried to make Batman plausible and grounded in reality, there are credibility gaps especially towards the end.  In one scene, Gordon attempts to operate the Bat vehicle, and it just doesn't ring true.  A fight aboard an elevated train (and earlier fight scenes) is at best standard fare.

Christian Bale (The Machinist) has been perceived as a rising talent whose persona is that of dark intensity; who better to portray the Dark Knight?  He is surrounded by an exceptional supporting cast.  Caine is effortlessly stoic. It is amusing in one scene to see both veteran pros like he and Freeman counsel Bale.  Liam Neeson is good as a mentor but he is in danger of being typecast in these kinds of roles.  Oldman is cast against type and quite effectively as a good cop. Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) as the leader of the temple is not given much to do unfortunately.

The luscious musical score by committee is appropriately strong and heroic without leaning on a catchy title theme as previous Batman scores have popularized e.g. Nelson Riddle on TV and Danny Elfman in film.  The art direction and set design are impressive in their own interpretation of Gotham City compared to the earlier Tim Burton films which set a new standard.

By the climax, you root for the film to fulfill its promise but it doesn't quite succeed. Although successes like X Men and Spiderman are good examples of mainstream, pop hero entertainment, the makers of Batman Begins for the most part have raised the super hero film to an art film, and that's not a bad thing.",1122422400,,5726,4.9498432601880875

I've never really truly understood the plight of Bruce Wayne. Poor rich baby.  However, this film not only goes way back to show exactly what happened with his parents, but also chooses not to neglect the road he had to travel to become the caped crusader.  I thought the screenplay, the script, was excellent because it told the story as a novel would, fleshing out necessary characters and giving the audience their motivation as well.  I thought it was great to see where Comissioner Gordon started out and how Gotham became the center of all corruption.

I thought the movie did two things really well: get to the heart of the problem in Gotham through the hero/villain that Liam Neeson played with such expertise (he was trained well in Star Wars) AND cast Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne.  Finally a guy who can pull off the drama and the action and still maintain a somewhat ""upper crust"" feel that is so necessary to this character.

If the casting in this movie(minus Katie Holmes who was enthusiastically average as the do-gooder-slash-supposed-love-interest) had been present throughout all of the sadly misguided versions of Batman movies over the years, the sum would be classic.  As it is, they do make up for the horror of Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl.  And that's bringing us back a long, long way.

1574899,4,B00005JNJV,"Like ""Spiderman 2,"" ""Batman Begins"" goes into the psyche of the protagonist. If you want immediate action, or a simple ""go take out the bad guys"" movie, you won't be happy with this one.

I love a good vs. evil movie, the kind where the good guy learns of a caper, chases down the bad guy, hits him around a few times when the bad guy tries to get away. ""Batman Begins"" is not about chasing bad guys. It is about Bruce Wayne, and why and how he became the Caped Crusader.

If outlined, it might come across like other super hero movies. The strength of the movie is how it reaches into the details, and how the story is told.

Fans of Batman in the comics, and followers of the movie series know the origin story. Bruce's parents are killed when he is a child, and he determines to bring justice through training and by using his parents' vast fortune to provide him the tools he needs. The story is the same.

Why tell an old story again? Because all we have ever have been given was an outline -- we want more. The years between Bruce's parent's death and when he first wore the cape in Gotham City have always been a mystery.

How did he train? What fueled his intensity? How did he get the uniform? Why bats? How did he get the bat cave? If he is just a human, why don't bullets kill him? All of these questions and more are answered in a satisfying way, and hopefully will inspire deeper super hero movies.

Parts of the plot are confusing, like the Scare Crow's persona. Kids might not make the connection psychologically. Younger kids might have trouble with the drug-induced hallucinogenic episodes meant to scare the victims. If they can handle the old ""Willie Wonka"" movie, this should be OK.

It doesn't get a perfect grade only because I had trouble believing that this very human Bruce Wayne could adapt as quickly as he did to the special machinery and vehicles, and learn to fight in the mountains so adeptly in what seemed just a few months. The difference between Batman and Superman has always been the humanity of Wayne. Occasionally, the movie stretched this a step too far. Ignore a few of those scenes, and you'll enjoy ""Batman Begins.""

Well, this Batman has more than salvaged the enigmatic hero's image on the big screen. Batman is here to stay and I can't wait for the sequel ;-)

Move over Michael Keaton, Christian Bale is flying through :-) Bale's portrayal of Batman is my favorite so far with Keaton's close second. Val Kilmer's was OK and George Clooney's right out sucked ass chunks. I mean, really!

Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and Gary Oldman are, as always, superb. Katie Holmes is good but does account for much of the cheese in the film. All in all, performances are solid and you do feel for the characters, which is very important to me.

The movie covers so many story lines from the childhood times to the rebellion times to the rising times of Batman with great fluidity. The plot is very plausible and the special effects are outstanding.

Batman Begins tackles the subject of justice and it's relationship to revenge and vengeance. It's almost a critical commentary on the state of affairs of our world today.

Although, no obvious influence comes from Frank Miller graphic novel storyline Batman: Year One, this is still a superior comicbook movie, which says alot since Spiderman (1 & 2) upped the bar for the genre.

Bale is really believable as the driven, haunted Bruce Wayne, Caine is really believable and fun as Alfred, Morgan Freeman is believable and shrewd as Fox, Gary Oldman is believable in any role, his Pre-commish Gordan is no exception, not to mention the first time Gordan look like the comic character. Everything, including the chaotic climax rings believable, nothing seems overly impossible, in this very grounded vision of Gotham.

1575022,5,B00005JNJV,"For years, the batman series has been somewhat of a mockery to the comic book.  Even Tim Burton flopped the first Batman by having errors like having Harvey Dent be a black man when in the comics he was white.

Despite Burton's best efforts and Shumacher's dismal attempt and utter demise of a comic book legend, Warner Bros.  finally made the Batman that EVERY comic book and Batman fanatic have been waiting for:  Batman Begins.

Batman Begins stars Christian Bale as a clumsy and yet scared Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Bale plays a man driven to the edge, just like the villians of Gotham; however, unlike the villians of Gotham where they are selfish and only think of revenge, Wayne or Batman uses selflessness and justice.  In Batman Begins, we see Wayne struggle with selflessness and selfishness.

Of course a lot of mishaps are in this movie, but keep in mind this movie is in NO WAY connected to the previous movies [Batman, Returns, Forever, & Robin].  Warner Bros. has decided to redo the whole series dedicated and devoted to the comic books.  THANK GOD!

The Scarecrow is frieghtning and downright loony as he is cunning and malovent; however, the real villian is Ra's Al Guhl who I believe makes the other Gotham villians look weak and irrelevent.  In fact, Guhl gives Batman a run for his money.

The characters are great, the acting is great, and the plot is on the money, and there may be a sequel in the works.  Send in the clowns!(hint hint)

Thumbs Up!",1122163200,,1466,4.6498054474708175
1575023,3,B00005JNJV,Batman Begins is adifferent than the rest. The begining focuses on emotion and psychology. It's not as dark as Burton's Gotham City and there's a little too much drag before it gets into the good stuff. Once there the movie goes along well and is exciting.,1122163200,,256,4.586956521739131

Ra's Al Ghul and Scarecrow are #s 2 and 10 in my top 10 favorite Bat-foes, but more than that, Christian Bale is the second best Batman next to Micheal Keaton! The scariness was at a perfect level, all the fight scenes were made like a rich cake, there were so many good and memorable lines, and I just gotta say it! Batman Begins rules the world of DC comics! Except for Batman and Batman Returns, of course. And so, I've done my review. See Batman Begins. You WON'T regret it.",1122163200,,534,4.194174757281553

I took a chance and saw it and was blown away by how good it is. Christopher Nolan has brought this franchise back from the dead!!,1122163200,,258,4.078431372549019
1575026,5,B00005JNJV,I saw this movie and all I can say is that it rocked out loud this is what Batman should have looked like the fist time Batman came out back in 1989. I have seen all the Batman films and I like most of them but this out is the best one yet the movie is dark and has that comic book feel to it and it made Batman cool agin. The movie has a lot of Action and heart to it but thge story falls short and the villains are not ALL that but still it's one of the beast films of 2005 and I can't wait of it to come out on DVD.So if you're a comic book fan or a batman fan or just someone looking for a good movie then GO SEE THIS MOVIE  you will not be desapointed trust me.,1122163200,,666,3.593103448275862
1575027,4,B00005JNJV,"I was just a 7 year old kid when batman forever came out and it was followed by batman and robin. And the fact is that i wasn't old enough to grasp the grotesque direction the series had been steered in to by the release of those two movies. To me the Cartoonish and hi-tech action of the two movies seemed amusing along with how Batman was now being portrayed as more of a happy go lucky crime fighter rather then a ""dark knight"". But as i grew older and became more of a comic book fan i realised that those two movies had failed to portray the character accurately. I saw the first two baman movies ""Batman"" and ""Batman Begins"" to further see how the series had started out really well but was ending up going in a wrong direction.

 But this movie changes all that. Batman Begins is everything a batman movie should be. New director Christopher Nolan takes the whole experience of the movie closer to the feel of the comic books, something true fans are bound to appreciate. A darker edgier batman is portrayed by Christian Bale who is probably the best Batman yet. The movie lays emphasis on story and plot rather then stupid cartoonish antics, so if you are one of those people who just expect the action to keep flowing because you are not mature enough to appreciate the storyline then this movie is not for you. Bottom line is all hardcore fans of the comic books will not be dissapointed. There have been many dissapointed fans who have complained about the previous two batman movies, but rest assured there prayers have been answered with this masterpiece",1121990400,,1567,4.514084507042254
1575028,3,B00005JNJV,"For these kinds of films? Well, Nolan's first major film since INSOMNIA is a nice combination of action and horror (believe it or not)and it provides an interesting thesis on human being's repsonses to fear. It is not so unfortunate that Burton's vision has been moved aside, but it may be unfortunate that this Batman movie is a serious drama and has little of the fun for the people who enjoyed Micheal Keaton's films. So you'd better get that out of your head before watching this. Also, don't take small children or squeamish adults to this movie, because it is loaded with darkness and some truly unsettling images and nightmarish moments. Christian Bale hasn't really had any decent acting roles until this, but although he is a fine actor and a competent new star for my generation, Batman is simply too strong for its own good. Here we get the rundown on the League of Shadows and that stuff, and Bruce Wayne's history and condition is explained from the beginning. There are slow moments, but also many jarringly violent scenes, so it is ultimately hard to access once its over. Plus it goes on for a lot longer than any other Batman film. Arty, original, and highly impressive production-wise, this movie isn't for all tastes but it is a unique picture for those who want a new Batman and for a new vision of a superhero. The greatest superhero movie ever it is NOT, but if you can handle its brutality and nightmarish realism (basically), you may find it to be the best film of the year. It will certainly take you by surprise.",1121904000,,1538,4.616788321167883
1575029,5,B00005JNJV,"This was not a movie I was going to see, after all my friends raved about it, I found myself in a San Fernando Valley Cineplex, riveted to the chair.  I thought the movie was fantastic.  I really love Christopher Nolan's work, and think the cast is amazing.  I am not terribly sure I can be that analytical about it.  I just know I was gripped by it.  Here are a couple of thoughts...

The journey.......yes, we are used to a darker Batman now.  Truly the years of ""bang"" ""zowie"" and Julie Newmar as the catwoman(and Liberace as a guest villian) are over.  Batman has been dark for a long time...and all this stuff about Batman being so dark should exist only in conversations over old Green Hornet reruns..But what seems to be important , more than the darkness, is the journey.  This deals with a real person, a tortured billionaire who abandons money for searching...and then comes back.  This is a story...a story of a journey, and quite effective.

The cast...Ok, how great is Morgan Freeman?  Yeah, he is often Morgan Freeman, but who the hell cares.  The supporting cast is brilliant.  Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy(creepy creepy pretty boy), Tom Wilkinson...Ok, I had never seen Katie Holmes in anything, and she wasn't so great in my opinion, but I am sure in the right vehicle(and I don't mean  on the back of Tom's Motorcyle) she is great.

  But let's rave a little about Christian Bale.  He is, in my opinion, on a level with Johnny Depp for risky work.  He is so fun to watch.  You never know where he is going, he keeps you on guard, but ultimately he pulls out a rich, nuanced performance.

Finally, lets applaud a piece that is nuanced itself.  Funny at times, couched in relationship and history rather than just bloodshed, filled with action...rooted in story.  And...again...it dares to be different.  I mean, let's face it, we all have our opinions...so it boils down to what you want..  If you want a story well told, using heroes and villians as a way of getting to the pain of loss, in a world devoid of a lot of light...this is definitely one for you...",1121904000,4,2091,4.553763440860215
1575030,4,B00005JNJV,"I don't want to be critical of Tim Burtons ""Batman"" with Michael Keaton as the first caped crusader, which was fresh, dark and engaging when it first hit the screen, but this is better.

Christian Bale brings vehemence to the role not seen before in my opinion, and although the story suffers (like all first installments) of a good deal of story explanation the end result is arguably the best Batman flick to date.

Bruce Wayne, as the story goes, witnesses his billionaire parents being murdered and after finding no peace through adolescence into young adulthood sees what slender grips he has on truth and justice vanish as their murderer looks set to walk after an early parole.

Disillusioned with the rising crime and general lawless mob rule in Gotham, he seeks anonymity and sets off to the Far East to witness the criminal mind, and lifestyle first hand, ending up embittered in a hell hole prison somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

Enter at this point Liam Neeson (in another mentor role) who takes the raw and angry Wayne and subjects him to a tortuous training regime high in the mountains, in the hopes to enlist him into the ""League of Shadows"" a group of Ninja exponents thinly disguised as vigilantes, with some rather extreme methods and ideas on justice.

After completion of his training, Wayne however, turns Neeson and his goons down and returns to Gotham to set about administering his own brand of justice to the decadent masses. With the help of his butler Alfred (played very ably by Michael Caine) and Morgan Freeman as a scientist working for Wayne Industries, he creates Batman, and then the story really begins to unfurl.

This is a very good movie, and considering the talent on display is not (I'm happy to say) a CGI festival or cartoon revenge story. Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe as well as those already mentioned are well cast in their respective roles, and there is a real polished feel to the whole picture.

If I had to make one complaint it would be the new techniques used in close quarter fight choreography that seem to be the norm these days. Very quick and choppy, may be realistic, but it does nothing for the eye, and in some ways reminds me of older movie special effects that were always filmed in low lighting to hide the stunt work.

Other than that, just about everything is here, villains a plenty, the necessary love interest, and the whole story told anew, with a fresh approach that seems to stay faithful to the DC comics creation. I actually forgot about the other Batman movies while watching which is testament to the production here. Will Batman thwart the bad guys and save the day? - you'll have to see for yourself. I for one can't wait for the next installment. Great Movie! - Enjoy!",1121817600,,2762,4.6687242798353905

From the trailers I thought this would be Batman vs. Scarecrow, it's not theres about three vilians in the movie. Scarecrow is cool vilian I like the gas as a weapon and how the screen got all distorted when he used it and how is voice sounded when he put on the mask. His first appearence on screen kind of creeped me out. All in all this look like the begining of a good new franchise.",1121817600,,519,4.360824742268041
1575132,5,B00005JNJV,"Having grown up on Batman (89) and its sequels, this sudden retelling of the Batman saga took me by surprise.  Did this imply viewers to forget the first four movies, that this was THE definitive Batman story?  Or was this an alternate reality separate from the previous movies.

What separates this from the previous Batman canon is that it explores the why's and when's of Bruce Wayne as a child, something that was gone over superficially in the 1989 Batman.  We see Wayne falling down a well and terrified by a cloud of bats that fly at him.  Then there's the oft-told tale of how his parents were gunned down by a criminal.  And the big payoff is of course, whence came Batman?

His jiujistu and ninja training by the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) of the League of Shadows, a group dedicated to a vigilante-style justice, explains how he not only hones his skills, but also how he confronts his fear.  And he decides to put fear unto baddies by the very thing he feared most.  But the Legion is more a crusader for justice in an extreme way.  Using Rome and Constantinople as examples, the Legion have been behind-the-scene catalysts for change in decadent empires, paving the way for the Germanic peoples and Ottoman Turks respectively.  It's Gotham's turn, reminding me of the words of Jack Nicholson's Joker, ""this town needs an enema.""  Yet despite his brooding and anger, Wayne still believes in the justice system, which sets him at odds against Ducard.

Back in Gotham, Wayne is welcomed back to Wayne Industries, led by corporate shark Earle (Rutger Hauer), where he befriends Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), head of the high-tech division, which translates to exile from the board room so he can't cause trouble.  Seems that his division has a lot of stuff the military didn't want to use, such as certain bulletproof body armour, grapple hook, a lightweight parachute-like fabric, and a humvee-type vehicle originally for bridge purposes.  Wayne's deadpan question:  ""Do you have any of these in black?""  He sets out to undermine Carmine Falcone, the gangster behind the racketeering and drugs in Gotham City, yet there are other players, such as Dr. Crane, head of Arkham Asylum, whose duty is to pronounce Falcone's thugs insane so they can't be found guilty.  And Batman is dead set on protecting Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), his childhood friend, now an idealistic assistant at the DA's office who's fighting a lonely crusade against corruption.

Where the previous Batman films featured a Dark Knight already at the peak of his powers, this shows Batman in the making.  He makes a clumsy attempt at escaping when first making contact with Sgt Gordon, the only honest cop in Gotham, crashing into all sorts of things in the process.  And where Tim Burton made his Gotham City a dark and gothic place, Christopher Nolan's Gotham retains the same murkiness, but with a more glossy high-tech covering.  And certain hazy scenes play havoc with the usual deadeningly fast action sequences.

Batman here is defined as a vigilante, which draws comparisons to Paul Kersey in Death Wish and the idealistic cops in Magnum Force.  The latter case was motivated for personal revenge, while the second was against corrupt criminals who got off scotfree.  In his belief in universal justice as opposed to parochial revenge, his role as champion and hero puts him higher than the aforementioned vigilantes.  But as in Dirty Harry, the system, so riddled with corruption, is not working, and things can't go on as they are.

Christian Bale's Batman is as brooding as Michael Keaton's, but with a more hoarse and menacing edge to his voice that makes the previous Batmans sound like Tiny Tim.  Veteran actor Michael Caine scores points as the ever faithful butler Alfred.  And points for Katie Holmes who still manages to be adorable in such a grim film.  And yes, the ending more than hints at a sequel.",1121731200,3,3911,4.86404833836858

1575134,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is the long awaited fifth film in the Warner Bros. Batman Series. This series started off strong with Tim Burton's first film Batman with Kim Basinger as Vicky Vale,the love interest for both our hero and our villian,Jack Nicholson having a field day as the psychotic Joker,and in one of the strangest casting decisions ever that actually worked,Michael Keaton played Batman and Bruce Wayne and he played both roles brilliantly. After three years,Tim Burton returned to Batman in Batman Returns,where Batman(once again Michael Keaton,playing the role sadly for the last time)fighting the powerful duo of Catwoman(played by a amazing Michelle Pfiefer) and the Penguin(played by Danny DeVito,who really didn't do that great)while Bruce Wayne is falling for Catwoman's alter-ego,Selina Kyle,who wants revenge on her boss for killing her. While Returns is a good chapter,it was called too dark and depressing,which is true. It was decided that the series needed to become lighter.

Three years passed and Batman returned in Batman Forever. A new director in Joel Schumacher made things more colorful and a little cheesy. Batman(now played by Val Kilmer,who was better than Keaton,IMO)now taking on the sinster Two-Face(Tommy Lee Jones)and the insane Riddler(played by a absolutley hilarious Jim Carrey)with the help of his new found ally,Robin(Chris O'Donnell).All this is happening while Bruce has found a new love interest in Dr. Chase Meridan(Nicole Kidman).All in all,Forever was a huge hit,despite not being a favorite in the series. Next,Batman & Robin. Batman(now played by George Clooney)and Robin(Chris O'Donnell,again)take on another group of villians:Mr. Freeze(Arnold Schwarzenegger),Poison Ivy(Uma Thurman),and her flunky,Bane. With the help of Batgirl(Alicia Silverstone),our heroes must stop the villans before it's too late. Although I enjoy this film,many people hate it and it's okay. It was considered to be the worst Batman film ever and the worst of the Schumacher films.

Anyway,the series was considered dead.......until now!!!!!

Batman is back in a big way in this amazing film directed by Christopher Nolan. This film gives the resons of how Bruce Wayne
became the Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne(Christain Bale,who is the best Batman EVER)is in the Himalayas where our story begins in a prison cell where a man named Henri Ducard(Liam Neeson)offers Bruce a chance to join the League of Shadows,where Bruce can be taught how to fight against injustice under the leadership of the mysterious Ra's Al Ghaul. After he learns some incredible skills,he decides to return to Gotham and do something about the criminals who run the streets. With the help of his loyal butler and friend Alfred(Michael Caine),a man named by Lucius Fox(Morgan Freeman)who makes his equipment,and Defense Attorney and childhood friend,Rachel Dawes(Katie Holmes),he will battle the psychotic Scarecrow(Cillian Murphy),evil crime boss Falconie(Tom Wilkimson),and the ruler of the League of Shadows himself,Ra's Al Ghaul.

This is the most intelligent and best of the series. The plot is great and has several twists and turns. The cast is great:Morgan Freeman,Michael Caine,Liam Neeson,and Tom Wilkimson are great in the roles they have been given,especially the first three I mentioned. Katie Holmes does decent in her role,just don't expect anyting groundbreaking. Cillian Murphy is terrific in the role of the Scarecrow and is downright scary. And Christain Bale IS Batman and makes you forget Kilmer,Keaton,and especially Clooney. He is amazing in the role and he is the best Bruce Wayne,too.

So,if you weren't satisfied by the first four,Begins will be the one you'll enjoy!!!!!! See this as soon as possible! The Ultimate Batman movie is here and it's Batman Begins!!!!!!",1121644800,2,3778,5.495697074010327
1575135,4,B00005JNJV,"BATMAN BEGINS scraps the previous four execrable movies and returns to Batman's roots, with this coming-of-age tale of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), brooding vigilante hero.

Bruce, who blames himself for the death of his parents, seeks to understand the criminal mind by recklessly throwing himself into crime as another man might drown his sorrows in liquor. He eventually ends up in an Asian prison where he is found by Ducard (Liam Neeson), who takes Bruce on as an initiate of the League of Shadows, vigilante ninja society extraordinaire.

In the end, Bruce cannot embrace the League of Shadows' strictly black-and-white view of crime and criminals, destroys their stronghold, and returns to Gotham to clean up the place.

It is fun to watch Bruce and his faithful butler/surrogate father, Alfred (Michael Caine), assemble the Batman gear from the forgotten store of military prototypes at Wayne Enterprises.

When the League of Shadows returns to Gotham to finish what they started, Bruce must fight and overcome his former mentor to save his not-so-fair city.

Christian Bale gives a performance which makes all the previous Batmans laughable. Fans of the graphic novels will applaud this latest addition to the Batman series, and be more than willing  to overlook (or be unaware of) the plot holes, scientific impossibilities, and historical inaccuracies.

I, however, am too much of a science and history geek to suspend disbelief and simply enjoy a movie like this. I think anyone with a basic knowledge of how their home microwave oven works will think ""Wait a minute..."" when the bad guys stand blithely around their microwave superweapon as it cooks Gotham's water supply. (The human body is 90-what percent water?) And the League of Shadows takes credit for introducing the plague rats to Europe (which time?), burning London in 1666, and sacking Rome (which time?). Claiming credit for the Nazis would be just as ridiculous.",1121644800,,1940,5.159235668789809
1575136,5,B00005JNJV,"A dark and forboding film with a serious Noir twist, as Gotham tends to be. For Me, some of the most profound scenes commenced in the beginning sequences of the movie during the temple scenes, wherein it is established that the caped crusader did indeed train with Ninjas, and is in fact, a Ninja himself, which explains much of his exploits from agility to ingenuity, amazing strength to stamina and boundless energy, the skill and the training, the expertise in weaponry, the self-discipline and determination, the psychological projections and invisibility - all of these and more, taught through Ninjutsu. Here, Ninjas represent a balancing force in nature, the ""legion of shadows"" who go forth into human civilization when excesses are reached.  Ra's Al Ghul {Ken Watanabe} is present here, the veritable Shidoshi, and Ducard {Liam Neeson}, Wayne's mentor and sensei who rescued him from the clutches of a filthy prison, which was the result of his own fiece self-exploration.

For those familiar with the origins of the Batman chronicles, we know how The Dark Knight originates, through unfortunate and tragic events concerning the rotten dregs of the underbelly of society - and this adversity caused the inspired greatness of this tenebrious form, eventually leading him upon a personal journey to find his place within nature and to plunge the darkest recesses of his own shadow side, as Shadowmancy is accessed and utilized, one's inner monsters employed towards beneficial endeavors.

His primary foe herein is The Scarecrow, a mental health professional who has developed a psychotropic narcotic in aerosol form, which bestowes hallucinogenic torment upon those so afflicted, combined with his fear mask, essentially, a blank slate, a veritable canvas for the victims to paint the gruesome forms of their own horrors. Quite ingenious, actually.

The ever-carnal Bruce Wayne arrays himself with fleshly pleasures when not in his alter-ego, indulging in superb women, and finery of all sorts. He surprised the residents in his own company when he one day returned from the frozen tundras of Tibet to Gotham City, feeding his demonic appetite when opportunity allowed. He does have somewhat of a love interest in Rachel Dawes {Katie Holmes} , a childhood sweetheart, yet their extreme professions frequently take them in sweeping dramatic directions.

There is a clue at the film's conclusion which opens for the idea of a sequal, and even the probable character...

I found the film's primary focus to be that of a shadowmantic nature - that is, accessing the primal fears buried in the subconscious and surfacing them to either terrify or edify, according to the fortitude of the subject.

Batman Begins is a welcomed evolution in the Batman Saga, considering the former two jokes previously produced which obviously catered to the slovenly herd; and although this chraracter is one of comic book legendry, the personality absolutely displays de-facto qualities of the Satanic mindset, and has remained a prototypal Devil throughout.",1121558400,,3044,5.263917525773196
1575137,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman begins is a good movie.  It answers several questions for those who have not read the DC series (i.e. Why ""bats""?, Why are all the bad guys escaped from Arkam?,  Where does Bruce Wayne get his cool crime fighting gadgetry?, etc.).

The stunts are great.  The bat-suit and utility belt are still imaginative.  The bat-cape is still too cool!  And, I want to park my '70s muscle car and drive this bat mobile (unlike the tiresome cars in the previous 4 flicks)!

Bale is great as the Caped one.  Caine, Freeman, and Hauer are memorable in supporting action.

The movie really takes off after the first 30 minutes of Zen-Judo weirdness.  The prison and ninja fights scenes are dull and boring- bordering on silly (as usual with martial arts stuff).

1575138,2,B00005JNJV,"This wasn't a bad movie per se, but I was expecting so much more. I would have to rank this as the 3rd best in the series, behind the first two. While it was nice to see the origins of Batman, I think they gave away too much. Because Batman is such a mysterious character, I think it would've been best to have his origins described in vague manner, instead of spelling it out for every first grader to understand. Much of Batman's mystery was lost and because of this, the movie lost much of its appeal. Another thing that bothered me was when they showed him coming back from Princeton, they tried to make him look young a few years younger, however, Katie Holmes' character didn't age at all (I guess she uses Oil of Olay). Contrary to other reviews, I don't think her perfomance tarnished the movie, but I think her not aging whatsoever like Christian Bale really irritated me (you can suspend your belief only so much)..

Then we have the person who played the psych doctor at the hospital (the one w/ the glasses and scarecrow mask) looks like a prototypical  high school drama geek who always got his @ss kicked everyday after school. And how about that ending?? How can there be so much carnage and no talk of casualties. I was thinking to myself when the train flew off the tracks and took out everything in its path that at least 10,000 people died in this one scene. I will say I liked Christian Bale much better than Clooney or Kilmer, but this role was perfected by Michael Keaton. The supporting actors were excellent, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, but the one who played the heroic cop was SOO boring. As you can see, casting was a mixed bag.

In conclusion, I expect many people to tar and feather this review or to not pay any heed to it whatsoever, but I have a feeling many of you will agree with me, but will fall in line with everyone else and give it 5 stars.",1121558400,4,1885,4.364672364672365
1575241,4,B00005JNJV,"Or rather, the revitalizing of one. Batman has always been my favorite superhero, mostly for his lack of super-extraordinary powers and the darkness of his image. Unlike the all-American apple-pie wholesomeness of Peter Parker and Clark Kent and their respective counterparts, Bruce Wayne and his alter ego were always far more sinister. Menacing. Sombre. Unfortunately, the previous film renderings - even Tim Burton's much-beloved forays into the franchise - lacked this sense of dark inscrutability, ranging anywhere from the insanely Gothic to the unbearably campy, but always missing the true essence of the character.

Not any more. Christopher Nolan brings new life to the Caped Crusader, along with a more in-depth psychology and more believable methodology than anything seen previously. I cannot think of anyone I'd prefer as Batman than Christian Bale: he has a single-mindedness, a certain ferocity to him, that absolutely works for the driven character of Batman. He is in prime form here, demonstrating his usual dedication to the character and impressive talent, but he has got quite a supporting cast to back him up.

Not since the Lord of the Rings movies has such an extraordinary ensemble of performers been assembled in one film. These people are artists first, before movie stars, and it shows in their careful craft. The performers are not the only great aspect of the film, but they are essential to the mood: always realistic, they are nefarious or idealistic when appropriate. My particular favourites are Liam Neeson, elegant and paternal as always, but here driven by darker motivations than usual, and Michael Caine, who brings a humanity and emotional realism to Alfred that has not been seen before. He too is a father figure to Bruce, a nice touch that has been lacking from his usual function as a crusty facilitator. Also wonderful is Gary Oldman, who does a 180 from his usual slightly insane roles and embodies so much decent normalcy onscreen that it is slightly disconcerting in the midst of such madness. Indeed, the only weak spot in the casting is Katie Holmes as the dewy Rachel Dawes: she is amiable enough, but sorely outclassed in an otherwise exceptionally outstanding ensemble.

The production design is also outstanding. Gotham City is rotten to the core, to be sure, but there are observable vestiges of the grandeur that was, and also of the Wayne family ties to the city: Wayne Tower dominates the city centre, and the Wayne monorail - the pet project of Bruce's philanthropist father - is a now-dilapidated relic of better days. Its destruction near the end of the film is almost poetic. Batman's technology is not as advanced, but this I see as an improvement rather than not. The Batmobile, for instance, resembles an unlovely cross between a Lamborghini and a Hummer - far tougher and less sleek than the others, but practical for the demands of city-saving. I particularly like how it gets in and out of the Batcave. No fancy lifts or hydraulics here; it shoots - with a little help from its jet engine - through a waterfall into the Batcave, which is precisely that: a dark, dank, craggy mess home to some tens of thousands of bats. The Batsuit is something that looks like it might actually be an extant but neglected military prototype. And, perhaps most happily, it is presented sans the molded nipples and thong underwear, and even the ""six-pack"" is not ludicrous. The evolution of it, particularly the Cowl, is also entertaining to watch. All this combines to give this Batman a far more realistic tone, something the franchise has long needed.

But now let us return to Bruce Wayne for a moment. This is by far Christian Bale's most commercial film to date (ignoring 2002's largely forgettable ""Reign of Fire""), but the actor gives no sign that he is a bona fide Hunky Movie Star in a bona fide Big-Budget Summer Blockbuster, giving another finely-tuned, pitch-perfect performance. His Bruce Wayne is subtle, nuanced, tormented not only by the demons of his childhood but those of his own dark soul. He is extensively trained but not entirely grounded; there are hints of madness in his dark eyes. Bale is debonair and suave, yes; he is completely believable and appropriately shallow in his playboy persona.

But more than this, he is scary. One would not want to meet him in a dark alleyway, nor would one want to get on his bad side. He inspires fear, not only as Batman, but as Bruce Wayne too; this is something the previous Batmans failed to do for me. Bale has always had an enormous talent for using his physicality to enhance his characters: in ""Empire of the Sun"" he went from a skipping, easy-going slip of a lad to a hard-bitten, almost feral survivor; in ""American Psycho,"" he was a ripped, six-pack-bearing, body-obssessed narcissist; in ""The Machinist"" he transformed into a walking skeleton, haunted nearly to his own extinction by his inner demons. Here, he is brawny, equipped again with a finely muscled physique that looks quite capable of beating the life out of someone. It is more than eye-candy here (although I'll gladly admit I'm happy to see him buff and beautiful again after his cadaverous turn in ""The Machinist""): it makes the persona of the superhero believable when we know there is under the molded latex of the Batsuit a real, honed, physical weapon that could inflict definite and serious damage.

One is impressed, too, in this film that Bruce's alter-ego Batman is more than a way to shoot off steam after the playboy's partying. Unlike Peter Parker, who strives to live a normal life despite his superhero responsibilities as Spider-Man, Bruce Wayne needs Batman: the two are symbiotic halves of the same whole, neither equalling a whole person and neither capable of existing without the other. Bale captures Bruce's essential humanness without ever overplaying the role, bringing gravitas and dignity to the superhero genre.

This is definitely a Batman of the twenty-first century, informed by terrorism and 9/11. Rather than outlandish corporate villains and hedonistic monstrosities, the enemies here are idealists, warriors who fight for ideas rather than power. Ra's al Ghoul and his inscrutable League of Shadows operate covertly, infiltrating hierarchies, quietly sabotaging social structures, utilizing economic warfare. Here, they employ a biotoxin emptied into the water supply as a weapon; it is not to destroy the world, but to save it from itself. This allows for a far greater exploration of human motivation and psychology than has been attempted previously, and is far scarier than anything else I've seen in ""hero"" films. The film has received some criticism for not playing up to the younger, more comic-book atmosphere of the others, but this is precisely one of its biggest strengths. It is a very grown-up superhero flick, with adult concerns and adult methods on display. This Batman is part film noir and part action flick, but the two are married gracefully, bringing a long-overdue elegance to the franchise and offering the promise of several more fine outings to come.",1121558400,,7098,5.005080440304827
1575242,5,B00005JNJV,"This film is brooding and dark, but also exciting and smart, Batman Begins is a film that understands the essence of one of the definitive superheroes.

""Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)--the billionaire prince of Gotham whose parents were killed in an alleyway mugging--transformed into the crime-fighting superhero. With flashbacks to his privileged childhood, young Master Wayne, as he is called by the butler Alfred (Michael Caine), develops a terrible fear of bats when he falls through the backyard garden into a hidden cave. As a young adult, Wayne lives among the League of Shadows, a martial arts group in the mountains of Asia. His leaders Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) teach him strength, endurance, and--unfortunately--evil, against which he naturally rebels. Returning to Gotham and reinstating himself as a dapper socialite and the rightful heir to his parents' enterprise, Wayne quickly devises his secret identity, commanding help from the gadgetry expert Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). With one eye on his childhood playmate Rachel (Katie Holmes)--now a beautiful woman and dedicated lawyer--and the other on his mission to save Gotham from criminal corruption, Batman makes his fledgling debut. But when the blue-blooded mastermind Dr. Crane (Cillian Murphy)--who steals every scene with chilling menace--taints the water system with a hallucinatory substance, Batman realizes he has met his first true opponent.""

Good story, excellent character developement, and awesome action scenes make this the best batman movie to come out in years. Only complaint is that the scarecrow didn't get enough screen time, but he'll be back. This is a definite must see for fans and non fans of the series alike.

1575243,5,B00005JNJV,"I know that a lot of people think that the Tim Burton Batman movies are masterpieces, but I didn't like them.  And it is true that Batman and Robin was pretty stupid and hackneyed.  I basically thought that the Batman series was dead, but then Batman Begins provided a fresh outlook on the whole Batman concept.

This movie tells the origin of Batman, a subject that no previous Batman movie had whole-heartedly attempted to do.  In the movie, a young Bruce Wayne falls down a well and is frightened by bats, establishing a chronic phoebia.  His fear of bats leads him to persuade his parents to exit an opera that they are attending featuring bat-like costumes.  Tragically, Bruce witnesses his parents being mugged and shot to death in the alley outside the theater and blames himself for their deaths.  Their killer is caught and imprisoned but Bruce cannot allay his angust.  Several years later he travels to Asia to understand the criminal mind.  There he meets Ducard, who trains him to control his fear and anger.  Bruce takes these skills back to Gotham and becomes Batman.  And in Gotham, he finds that he really has his work cut out for him....

I thought that the actors in this movie were well cast.  Christian Bale carefully balances Batman as a strong hero who has dark inner troubles.  His Bruce Wayne is young, consequential, and above all a inheritor of the powerful Wayne name.  Katie Holmes was also fitting as Rachael, a childhood friend of Bruce's and a future love interest.  She was at times a damsel in distress, yet still a firmly grounded force to be reckoned with.  Liam Neison was great as the mysterious mentor Ducard, and Morgan Freeman (Fox) and Michael Caine (Alfred) both served as perfect father figures for Bruce.

Finally, the plot was one of the best that I have seen in a Batman movie.  The main motiff of the movie is fear.  Batman learns to use fear to his advantage, while others fall victim to the Scarcrow's hallucingenic toxin that causes them to be tortured by their personal demons.  The villians in the movie are well characterized and conduct their devious plans with the uptmost guile.  As the movie progress, the viewers sees Batman's accretion as a hero and will be routing for him to win in the end.  This is an action packed movie with a get hero and even a more austere yet still powerful Batmobile.

This movie ends by adumbrating that sequels are in the works.  I sure hope that this is true because if Batman has such a promising begining, I can't wait to see where the journey will take him, even if future movies involve re-inventing characters that are present in existing Batman movies.  Let's hope that Batman's legend will continue for years to come.",1121385600,,2714,4.672995780590718
1575244,5,B00005JNJV,"Or rather, the revitalizing of one. Batman has always been my favorite superhero, primarily for his lack of supernatural powers and the darkness of his image. Unlike the all-American apple-pie wholesomeness of Peter Parker and Clark Kent and their respective counterparts, Bruce Wayne and his alter ego were always far more menacing, even sinister. Unfortunately, all the previous film renderings lacked this sense of dark inscrutability, ranging anywhere from the insanely Gothic to the unbearably campy, but always missing the mark.

Not any more. Christopher Nolan brings new life to the Caped Crusader, along with a more in-depth and believable psychology than anything seen previously. Nolan brings with him the psychological sophistication of his work in ""Memento,"" and it shows: he tells a real story with skill and elegance. Yes, ""Batman Begins"" has all the elements of traditional action flicks: car-chases, fight sequences, even the now-obligatory martial-arts training duels, but it also gives us reasons that are, if not logical, at least plausible why a billionaire orphan would dress up as a nocturnal rodent and fight crime on the streets, instead of, say, joining the Peace Corps. As in ""Memento,"" the plot really is not essential to the story, but plots are always the same in superhero flicks anyway: Hero discovers an enemy intent on destroying the world; Hero saves World and Girl. The plot in this is similar (though Batman has a bumper crop of villains to fight rather than just one) but it is not detrimental to the film: this is a tale of ideas and motivations first, and is more than the sum of its parts.

I can't think of anyone I'd prefer as Batman than Christian Bale: he is good-looking, but with a certain ferocity to him that works for Batman, who is here more than slightly reminiscent of another of Bale's characters with a remarkably similar name. Batman's clearly a ""superhero,"" but unlike previous outings it is also impossible to forget this time that he is ultimately a Man, motivated not so much by an overpowering desire to do right as to inflict serious damage on people who do wrong. There's a substantial difference.

Bale is in prime form here, as usual, but he's got quite a supporting cast to back him up. Liam Neeson is elegant as always in what appears to be a patented mentor role, but it was a refreshing change of pace to find him driven by darker motivations than usual. Michael Caine brings a humanity to Alfred, making him a father figure to Bruce and becoming more than just the crusty facilitator we're used to. Morgan Freeman's ""Q""-equivalent Lucius Fox is slightly redundant, as the third father-figure in the film, but he also brings a kindly cunning to his role that is fun to watch; he has been around long enough that he knows Wayne doesn't want gear for extreme sports, but he is also wise enough to ask no questions. The biggest surprise is perhaps Gary Oldman, who does a 180 from his usual slightly insane roles and embodies so much decent normalcy that it is slightly disconcerting in the midst of such madness. Indeed, the only weak spot in the casting is Katie Holmes as the dewy Rachel Dawes: she is amiable enough, but her smarmy debate-club delivery doesn't belong in the noir Gotham Nolan has given us; she's too young and too bathetic, and is sorely outclassed in an otherwise exceptionally outstanding ensemble.

The production design is also outstanding. Gotham City is rotten to the core, to be sure, but there are observable vestiges of the grandeur that was, and also of the Wayne family ties to the city: Wayne Tower dominates the city centre, and the Wayne monorail - the pet project of Bruce's philanthropist father - is a now-dilapidated relic of better days. Batman's technology is not as advanced as we are used to from previous films, but this I see as an improvement rather than not. The Batmobile, for instance, resembles an unlovely cross between a Lamborghini and a Hummer - far tougher and less sleek than the others, but practical for the demands of city-saving. When it smashes into things and stays intact, I believe it's possible. I particularly like how it enters and exits the Batcave, without the luxury of lifts or hydraulics; it shoots, jet-propelled, through a waterfall into the Batcave, which is precisely that: a dark, dank, craggy mess home to some tens of thousands of bats. The Batsuit is something that looks like it might actually be an extant but neglected military prototype. And, thank God, it is presented sans the weird molded nipples. The evolution of it, particularly the Cowl, is also entertaining to watch. All this combines to give this Batman a far more realistic tone, something the franchise has long needed.

But now let us return to Bruce Wayne for a moment. This is by far Christian Bale's most commercial film to date (ignoring 2002's forgettable ""Reign of Fire""), but the actor gives no sign that he knows he's a bona fide Hunky Movie Star heading a bona fide Big-Budget Summer Blockbuster, turning in a pitch-perfectly crafted performance that threatens to make him the Definitive Batman. Bale is as good at low-key performances as he is at outlandish ones, and here he strikes a remarkable balance; his Bruce Wayne is subtle, nuanced, tormented not only by the demons of his childhood traumas but what he perceives as his continued failure to avenge them. He is extensively trained, exceedingly dedicated, but not entirely grounded; there are hints of madness in his dark eyes. Bale is debonair and suave, yes; he is completely believable as his shallow playboy persona.

And yet even his handsome playboy is ominously rough around the edges. Bale already has experience playing spoiled, psychotic rich kids, and there are moments when Bruce Wayne says something and his voice slips into that unnervingly hollow sing-song fans of ""American Psycho"" remember, his vapid grin gets a little too wide and too feral, and his eyes get a familiar twinkle to them that is far from comfortable. He has a way of cocking his head, even without the bat-eared cowl, that is distinctly predatory. Bale makes Bruce Wayne something he hasn't been before: scary. One would not want to meet him in a dark alleyway, nor would one want to get on his bad side. He is a superhero who all too easily could really enjoy his work, and we know it.

Bale has always had a knack for using his physicality to enhance his characters: in ""Empire of the Sun"" he went from a skipping slip of a lad to a feral survivor; in ""American Psycho,"" he was a ripped, six-pack-bearing, image-obsessed narcissist; in ""The Machinist"" he transformed into a walking skeleton, haunted nearly to his own extinction by his inner demons. Here he looks the part again: at 6'2"", he is already the tallest of the actors to play Batman, but he is definitely the largest too, equipped with a brawny physique that looks quite capable of beating the life out of someone. It is more than eye-candy here (although I'll admit I'm happy to see him buff and beautiful again after his cadaverous turn in ""The Machinist""): it makes the superhero credible when we know there is under the molded latex six-pack of the Batsuit a real, honed, physical weapon that could inflict definite and serious damage.

One is also impressed upon in this film that Bruce's alter-ego Batman is more than a way to shoot off steam after the playboy's partying. Unlike Peter Parker, who strives to live a normal life despite his superhero responsibilities as Spider-Man, Bruce Wayne needs Batman: the two are symbiotic halves of the same whole, neither equaling a whole person and neither capable of existing without the other.

This is definitely a Batman of the twenty-first century, informed by terrorism and 9/11.

Ra's al-Ghul and his inscrutable League of Shadows operate covertly, infiltrating hierarchies, sabotaging economies. Here, they employ a biotoxin emptied into the water supply as a weapon; their aim is not to destroy the world, but to ""save it from itself."" And not only the bad guys have been modernized; much of the Bat-gear is acquired from mothballed military projects, which all too frequently were rejected, we're told, because the government didn't feel that saving soldiers' lives were worth the expense.

All this coalesces into not only a grown-up superhero flick but a grown-up film, period. The film has received some criticism for not playing up to the younger, more comic-book atmosphere of the others, but this is precisely one of its biggest strengths. It is concerned with adult burdens and adult methods. This Batman is part film noir and part action flick, but the two are married gracefully, without insulting the viewer's intelligence, bringing a long-overdue elegance to the franchise and offering the promise of several more fine outings to come.",1121385600,,8983,4.915622940013184

This movie is really the first real attempt to make batman work in the real world.

1575246,5,B00005JNJV,"Finally! We get a Batman movie that is worth the type

instead of a run of the mill action film with a boat

load of well known (and popular at the time) actors.

The movie starts with Bruce Wayne as a little boy and

spends a great deal of the first half of the movie

going in detail about how and why Bruce Wayne became

Batman. It really is a nice change from what the series

has been doing the last two sequels.

Christian Bale is very convicing as Bruce Wayne and I

had a great feeling that he would fit the part. He

brought seriousness, but yet fun back to a Batman

character that had become a stiff and lame ""super

hero"" and he wasn't the only one. I thought Michael

Cane was very underrated and brought good humor to

the Alfred character. It's actually ashame he didn't

get more airtime.

This movie won me over when it put character develop-

ment and thinking over run of the mill action that

seems take the lead in movies such as this. Could

some of the fight scenes brought alittle more? Yes,

but it's forgiven since that's not what this is

really about. Another great thing is not one guy

totally took the show. It it was pretty much a team

effort with the exception of Katie Holmes who just

didn't have enough charisma and presence to the

movie.

But it wasn't all her fault... She simply wasn't a

good fit and was a girl among men in this movie.

The rest of the cast was just too notch and it

shows that a good balance of acting can make a movie

work more than a movie with one great proformer or two

can.

Another thing is that the movie was light on the cheese

and B movie type of lines for most of the movie and most

of the humor felt refreashing and real. Nothing was all

that forced here... Just GREAT team acting and a dark

feel that hasn't been seen since the first film back in

1989.

1575247,5,B00005JNJV,"I'll not mince words, I'll not try to feign some foreign objectivity in this review; I am a fan boy. A comic fan boy, a Batman fan boy. So, obviously, I went into Batman Begins with certainly a different mind set than most. A mind set of great hope for the quality of the film, and, if that hope was dashed, an elevated level of dislike and disappointment. I happily report that upon viewing this film, there was absolutely no need for feelings of disappointment on my part. The movie is, simply put, perfect. If not as a film in its own right, than as an faithful adaptation of the character of Batman.

So, where to begin my critique? Well, the heart of every film is its story/plot, so I'll start there. Begins' is excellent. I've known it for quite some time, having read the script to the film over a year ago (even wrote a review about it), so there really wasn't anything ""shocking"" for me in that department. But still, what impressed me the most about the Begins script months ago, once again impressed me on the screen. The story is simply huge. In both scope and depth of plot. A LOT happens in this movie. More than anything that's happened in the previous Batman movies, maybe more than anything that's happened in any superhero movie. This, thusly means no minutes are wasted in Begins; every scene has a purpose and serves a point to the plot. Which makes the movie quickly paced and never, ever boring. I never go into a lot of plot detail in my reviews, but suffice it to say there are plenty of twists, turns, emotional impacts that will keep your eyes locked to the screen. Including an end scene which may not just be one of the most iconic scenes ever, but also drops a big hint of the great things to come in Batman's adventures and, hopefully, in Begins' sequel.

The thing that impressed me the most about the film was the acting. Every performance is stellar. Probably the best cast and performance since the Lord of the Rings. And not only is everyone excellent, they each give breath life into their character, and give it a...personality all its own. Liam Neeson as Ducard plays the perfect mentor role, just as he has done repeatedly during his career. Michael Caine proves himself to be the best Alfred ever; balancing wit and concern for his Master without becoming a nag. Morgan Freeman is almost endearing as the film's ""Q"" character; providing Bruce with all the necessary equipment to become the legend he desires to be. Gary Oldman simply is Jim Gordon, quickly become an almost impromptu sidekick of Batman's, and does so in a way that's both fun (sometimes even funny) and smart. And Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow does the most of his somewhat limited screen time and steals every scene he's in. And doing it without stealing the movie; a flaw of the previous Batman films and villains. He's marvelously creepy, and simply devours his dialog and spits it back out with a fervor and passion you don't often see. I'll definitely be paying close attention to Murphy's burgeoning career, as he may indeed turn out to be something quite special in the acting world in years to come. Also, mentions should also go out to Tom Wilkinson and Rutger Hauer for their supporting rolls as Carmine Falcone and Mr. Earl respectively. These are professionals, and they display their expertise in every scene.

Then at the center of this grand opera of oscar-caliber acting, there is Christian Bale. The fan favorite. The cult icon. He is...amazing. He gives, without a doubt in my mind, the best portrayal of a superhero ever. Even surpassing the late, great Christopher Reeve. He gives Bruce a personality that, frankly, I have never fully seen before. Even in the definitive Batman: The Animated Series. As Batman, Bale is animal. In every scene of the word. The crutches in the shadows, perches upon rooftops, and barks orders to all around him. If you ever wondered exactly how someone could be afraid of a guy dressed up in a Bat costume, Bale more than answers your question. You could be afraid. You would be afraid. Bale's Wayne is really a four dimensional character, which each one done to perfection. We see Bruce go from a lost, troubled adolescent, to a hardened, but just as lost, man, and then finally becoming the Bruce Wayne he should be. The Bruce Wayne we all know. Only a bit different. A bit better. This is something I was specially amazed by. So far, we have either seen Bruce Wayne as a cold, remote...shell of a man really in the previous films, and even the cartoon, or as a flat out jerk in the comics. Bale sidesteps either of these personalities. Instead he becomes something much more human and relatable. A person you truly feel sympathy for. As much as Bale's Batman is an animal, Bale's Bruce Wayne is a person. And a damned good one, at that.

Of course, the ""real"" Bruce, he must create an outward, playboy persona to deter any...suspicions, and, unsurprisingly, Bale does this perfectly as well. Taking a page from his performance in ""American Psycho,""  Bale makes Bruce into the ultimate billionaire airhead. He's selfish, conceited, and downright stupid. A newspaper headline near the end of the film most notably spells that out. The performance is almost funny, without ever being campy or overly silly.

As for Katie Holmes, an actress I have little love for, she actually does quite well herself. Her performance is definitely the weakest of any of the main characters, but it's by no means bad. I wasn't expecting much from the character of Rachel, after I had grown to loath her since reading the script, but Holmes did a pretty good job of breathing life into the character and actually making her...likable. While her performance could be topped, you really can't complain.

Visually, Begins is many things. From the ice and snow-capped mountains of Bhutan (which is almost a cross between Lord of the Rings and Nolan's previous film ""Insomnia""), to green and bright images of Bruce's childhood, to the dark and Blade Runner-esque shots of Gotham City, there is one consistent; excellent cinematography and rich pallet of colors, effectively touched up by the bleach bypassing process the film went through. Nolan's cinematographer certainly adapted his styled perfectly to fit the world of ""Batman Begins,"" making the film seem both epic and claustrophobic, when needed. There's nothing I love more than a beautifully shot film, and Batman definitely pleased me in this area. While ""Begins"" isn't quite the best shot film I've ever seen (that mantle goes to LOTR), it's definitely one of the best, and anyone like me who takes enjoyment out of that area of film should be quite pleased.

Howard and Zimmer's score for Batman Begins is much different from the now-classic Danny Elfman score, but that's a good thing, as Begins' atmosphere is so different from the previous films. A completely score was needed, and composers did an wonderful job of reinventing Batman's themes. While I must say I still prefer Elfman's score, the Howard/Zimmer score is very strong in its own right, and leaves no room for complaints. It doesn't have a main, recognizable theme like Elfman's, it's not really noticeable, and, once again, seems to ""fit"" with the mood of the movie.

The Special Effects are particularly noticeable. And for just the right reasons. Instead of a sterile, CGI-created environment, Nolan went back to basics, and had nearly all of the effects done the old fashioned way; with real people  Shocking, I know, but amazingly effective. Nothing looks fake about Batman Begins, when Batman's gliding through the sky, it looks like he's gliding through the sky, when the Batmobile's crashing through Gotham, it looks like it's really happening, and why shouldn't it? It was real.

That brings me to my next points; Nolan's ""vision"" of Gotham, and, probably the soon to be legendary, Batmobile chase through the city. Gotham is much different in this film than it ever was previously, and personally, I love the change. While I firmly believe Burton's Gothic style in 1989's BATMAN was beauty in every sense of the word, it did have its flaws; Gotham seemed small, and subtly artificial. Nolan corrects this, ""opening up"" Gotham by combining a London airplane hanger of sets and the city of Chicago itself to make Gotham look more like a real city, than just a child's nightmare. As for the Batmobile chase, it is as high-caliber as everything else in the film. This Batmobile (also called The Tumbler) does things no one would ever dream, let alone seen, a car doing before. I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of the more famous car chases in the history of film when all's said and done.

Nolan's direction of Batman Begins isn't as...noticeably brilliant as some of his other films, but it is still very strong, and still better than most directors in Hollywood. The film is edited quite well, and judging from the acting performances of the film, his direction to his actors must have been suburb as well. He's definitely turned out, at least, his second best film in Batman Begins.

But now, sadly, I must address the flaw in the movie. Every film's got at least one, and Begins has its own; the cinematography during fight sequences. Many have already criticized Nolan for this. Quite severely, in fact. I wouldn't go quite as far. The fight scenes aren't horrible, they're just simply not the best in the world. I can almost see where Nolan was coming from in his choice of shooting the fights with many quick-cuts and close ups. It's confused, hurried and disoriented; which is exactly what a fight with Batman would be like. So, it's not bad in terms of realism, but for viewing enjoyment, it falls a bit short.

Overall though, I'd have to say without a doubt, Batman Begins is not only one of the best films of the year, but also the most well-made film in its genre yet.",1121299200,6,9862,4.746207701283547
1575248,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins shows that it is possible to have a well plotted movie, with CGI effects shine when you have a set of first rate actors playing the roles.

From Bale, to Caine to the Cillian Murphy's absolutely PERFECT Dr. Craine and the even more perfect Liam Neeson the acting not only complements the action and CGI but rises above it.

This is a loose adaption of BATMAN year 1 series it is so well done that I can't wait to see the next one.

I've yet to see another picture this year that was so worth my money and worth yours.

1575249,5,B00005JNJV,"While Batman Forever focused on the psychology of destruction and human emotion's justification power, the psychology, or rather, mental illness, of Batman Begins shows the power of mental thought in healthy individuals (no body problems or mental disorders that prevent ordinary function with humans or travel) and also recorded that feeling when applied to the sense of the unknown.

Hence Batman is a rogue warrior trying to be different from all other fighters. The movie portrays him as a man trapped in China trying to find his way to his soul. He will do anything to mess up his mind and life to get to the ultimate form of combat. He trains with a group known as the League of Shadows (with the excellent Liam Neeson) and even learns how to get along with them. At the end, in a surprise, he breaks free of them and kills them all (by accident or by skill) in an explosion, saving Neeson, who is his trainer. The skill of teaching must be respected in this case.

However, that is the most (or least) Batman, played by the excellent Christian Bale, will allow. He will preserve the art and skill of a fighting technique, but otherwise trusts entirely to gadgets, and of course, Wayne Enterprises and his luxurious outfit. However, his fearless devotion to being seen as mentally unstable yet accomplishing his goal is something to be lauded for sure.

The film's main antagonist is an insane lawyer who locks people up in Arkham Asylum, scene of most of the villains' demise in the cartoons, if you're a fan of those. While I've not read the comics, I do know that the movies are gently entertaining, and don't dispute with them, nor conceive of something better or worse. What's interesting is his use of a spray that makes all those who breathe it fearful of everyone around them. Then a fight ensues of a different kind on the island where the asylum is located. Batman has trained himself for this moment and has an antidote, and it's here where the fighter's skills show up.

Trained to be aware of the fear, not just merely know it, and capable of making his enemies ten times better at fighting him due to his weakness, his ultimate awareness leads not to boredom, but to insight. His ultimate insight: Save the girl, win the movie, be a good hero, makes others into heroes as well.

At the end of the movie, you're treated to a nice look at the beginning of the original Batman. The Joker is his next villain. A nice end to a climactic, and very spiritual, script.",1121212800,,2480,4.589164785553048

1575388,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is one of the best Batman movies yet. I was honestly not expecting much and just expecting to see just another Batman film with yet another actor playing Batman. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was, and what a great job Christian Bale (American Psycho) did. I had no desire to even see this film and I was really glad I did. This movie is dark but not as dark as some of the earlier films. What makes this Batman stand out is that like the Spider-Man movies this has just the right amount of action and drama. I will not give any details about the movie as not to spoil it for people who have not seen it, but I will say Batman Begins is in the tradition of Spider-Man and it is truly worth checking out.",1121040000,4,736,4.153846153846154
1575389,5,B00005JNJV,"What can I say that hasn't been said already?  I can say ""WOW"", but does it carry the same emotion that everyone else speaks about?  I don't know, but for me, this was the best summer blockbuster that I have seen in 2005.  Christopher Nolan has done his homework, stayed true to dark, graphic stories that follow this hero, and set in place a cast that equally carry the weight of this film on their shoulders.  I remember saying to a friend that the reason this film worked was because of the cast.  In previous Batman films, we struggled between the over-acting of some, the celebrity status of others, and some that were just plain goofy, but now Nolan has given us a cast that carries this film into a whole new ballgame.  They want to be there, they want to embody their characters, they want to give birth to this Dark Knight, and they do.  When I first heard about this film being in the pipeline, I was concerned about Christian Bale taking on such a role that has been demolished by the heavy-hitters of Hollywood.  Could he do it?  I had faith in him, but did everyone else?  Apparently they did, because he is the most powerful representation of this tortured figure ever to come out of comic book Hollywood.  I applaud his work, appreciated his toned down approach, and cannot wait for him to come back and prove that he is this winged freak.

Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, Tom Wilkinson, the AMAZING Cillian Murphy, Linus Roache, and Ken Watanabe.  With names like this you know that you are walking into greatness.  I was worried at first about Caine as Alfred, but with the greatest of ease he turned what could have been the comic character of the film into this powerful voice of Wayne's conscious.  It was incredible.

While I give so much credit to the actors, I need to equally pay respect to Christopher Nolan.  Not since Sin City did I feel like I was watching a graphic novel, a comic, come alive on screen.  His ability to frame each shot like a moment in the books, create these breathing characters that you can actually believe exist, as well as tell a story that has been corrupted by the Hollywood recycling machine takes talent and Nolan did it.  I have been a huge fan of everything that Nolan has touched.  I used to give Memento out for free at the video store just so people could experience the magic that he has.  I was a fan of Insomnia and even Followers.  I get excited to see his work because it changes with each picture.  You never know what you are going to get when you watch a Nolan film, but you can guess that it will be dark and come from his heart.  I saw it in his earlier films and it shined brightly in Batman Begins.

If I had to say anything negative about the film (which is hard to do) there would be two aspects that I would mention.  The first is Katie Holmes.  I just didn't like her character.  She was underdefined and basically eye-candy for the younger Dawson's Creek audience members.  She was worthless, perhaps it was the Tom Cruise media mud-bath that seems to have ruined our newspapers these days, but she just felt plain to me.  She didn't make the cut.  Then, there were times where you could tell that Bale was really forcing a grumbly American accent.  Nothing too wrong with this, but it just felt forced.  These were minor insecurities that I had with this overall brilliant film.

Outstanding.  Perhaps that is a better word for it.  I could see this film again and again.  From the opening frame to the final moments of battle I was pulled from my theater seat directly into the film.  No other Batman film has done that for me.  I remember falling in love with Keaton as the Dark Knight, but I think Bale even gave him a run for his money.  Nolan created the perfect tone and story for our disturbed hero.  He took the goofy elements from Burton, erased Kilmer/Clooney, and brought us back to our roots.  This film was perfection on a stick.

1575390,5,B00005JNJV,"After several disappointing Batman films, this one truly begins the good Batman films. It had a great and entertaining story line, good acting, and very good visuals. Sure it took a darker approach to Batman, but it paid off and created a very exciting, edge-of-your-seat Batman. It does the Black Knight justice.

The start of the film explores who Bruce Wayne was before he became Batman and even shows his parents' death. The beginning is great, but the movie takes off in the batmobile when Wayne returns to Gotham. That's when the fun starts. Great scenes of Batman busting bad guys and driving around in his ""tumbler"" keep you entertained. There are nice twists, a great ending, and even some remotely scary scenes. Add that with well placed humor and good acting from Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, and Morgan Freeman and you have one great movie.

Nothing is as cool as seeing the Batman logo projected in the air over Gotham, except Gotham itself, and Batman in action, and Scarecrow in action, and and and I could keep on going, but it will take to long and I don't want to spoil anything. Point is, after summer flops like Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Fantastic Four, Batman Begins is easily the best movie of Summer 2005.",1120953600,,1226,4.671296296296297

Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson. All of them were perfect. Kaitie Holmes kinda sucked, but she wasn't in the movie hardly at all. This movie had everything. Drama, suspense, action, comedy. I thought it was going to be decent, but it exceeded my expectations 10 fold. All the reviewers that are giving it a bad review, a la ""the true reviewer"" are giving Fantastic 4 more stars than Batman. That is insane. Fantastic 4 blew.

1575492,2,B00005JNJV,I cannot believe this. How in the world can a movie this bad get so many good reviews? This is deffinitely the worst translation of Batman ever. This story turns Bruce Wayne into a stupid rich kid who seems to care only for himself. Not only this but at the beginning of the film Bruce is in a prison. Why in the world would Batman be a criminal. To make matters worse we find out that it is a villian who actually is responsible for creating Batman. Then they make Gordon into a cop who seems to be afraid of his own shadow. And please tell me how someone as young as Katie Holmes ends up a district attorney. None of this makes sense at all. I won't even talk about the army tank they try to pass off as the batmobile. The only reason this movie gets a two star rating is because of the way they showed the fear of Batman and because of the great preformance by the actor who played the Scarecrow. All in all if you want to see good Batman I suggest you buy the stellar animated series which is now on dvd.,1120867200,6,1008,4.0703517587939695
1575493,5,B00005JNJV,"Back in 1989, I was extremely excited about the release of Tim Burton's BATMAN. And when I finally got to see the film, I remember sitting back in my seat, enjoying the moment...the moment when I finally got to see my favorite comic-book character on the big screen.

So after several viewings, I talked about how much I enjoyed it and thought it was great. Unfortunately I wasn't being totally honest with myself. While I did enjoy the ""moment"", I didn't necessarily enjoy the film.

The bat costume was rigid. Gotham City looked fake. Commissioner Gordon was a joke. Bruce gets Vicky Vale drunk and sleeps with her on the first date. The Joker kills Wayne's parents, creating this bizarre you-made-me/no-you-made-me dynamic (and to clear up some confusion for a couple of reviewers here: Joe Chill killed Bruce Wayne's parents in the comics, NOT the Joker).

Worst of all, the screenplay was just plain bad. Horrible dialogue, especially between Bruce and Vicky.

Over the years I've come to terms with the fact that Burton's BATMAN is just not a very good movie. And his sequel BATMAN RETURNS is worse.

So when people blame Joel Schumacher for destroying the Batman franchise, I'm not so hard on him. Yes, BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN & ROBIN were lousy...yes, worse than the Burton films. But in my humble opinion, the seeds of failure were planted by Burton himself. For all the talk about how dark Tim Burton's vision of Batman was, some campiness managed to seep out, especially in scenes between Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman and Danny DeVito's Penguin. Schumacher just took it to the next level.

But BATMAN BEGINS is the real deal. This time, the filmakers wanted to make a good movie, not just a blockbuster event. Director Chris Nolan and co-screenwriter David Goyer wanted to make a Batman film with a real story. A story about fear...conquering it and, when necessary, dispensing it.

It's also about a young man (Christian Bale) so distraught over the murder of his parents he journeys across the world seeking the means to fight injustice. This is where Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and Ducard (Liam Neeson) enter the picture. These two characters and their ""League of Shadows"" organization direct Bruce Wayne in his quest, inspiring him to be ""more than just a man"".

In the comics, Ra's al Ghul has been one of Batman's most powerful villains since the early 70's. I don't recall him having anything to do with Batman's origin, but it makes perfect sense in the context of the film...a credit to BATMAN BEGINS' excellent screenplay.

The screenplay also features wonderful dialogue that previous Batman scribes Sam Hamm and Akiva Goldsman could never hope to write, such as the moment when Bruce Wayne realizes that his mentors against ""evil"" have a disturbing agenda:

Ra's al Ghul: ""Gotham's time has come. Like Constantinople and Rome before it...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice...it is beyond saving and must be allowed to die. This is the most important function of the League of Shadows. It is one we have performed for centuries. Gotham must be destroyed.""

That's good stuff.

Anyway, it's at that point that Bruce Wayne comes back to Gotham City and, with help from his butler/moral compass Alfred (played with warmth and humor by the great Michael Caine), discovers the best way to strike against the criminals of Gotham is to make them good and scared...to become Batman. For reasons explained early in the film, Bruce has been afraid of bats most of his life, so as he explains at a point in the film, ""it's time my enemies shared my dread.""

Along the way we meet several characters, good-guys and bad. Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, an employee of Wayne Enterprises. He's an actual character from the comics, but tweaked just enough to be involved in the action...which is a good thing considering it's MORGAN FREEMAN for goodness sakes!

We also meet Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) who is Bruce's childhood friend. Her character is not from the comics but she's not a bad inclusion. She serves the purpose of grounding Bruce back into reality...quite literally slapping some sense into the boy during one moment. There have been some negative comments about Holmes' performance, but I think she was quite good.

Most importantly, we meet police detective Sgt James Gordon. Gary Oldman is wonderfully weary as the one good cop left in Gotham City. BATMAN BEGINS really captures the spirit of the comics and the unlikely friendship between Batman and Gordon is one of the many reasons why.

As for the villains, I couldn't have asked for a more appropriate actor to portray Ra's al Ghul. He's just perfect. Tom Wilkinson is surprisingly menacing as crime boss Carmine Falcone. And Cillian Murphy is Jonathon Crane, a criminal psychologist who becomes the Scarecrow when he puts on a mask and sprays fear-inducing gas.

I never would have considered the Scarecrow as one of the first villains in a movie about Batman's origin, but I once again have to hand it to the screenplay for blending his character seamlessly into the plot. A plot in which fear is the central theme, after all. There are some genuinely chilling moments involving the Scarecrow, maybe too scary for young children.

The film also has some decidedly cinematic moments, such as car chases featuring the cool humvee-style Batmobile. Batman's ability to glide thru the air with his cape (trust me, it's explained in the film), and an almost James Bond-like plot to destroy Gotham by poisoning the air with fear toxin. But these moments never feel too over-the-top or phony. It helps that the action is done with very little CGI effects. No, these cinematic touches merely add to the fun.

When it's all said and done, this movie is about Batman. We really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is and why he has to become this (as one character puts it) monster. Christian Bale is ideal as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Unlike others who have donned the cowl, Bale GETS it...he understands.

And when I see images from the film of Batman crouched on some building, cape flowing in the night air as he looks down upon the city, I know the filmakers of BATMAN BEGINS understand too.  BATMAN BEGINS is not just the best Batman movie ever, it's the best film of the summer and one of the best films of the year. This movie is intense, humorous, dark and exciting. STAR WARS, EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH and WAR OF THE WORLDS may end up making more money by the end of the summer, but audiences are finding BATMAN BEGINS infinitely more satisfying.

1575495,4,B00005JNJV,"Well do not get me wrong, I loved the movie, but It looks like they always have to change something and come up with different versions of what is on the books,(comic books, etc,),wich it is by the way, the Batman that we know and have known for more than 40 years. First they killed The Joker, of course they had to do it because someone thought that it would be a great idea to have him know who Batman really was and that he, (The joker) killed his parents? Come on` are this people really writing this stuff and nobody has a word to say about it before it goes into production? and they continued vandalizing ""The Classics"".

Now we have a New Batman, so far the Best in years..but already they keep on vaporazing the Villians,(well, at least we know one has the means to come back from the dead,)but Batman`s mentor,""Ducard"" does not have a Lazarus Pit to bath on.

Seriously, you don`t kill the arch nemesis, the bad guys, the criminal minds, think about Freddy Krueger and Jason, they always come back for more and people go to the see their movies without thinking if this is real or not. The word it`s Enterteinment, so forget about the ""non initiated"" and if they are going to see the movies thinking or believing ""this could be real"". The writers should keep it ""real"" by sticking to the classics.

Yeah! I know, I am a weirdo. I am a comic book reader, a nerd, a geek, whatever. So is Frank Miller,Jeph Loeb and others, (no offense meant guys)

1575496,5,B00005JNJV,"There is something which I think most of these reviews do not understand. This isn't the 5th film in the Batman Franchise, this is the 1st film in a whole new franchise. This will redo everything which Burton and Shumacher failed on. The next film in the series will be about the Joker, this will have nothing to do with the Nicholson Joker or even the Burton version, this is getting back to how the films should have been made, more realistic and about Batman not supervillains played by actors who are just playing themselves. Nicholson wasn't playing the Joker he was playing Jack Nicholson, same with Jim Carrey and Arnie.

Well to the film itself, it was fantastic. Bale and Nolan have made Batman believable and have made it the best Batfilm yet. Everything is explained well, everyone is well cast and have steered clear from using massive actors and actresses to make the film good. Bale is THE Batman and gives a superb performance, Caine is well cast as Alfred and gives him that toughness which shows how he can be butler to both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Cillian Murphy was perfect as the lunitic Scarecrow, creepy before he had donned the makshift mask. Neeson is also excellent as is Gary Oldman as Sgt Gordon.

The back story is great and it shows how Bruce Wayne could become Batman and shows him searching for his path and purpose in life, ironically shown to him by the villains he will try to defeat. Batman's story is well developed without being boring or tedious, the acting is never hammy, and the one liners are handed out sparingly. The makeshift Batmobile is absolutely fantastic and the burning down of the manor shows how Batman can build the Batcave to the standards of the original Batman. There are a few minor problems such as the fast paced action which can be a bit too fast due to the poor editing, and at the end, it seems as if Gordon is being used for comic relief, but the pros outweigh the cons by far.

This film was immensely entertaining and I am definately looking forward to the new sequels which will not make the mistakes which the original franchise did. Bring on the Joker.",1120867200,3,2121,4.561679790026247

Bale plays a wonderful Batman who is able to change his attitude in the split of a second as his personality goes from Batman to Bruce and vice versa.  Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanube, and Tom Wilkonson are great as always.  Katie Holmes did a great job, but it wasn't an oscar winning performance.

The entire cast is unbelievably good especially (Gary Oldman, Mark Boone Junior, Rutger Hauer and of course Morgan Freeman)and the script is very well written.  Too early to say if its better than the first two Superman films but it certainly gives them a run for their money.

1575500,5,B00005JNJV,"The question with Batman Begins is, ""Why does this movie need to exist?""  When I first heard of the project, it struck me as odd, considering that the original Batman is not an ""old"" movie.  Also, if you count the entire previous franchise, it just ended in 1997!  Eight years is hardly a lot of time to call for a remake.  Also, the original Batman is one of my favorite superhero films.

On the other hand, great as the original Batman was, all of the sequels were bad.  The last film in the series, Batman and Robin, (helmed by that hack, Joel Schumacher) was un-watchably bad.  Still, I was having enough trouble dealing with a remake of Superman - and that movie is over twenty years old.  Why Batman?

The original Batman jumped into its story in the midst of things: Bruce Wayne is already Batman, and that is how we see him in the first scene.  Although the original gets the tone right, we never delve that deeply into the mind of Bruce Wayne.  What makes Batman Begins the best of the Batman movies is because - dare I say it? - it is a character study.  The model Batman Begins follows is the original Superman movie: we begin in the hero's childhood, and explain who he is and how he got to be that way.  Like Superman, the superhero doesn't make his first appearance until half-way into the film.  The price of this is that we sacrifice some action.  The benefit is that we have memorable, three-dimensional characters.

If Batman really existed, this would be him.  Christian Bale is perfect for the part.  (For some reason, the movie is populated by Brits doing American accents.  Probably because they are better actors than we are).  We believe that Bale can be dangerous and he effectively creates different personalities for the playboy Bruce Wayne, the real Bruce Wayne, and the Batman.  (His characterization of the playboy is shockingly close to his performance in American Psycho.)  Unlike the Tim Burton film however (which I still love), this movie attempts to take place in the ""real"" world.  Of course, as Jim Gordon points out at the end, the introduction of Batman into Gotham City will surely produce the creation of equally outrageous villains.

A final note: One of the great things about the movie is the way it sets up relationships that we know will play out in the future.  Pay attention to that little boy Batman saves.  Doesn't Batman eventually get a helper?",1120780800,4,2397,4.62085308056872

Although ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" were excellent movies, this movie is excellent in a completely contrasting way.  Instead of jumping right into the bad guy of the moment, this movie makes the effort to set up the back story of Bruce Wayne, which is well worth it.  The only problems I had with this movie is

1) Cheesey alert!  Liam Neeson's character goes on and on about how one has to conquer fear, until I feel like I'm forced to sit through a presidential speech--""The only thing you have to fear is fear itself.""  Besides that, Liam Neeson is awesome.

2) I was slightly disappointed that they didn't do more with Cillian Murphy's character, Scarecrow, who has the makings of a worthy bad-guy opponent--interesting and dark, and not at all cheesy.

1575631,3,B00005JNJV,"I went to see 'Batman Begins' last night so while it is fresh in my mind, let me tell you what I thought of it -

Firstly, the director Christopher Nolan's previous work included the excellent 'Memento' and 'Insomnia'.He seemed like a weird choice of director for a superhero/action movie.

However, after seeing this film, it's clear why he was chosen - this film is very analytical in it's detail. The first hour and a bit of the film goes to explain why Bruce Wayne took on the persona of Batman. This is the main problem with the film. It is very very boring for the first hour. He doesn't don the cape and mask until about 70 minutes into the film.

Personally I preferred Tim Burton's vision of Gotham City and Batman. Christopher Nolan is trying to bring reason and sense into the Batman story. There is NO NEED to go through the level of detail that he has done. An audience can accept that Batman is a superhero end of story.

I also didn't enjoy the baddies in this film. They are not spectacular enough.

Also Katy Holmes plays the District Attorney of Gotham City. This is bad casting. She looks like a lost little girl in the film. Michael Caine as Alfred is pretty wooden as well. He phones in a performance e.g. doesn't try too hard. The same goes for Morgan Freeman. The role doesn't stretch him too hard.

Christian Bale as Batman is a decent enough performance. He's a good actor.

1575632,4,B00005JNJV,"I thought BATMAN BEGINS was a really good movie.  It explained why Bruce Wayne became Batman.  The stories of how Wayne's parents were killed from BATMAN and BATMAN FOREVER didn't really match up, though BATMAN (with Keaton) story was close.

I thought Christian Bale did an outstanding job as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  I would have to say that Michael Keaton and Christian Bale were the two best guys to play Batman.  Val Kimler was alright.  I thought he played one of the best Doc Holiday in TOMBSTONE.  George Clooney wasn't that great of a Batman.  sorry George!

The end of the movie was interesting.  It kind of leads into the other Batman movie with Michael Keaton.  In the movie, BATMAN BEGINS, it shows the murderer of Wayne's parents getting killed.  It's possible that there were two men responsible for killing Bruce Wayne's parents.  BATMAN BEGINS showed one of the killers and BATMAN (with Keaton) showed the other killer who turns out to be the Joker.  You can make your own guesses on that.",1120608000,,1006,4.706896551724138

As is well known, it was a majority consensus that the last two film's in the series were cheap parody's of the original comic series, that the caped crusader came dangerously close to becoming the ""campy crusader"", lost is some post modern haze. The last instalment (Batman & Robin) with George Clooney as the Batman almost brought Warner Bro's million-dollar Batman industry to a complete standstill. For some strange reason, Batman, even in the hands of capable filmmakers, lost its way, that is, until now.

Christopher Nolan as director and co-screenwriter, known otherwise for his ""thinking"" films (Memento) has brought his cerebral sensibilities to the project, resurrecting Batman and presenting the character in the true light he deserves.

Nolan approached the subject matter with the seriousness that is appropriate to Batman. He is a dark character, bordering on evil, using fear to combat evil. What Nolan has done is to give the audience the necessary background on Bruce Wayne, his seven year sabbatical in the mountains of Tibet, his training with the League of Shadows and his creation of the Batman, returning to Gotham city to fight the forces of evil.

What makes Batman unique compared to other superheroes is the fact he does not have super powers but trains himself to do amazing feats, Wayne's incredible will to extend himself towards excellence, in the creation of an ideal, is truly inspiring. As Bruce Wayne has unlimited funds as a billionaire, he is only limited by his imagination, creating the ultimate ""vigilantly"", a dark force to be reckoned with in the battle against crime.

The film has a league of excellent actors from Morgan Freeman to Gary Oldman playing a young ""Commissioner Gordon""; this would have to be the first ""good guy"" that Oldman has played in over twenty years, and as expected, as one of the best character actors in the business, put in a stellar performance.

Chris Bale as Batman soars above previous performances in the long series, making the character memorable and inspiring.

One cannot write about this film without mentioning the ""Bat mobile""; this car is simply astounding, zooming over the rooftops of the city. What one would give to have that car?

I had high expectations for this film before walking into the theatre and found that it exceeded those expectations - without question this is a five star film.",1120521600,4,2432,4.990123456790124
1575636,2,B00005JNJV,"I was looking forward to this movie with intense anticipation. I have seen every single Batman movie, and I'm a huge fan of comic-book movies in general, with the Spiderman movies my all-time favorites. I also respect the abilities of Welsh actor, Christian Bale, and everything I'd heard about this movie caused me to assume I'd love it. Unfortunately, I am more sorry than I can say that I have seldom had a more painful movie experience than enduring this film. Here are some of the main reasons why:

In Tim Burton's Batman, not only did Michael Keaton do a very good job of making Batman fascinatingly mysterious, the Bat Cave and Wayne Mansion, as his two personal spaces, both reflected his personality and added to his mysterious allure. In this new Batman, Director Nolan never shows Bruce Wayne in his own personal space at all the first half of the movie. Instead, he is either in a Far Eastern prison or trekking through vast landscapes in uncharted mountain terrain, all of this peppered with flashbacks of him as a child either in a hole in the ground with terrifying bats or at the scene of the murder of his parents. In the second half of the movie, Wayne Mansion is presented as utterly alien to Bruce Wayne, so it can in no way reflect him and thereby enhance his characterization. And the Bat Cave, as presented in this movie, is simply a raw cave with bats, meaning that it, too, has no ability to reveal either Bruce Wayne or Batman as a character.

The villain is also a real disappointment. I respect, too, the abilities of Irish actor, Liam Neeson, but he does a far better job playing tortured heroes than villains. He sports a perpetual non-expression as the Bad Guy of this movie, a man with a very mundane name of Ducard, and a persona that is supposed to be exotic, but comes off as ordinary and unengaging. Where a colorful, frightening villain is important in a regular action-adventure story, it is supremely vital in comic-book action-adventure stories. Thus, a Batman story just doesn't look or feel like a Batman story without a Joker, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, or a Penguin.

Another issue, as well, that undermines the potency of Neeson's villain: Because of the way the story is plotted, he is not on stage throughout the movie to taunt Batman with threats of destroying innocent, helpless people, thereby giving Batman frequent opportunities to perform daring, hairsbreadth rescues. Instead, Batman fights tepid battles against a middle-management villain, Dr. Jonathan Crane, played by another Irish actor, Cillian Murphy, who looks, and acts, like an Eric Roberts clone. On the one hand, it is something of a relief that Crane/Murphy sneers a lot better than no-expression Ducard/Neeson, but the downside is that his sneering serves to make Neeson appear, in contrast, an even more flat and uninteresting villain than he already does.

Another major beef I have is that this movie's claim to fame is that it ""explains"" how Batman became Batman, but it does only a partial job of it. Yes, it shows Bruce learning advanced martial arts in the Far East, but by the time he joins the Ninjas who teach him, he is already a superior martial artist, and we never learn how he has gotten that way. In addition, I found the entire Ninja plot to be a boring echo of the Ninja action-film genre which adds nothing useful to the comic-book action-film genre, and makes no contribution at all to the world of Ninja action films. As for how Bruce amasses his Batman equipment, we get only a partial explanation about only a tiny part of the equipment we know from the comics that Batman owns. We also see almost nothing of Bruce learning to ""fly"" with fancy climbing and yanking cables, which I'm guessing is because Nolan decided it would be impossible to compete with the fantastic job the first Spiderman does showing how Spiderman learns to soar and fight using his webs.

Ultimately, for me, the reason the ""creation of Batman"" portion of this film fails is because it is NOT what I, as someone who loves comic-book heroes, most want to see in a Batman movie--the superhero himself, dressed to the teeth in leather, flinging himself off buildings and kicking the crap out of villains. As a result, the ""beginning"" part of the movie comes off as merely a prologue, an elaborate flashback frame for the movie's true story.

My final complaint is with the use of setting in the film, both the actual sets of the movie and Director Nolan's use of lighting and camera shots. Nolan focuses constant attention in Gotham City and in the Ninja camp on the ""atmospheric"" techniques of dark lighting and jerky camera shots that consistently interfere with the audience enjoying the main purpose of an action film--outstandingly choreographed and executed fight scenes. In addition, Nolan's nightmare vision of New York City aka Gotham City, is so bizarre, it becomes an invasive, scene-stealing secondary character, drastically taking the focus off Batman. A number of far-better-done, comic-book movies, from the Superman series in the 70's and early 80's, up through the current Spiderman movies, understand in a way Nolan obviously does not that a normal, recognizable, everyday NYC allows the audience to viscerally connect with both the victims of the villain and Batman as their rescuer. When victims are ordinary people with plenty to lose, such as homes, jobs, and families they care about a lot, they are much more compelling as victims. Instead, in this movie, all but four of the potential victims of the villain(s) look and act like nuclear holocaust survivors crawling around in the rubble with nothing left to live for. Of the four semi-normal characters, Alfred the butler never gets into any trouble; Policeman Gordon never gets into any rescueable trouble; Rachel Dawes gets into highly predictable trouble because she walks around the entire movie exhibiting the self-protective instincts of a sitting duck; and one cute little boy who is a victim of the villain's poison gas is so surreally healthy and well adjusted among the hell-hole denizens of Gotham City, he stands out like a rose on a dung heap--and is about as believable. In short, the Gotham City Director Nolan so artily portrays is so grotesquely degraded, the villain's plot to euthanize the suffering inhabitants and level it to the ground comes to seem, by the movie's end, a reasonable idea.",1120521600,8,6394,4.861467889908257

No stupid-corny-cheesy Val kilmer, Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, robin, batgirl, or Mr. Freeze in this one ladies and gentlemen. This is the real deal right here! Finally, a serious batman movie, and it actually stayed close to the story of the original comic book series. Excellent job by Christian Bale. My only VERY minor complaints about the movie was it was a tad bit slow in the beginning, and I was really hoping for more of a fight out of the ""scarecrow"" villain at the end of the movie. still a 5 star movie.",1120521600,4,638,4.369747899159663
1575638,5,B00005JNJV,"Here in San Francisco the house was completely packed at the huge, sprawling IMAX cinema at Fourth and Mission.  People say you should sit right in the middle of the audience, not too far over to the left or right, otherwise the screen will start curling at the edges and you'll lose some of the detail of the grain.  (For the same reason they say not to sit in the first few rows, for the top of the screen will seem too far away and starts ""whiting out"" like the Aurora Borealis.)  I don't know if that's so, but why take a chance, so we picked our way through till we found a pair of seats directly under the projector.  It seems to me that all big movies should be released in IMAX simultaneously to their release in regular stock, so kudos to Warner for making this happen with BATMAN BEGINS.  Once the theater went dark you could hear a pin drop, and then, out of the three hundred plus speakers embedded behind the giant screen, you heard the massed orchestra, heavy with brass and glass, launch into the IMAX theme and we were all there.  A whispery little promo under the strings says, ""Use your IMAXination.""

Christian Bale, America's number one actor, outdid all of his previous roles (except those in NEWSIES and VELVET GOLDMINE) playing Bruce Wayne as a young man, younger than we're used to seeing him and eliminating the need for a Robin in the story.  Why have Robin when your Batman is just Robin's age?  After all the brouhaha about Katie Holmes' supposed inadequacy in the part of Rachel, I was surprised to see how good she is.  For me, she has always been up and down.  Good sometimes, as in THE GIFT or WONDER BOYS or THE ICE STORM, but I remember seeing that horrible, horrible picture about her being a bohemian in the East Village and trying to make a Thanksgiving dinner for her family, from whom she has been estranged, and nothing, nothing, not even Scientology, could ever be as bad as that horrible movie PIECES OF APRIL and Patricia Clarkson as her mother!  Anyhow her Rachel here was just as good as her Rachel in DISTURBING BEHAVIOR.  I think people just like her playing ""Rachel,"" I'm surprised she wasn't Rachel on FRIENDS. In IMAX she soars about thirty-five feet tall and she's a good enough actress to hold her own in scenes opposite many old pros who chew every piece of scenery they find.

The people ahead of us in the theater were talking about how the DVD is supposed to have some deleted scenes that Nolan and Co. left out the BB due to excessive length.  (It is pretty long, you definitely get your money's worth.)  I hope they will give us Christian Bale's screen test!  I know many fans who would pay premium money for such a treasure.",1120521600,2,2683,4.45398773006135
1575639,5,B00005JNJV,"Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") takes the helm for the latest entry in the successful (""Fading,"" my a--, though I haven't seen ""Batman Returns"" or ""Batman Forever"") franchise, steering it away from the first 4 movies, thus re-inventing the Dark Knight for a new generation. The acting was excellent on all levels (Oscar-winners Morgan Freeman, also doing some voice-over work in Steven Spielberg's awesome remake of H.G. Wells' classic sci-fi novel ""War Of The Worlds"" [see my review on it], and Michael Caine appear as Lucius Fox and long-time ""Batman"" staple Albert, the butler, providing the comic relief when neccessary). Katie Holmes (best-known as the love interest in ""Dawson's Creek"") does a great job as Bruce Wayne's love interest, aside from being another pretty face. Christian Bale (the little boy in Steven Spielberg's ""Empire Of The Sun"" and the ""Boy"" in Kenneth Branagh's ""Henry V"" [see my review on it]) has come a long way since then, turning in a ferocious, yet completely believable, performance as Bruce Wayne. Liam Neeson (best-known as Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's epic ""Schindler's List"" [see my review on it]), Ken Watanabe (the samurai leader in ""The Last Samurai"") and screen villian Gary Oldman, doing a 360-degree turn, bring up the supporting cast...and do it very well. All I can say is, BRING ON THE SEQUEL!! Why not cast Tom Cruise as the villain in the next film? Christopher Nolan (""Memento,""
""Insomnia"") opts for a darker take on the origins of ""The Bat Man,"" thus creating the atmosphere for an emotionally gripping, more stylized version of Bob Kane's immortal comic book creation, ditching the campiness of the first four (unless you count the 1966 ""Batman"" film, which was based on the 1960's TV series) movies. The scene where Rachael (Ms. Holmes) literallt slaps some sense into Bruce should've been extended and ended a little differently, but screenwriter David S. Goyer had the right idea, choosing to further explore the here-to-fore uncharted reasons that drove Bruce to becoming ""The Dark Knight."" The small scene where Rachael is protecting a little boy also should've been extended, but it probably would've driven the movie way off track, however further it would have developed her character.

1575779,5,B00005JNJV,"If George Clooney said that he had killed the Batman franchise, Chistian Bale had revived it.

In fact it is not truly fair to say George Clooney killed the franchise because the last series of franchise were killed by greed and bad screenplay. Michael Keaton was unhappy with the direction the seies went and decided not to reprise the third time. History proved that he was right. Nonetheless, Batman Begins breathed new air into this stagnant fossilised franchise and brought it back to life.

Batman begins adopted the same dark tune that Tim Burton had set for the series but the emotion in this one is even darker. There was an in depth study of Bruce Wayne and Batman's psychology that departs itself from the last two movies. In the first one, we had the unwilling hero and in the second one we had the lover-enemey relationship between Batman and Catwoman. In the third and the fourth one, the villains had taken over the limelight with technology leaving two empty shells for the audience to wondering what is actually happening.

The childhood memories and haunting of Bruce Wayne had led him into complete emotional and psychological breakdown. He could not face himself nor anyone he knew. He chose an exiled life and prepared to complete the cycle by punishing bad guys in the jail, which he got himself into. He was ""rescued"" by a mysterious man who eventually unfolded a series of events that Bruce had never thought of. The respect and pain relationship between Liam Neeson and Christian Bale was well portrayed and written; nonetheless Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman got the best lines in the movie. Katie Holmes had been overshadowed not by Tom but by the lack of performance she could have in the movie. Despite that she is the only lead, she is hardly ""leading"" the story in any sense. There are quite a number of other baddies in the movie but most of them didn't really make their mark in the movie, except maybe for Cillian Murphy who played the villain doctor.

The main difference of Batman Begins from other similar movie is the abandonment of extensive CGI for effects. As the actors themselves said, Batman is never a superpower hero so it doesn't make sense to have a lot of CGI to do the stunts while they are not difficult to do by the actors themselves. The product was series of fast paced fighting and melee scenes that could leave an impression in your mind. The gadgets are popular and well know gadgets but they were well used and well explained scientifically in the movie. Like the way they explained about the cape. The Batmobile was a bit stylishly clumsy but it served its purpose of originally designed as a battle tank. If you want to find flaws, it would be some illogical bits in the movie like why if the whole construction on top of a snow mountain exploded, there was no avalanche following? Also how come all of a sudden a mountain resident who never uttered a word of English could speak a line in fluent English? Nonetheless they are just minor stuff and actually if you don't care, they are quite amusing.

The movie ended with a very good link to the first Batman movie that could play the music in your heart.

In all Batman Begins is a successful reinstalment of the franchise and unless Warner Bros committed the wrong choice again to kill it off, it could well leave good credentials for the franchise to survive in the current generation of movie goers.",1120521600,2,3415,4.645695364238411
1575780,3,B00005JNJV,"Some quote from the movie (or something like it): 'The reason why we fall down is because so that we would learn to pick ourselves up' -(no not Vader)Bruce Wayne's pops

A monologue from the movie (or something like it as well):

Bruce Wayne to Michael Caine: 'Tell me Alfred, why do you give a damn so much?'

Alfred played by Michael Caine's answer: 'I give a damn - because your father intrusted me with something that is very important for him in our world.'

DC Comics' doomed BATMAN movies franchise shed its new skin with this yet another movie depiction of Bob Kane's classic cape crusading comic book hero, and most desperately so- being that the other rival comic book company is scoring well these days with its load of titles frolicking about in the movie industry since their campy tv equivalents back in the late 70's-- by stripping out the cheesyness and out-of-control production inspired by Tim Burton's creative yet confined vision in moviemaking, cutting out the commercial trimmings given with the actors chosen for the earlier movies and the cast of artists for the soundtrack on the movies (I guess the very first big mistake with the first Tim Burton film is that they commisioned The Artist Formerly Known as AFKAP to score the flick with that chessy BatDance, I said then they oughtta have U2 (being a big fan of the band) whom they did have for the third installment's soundtrack, but AFKAAFKAP ain't no Ray Parker Jr., if you know what I'm saying (sorry for the paraenthesisses)); and incorporating a more darker / serious approach which in this case is mainly propelled by Christopher Nolan who wrote and directed the film. Needless to say (and yet I'd state it such) It's Chris Nolan's baby. Welp, mainly...

Heir to the growing empire which his parents have left, blaming himself for the murder of his parents and haunted by his childhood fears for bats- This time we have Bruce Wayne (confined from an oriental prison cell) recruited by Qui Gon Jin, er.. a character played by Liam Neeson rather- from a secret society zealous with its concept of Justice, which reflect a lot more on what the Tarot cards' sentiments implies - total blind amoral justice, for the sake of justice, called the League of Shadows (nope, none of those from Dan Brown's flimsy novels) led by Rahs-Al Ghoul. Here, Wayne is subjected to a certain shot that's a bit like those of Miyagi and his apprentice, Daniel-san from that 80's movie classic -Karate Kid. But our dear Bruce (played not so impressively but good nuf by Christian Bale this time) had his own ideas, and thus the apprentice became a defiant vigilante under his own umbrella so-to-speak, the BATMAN came out of the shadows and thus commence what could be another string of movies gaping for box office appeal for the next years prospectively to come along our way. It is also a latter point in the plot that Bruce Wayne had to confront the very man who killed his parents, facing an appeal for bail- here, Nolan gave the character of BAts that resembles a lot like those which the Daredevil have suffered in the wake of its own Comic Book pages, specifically the 'BORN AGAIN' series, where the Kingpin- finding out about the true identity of blind lawyer MAtt Murdock, gave life a living hell for this other comic book company rival to DC's costumed hero - equivalent to this here DC's DArk Crusader.

Quite lenghty, and other than that sort of Talkish- this time we have BAtman's foe The Scarecrow as the featured villain for this first re-installment on this BATMAN flick. ANd obviously, on its next stop we are indicated by the film that it would be Bats' arch-nemesis The Joker that's to be featured in the next film. Jack Nickolson I hope he's not. However, the Scarecrow's depiction is the downer in this flick, not so impressive me thinks.

Oh, and yeah check out what happened with BAts' wheels we faintly remember as the BAtmobile.

For one thing, casting the presense of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson is a splendid thing and the actors played their characters well, and also there's Gary Oldman and somehow, Rutger Heuer's presence have gone to me unnoticed.

Oh, and as for Tim Burton, he'd a remake of Roald Dahl's children classic CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, maintaining its title this time, featuring (who else?) Johnny Depp in the role of Willie Wonka, along another NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS-like flick titled CORPSE BRIDE.

and Lastly, another quote:

'Everybody falls down, it's just all about how fast you can get up again right' -sorry this time its from another movie, DRIVEN.

but here's one from this movie and from the Bats himself:

EASY READER: 'What's (the thing) with the bat?'

WAYNE as the BATS: 'I'm afraid of bats. It's time that I give them a fair share of my own fear.'

1575781,5,B00005JNJV,"I never know what to expect from a Batman movie.  Some of them seem more action-oriented than suits my taste, but they're almost always entertaining in one way or another.  This one is one of the best, in my opinion, because the back-story is blended in with the action without diluting it, as well as a good deal of philosophy about the difference between justice and revenge, which interests me, and unfortunately is still not resolved.  I wonder if there's a website somewhere discussing the topic.  Anyway, what holds all this together is not good plotting, but talent from all directions - lotsa good stars - Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Michael Caine, Katie Homes, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, others.  I never used to like Michael Caine until he got older, and changed my mind probably when he did Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Steve Martin.  I've liked him more in each movie since, and he's outstanding as Alfred the butler in this one.  The rest of the cast performs to their usual high standards as well.  If you're familiar with Batman at all, the plot won't have any big surprises for you, but a few fun small ones that fill in the story.  All in all, it's one of the best movies I've seen this year, recommended for Batman fans as much as for those who've never read a comic book or seen a Batman movie before.",1120435200,,1337,4.584033613445378
1575782,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman's had a rough ride in the movie business.  He started out all right-you might argue that Batman launched the current craze of translating comic books to movies.  But before the Hulk, Spiderman, Daredevil, and the X-Men came to the big screen, Batman had to fight to be taken seriously. Unfortunately, after making strides with the Batman movie by Tim Burton, the franchise slowly lost ground to directors who didn't respect the material, eventually finding its way into the hands Evil Incarnate himself, the bad guy fanboys loathe everywhere: Joel Schumacher.

It's not that Schumacher's vision was wrong, because Batman has certainly been campy before (one look at Adam West's television series drives that point home).  It's that Schumacher was making a movie for himself.  Conversations about ""staying true to the material"" didn't happen then.  Schumacher did whatever he felt like, and to heck with anybody who disagreed.

Like the big dumb animals that movies tend to be, franchises only stop charging down a path when they get seriously wounded.  When Batman & Robin finally, blessedly, flopped in the box office, comic book movies stopped getting made and, unfortunately, Batman along with them.

Given that little history lesson, it's understandable that Batman Begins strives very hard to ""keep it real.""  Every character is perfectly cast, from Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, to Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, from Michael Caine as Alfred, to Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon.  The actors, the directors, the studios now take comic-based films very seriously and stock them with the right people...casts that had been only fantasized as ""dream teams"" for comic book translations are now regularly realized. Bale has the physique and brooding manner necessary to pull off a believable Batman and an even more believable Wayne.  Freeman has the reserved kindness and intelligence required for Fox.  Caine imbues Alfred with whit and charm as only he can.  And Oldman is both frightened and frail as a lone good cop in a world gone mad.

With this newfound respect, Batman Begins starts the franchise all over again by going back to his roots.  And by doing so, in the same way Enterprise helped Star Trek (but alas, could not sustain it), Batman Begins forgives past sins by focusing on the visceral parts of the its protagonist.  There is a gritty realism that serves as a constant reminder that Batman person could exist, from the training Bruce receives from ninjas to how Bruce, Lucius and Alfred conspire to create Batman's suit and Batmobile.

Even the villains are carefully weaved through the plot. The Scarecrow is actually Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, creating zombies instead of fighting them this go round), with grandiose plans of psychological experimentation on Gotham City. Ra's Al Ghul, the leader of a shadowy organization that destroys empires, employs Crane.  If there is a high-minded plot point that might lose some members of the audience, it's the ninjas...but man I just love me some ninjas.

There are links to Batman history all over the place.  Batman Begins largely follows the events in Batman: Year One, especially when Bruce falls down a hole and is terrorized by a swarm of bats-a fear that, to the writers' credit (Christopher Nolan and David Goyer), is never forgotten even as they amp up the action and violence.  The tank-like form of the Batmobile harkens back to The Dark Knight Returns.  In that regard, Batman succeeds admirably.

There's a lot to cover.  The chase scenes are a little too long, and the Rachel Dawes character played by Katie Holmes is almost unnecessary. Still, Batman Begins alternately feels like an urban horror or a dramatic character study.  There is nothing campy or self-parodying here. When Batman strikes, it's horrifying.  When Bruce Wayne manipulates, it's believable.  It's to everyone's credit that there are no jarring transitions between the two worlds.

Ultimately, Batman Begins is the platform for a much larger story.  The events in the first movie stage the platform for the next and explain why so many crazies-with-a-theme populate Batman's world.  If the Batman franchise can stray true to this new ""comic book realism,"" it will be a joy to watch unfold.  Here's hoping this is just the beginning.",1120435200,,4300,5.089871611982882
1575783,4,B00005JNJV,"I loved ""Batman Begins"" overall, especially because it stays true to its title and focuses on Batman's origins. It is also very dark and brings Batman back to his brooding film noirish roots. Christopher Nolan was an ideal choice for director given his film noir past with ""Memento"" ""Insomnia"" and ""Following"", but I suspect that a well-trained dog could have turned in a better effort than ""Batman and Robin."" (""Batman Forever"" was an OK change of pace, and fit Jim Carrey, it doesn't deserve to be lumped in the same category as it's successor.)

""Batman Begins"" is a near perfect film, though I think it took a terrible wrong-turn in its closing minutes. SPOILER ALERT! While it is true that both of Burton's efforts could stand to go a shade or two darker, who dares to take on Jack Nicholson's ""Joker""? Why go into head-to-head competition with a pretty good film when you have the opportunity to correct utter garbage like ""Batman and Robin"" ? Mr. Freeze deserves better than the Governator and Poison Ivy was perfectly cast, and should have been given more to do than fight like a Power-Ranger.",1120435200,,1101,4.7643979057591626

I couldn't wait to come home from school to see who the Dynamic Duo would be up against that day.  Have enjoyed the ""Dark Knight"" cartoons and all the movies--particularly the third in the series ""Batman Forever"" with Val Kilmer as Bruce/Batman.

Needless to say, I saw ""Batman Begins"" on the first night.  I've been back once---driving 2 hours to reach the San Antonio IMAX to see ""Batman Begins"" on the big screen.

""Batman Begins"" is a prequel to all the other motion pictures, filling in Bruce Wayne's backstory from what we've only before seen as nightmares and flashbacks.  Here we see Bruce's parents die and know the youth's full pain.  We also see Bruce retiring from the priviledged world to understand crime so he can fight it better.  He's selected by a mysterious man Ras Al Ghul, who tells him he's being recruited to bring justice to the world.  Aftet grueling training, Wayne realizes that Al Ghul and Company are planning to destroy his home, Gotham City.  Bruce returns to his hometown and becomes Batman to help rein in on the crime spree that threatens to turn the town into a modern-day Babylon.

Christian Bale is my favorite actor portraying Batman.  His very down-to-earth humor fits what I think of Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine also blew me away as Alfred Pennyworth.  At last, an actor truly worthy of the role. What I really like is very little of the movie is 'dated.' The Prince soundtrack from ""Batman"" definitely takes you back to the 1980's and just doesn't hold up to today.  I think ""Batman Begins"" is a very nice beginning indeed.  I hope they will continue and redo the old Batman stories.",1120435200,3,1704,4.671140939597316

Batman Begins offers you all the great stuff you crave in superhero movies. You know how you look at the heroes' weapons in movies and you would like to see more. Well Batman Begins gives you plenty of information and looks at his weapons and the Bat suit itself. Batmans enemies are great , he has alot of enemies one including his co-owner of Wayne Enterprises. This Batman movie is the best ever. To be honest it's the best movie I seen in 2005. But I didn't see Star Wars Es. III.But it beats any other flick out there. It's 2 hrs. and 15 minutes long , so you get alot of action and Batman himself. I seen this movie twice already and it was good for the second time too. Go to the theaters and see this movie. Pick Batman Begins over Star Wars and Mr. Mrs. Smith , I promise you , you won't be disappointed.

thanks god Tim Burton didn't direct this movie.superhero movies don't need a freaky director.only smart ones that  make good stories like Chis Nolan the director. He should win some kind of award for putting Batman back on the map and capturing the true like and story of the Dark Knight - Batman. Oh yea he's not the cape Crusader anymore try ""Dark"" Knight.

1575786,4,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" brings a breath of fresh air to the tired and weakened ""Batman"" film franchise.  Although it lags a little when compared to Tim Burton's original ""Batman"" flick, it more than makes up for the drivel that followed it.  Christopher Nolan directs this Bat with care and a harsh degree of reality.  He also manages to make a Bat that is considerably darker, moodier, and more atmospheric than Burton's.  That's hard to pull off, but Nolan does it.  David Goyer handles the script rather well, and manages to make a film that is appeasing to the mind and to the eye.

The story introduces us to the events that lead up to Bruce Wayne's becoming the Dark Knight.  It plays out as if the other films never occurred.  Wayne's parents are murdered and he witnesses the crime.  The killer gets off after serving a few years, but a series of events leads to the uprising of a crime boss with a stranglehold on Gotham City.  This prevents Wayne from exacting vengeance on his parents' murderer.  Angered, Wayne seeks out the criminal mind, learning everything he can about them(including prison life), but it is when he meets up with Ra's Al Ghul and Ducard where we find out how he masters numerous fighting styles and skills.  When Wayne returns to Gotham, the city is in shambles, and he sets out to make things right.  What follows is  a wonderful story that has a few twists and turns and some wonderful action.

The story realizes its characters so well that the viewer forgets that they are watching a film based on comic books.  It doesn't seem quite as silly to believe that a man can become so enraged with the criminal element that he would dress up like a giant bat and fight for justice.  If I had to categorize this film with any other comic flick, I'd have to say that only ""The Punisher"" with Thomas Jane and John Travolta comes close to the realism expressed in ""Batman Begins.""  However, ""Batman Begins"" is a much better film than ""The Punisher"" could ever be.

Christian Bale seems to be a perfect fit as Bruce Wayne/Batman.  He looks comfortable as a billionaire playboy and as a masked vigilante.  Some folks have made fun of the way he changes his voice when dressed as Batman.  Has anyone thought that perhaps he changes his voice so that he becomes harder to identify?  Michael Keaton spoke with a raspy hiss when he was under the cowl, and Val Kilmer and George Clooney did little to mask their vocal identity.  Also, Bale's Batman is intent on striking fear into his enemies.  If some dude in a batsuit comes up to you with a booming voice and batarangs flying all over the place, you'd probably get scared too.

Gary Oldman is perfectly cast as Sgt. Gordon.  He's a nice guy who only wants the best for Gotham.  Problem is, the criminals run the city, which makes it a little hard for Gordon to do his job.  He becomes a strong and worthy ally of Batman as the story unfolds.

Michael Caine is wonderful as Alfred.  Though Michael Gough's Alfred will always hold a special place in my heart, Caine makes the role his own in ""Batman Begins.""  He is the one true source of comedy in a film as dark as this one.

Morgan Freeman is very believable and likeable as Wayne's weapons expert.  He's responsible for all of Batman's gadgets and the wonderfully big and loud Batmobile.

Cillian Murphy, who I'm not very familiar with, is seedy, twisted and perfect as Dr. Crane/Scarecrow.  I've always believed that Scarecrow deserved to be in one of the other films, but I'm glad that they held off until now.  Murphy's a weasel and his eventual send off is downright fun to watch.  He was perfectly cast in this part.

Liam Neeson is solid as Ducard, a man who seemingly has a deep concern for Wayne when he is learning the arts of justice under the tutelage of Ra's Al Ghul.  Much like his Qui-Gon character from ""Star Wars:  Episode I,"" Neeson fills the role of mentor perfectly.

Katie Holmes is sufficient in her role as Wayne's love interest in the flick, but her role is probably the weakest in the bunch.  Also, all of her publicity with Cruise lately made it harder to believe in her character.

Although there are plenty of special effects, there isn't much CGI.  That's a beautiful thing these days, when most comic flicks rely heavily on the oft-fake-looking gimmick.  Instead, we get plenty of explosions, close-up fight scenes, and lots of crashes.

In short, this is a wonderful flick that fans of action, drama, and suspense will love.  Remember, this pic does not come across as a comic book film, but as a legitimate story that has some wonderful characters and great atmosphere.  I give it a strong four stars, although Holmes' performance is somewhat of a downer.",1120435200,,4703,4.581534772182255
1575787,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is a cinematic triumph because it doesn't allow the power of Hollywood glitz, to get in the way of a compelling story that is character based and powerful. Bale is at the heart of that story - giving a portrayal of Batman that is at once - tortured and dark as well as warm and sensitive. The Batman franchise is back and in Bale, they have a powerful leading man.

Bale - a veteran of recent films portraying psychopaths, brings a psychopathic element to Batman : a presence that seems only slightly saner than the criminals he engages.

Bale's Batman has a lot of imperfections, keeping with director Nolan's vision of Bruce Wayne struggling to learn how to be a crimefighter for the first time. The husky whisper is somewhat heavy, admittedly. Batman struggles to hold on when leaping buildings for the first time. Bale feeling the pain of the flames when Dr Crane sets him on fire.

Nolan's portrayal of Gotham City also gives it a dimension that many of us can identify with. He shows us that the biggest threat to Gotham itself isn't supervillains but organised crime that infects and infiltrates all levels of city bureaucracy.

This Batman gives the franchise a soul and a superhero with human frailties both physical and emotional. Nolan and Goyer, along with Bale have succeeded beyond expectations in bringing respect to the franchise again. This is Batman at his darkest, most tortured self. This is the Batman that we have all come to see.",1120348800,2,1466,4.737254901960784
1575917,3,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" is a far cry from the original TV series with Batman and Robin (Robin did not appear this time around). The original TV series involved lots of joking around, was less violent, and the ""bad guys"" were almost likeable. ""Batman Begins"" was a long, explosive portrayal of good vs. evil.

I appreciated the fact that ""Batman Begins"" modeled good choices. For example, when Batman unwisely decided to take revenge on the murderer of his parents, his childhood friend declared, ""Revenge and justice are two different things."" Revenge was portrayed as the bad choice, since it would have been the result of years of Batman's anger and bitterness.

Batman did eventually decide to follow truth, justice, and the American way in his quest to save Gotham City. However, the movie constantly protrayed Batman in one fight or another, or fighting an evil character spewing hallucinogenic gas. The evil of Gotham  City was graphically displayed. Therefore, I would not recommend this movie to younger children.

If there is to be a sequel (and the movie undoubtedly sets us up for one), I hope there are more scenes involving interactions between Batman and his butler. The butler was the personification of wisdom and devotion; and, in my opinion, he carried this movie.",1120348800,2,1274,5.023696682464455
1575918,5,B00005JNJV,"When I heard they were making another Batman movie, I couldn't believe they were doing it. After Batman and Robin, I thought what is wrong with these people. As a result, I was very, VERY hesitant to go see this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a loooooong time.

First off, Christian Bale makes an AMAZING Batman. I have always been impressed with Bale and thought he was/is a WONDERFUL actor and the role of Batman suits him perfectly. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman are all great in this film as well. I thoroughly enjoyed Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow and think he would make a great villian to come back in the future.

One of the best things about this movie is the focus is on Bruce Wayne and his history. The other Batman movies progressively focused on the villian(s) as opposed to the Dark Knight himself. Christopher Nolan and David Goyer did a wonderful job in showing the various, darker sides of Bruce Wayne.

I recommend this film to everyone. And I ask you to remember when going to see this that it is called Batman BEGINS. It is how Batman came to be, so it is not necessarily going to be as action-packed as movies of this sort tend to be. With that said, the action that is in the film is exciting and done very well. Batman Begins is done the way these movies should have been done all along...and it is FANTASTIC!",1120348800,3,1397,4.406976744186046
1575919,5,B00005JNJV,"At last, a movie worth watching, worth discussing & worth writing about.

Batman Begins (Batman 5) is bigger, better & bolder than all its predecessors. The beauty of this one is that the focus is on Batman & not what the Riddler is doing or what prank the Joker is playing or what surprise the Penguin has in store.

This movie is Batman all the way. The carefully selected Christian Bale is a wonderful choice for the Lead role the best Batman since Michael Keaton, he does justice to the role. He might seem a bit too young for the role of Bruce Wayne however we need to keep in mind that this is Batman ""Begins"" hence him being young.

The entire movie was good actually it was great except for a few minor things. The Batmobile was a bit rugged as opposed to refined, the three main fight scenes (The one in jail, the one at the School & the last one) were really quick & you can't quite make heads or tales of it. Oh yeah, at the end of the movie the weather was probably cold but Christopher Nolan did not have to use Katie Holmes' assets to get the message across - on IMAX it is very evident - for those who have no clue what I am talking about, watch the movie & you decide.

As for the cast; excellent choice, everyone of them. Caine is remarkable as Alfred, Neeson was outstanding in another one of his ""mentor"" roles - he might just get typecast if he keeps accepting such roles - Freeman is breathtaking as Fox, he doesn't have to say much, yet he owns the screen. Gary Oldman created a whole new him; a cross between Tom Skeritt & Edward James Almos plus a little extra. Katie Holmes, what can we say, she's all grown up now & can act too, good for her. She's got her life sorted out, she makes good movies & is dating Tom Cruise. Life is good. I do wish her the best though, she deserves it.

Verdict: thoroughly enjoyable. A great movie for fans or moviegoers alike. Bale is great as Batman & is very convincing. Great movie, well made, well filmed & I am sure it'll be well liked as well.

Rating: 4 &  stars.",1120262400,4,2027,4.195372750642673
1575920,5,B00005JNJV,"Thank heavens the world has finally gone batsh@$ crazy.

If you grew up with the Batman comic books, you're in for a double-whammy of Batman nostalgia. And even if you've never read a DC comic book, you're still in for a very pleasant movie experience.

We've had Batman films before (Michael Keaton starring in the first rubber suit, then Val Kilmer, and finally the hunky George Clooney), but here we've got a more obscure actor --- Christian Bale --- whom many film-watchers probably have only scant knowledge of. But he's just about as perfect a Batman I've ever seen. He's not George Clooney gorgeous, nor does he have the versatility of Val Kilmer (i.e. Doc Holiday in ""Tombstone"", and Jim Morrison in ""The Doors""). But what Mr. Bale DOES have is a really great persona that accompanies the dark-style films he chooses (please see ""Reign of Fire"" if you haven't already).

The filming of this Batman is dark, moody, and not too far removed from the previous films; but where it excels above its predecessors is in the story being told. For those in the know, Batman has some less-than-humble beginnings. He's a strange character who has walked a fine line between slipping into the dark underworld versus becoming an obscurely disturbed superhero. In this film, we get to see a bit of both of these sides.

Also notable is the all-star cast that graces the silver screen. Michael Caine is PERFECT as the stodgy yet affable butler Alfred. Gary Oldman stars as officer Gordon, whom we all know will eventually become the Commissioner. Liam Neeson gives a fine performance as both Batman's mentor and nearly his demise into darkness. Rutger Hauer plays the stuck-up role of the director of Wayne Enterprises after the death of Bruce's parents. Morgan Freeman plays a Q-type character (ala James Bond) who helps Bruce Wayne with his nifty gadgets. Katie Holmes plays the love interest but is nearly forgettable against the backdrop of this powerfully told story and the more seasoned actors.

Director Christopher Nolan (Momento) pulls off the best Batman movie EVER. And the amazing thing is that it's not JUST for Batman and comic book fans. Several of my friends and co-workers who've never touched a DC comic have seen the film and are singing its praises.

Go see it on the big screen. It's one of the few films out right now that requires it.

(Also, make sure you watch for and enjoy the earliest version of the Batmobile.)",1120176000,3,2432,4.803827751196172
1576048,5,B00005JNJV,"I agree with all the positive reviews of this entertaining and well-acted movie.  The previous Batman movies were lukewarm whereas Batman Begins is BURNING HOT!  There's no comparison.

I am very glad I saw Batman Begins at the IMAX.  The sound was big and rich, the images crystal clear.  I did hear a little boy cry for a minute at the very beginning because the colossal screen and full sounds are a new experience for those of us who do most of our viewing in front of a comparatively much smaller TV screen.  And children if not adults do fear most things new. (by the by, FEAR is the main subject of this enjoyable movie) If you're unusually sensitive to booming sounds, be advised that the sound is louder but not more offensive than most standard movie theaters.  That's one of my big gripes of the standard movie theaters, whenever the volume increased, the amplifiers could not handle the extra noise volume and all I could focus on was the annoying tinny noise & the vibrating speakers.  It was a relief to actually watch a movie and not be distracted by noticing something wrong with either the theater or the movie itself.

The best way to experience this ab-fab movie is @ the IMAX.  As soon as the movie ended, most people could not help but clap.  Rare for a movie relesed these days.  It is an all-over physical/mental experince not to be missed.

p.s.  when I got home from the IMAX last night, I turned the TV on and the Batman Begins movie commercial was on!  I was amazed at how much of the experience was sacrificed on the reduced images.  There's no comparison.",1120176000,2,1584,4.505263157894737
1576049,5,B00005JNJV,"You have to at least like Batman to enjoy this, but if you hated the other Batman movies, you might enjoy this one. The story is intriguing with a few really good surprises. The action and dialogue is all directed toward advancing the plot and there is very little in the gratuitous eye-candy department - just enough special effects to pull the audience in.

The theme of fear is powerfully developed in the movie in Bruce's character development. He uses his fear of bats, something we discovered in the first minutes of the film, to strike fear in the hearts of criminals. A minor theme placed in opposition to fear is that of hope - the good people of Gotham have hope in the face of the troubles of the city while the villians wish to use fear to destroy the city as a kind of ""cleansing process"".

This film is incredibly casted and directed. I never would have believed Liam Neeson could do such a job in that type of role. Also I didn't even realize that Gordon was played by Gary Oldman until the end of the film. I wished we could have seen a little bit more of Morgan Freeman who was perfect as always in the role of a genius scientist who designs all of Batman's gadgets. But even amid these greats Christian Bale steals the movie with the most convincing Batman yet - brooding yet driven to action, living a dual existence yet focused in his mission.

The friendship and tension between Bruce and Alfred, well-acted by Michael Caine, are both portrayed well as we are shown Bruce's coming of age as a rich orphan. His self-disdain and self-acceptance as an heir to a fortune are realistically demonstrated as part of the overall character development. If I have any complaint about the movie I'd say Katie Holmes performance, although passable, is somewhat ancillary to the rest of the plot and the film can't ""decide"" whether she is a heroine who can take care of herself with an electric stun gun or the obligatory female victim for the hero to save from danger.",1120176000,2,1977,4.5322128851540615
1576050,5,B00005JNJV,"Not since the days of the original Batman feature film adaptation back in 1989 have fans of the Cape Crusader experienced joy with the venerable franchise on the big screen. Burton's follow-up to the perennial favorite entitled Batman Returns did not quite live up to the expectations that had been set down for it. Maybe too much had been demanded of it to live up to the greatness of the original or two major villains in one picture was bit much for audiences to handle. Whatever the reason may be the Batman franchise was never the same from that moment on. When Burton dropped out, director Joel Schumacher stepped in to take over the directing reins. And in spite of Batman Forever's success, grossing twelve million more in domestic box office receipts then the previous installment, fan fervor over Schumacher's neon obsession began to boil over and came to head with the introduction of the `nipple suit'. Director Christopher Nolan, the man behind the critically acclaimed Memento and Insomnia, now returns fans to where the legend began to return the Dark Knight to his beloved glory.

The story for Batman Begins strays dramatically away from the direction in which past franchise films have been forced which, thankfully, is a good thing in this instance. Batman Begins harkens back to the gritty atmosphere that was so abundant in Tim Burton's original adaptation and even proceeds to take audiences one step further. Though dark in tone, Burton's Batman remained set in the realm of fantasy which, in its own right, was fine at the time but Christopher Nolan makes the Dark Knight real, which in effect strikes a stronger tone with audiences. Knowing that the Cape Crusader is made of flesh and blood, that he can be knocked down or burnt to crisp and left for dead like the rest of us and yet get up and continue the fight to win the day makes him a far more captivating mythological figure then if he were invincible.

Christian Bale, a rising performer who to the surprise of many has been in the movie industry for several years now, has at long last come into his own in the role of billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne which is merely an alter-ego for the Dark Knight who battles crime and injustice on the streets of Gothem when the sun sets. Bale is nothing short of remarkable in his portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman, a more realistic and gothic style version then modern audiences, plagued with the nightmarish images of neon splattered Schumacher creations long gone, are not accustomed to, even those who are old enough to recall Tim Burton's adaptation of the Cape Crusader in the late-1980s. Bruce Wayne is an inordinately conflicted man, battling not only the crime lords and the gangsters for the streets of Gothem City but also with his alter-ego, Batman, for control of his personal life and even with himself for the direction in which his life after his parents' deaths is to proceed and in what capacity. Bale, like Maguire in the Spider-Man franchise, proves effectively, both through heart-wrenching emotions and body language, that the life of a superhero is not what it is cracked up to be.

Liam Neeson is positively impeccable as Ducard, the mysterious and often deceivable assistant to Ra's Al Ghul who tracks down Bruce Wayne so that he may train him in the ways of the League of Shadows in order to overcome his fears and enact justice on the city of Gothem. Though he undoubtedly has the talent capacity to successfully pull off a performance like this one, it remains a bit unnerving, at least for some, to see him in a role as this, especially after his powerful role in Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning film, Schindler's List. Ducard is the type of character who presents a truly emotional roller coaster attraction for his audience. He clearly has the right intentions in mind, wanting to combat injustice and stave off evil, but as Bruce Wayne discovers he takes his dedication to preserving justice to an unhealthy level in which the `heroes' are almost as bad as the villains themselves. Just as you grasp the concept he is advocating he goes and says something that touches a moral nerve. Easily the most diabolical villain in the Batman film franchise to date.

Alright, putting it as concisely and politely as possible, Katie Holmes' performance as the persistent and slightly perky, particularly near the end of the film if anyone noticed, assistant district attorney Rachael Dawes is not exactly as prestigious as her newfound beau Tom Cruise built it up to be but neither was it as disastrous as it certainly could have been, especially given her track record of `distinguishable' projects. The romantic aspect of the storyline between her and the Cape Crusader's alter-ego Bruce Wayne, though undeniably evident from the beginning, is quite possibly the most downplayed of the Batman franchise which to say is not a bad thing given that its audience cares more about the story and the action then anything else, particularly romance. All in all, Miss Holmes, likely to be Mrs. Cruise soon, will not be missed terribly given she was the only cast member not to be picked up for the upcoming sequel, likely to the fallout caused by her relationship with Tom Cruise. But it is tradition, in much the same vein as the James Bond franchise, for the Batman films to interchange the love interest of billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne to keep things flowing, so for fans this will be use to this.

Two villains which fixture prominently into the Batman Begins storyline appear to be quite underutilized, at least from first glance. These would be Dr. Jonathan Crane, more commonly referred to as the Scarecrow, played fiendishly by Cilian Murphy and Ra's Al Ghul, a stylized performance commanded by Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe. However, it would seem as though Crane is used merely as a distraction, and the same can be said of Ken Watanabe's character as well, and was never meant to be used to his full capacity in this chapter of the Batman saga. Given that he was never officially captured at the end of the film, the Scarecrow may play a part in pictures to come, with two sequels already in the works with Nolan at the helm, but with The Joker clearly being the featured villain in the second movie, it doesn't seem likely.

The always entertaining British actor Michael Caine brings to the role of Bruce Wayne's faithful butler Alfred a style that is all his own. For the first time Alfred is not exclusively viewed as only Bruce Wayne's dear friend and close confidante but also the lone father figure following the deaths of his parents. Gary Oldman scores a home run performance in the role of Sergeant Jim Gordon. Fans of the Dark Knight will certainly be taken back a bit by the lackluster appearance and stammer of Jim Gordon, clearly noting how far he has come from when the comic book superhero's story began. Those unfamiliar with the Batman legend or the feature film franchise will view Gordon, the only good egg in the bunch as far as the police force in Gothem is concerned, as a pathetic sap, in spite of his willingness moral standings, which only increases the audience's anguish for the prospects of the city. Though Morgan Freeman is delightful as Lucius Fox, he is not seen in quite the capacity audiences may expect, which is a bit disappointing to say the least, but there is hope his character's role in the Batman legend will expand with the upcoming sequels.

Overall, Christopher Nolan at the helm of Batman Begins triumphantly returns the Dark Knight to his long since forgotten former glory which existed in the time of Tim Burton's original big screen adaptation and even exceeds expectations by taking the Cape Crusader to a level which he has never experienced before - the real world. True, not everything which takes place in Batman Begins has its basis in reality but the characters and their actions are more intone with our world then in any other film present in the franchise which makes it so poignant and insightful. These individuals, these human beings, are easily vulnerable and are not the squeaky-clean heroic figures your parents grew up with. Though Bruce Wayne eventually finds the path of justice which would lead him to become the legendary figure he is seen as today, he contemplated killing his parents' attacker in cold-blood as he left the courtroom and would have gone through with it if it were not for an assassin sent by the mob boss of Gothem. And in spite of their perceivable evolution in character and spirit as the film progresses towards its climax and beyond, the closing credits of the picture hardly mark the end of their progression, which will continue through the rest of the series. Likely the most frequent complaint from audiences will be that there exists not enough action in the storyline to make the film as interesting in terms of scope as the rest of the franchise. There is a reason the film is called Batman `Begins'. Starting from scratch, Christopher Nolan must develop these characters from the ground up and, through the process of a few sequels in the near future, make them into the mythological figures we have come to cherish. We can only hope, not expect it if history has taught us anything, that the integrity of this new chapter in the Batman film franchise will remain intact as the series continues and not deteriorate in light of its public and critical success.",1120089600,3,9408,4.792975970425139
1576051,4,B00005JNJV,"This is a truly all new Batman that I have never seen before. I am a big fan of the other four films, but this one truly stands out as a new chain of Batman films. I can see filmmakers making sequels to this movie and starting a 2nd series of Batman films.

What really got me in this movie was the Bruce Wayne is how he transformed into the Dark Knight. I've always been interested in how he came about his ""powers"" and this really changed my perspective on Batman, even though it's not related to the other films.

Nobody can play Alfred the Butler like Michael Caine. He has the perfect look and an even more perfect voice. I was surprised at the A-list cast of stars this film has. Sure, the other four films have several huge stars, but this one's has truly great actors and not just famouse ones. I would've liked to see a little more of Morgan Freeman since he is great in everything he does. I was especially surprised w/Murphy's portrayl as the Scarecrow. Although, I would've liked to see more of him, he really gave a chilling and eerie performance.

Christian Bale is probably my favorite portrayl of Bruce Wayne. He really gives it the dark edge and, when he's Batman, you can really hear the tone of fury in his voice.

The action scenes were quite incredible. It couldn't of gotten any better with the scene where Batman is jumping rooftops in the, very cool-looking, new Batmobile. Great intensity!

The one thing I am really not looking forward to in the future is what happened at the very end of this film. ---DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE CLIFFHANGER--- I'm not thrilled about the Joker being the next villian. Jack Nicholasen truly captivated me with his portrayl of him and I can't watch anyone try to match it.",1120089600,3,1744,4.4375
1576052,5,B00005JNJV,"8 years after killing the Batman franchise thanks to director Joel Schumacher and Warner Brothers for giving the green light to do so, Batman is reborn in this exquisite effort by Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale.  Giving the upmost respect to the DC comic book character, Nolan has created a world that fans have only dreamed of seeing on the big screen in the past, and he succeeds to the utmost degree.  From the creation of a Gotham city that is not only believable but REAL (very limited CGI usage in this film) to the backstory of how Bruce Wayne became Batman to how he was trained and got all the gadgets that he uses as the Dark Knight, everything works in this film.

You don't have to be a fan of comic books or Batman in particular to enjoy this movie, just a fan of being able to sit back and escape for 2+ hours.  If you are a fan of comic books and/or Batman you will be truly enjoying what a comic book film is supposed to be.  It's so refreshing how much time and respect have gone into comic book films the last couple of years and you will be exhuberant as you take in this film.  Christopher Nolan has resurrected a franchise that was dead and buried and improved upon the solid effort that Tim Burton put forth in the 1989 film BATMAN.  Christian Bale shines as Bruce Wayne and I love the fact that he changes his voice and actually acts different when he dons the rubber.  Every acting effort here is solid, as Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, and Katie Holmes all are great in their roles and they take all these roles seriously.

Batman Begins IS the movie of the year thus far and you would be hard-pressed to not be able to enjoy this fantastic film.  One of (if not) the best comic book adaptations of all time, and a solid, solid effort.  I cannot wait for the next film in the series.

1576053,1,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is another horrid chapter in the butchering of the Batman franchise, easily as bad as the worse outing in the series.

The movie is promising in its first half as Bruce Wayne trains to become the Batman.  It has a gritty feel that makes one hopeful this Batman movie won't deteriorate into another flashy, empty spectacle.  But the minute Bale puts on the suit - its back to the old tired routine.

What is the deal with the appalling Batman costumes, anyway? The big wigs at Warner must have no confidence audiences will accept the Batman character in his original incarnation; a vulnerable hero - half Sherlock Holmes - half the Shadow.  We have to have an explanation about why he can't be shot - and that's the point guys - he can get shot - and should once in a while.

And this suit is by far the hokiest - can you imagine - fifteen years later and they can't figure out how to make him look cool?  Why bother making the movie if the hero looks like a bafoon?

Fifteen years later, the suit still inhibits the movement of the actor so he has to rely heavily on gadgets to do what should be done by the actor.  And the directors have to resort to chaotic editing to get around the fact the guy can't move in the thing.

Say what you will about the Sixties show, but that costume was amazing.  Maybe Adam West wasn't the most muscular guy, but he added all sorts of nuance to the character when he was in the suit, rather than the suit becoming the character.",1120089600,11,1477,4.296028880866426
1576054,5,B00005JNJV,"Just when you thought Batman had been relegated to the used video bin, along comes this exceptionally entertaining, brand spankin' new, fabulous new movie.  Everything about it is wonderful - from the engrossing plot and concept to the hyper-cool production design.  The cast is terrific, headed up by a sexy, angry, smoldering Christian Bale as Batman, and Michael Caine, who has a delightful winking humor as Alfred.  This movie, with its attention to detail, its heart-pounding soundtrack, and its smart, comic-book sensibility, gives you what so few summer movies do these days -- a visceral thrill that makes you literally gasp.",1120089600,,633,5.247524752475248
1576055,2,B00005JNJV,"There's a moment in this film where Bruce Wayne and Alfred go over the design to the batsuit's mask.  The mask itself is sort of a bloated, hydrocephalic affair, making Bruce's head seem twice as large as it really is.  Then there's the pointy bat-ears at the top.  What are they for?  One would assume that if you're going to go around calling yourself Batman, you'd want to resemble a bat.  Ah ha!  You'd be wrong, because those pointy ears are actually radio antennas.

It seems to be the trend in films today to strive towards a certain hyper-realism with characters and dialogue.  After two abysmal Joel Schumacher films with the Batman film series, the better part of the movie-watching world declared the series dead in the water, bloated by its own design excesses.  This film seeks to go entirely in the opposite direction as 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman&Robin.'  However, if those two movies go to the extreme of being overblown, horribly designed and poorly executed, this film 'Batman Begins' goes to the extreme of being overdone, dry and hollow, and poorly executed.

The plot should be simple enough to anyone who reads the title.  It is the story of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.

But just a minute there... why should we be so obsessed with how Batman begins in the first place?  Batman says himself (quite incorrectly) ""As a symbol I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.""  Pardon the theology, but with everlasting beings, isn't it not so important how they came to be as is the fact that they exist in our world?  I ignored this line completely.  Not only is it meaningless, but the idea that Batman is a symbol for justice and hope for victims of crime is a complete misinterpretation of what Batman stands for.

But hold on; who talks like this?  We've been here with George Lucas and his new Star Wars films.  I know of not one person who verbalizes the way these people do in 'Batman Begins.'  Why write dialogue that has no semblance of actual conversation in real life?  You're going for a high-mimetic style, why not make your dialogue to fit in?  It's like they're reading out of some New Age, self-psychiatry manual.

The problem is that too much of this dialogue exists in the film; and even worse, a lot of it belongs to seminal actor Liam Neeson.  Why can't this poor man land a good role?  His job in this film is not only to be a martial-arts instructor (Liam Neeson?), but also as a kind of Zen Dr. Phil.  Basically, Bruce Wayne gets freebie therapy sessions while Neeson beats the crap out of him.  Makes sense to me, especially since Neeson's character Ducard is a commander of the League of Shadows, a vigilante martial-arts group that's been acting as population control for planet Earth since before God was born.  They plan on annihilating everyone in Gotham City because its just got too darn big.  By the way, the slums in this movie give slums a bad image.

After about an hour and a half of pop-psychobabble from Neeson and co., Batman makes his first arrival.  It's quite thrilling to see the Caped Crusader on-screen again, but that energy dies down rather quickly once things begin.  First of all, Christian Bale adopts this raspy, phone-sex offender voice with the mask on, which is corny at best.  His main villain is the Scarecrow, played by Cillian Murphy, who is about as menacing as moldy cheese.  The Batmobile is completely ridiculous to look at; like a cross between a Lamborghini and a Humvee.  Why they chose this look, I have no idea.  The batmobile in the original had such a unique style, and it was believable.  I would never believe that Batman would drive this thing.  What a stupid idea.

The last part of this film is all mindless explosion, chases, fire, loud-noises, and close-up fight scenes, which couldn't be less pleasing to the eye.  Also, I don't think I'm that old, but it was simply too loud to be enjoyable.  I found myself, for the first time in a movie theater, closing my ears because I couldn't take it.  I should not need to do that.

Batman himself is now something of an allegorical hero.  He claims he wants to be a symbol, and that his job as a symbol is to be this incorruptible image of justice in a world of corruption.  Sort of like a light in dark places.  Good vs. evil, that kind of stuff.  How boring is that?  Batman is a character who appeals to the outsider, the loner, the freak who gets shunned by society.  He's about vengeance and personal vendetta, not about the lofty ideals of incorruptibility.  Batman, by his nature, is a corrupted human.  He dresses up as a bat and fights crime with a sort of mob-justice doctrine.  Here in this film, he recruits Sgt. Gordon, and acts in concert with the police to a degree.  This is indicative of our litigious mindset in the 21st century, believe it or not.

What I find most ironic about this film is the fact that superheroes are part of a mythology, apparently, that fits in with our modern times.  Batman is a kind of Zeus, or Apollo, such as Spiderman and Superman are.  And yet this film, like the Spiderman films, seem to be concerned with making everything seem so ordinary and plain.  When you do that, you suck the life out of things.  The original Tim Burton 'Batman' was a success because it had a style, it had a particular energy in the script, and the performances were not overdone--merely spot-on acting from actors working with a director who had some kind of vision for what his characters should be.  It seems as though Chris Nolan has gotten some sort of bullet-proof vest on him for doing ""Memento"" which was half-interesting in its best moments.  This film shows that he should probably not be entrusted with the next film.  And that anyone who thought this was good filmmaking should not be allowed to see movies.",1120003200,14,5790,4.5892682926829265
1576056,5,B00005JNJV,"Being one of the highly anticipated movies of 2005, I just had to go see this movie when it released. Even though I heard it was different compared to the previous Batman movies, this intrigued me more. After watching `Batman Begins' I can easily say that this was like a breath of fresh air from the previous movies.

Since there are so many reviews describing the story of the movie, I will keep this one short. `Batman Begins' starts off with 8 year old Bruce, playing with his friend Rachel in his Mansion. He falls into a ditch and is attacked by a lot of bats, hence starting his fears of them. The story follows as to how he loses his parents, how he is arrested, saved, and how he becomes the caped crusader to defend the citizens of Gotham. Of course, during all this, also includes his relationship with Rachel, overcoming his fears and learning the difference between justice and revenge.

There are many reasons as to why I loved this movie. They are:

1) The dark and mysterious atmosphere that the story takes place in. This gives a very serious look to the movie, making it what Batman is actually supposed to be about.

2) The way in which the movie fits all the pieces, like how the villains come to take their identities, how Batman came to be, how the Bat Cave, Bat mobile, and other equipment were created etc. It has all been so nicely incorporated into the movie, that you will find yourself going `Ok, so that's how it started'. I'm sure that fans of the comics will already know the whole history behind Batman, but for some people like me, it is a roller coaster ride of suspense and surprises.

3) Finally, how Christopher Nolan managed to balance the emotional scenes to the crime fighting scenes throughout the movie. You don't feel the movie dragging for even a minute because it keeps you interested throughout.

Christopher Nolan (who directed other great movies like `Insomnia' and `Mememto') continues showing his talent in `Batman Begins'. Christian Bale gives a wonderful performance as Batman, the dark knight. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, and Gary Oldman play their role well. I was actually surprised by how Katie Holmes has matured in his acting abilities. I have seen her act only on `Dawson's Creek' and didn't think she could pull this roll off, but she proved me wrong.

On the whole, whether you are a fan of Batman or not, you will definitely enjoy this movie.",1120003200,6,2418,4.635514018691588
1576057,4,B00005JNJV,"WHAT A DIRECTOR!  WHAT A CAST! WHAT A SCRIPT!  WHAT A MOVIE!  I just saw BATMAN BEGINS last night and it's easily the best superhero movie I've ever seen, and maybe the best movie I've ever seen--period!

Val Kilmer and George Clooney were both good as Bruce Wayne/Batman, but Christian Bale is better looking, and goes from Batman to Bruce and back like he was born for the role!

Director Christopher Nolan's created a masterpiece here, with a terrific Hall of Fame cast with Michael Caine as butler Alfred, Gary Oldman as a wierd police buddy James Gordon--not yet Commissioner!--Morgan Freeman as a dedicated but isolated Wayne Corp staffer who becomes a sort of Tonto to Bale's Batman, and Liam Neesom as the main heavy, with Rutger Hauer hanging around as a corporate heavy at Wayne Corp.

The script keeps moving right along, and introduces an actor I've never seen before--Cillian Murphy--and boy, does this Irish kid steal the show as crazy Dr. Jonathan Crane alias the Scarecrow!!!  Murphy looks terrific, and he's one of the few modern actors with a great voice, which he uses to full effect in his terrifying role!

The music is great, too, and the only bad things about BATMAN BEGINS are that the action scenes area so fast you can never see what's going on, plus there's a stupid scene at Wayne Manor where
Wayne pretends to be drunk to run off some birthday party guests from impending danger--why couldn't a smooth guy like Wayne just send them off diplomatically???  Plus, Katie Holmes is a dud as love interest Rachel Dawes--she just doesn't look good enough for Bale!

But BATMAN BEGINS is beautifully filmed, and the movie keeps rolling along till the end when you're left wanting more--and that's the way movies are supposed to be!!!

BATMAN BEGINS IS THE BEST BATMAN MOVIE EVER MADE!!!

1576168,5,B00005JNJV,"In Christopher Nolan's capable hands, the Batman franchise finally gets the formula right: drop the camp and embrace the darkness. ""Origin of superhero"" stories are notoriously difficult to do well because we all know where they're heading. Fortunately, Nolan and co-writer David Goyer have focused on the right thing: it's not just how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, but why. Fear - where it comes from, how we beat it, and how it can be turned against others - is the theme here, and the Nolan/Goyer script is all the more interesting for it. They also recognise the imperative of telling a good story, offering us a well-crafted action/mystery plot which never drags despite needing to cover a lot of detail and carry a large freight of emotional and ideological complexity. Christian Bale is perfectly cast as the Dark Knight. He's fresh enough for most viewers to accept him as not just another Hollywood star in a rubber suit, and talented enough to pull off what ends up being a pretty complex character: both terrified and terrifying, sometimes simultaneously. He's impressive enough to be a credible superhero, yet fallible enough to be endearing. The big-name supporting cast are excellent, with the exception of the relentlessly banal Katie Holmes who plays Gotham's fearless, mob-busting ADA as Joey Potter in a nice suit. But she's a minor quibble. It all comes together here: a great script, engaging characters, wonderful production design, neatly deployed music (which right from the outset cleverly makes potentially tedious expository scenes feel like part of larger sequences), gorgeous cinematography, imaginative but never overpowering use of CGI, and perfect pacing. ""Batman Begins"" doesn't quite follow the mythology laid down in the graphic novels (which isn't internally consistent anyway) but it does prove what their readers have long known: it's not just the pretty pictures, guys - it's those wonderfully tortured characters, their desolate urban milieu, and the way it all grips your dark imagination. Nolan knows that, and he really nails it here. This is the Batman movie you've been waiting for.",1120003200,4,2125,5.216374269005848

1576172,5,B00005JNJV,"Coming 8 long years after the debacle that was 1997's ""Batman And Robin"", the franchise with the man in the bat costume gets a new shot at life, and what a rebirth it is. The project brings back the integrity, dignity, and all around excitement that the first film, under the director of genius Tim Burton, brought back in 1989. While some people might consider it one of the two or both, this latest installment is neither a sequel or a prequel. Just as the title says, it's beginning anew. Something totally new, different, and something that is starting it's own seperate franchise. Director Christopher Nolan, with a script from David Goyer(known mostly as the man behind the ""Blade"" movies), brings the dark moodniess back to the dark knight, and makes it darker than anyone has seen on film yet. Bruce Wayne(now played by the excellent Christian Bale), is recruited by a man named Ducard(Liam Neeson), from a prison where he was kept for theft, and trained to be a warrior in the League Of Shadows. When he has fulfilled his training, Wayne heads back to Gotham City to clean out the trash, go home to trusted butler Alfred, and meet up with childhood sweetheart Rachel(Katie Holmes). Bruce takes on the disguise of 'Batman', which is explained in the film's early flashbacks to the death of his parents, and just why he chose bats as his symbol. As this new persona, he plans to take on the mob underworld, but gets a surprise when Scarecrow(Cillian Murphy), and a fellow villain, plan to release a poison to bring everyone's fears to life and ruin the city. As the new Batman/Bruce Wayne, Bale brings the character to life in ways that no one has ever seen before. I have a soft spot for Michael Keaton, but Bale is Batman. But better yet, he is Bruce Wayne. Bringing to full fruition the the dark, angry, and brooding side of the character. I liked Michael Gough, but Michael Caine just takes the role of Alfred as his own and he is the best Alfred anyone has seen. He is funny and warm, and the relationship with him and Bruce is fantastic. The movie also boasts one great actor after another popping up. Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, and Tom Wilkinson. Holmes does well with her role, but in the end, it becomes nothing more than a typical heroine. Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane/Scarecrow is just fine, but there seemed to be less screen time for him to really have a solid impression. It can also be said his Scarecrow part can be pretty frightening for young kids. In fact, there are some scary/frightening things here that may not be well suited for young children. It is rated PG-13 after all. As with most Batman films, it's pretty dark. In the sense that it's hard to see sometimes, and you are not sure what you are seeing during some of the fights as well. While the movie is much more serious and darker, it does have a nice dose of humor to lighten things up a bit. The movie does a great job of explaining the origins of the character and just how he got to be who he is today. Not just as Batman, but as Bruce Wayne too. The movie may have the images and cool fights and all that, but this one is much more a character piece than any that has come before. I mean, why would a grown man dress up as a bat and capture bad guys?. The look of the film is magnificent. Gotham City is not the gothic place it was with Burton's films, or the comic book metropolis of Schumacher's films. It does have a distinct look to it tho. Like New York City a little bit in the future. The movie runs a longer than any other Bat film, and drags in some spots, but the end result is incredibly satisfying and entertaining. The way they structured it is perfect. You don't even see Batman until like 40 minutes or so into the movie. It breaks the comic book/superhero mold just by doing that alone, but also because it is not a typical comic book-y type superhero movie at all. This is not ""Spider-Man"", although I loved both films. Batman Begins is a brilliant, dazzling, and influential film, and will no doubt raise the bar for future superhero movies. It's the best movie I have seen in a while. Let's hope next summer's ""Superman Returns"" will be just as worthy as this one.",1119916800,,4192,4.452535760728218

I always thought the Warner Bros. animated series would always be the best telling of the Batman story, but this movie even gives that a run for it's money. Christian Bale gives a moving performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman, the best I've seen on the big screen anyway.

My only compliant was the casting of Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Why not get someone with a little more depth. Maybe it's because I can only think if her as Joey on Dawson's Creek. I kept expecting her to say something like,""Wait! I still love Dawson!"".

Overall the movie is great. Finally, a realistic Batman who isn't made to look like a dork!",1119830400,3,682,4.536585365853658
1576353,4,B00005JNJV,"It's a shame this movie had to arrive in 2005, because it makes previous Batman movies completely obsolete.

Taking cues from the original - strong storytelling, character development, good visuals - Batman Begins feels like a completely new Batman, because in many ways it is; it's a return to strong storytelling.

Whereas previous Batman movies (Returns, Forever, Batman and Robin) felt hollow in spots, this one under new direction from Christopher Nolan (Memento), feels more complete. Given that it is long (140 minutes), dark, and the first hour of the film is all exposition, that's a huge achievement.  The striking difference with ""Begins"" is the details: believable city, sharp humor, developed characters - all items that previous Batman films - with the exception of the original - lacked to some degree.

Given the constraints of a prequel, and being confined to telling the origin of everything now familiar to the audience, the results are very solid.  It is immensely satisfying to watch the now famous Batman staples (Batcave, Batsuit, Batmobile, Batblades) come to fruition. We have now been given reasons why the Bat was chosen as his symbol, what Bruce Wayne did before becoming Batman, and even been introduced to the supplier of his gadgets (Lucius Fox, played by Morgan Freeman, solid as always).  These details add new weight to what was originally a strong storytelling foundation.

Gotham City is improved as well. Whereas previous Gothams (such as the one found in Batman Forever) felt too futuristic and neon (color), this Gotham actually resembles a city people could live in, one that bears close resemblance to Chicago. Another bonus is the humor. In one great scene, a slightly intoxicated Bruce Wayne dismisses all his freeloading, brown-nosing guests, telling them the ""the party's over; it's not a joke. Get-out."" and watches with delight as they leave.  Additionally, there is subtle humor employed during a chase scene (""At least tell me what it looks like...Nevermind)"" and even Alfred knocks Bruce's reasoning for doing all his pushups (""What's the point of of all those pushups if you can't lift a bloody log?)"" Each adds lightness to an otherwise dark, intense, fast-paced film.

That, to its entirety, emphasizes the strengths of the film: it feels genuine.  The actors are well-cast, and the acting is very good.  Christian Bale plays a very likeable, layered Batman, Michael Caine accels as Alfred, as does Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox (Batman's gadget man). Liam Neeson (Jean Luc Ducard) and Gary Oldman (Commissioner Gordon) give strong performances, as expected.

There are a few creative flaws, however.

As one watches the film, the sheer abundance of villains is staggering.  Unlike other super hero movies, Bruce Wayne/Batman doesn't have one concentrated enemy.  He seems to fight everyone (in shifts). Bruce/Batman battles martial arts vigilantes the League of Shadows, an organized crime boss, a psychologically twisted Dr. Crane/Scarecrow, and his business boss, Mr. Earle.  By the end, all enemies are part of the League of Shadows led by Ducard.  Batman's only allies are his caretaker Alfred (Michael Caine), District Attorney Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman). Only Gordon assists him in battle. Amidst all the internal and external conflicts, it's a wonder Bruce can soar at all.  Perhaps this adds to the heroic charisma of our Caped Crusader? Additonally, the final climactic disaster, the contamination of Gotham City's water supply, is a scary coda in this age of terrorism - one that may hit too close for some viewers.

Small criticism aside, ""Begins"" is a soaring success. The story flows well from start to finish, with no loose ends. Notably, the final frame featuring the Bat signal and foreshadowing of the Joker's wrath on Gotham brings the movie to an effective end, and the Batman saga to its appropriate original beginning.  Given Nolan's strong direction, it views like a prequel and a new saga all in one.  If the next story involving the Joker were told again by Nolan, the audience would surely come back to see it.

Summer movies are typically ones filled with big action/cheap laughs but short on smarts.  Batman Begins is a movie that is a summer movie anomaly - it is entertaining AND sharply written.  Though it is a prequel, Batman Begins gives new wings to a fluttering franchise.",1119830400,5,4400,5.1216783216783215
1576354,1,B00005JNJV,"There seem to be two types of reviews/reviewers:  those who take ""Batman Begins"" seriously and those who don't.  What ""BB"" is is an attempt to rejuvenate sagging summer profits by tapping into both safer and less safe, but promising talents.  Bale was an unorthodox choice;  Caine, Neeson, Oldman were safe bets.  Nolan adventurous, but gifted, just like Burton.  Nice balance all around.  The ""franchise"" is a venerable one;  its possibilities for cinematic renewal are endless:  ""Batman"" can be whatever Hollywood wants him to be at any time.  IN ""BB,"" he was a ninja.  He fought near-terrorists this time;  see him fight real terrorists next time.  And, so far, it's worked real well.

What Hollywood needs/needed real bad - even as the carp-like publicity thrashings about of Cruise and Holmes (including Cruise's latest ""sparring"" with Lauer over anti-depressants show [what a shill!] - is making *you* pay attention to movies, go to them *and so pay a lot of money to see them.*  (Don't you think that the so-called ""romance"" of Pitt and Jolie affected sales of ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" tickets?  It's a dreadful movie. When have we ever seen so much of Cruise ""acting"" in this way all before the opening of ""War of the Worlds.""

The plots were geared for folks with ADD and the art direction was more ""Burton"" than it was Batman.  Then Joel Schumacher had a vision to mix Batman with musical theatre stage production (bad acting, colored lights, claustrophobic sets and homoeroticism) literally killing Batman.  Given this history, I was barely interested in seeing Batman Begins, but I can honestly say that this is the first movie based off of a super hero that I liked at all (sorry I just don't like Spiderman).  Bale is perfect for the duality of this role, and get this, he actually looks like he could kick the crap out of you.  Noland & Goyer bring Miller's vision of Gotham to life wonderfully  (no greasy perms or latex nipples).  The Batmobile finally looks real instead of like Michael Jackson's Liberachi-esqe dream toy.  Add it all up and suddenly Batman is cool again.  Katie Holms doesn't really work in this film.  She is too young and too trendy to make me believe she is the district attorney. Also, just hire a Chinese choreographer for the action sequences instead of choppy, close up action scenes.  The sequel needs to be more of the same (Bale, Nolan & Goyer).

1576356,4,B00005JNJV,"I ABSOLUTELY loved this movie and wanted to give it 5 stars. However, it's Mr Nolan's first summer blockbuster and unfortunately this movie is not without its faults.

1st, as many others would agree, the fight sequences are a bit too shaky and closed up, I wished Mr Nolan would pull the camera back a little to reveal more what was going on. Batman is a martial artist after all, especially this batman with such brutal and lethal and wraith like fighting styles. I understand what he intended but it didn't work out that nicely

2nd, as I have stated in many comic book movies, I wanted to see the superhero instead of his alter ego. This movie is about 50/50, and I can stand with that, not to mention it's an origin tale. So I hope they would show more batman with batman problems.

Ok, it almost sounded like I hate this movie, but as I stated in my first sentence, this movie is a must see both comic book fan and non comic book fan. Put it simple, this movie upgrades a summer blockbuster to a mixture of summer action thriller and dramma with a psycological level in such a way that it almost include all the movie genre one can possibly think of. If you are looking for horror, it's there, if you are looking for action, it's there, if you are looking for science fiction, it's there, and many others. and you might think such a mix would ruin the movie but not here. make no mistake, the mixture is simply perfect.

The soundtrack is of some arguments and I am positive with it. It may not have a clear main theme and may not have danny's mystic heroic gritty feel, but it stands out in the movie. I wouldn't recommand the soundtrack on it's own, but you will definitely be absorbed into the movie as the soundtrack gives you the exact feel of the scene.

The cast is simply amazing to look at. some may dislike katie but i wouldn't think it's her fault, she is a fine actress who just couldn't stank out with such a huge cast. imagine yourself as an slightly above average actor and put into this situation...

Christian rocks as his three-part role as the main character: Private and Public Bruce and intimidating batman. Caine is more like a father figure than a butler and fits perfectly in the context. Cillian Murphy is solid as scarecrow and very scary sometimes. Liam Neeson is as wonderful as always doing mentor character and, to me, very tragic and both likable and hateful as another secret character. Gary Oldman is extremely likable in this movie and you will simply want him more. Morgan Freeman is as charm as he always is and did an awesome job. all other supporting cast did a wonderful job espeically bruce's father, and i only remember the name thomas wayne as his name because he is the one that made me feel truely emotional just the way young bruce did.

The gadgets of batman in this movie realy stand on their own and you may dislike them but after watching the movie your idea will change 180 degrees just like me, especially the tumbler and the suit.

it's my first long review and hope it's helpful. thank you for your time reading this, and hope you enjoy the film. i did.",1119830400,5,3112,4.4188481675392675
1576357,5,B00005JNJV,"The ultimate argument of ""Batman Begins"" is that Batman is really more like Superman than we have suspected. The two DC comic book superheroes have always been like night and day, with Batman prowling Gotham City at night relying on only his finely honed human abilities while Superman uses his superpowers for truth, justice, and the American way. But one of the things that made Superman unique was that he really is Superman, the strange visitor from another planet: he pretends to be Clark Kent. ""Batman Begins"" argues that the same thing applies to Batman. His name might be Bruce Wayne, but the billionaire the world sees is just a construct. Batman is his true face.

Batman is a psychotic and in this 2005 film we find out why. Before his parents were murdered young Master Wayne had a fateful encounter with a whole bunch of bats, and the two events actually end up being related, which makes the death of his parents even more tragic. Despite the protestations of the loyal Alfred, Bruce Wayne knows it is his fault. But while becoming a crime fighter is inevitable there is still a choice as to how that war will be waged, which means traveling halfway around the world to be mentored and trained.. Then he must return to Gotham City and transform himself into a creature of the night whose very appearance will terrorize the criminals and supply himself with the gadgets that will give him a fighting chance on the streets. However, Gotham is being threatened by more than its ruling crime lord and the stakes are higher than our hero knows.

The problem is that I hate the frantic pace of film editing in action films like ""Batman Begins."" I am not overly enamored of hand held camera work either, but it is constant cutting in contemporary montage that is driving me crazy. When I go to a theater to see a movie I would like to actually see what is going on and not have to wait until the DVD comes out to slow things down to really see what is going on. This approach to editing did not start with ""Batman Begins,"" but since I was looking forward to this cinematic retelling of the origin of the Dark Knight it was particularly bothersome. Every time Batman starts fighting the images are on the screen long enough that I can tell it is a new shot but then we are on to the next one while I try to make sense of the jumbled images of these fight scenes.

Maybe the key reason why ""Spider-Man 2"" remains the best comic book movie to date is because since the tentacles of Doctor Octopus had to be computer generated Spider-Man was be as well in their big fight scenes. There is not a sequences as good in ""Batman Returns"" as the one where Spidey and Doc Ock battle on the side of the building in ""Spider-Man 2,"" mainly because there is not a single shot in the action sequences of this new film even half as long as that one. Meanwhile there are lots of martial arts films in which we managed to see what is happening during their big fight sequences, so how come we cannot do the same thing in this Batman movie? When Batman fights I want to see what he is doing flip through shots like I was flipping through the pages of an issue of a ""Batman"" comic book. It is maddening.

The big irony is that usually movies about comic book superheroes sacrifice story to action, but that is not the case with this screenplay, co-written by director Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer (based on characters created by Bob Kane, but with obvious nods to Frank Miller's work, especially ""Batman: Year One""). Originally the story was quite simple: young Bruce Wayne sees his parents gunned down by a robber. He builds up his body, studies science and decides to become a masked vigilante, taking as his inspiration a bat that flies against a window of Wayne Manor. Noland and Goyer provide more depth to the origin, which adds to the depth of the character as well, which is why I rounded up on this one in the end. The only real flaw in their script is an over reliance on the screenwriting trick of doubling up on dialogue (if a line is good once maybe it will be even better a second time). That is why when people talk about their favorite bits in this film they will probably be talking about one-liners (virtually every scene has one) and not any particular action sequence or specific gag.

Few will be surprised that Christian Bale has no problems playing the Dark Knight, and a supporting cast that offers by Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman is pretty impressive for a comic book movie. It is too bad that Katie Holmes is not only 16 years younger than the youngest in that bunch because she seems like a kid and not an Assistant D.A. with a death wish, and there is no reason for her to be around for the next one given her benedictory speech. Besides, if Batman works even more closely with Lieutenant Gordon to catch the Joker in the next movie, that would be fine with me. The bottom line here is that while I have no problem with the idea this is the best Batman movie to date, the action sequences were not as good as the other parts of the movie and they should have been in order to move ""Batman Begins"" from being very good to being truly great.",1119744000,4,5227,4.446298227320125
1576358,4,B00005JNJV,"I wanted to leave the theater thinking to myself, ""fan-freaking-tastic"", but ""pretty damn awesome"" will have to do.  The critics who say the movie never quite ignites as a barn burner have a point--there's the usual car chase, the obligatory climactic fistfight--but these genre-staple scenes are well-done, and the movie remains engrossing thanks to psychological drama.  The violent scenes are indeed cut in a punch-pulling way that blunts their visceral impact.  Keep in mind that this was likely done to keep the PG-13 rating, not because the director has no sense of action.  Fittingly enough, Batman Begin's most thrilling moment has the Dark Knight dangling a criminal upside down like a yo-yo, interrogating him fiercly. In this moment the transformation to Batman is fully realized in a powerful, entertaining way.  The writing is excellent overall and there are precious few eye-rolling moments (I counted maybe two.)  The comic relief one-liners serve their purpose-they're actually funny!  And sure, Katie Holm's voice has that slightly annoying helium to it, but she plays the part just fine (and is fun to look at.)  So, the movie is not quite the jaw-dropping genre transcender I was looking for.  But it's smart, psychological and full of memorable moments.  At least the bar isn't set impossibly high.  If they keep the same director and tighten things up a bit, the series will be one to treasure.  They need only remember what made this movie work-it bothers to create characters the audience cares about, and it gives those characters good lines to deliver.  ""I'm not going to kill you.

1576361,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins was for me quite an enjoyment to behold. It was well made and actually had some depth. However ever since the previews I felt something lacking. I wasn't all too excited by the preview as I had expected to be. This feeling somehow extended to the film. I recall as a kid being overwhelmed when I saw the preview for the original and I was not let down in the least. For me a comparison between Burton's vision and Nolan's is unavoidable. I know they are two completely different realms but I can't help but be saddened by the disappearance of the franchise Tim Burton was creating. And I can't help but reflect on how much more I connected with the original version than this one. I don't completely blame Nolan for not being able to rival something so rare and phenomenal but I still feel he could have done something towards that old feeling at least a bit more without it necessarily feeling recycled. I prefer almost everything about the original: the city, the villain, the hero, the girlfriend, the visionary artistry, the extravagant shots, the 40's era and gothic style, the perfect climax, the mystery and the ridiculously abstract and flamboyant quality it exuded. I truly feel that soo many people are just jumping the gun and calling this the best Batman and placing it over the original which to me is utterly insane. I don't feel that many of these people are really thinking. I know that Burton took artistic liscence with his version but in doing so I feel that he only created a legacy, a phenomena of dark beauty never before seen and that will sadly never likely be seen again. I suppose strictly following the comics is not as important to me as presenting it in a creative, appealing fashion. If  Nolan were to present something actually as revolutionary as Burton's Batman than my hat would be off to him. These heights I did not feel were reached and I accept that because to me such an achievement would be close to impossible. I have tremendous respect for Bale as an actor. He proved himself to me even more so to be a serious and devoted actor with what he did with the Machinist and then half a year later playing Batman. And I knew all along he would be a good Bruce Wayne and Batman. I still however prefer Keaton's dark grittiness and quick movements while in the suit. His face fit so perfectly behind that mask that he seemed born for it. I also like how Keaton's Bruce Wayne seemed like an ineffectual panzi whose alter ego is a seemingly superhuman hero. But I must say there were times when Bale really did shine in the new suit. And yes he fits this Bruce Wayne very well. I always found him to be an admirable actor and especially after witnessing his version of Patrick Bateman I knew this guy was heading places. I was also not surprised by the charm Cillian Murphy threw into the mix as the Scarecrow. His performance somehow gave me a slight nostalgic feel that I might be able to connect to the original yet remains rather mild when Nicholson comes to mind, though I question whether something so extreme and over the top could even begin to fit in a film like this anyways. It seems that the one thing I really can give Nolan credit for is breathing some new life back into the series after being destroyed by you know who. Batman Begins did have its powerful somewhat magical moments. But at no time does it come anywhere close to expressing the indescribable magic of the original and in this regard is just kind of empty in comparison. But when I look at it on a different level perhaps comparison is not the best thing to dwell on. Batman Begins has done somthing completely orginal by giving Batman more meaning, seriousness, drive and depth than before. So in this regard I cannot look down on it too much at all for not delving into Burton's realm which is more placed in the realm of fantasy. And to me it makes sense why many hold this one higher than Burton's, mainly because a lot of people look down on fantasy. I on the other hand have quite an interest in the subject of fairytale and fantasy and have researched many of its facets and origins and have never failed to be amazed by any of it. Surprisingly the mythical aspect of the hero works out in both Nolan's realism and Burton's fantasy which is quite interesting. Which brings me to point out that a new quality that impressed me with Batman Begins is how the main character's journey actually reaches a somewhat spiritual level. I am not too disappointed with the new take on Batman and the direction it is now going in but it will not diminish the sadness I feel for what could have been after Batman Returns. They spent soo much time building up Catwoman's character to obviously bring her back and who knows what kind of magic was yet to come. One thing I can't fathom is how Nolan thinks he can pull off bringing the Joker back. To imagine anyone who isn't going to pale in comparison to Nicholson is pretty far fetched. I am never the less very curoius to see where Nolan is going to take the series from here.",1119744000,2,5045,4.465872156013001
1576461,5,B00005JNJV,"In Star Wars style, ""Batman Begins"", the fifth installment of the Batman franchise, presents the story of the early days of the superhero, from his childhood and his deepest fears, to his personal pursuit to leave those very fears behind, into the birth of his alter ego and his first days fighting crime and injustice in Gotham City.

The story is beyond enticing. While it could have spared some ""Bond""-like moments that make me scratch my head feeling treated like a silly moviegoer, most of it takes you in with ease. I particularly loved the evolutionary process Bruce Wayne goes through during his remote ""retreat"", in order to defeat his fears and overcome his insecurities. The way he gradually builds up Batman and his gear also results in a mix of fun and cool. Morgan Freeman resulted a key character to make this happen.

Special effects and sound effects are top of the line. I didn't feel particularly overwhelmed by them at any moment (though it does get pretty noisy some times). Production design of Gotham City was gorgeous. I loved the details in the monorail and the gothic arches it went through as it glided over the city, for example. The batmobile was absolutely B-A-D (as in cool).

As a whole, I loved it. I have been a fan of Batman since I was a boy and I continue to love the character. I am happy the franchise hasn't sold out even after five installments. Seems like Memento's Christopher Nolan was a worthy heir of the first ones, put out by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher.",1119657600,2,1505,4.629213483146067
1576462,5,B00005JNJV,"Did I think it possible? Heck no! I don't consider myself a big theater-goer, but when I do go, I expect nothing short of at least GOOD. What I got from Batman Begins was nothins short of fantastic. This movie is extreme! The script is great, Christian Bale is awesome, the villain is an ultimate bad guy (no crazy colorful costumes or cheesy dialogue come from this villain!), and the movie balances action with actual substance.

In Batman Begins, we learn the origins of Batman. It opens with our hero, Bruce Wayne aka Batman, in a prison. He gets into a wicked fight with a group of inmates, so bad that the guards pull him off telling him it's for ""protection."" When Bruce screams that he doesn't need protection, the guards tell him that it's for the other inmates, not for him. Bruce is a strong-willed, heck just plan strong, man. Soon after, he's picked up by Ducard (Liam Neeson), who trains Bruce to become a member of an elite group called The League of Shadows, but when Bruce's initiation consists of killing someone and he just can't do it, he ends up setting the entire place on fire, stopping only to save Ducard. Bruce heads back to Gotham City, sure that he can be of help to the people. And undoubtedly, he will be exactly the force that the city needs. The city is full of corruption, from the police to the lawyers to the creepy guy, Scarecrow, who runs the mental institution. One of the non-corrupt is Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), who is fighting to put the city's biggest mob boss behind bars. Rachel knew Bruce Wayne before his parents died and is upset to learn that his return to Gotham has no more substance than being a playboy (oh, how little she knows...)

It's great to finally have backstory. To finally have more than just a couple glimpses of how Bruce Wayne actually became Batman. His greatest fear is bats; what better way to get over the fear than become a bat? There's still comedic one-liners, though it's nothing near as cheesy as the previous films. One of my favorites is when Bruce is trapped under a fiery log and his butler Alfred (played wonderfully by Michael Caine) says, ""What's the purpose of all those push-ups if you can't even lift a bloody log?"" So, the cheese factor is finally gone from the Batman franchise. If they continue with making Batmans, which I'm sure they will, I hope they take notes while watching this one to create something equally spectacular.",1119657600,,2419,4.584295612009238
1576463,5,B00005JNJV,"As a huge fan of the first ""Batman"" movie, I had some serious doubts when I continuously read reviews, stating that this was the ""best 'Batman' movie yet"".  I just didn't see how any actor could play Batman better than Michael Keaton or how any villian could possibly top the performance of Jack Nicholson as the Joker.  Then, I went to see this movie last night.  WOW!!!!!

This movie is simply amazing!!

Christopher Nolan decided to take us deep into the mind, heart and soul of the 'Caped Crusader' and let the audience see what, how and why Batman is Batman.

We get to see Bruce Wayne as a child and watch the horrific murdering of his parents(this scene was very similiar to the first ""Batman"", except in the first one, the Joker kills his parents.  That is not the case in this film).  The audience is also treated to more of Wayne's father.  Nolan did an excellent job of depicting the relationship between Bruce and his father.  Every exchange we see between the two, easily displays the un-dying love Bruce's father had for him and the extreme respect both Bruce and Gotham City had for his father.(I get chills thinking of his father telling Bruce's mother that they are leaving the Opera, because he needs fresh air, not because Bruce is afraid of bats.  Truly an emotional scene and one that ""brings home"" the love between father and son).

After his parents are murdered, Bruce goes traveling and lands himself in a jail(for stealing merchandise.  All of which was from Wayne Enterprises and was actually owned by him.)  In prison, Bruce has his chance to release his anger over his parents murder on all of the convicts.  He is very feared and is very capable of handling more than 1 man(more like 8 or 9).

From prison Bruce is picked up by Ducard(Liam Neeson), whom works for a gang of vigilantes, headed by RA's Al Ghul(Ken Wantanabe).  Here, Bruce is taught to use his fear as a weapon.  He is taught to fight, be invisible, instill fear into his enemy and most importantly, harness his fear as his greatest weapon.  At the end of his training, Bruce is asked to inhale the fumes of a very rare flower(which will be used by our villians in a plot to ruin Gotham City forever).  As he does this, he begins to hallucinate and is told not to fear his greatest fear; bats.  As he stumbles for footing and repels the soldiers that are trying to sneak-attack him, a large horde of bats swarms over him(in his hallucination).  Bruce falls at first, just to get back up(Alfred teaches him this lesson) and finally overcome this dreaded fear.  This is where Bruce graudates from training and is asked to execute a criminal the vigilantes have caught.  Bruce claims he is not an executioner and in a great action scene; burns down the vigilante headquarters, kills all of the members in the explosion, saves Ducard and returns to Gotham City to fight crime and return the city to the grand vision his father had always seen it as.  Oh, and on the way, the man who killed his parents is paroled.  Bruce decides he is going to kill him, but is beaten to the punch by the Gotham's crimelord, who kills the murderer in the hopes of gaining Bruce's favor.  That doesn't work.

For the next hour or so, we are brought back to Gotham, introduced to Alfred(Michael Caine), Rachel Doss(Katie Holmes) and Mr. Fox(Morgan Freeman).  We are shown Wayne Enterprises.  We see Rachel Doss in the courtroom, trying, to no end, to convict criminals; only to have them set free and declared legally insane by Jonathan Crane A.K.A. ""the Scarecrow""(Cillian Murphy), who is on the payroll of the crimelord and will do what is needed to keep his men out of prison(Or so it appears at the start of the film.  As we learn more we see that he has a plan for these men, once he gets them into his asylum.)

I don't want to spoil any f the film for those who have not seen, but I did want to set up the premise for the film.  There are many twists and turns that start at about the point I have stopped at, and again, I wouldn't want to ruin this film, due to how magnificent it is.

My favorite part of this film is probably Michael Caine as Alfred.  He is simply perfect for the role and this movie gives us the best depiction of Alfred.  In previous films, Alfred was basically a friendly servant, with dry humor.  In this film, we see that Alfred is almost a father-figure to Bruce and actually persuades Bruce into keeping the mansion, and upholding the Wayne family name.  Alfred and Bruce argue quite a bit throughout this film and the dialogue between the two is so intelligent and so well-worded that you almost forget you are watching a ""Batman"" movie.(Nothing beats the repeated ""Bruce, why do we fall down?  So that we can learn to get back up.""  This line is repeated 3 times by Alfred during the movie and each time, becomes more powerful)  I love the dialogue, because it makes you realize that Wayne is an educated man, not simply a good-looking crime-fighter as depicted by the likes of Clooney, Keaton and Kilmer.

Morgan Freeman is also a joy as Mr. Fox, an applied scientist at Wayne Enterprises.  He is funny, smart, and a very large part of the plot, albeit the fact that his screen time is relatively short in this 2hr 20min masterpiece.

Cillian Murphy is very creepy as ""scarecrow"".

KAtie Holmes gives an adequte performance as Rachel Doss.  She's pretty and has that quality of appearing as such a sweetheart that she makes the role very believable.

Christian Bale IS Batman.  He truly fits this role better than I had imagined and gives Batman a human quality that his predecessors could not pull off in previous films.  He keeps the calm, quiet mystique of Bruce Wayne, while delivering what seems like a total different performance when he dons the Batman costume.

The scene that made this movie for me, is when Batman reveals his identity to Rachel.  In a scene that will give ANYONE goosebumps, Batman is on a rooftop, just having saved Rachel and a little boy from certain death, when Rachel asks for his name.  Batman repeats a line Rachel had told Bruce earlier in the film, during an argument the two had; ""It's not whats underneath, but your actions that determine who you are""----this is such an emotional and wonderful part of the movie, my words simply cannot describe.  It's this sort of dialogue/writing that make this movie oscar-worthy!

Another great part of the movie is that Gotham City is clearly modeled after my hometown, Chicago.  This is very clear on the skyline shots(I would know) and the 'EL', which Bruce's father built to help the ""lesser-offs"" comute cheaply.

Folks, I cannot say enough about how fantastic this film is.  Kudos to Christopher Nolan for reviving the ""Batman"" series and ending it on the high note it deserves!  There is NO WAY any ""Batman"" fan can be disappointed by this film!

ENJOY!!!

P.S.  I watched this movie at a Drive-In and as my friends and are were staring, completely engrossed in what was going on; a bat swooped down and zipped right between us!!!  I swear it happened and freaked the hell out of all of us.",1119657600,7,7082,4.563391442155309
1576464,4,B00005JNJV,"which is not saying very much. Nevertheless, Batman Begins is an excellent action movie with an outstanding, star-studded cast. At the top of the billing is the credible Christian Bale, who, unlike his predecessors, is not so heavily typecasted from other roles that his suitability to play Batman/Bruce Wayne is widely called into question. In addition, the great Michael Caine lends a strong, supporting role as the debonair butler, Alfred, and the talented Morgan Freeman plays a powerful, pivotal role as scientist, Lucius Fox.

In terms of the story, the strengths highlighted are, arguably, also the weaknesses. When compared to the Burton/Schumacher packages, the movie does not rely on desperate, dark humor elements that try to keep the audience engaged. However, the writers evoke an often grim, stark Batman story whose character's origin and development settings are, by and large, quite different from the Batman comics many grew up enjoying, even loving.

Also, attempts to make the Batman a character that we can relate to by touting that he is essentially one of those few superheroes without innate or augmented superpowers are limited in scope. There is no argument with the following: unlike Superman, he cannot fly; in contrast to the X-men, he was not born with super-human or mutant abilities; and as a dissimilarity between him and those others (Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Hulk, etc.) who do not belong to the previous two categories, his powers were not derived from accidents or scientific experiments. On the other side of the coin, it is perhaps the portrayal of the non-superhero half that, ironically, makes Batman less tangible to many perceptions of our mortal frailties. Batman's alter-ego, the man known as Bruce Wayne, is a person who has internal conflicts as most of us do from time to time; so both Batman and Bruce Wayne are human in that respect. However, Mr. Wayne is a successful, philanthropic businessman whose safe and secure wealth is very central to the story and is at a level that at least 99.5% are unable to identify with. Even during the aftermath of the most adverse moments from the darkest of hours, victory is often attained by the use of gadgetries that we, by and large, cannot imagine possessing.

In consequence, one does not need to be reminded that Batman is extremely wealthy, and that almost leads the viewer to conclude that the ""symbol"" of Batman is essentially a by-product of one's mass fortunes. Many might wonder how someone of a less- privileged background or even of less-desirable physical endowments could possibly become larger-than-life in any capacity.

Upon careful reflection, however, if one thinks slightly outside the box and looks at the commonly perceived struggle between the classes from various angles, he or she can come to acknowledge that the character of Batman is the embodiment and extension of the greatest qualities of Bruce Wayne, who, though superwealthy, is not so blinded by his riches that he cannot see the blights and misfortunes others have had to endure. Even if one supposes that he is too wealthy to be a working-class hero in the purest sense, Wayne is, in the highest regard, a champion for the common people; for as Batman, he gives a voice and an added strength behind those who want to improve themselves and those around them.

Quite remarkable is that Mr. Wayne, with the positive influence of his butler, Alfred, grew up to acquire and maintain wise stewardship of his inheritance and would come to use his assets for the betterment of others. One might even draw parallels to the heroic biographies of notable American figures such as our early twentieth-century presidents (both Roosevelts come to mind), whose life stories entailed using resources to fight corruption or poverty, or both.

All in all, this is a movie that can be seen from a myriad of perspectives. If there is a unifying moral to this tale that might make one feel enhanced or enlightened, I would say it is this: regardless of your background, you can use and develop personal traits within and without for the improvement of society. And that is, in my book, a very important lesson that we must all internalize.

Perhaps there a few minor scratches, but Batman Begins is a triumphant theatrical release. 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.",1119657600,,4313,4.981944444444444
1576465,4,B00005JNJV,"For Father's Day, my son and I went to see the fifth

in a series of Batman movies...""Batman Begins"".  A

true fan of this big screen sequence, I thought this

prequel was refreshing, exciting...and on a totally

different plain from the first four.  What I

discovered was that Batman has a heart...has a

history...has every reason on the planet to don wings,

ears and abilities above and beyond the call of

Dracula.

While I was expecting the same action-packed thrills

from the ""Batman"", ""Batman Returns"", ""Batman Forever"",

and ""Batman and Robin"" full screen classics, this one

hit a completely different nerve.

It is a two-hour and 20 minute drama...creating the

life of Bruce Wayne from childhood to the Joker.

Starring Christian Bale as Bruce (Batman) Wayne, this

one was far from being the action thriller with

non-stop special effects, violence and thrills.

Director Christopher Nolan took this opportunity to

give Batman a heart...a purpose...a reason for

being...and he does it masterfully.  To achieve this

goal, he had no choice but to submit a 140-minute

masterpiece that achieves everything it set out to do.

 Don't bring the little ones.  This intellectual

thriller is 20% action...80% intellectual.

Granted, the action builds in the last 30 minutes and

there's an awesome Batmobile chase, but the true merit

of this film is the heart of Batman.  Bale turns in a

highly believable performance as the viewer discovers

why Bruce became the comic book hero of the 50's.

The music and sound holds this flick together.

Wayne's heart throb Rachel (Katie Holmes), turns in an

average performance, but this film would have bombed

without Bale.

Perhaps the finest performance is turned in by cinema

legend Michael Caine as Batman's butler.  He hasn't

missed a beat.

If this film had been released as the first in the

sequence of five films, I would have given it a 5.

But because us viewers expected more action based on

its predecessors, I give it an 4...which isn't bad.

1576466,5,B00005JNJV,"This is easily the best super hero film ever made, and possibly one of the Top 10 movies of all time. If the Joel Schumacher installments accomplished anything, it's that they paved the way for WB to blow up the franchise and start over. I was a HUGE fan of the first Batman when it came out (I was 13) and this movie makes it look like a joke.

The most refreshing aspects of the movie is its realism. Portraying Gotham as modern day America, rather than some gloomy comic nightmare, or a neon-riddled discotheque draws us drawn into the action like we haven't been before. Complimenting this direction perfectly were the understated performances of the actors. It was nice to see villains that could exist in real life. I was worried going into this that there were too many story lines -- aside from how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, there is the love interest with Katie Holmes, and all the villains: Scarecrow, Raj Al Ghul, Carmine Falcione, the Chairman of Wayne Industries... would these all bog down the story the way they had in the past? Are these villains for villains' sake? I glad to say they work perfectly together, and it's not overwhelming in the slightest. I was also relieved they put the romance on the back burner, and Katie Holmes primary role in this movie is to be on the posters and in the trailers, where she looks fantastic.

Christian Bale was superbly cast as the billionaire playboy with a dark secret to hide, complete with two references to infamous lines in American Psycho -- 'inside doesn't matter', 'my mask of sanity is about to slip'. Cillian Murphy gives Nicholson a run for best villian ever - I'm not exaggerating, he's incredible, even in the few minutes of screen time. Morgan Freeman is fantastic as a scientist who has been run through the corporate grinder and ended in the basement of Wayne Industries. Liam Neison plays the most interesting character in the movie, and probably put this movie over the top for me, and cemented it as one I will never forget.

In a brilliant subtext of the movie they use Wayne Manor and as euphemism for the Batman franchise. This was very entertaining, and rare to see in an action/adventure movie.

For what a movie is supposed to accomplish, Batman Begins may hit the mark sharper than any movie ever made. It is one of the most engrossing, entertaining, creative, and smartly written movies of it's genre - but more importantly, the expectations have been driven so low over the past 15 years, they had a monumental task is restoring credibility to a character that for all intents and purposed has been delegated to Ace & Gary references on SNL.

It was just nice to leave the theater after watching a Batman movie without having to convince myself that I liked it. It's also nice to see that the 13 year old kid that collected all the Batman baseball cards, and talked to his best friend for months leading up to June 23, 1989... trying to figure out the exact plot of the movie with information taken from Rolling Stone, behind the scenes interviews with the cast, and excerpts from Batdance... that kid was on to something.

  The story was excellent. It had enough twists and turns to keep you on your seat on all times. And I loved its focus on story and character development. I also loved the way that they didn't have one major villian,they had two or three minor villians which worked excellently. All in all it was excellently written.

  And the acting was top notch. Christian Bale is the definitive Batman. And Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Liam Neeson,Katie Holmes,Morgan Freeman,and Cillian Murphy all delivered some of their best performances I have seen.

  The production of it was also real top notch. The set and prop design was fantastic,it made you feel as if you were watching the comic. And the new batsuit and batmobile were really cool!

This part of the story contains the requisite mumbo-jumbo about anger, power, control, etc. that's pro forma in this type of film, most of it smoothly delivered by Liam Neeson as Ra's sidekick.

A central theme that emerges amid all the talk is the lengths to which Bruce is willing to go to avenge his parents, who we see murdered in an early flashback. The Gotham part of the film, done in a neo-realist style, involves Bruce's first stabs at being Batman, corporate intrigue at Wayne Enterprises, possible love with a childhood sweetheart turned DA (Katie Holmes) and an insufficiently imagined villain called the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) who plans to destroy Gotham with the use of panic inducing drugs.

This is a genuinely new take on the superhero flick, which never loses sight of the fact that Bruce is just a man, with no superpowers....the first rate cast includes Michael Caine (Oscar-worthy as Alfred), Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Linus Roache, Rutger Hauer, and Morgan Freeman as Bruce's gadget guy.....the best film of the summer...",1119571200,,1341,5.0633484162895925
1576469,5,B00005JNJV,"I was extremely skeptical of this movie from the beginning. I couldn't believe that Warner Bros. was allowing the franchise to start over again and that it all came together so quickly (Quicker than Alien vs. Predator) I was expecting it to be another dumbed down version of the batman story (At the time I happened to think that Val Kilmer could have played a better Batman in the first two movies.) Now, I say without any hesitation that Christian Bales is by far the best Batman/Bruce Wayne so far adapted to film! there are a lot of differences in the story as far as how he became Batman and it makes the transition more human and less omnipitent(and even less egotistical). ""My parents died so now I'm Batman."" *Yawn* What makes him so special? answer from ""Batman Begins:"" HE'S NOT!

The origins are truly amazing and more believable in this 2nd attempt at a truly great story. I want so bad to point out how they took the perceptions about his origins from the ""Batman"" and ""Batman Forever"" films and destroyed it, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. (but believe me, I openly grinned when I realized what they had done!) I was glad to see some good actors in this movie too. Liam Neeson is great! (again, I REALLY want to go into detail, but I don't want to ruin it!) Michael Caine was ALWAYS the obvious choice for Alfred even back in 93. Katie Holmes has not always impressed me as the greatest actresses, but her acting in this movie has me coming around. (and shows her potential to become more) Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane is an EXCELLENT choice and just shows how the writers and Director wanted to have antagonists just as deep as the protaganist.

I've seen almost every major movie to come out this year, and I must say that this one is the best one so far! (See my Episode 3 Review!)",1119571200,3,1825,4.41246290801187
1576470,2,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is not a good film as many would have you believe.

Perhaps on a superficial level you will be charmed by the attractive cast, the gritty sets/ scenes, and the new batman suit and mobile.  And to a degree the story is anchored on the question of Vengeance and Justice, which provides a measure of depth.  But do they all mesh?  Moreover, does it make a good action movie?

It could have.  This movie did not.  There are many reasons that I did not feel any empathy for this movie, but I will name just three.

First, I just could not buy the whole idea of Conclave of Shadows - or whatever they called themselves.  A group of shinobi types 'balancing out' civilizations for thousands of years... it just did not seem pluasible.  It may be cliche, but it still seems more plausible that a villain would rather be what he is for the usual reasons: personal desires, ambitions, goals.  The idea of an ancient and secret order bent on global justice seems so way out there that I bet most people don't even care about them at all thruout the movie.  And when the archvillain goes out with a bang, the movie quickly cuts to the next and last scene, as if itself did not care about the fate of the Conclace after that last explosion.

Second, there is an issue of plausibility.  It seemed to me that all the natives Bruce encounters in his warderings across the desolatation of Tibet seem to speak and understand American. And when Bruce Wayne finally climbs up to the very asian looking Temple to meet the Conclave, he finds it occupied by a bunch of white guys with bad ninja costumes?  Ok, there was Ken Watanabe, but he is nothing more than window dressing in the Temple sequence.  Some may call it a small gripe, but if you want to borrow the asian mystique to justify Batman's scrappy aura, the movie could and should have delievered better.

Finally, I hated the action sequences.  Batman Begins' idea of action is to stick the camera as close to the action as possible, than shake it very fast left and right to simulate intensity.  Is this the best way to handle action in a multimillion dollar movie?  They couldn't hire one piano wire guy, much less a legitimate action choreographer?  I read somewhere that the director of this movie has Memento and Imsomnia on his resume.  Those were two good movies, but niether of them are action - and it shows in Batman Begins.  When I pay to watch an action flick, I want action, damnit!

On the whole, I found Batman Begins very boring and badly plotted.  All the pieces were there, but I think they could have been assembled into a much better movie.",1119571200,7,2612,4.471458773784355
1576551,5,B00005JNJV,"I loved this movie so much. Everything was perfect. It balanced the action and the drama perfectly and was a very mature film. It was realistic and not cartooney like the next four films in the series. The acting all round was excellent. Christian Bale was great as Batman. Also Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman and everyone were great. But I was most surprised with Katie Holmes. She really held her own standing among these great male actors. Overall BATMAN BEGINS is the best of the five Batman films.

1576552,4,B00005JNJV,"This movie is undoubtedly catered for matured audience who is looking more for depths and character developments.  It used to be that comic book movie offering defines clearly who the bad and good guys are; a lot of kicking arse going on but ultimately, justice shall prevail.  Subsequently, a new generation of directors started to rattle the cage, namely Ang Lee in the Hulk and now, Christopher Nolan in Batman Begins.  I find it quite a breath of fresh air by ""deconstructing"" parts of Batman.  This movie attempts to address the many why, who, where, when, how questions of Batman and I'm excited to report that the outcomes are rather logical but not corny and crass.  Some ""old"" villains are introduced such as Scarecrow.  New characters are introduced such as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend and later, love interest in the form of Katie Holmes, Raul, and Morgan Freeman's character akin to Q of James Bond franchise who introduced to Bruce Wayne many ""toys"" that grown-up men who are young at heart would droll all over.  Ultimately, the production is sleek by introducing new elements to freshen up the franchise and yet, not overdoing it to the extent that it sidelines the Batman fans of the past such as myself.  I guess it's true to say that this movie allows us to have a cake and eat it too.  Last but not least, a dry movie won't make do without some light-hearted jokes which are mainly done superbly by the veterans such as Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.  It's really wonderful to see Rutger Hauer back to the silver screen once again.  The casting for Batman Begins is impeccable with so many heavy weight actors.  Hans Zimmer soundtrack is as heroic and compelling as always.  Overall, a very well-done movie that keeps audience talking after the end credit rolls out.  I can't wait for the DVD limited edition release.  Moreoever, I look forward to watching the sequel which would most definitely bring back the most colourful villain of all, the Joker.  Gotham is always a part of the Batman myth and in this offering, the place is as bleak and as intimidating as always.  Long live the Batman franchise!  Highly recommended to be watched on the big screen.",1119571200,2,2182,4.742705570291777
1576553,5,B00005JNJV,"The first great film of Summer 2005 comes in the form of ""Batman Begins""! I have just seen this film today with high expectations...and man, I was not disappointed in the least! The direction of Christopher Nolan (""Memento"", ""Insomnia"") was absolutely mesmerizing and powerful! The special effects were mind-blowing, and the action/suspense of the film was nothing short of edge-of-your-seat! Now to the performances of the film's cast, led by superstar Christian Bale (""Equilibrium"") as the Dark Knight. Bale brings a powerful presence and on-the-spot seriousness to the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman. In fact, Bale is 100 times better than both Val Kilmer and George Clooney, but the best Batman of all time will always be -- (hats off, everyone) -- Michael Keaton! To me, Christian Bale's performance is about equal to Keaton's performance as Batman in the first two ""Batman"" films. Joining Bale are Academy Award winners Michael Caine (""The Quiet American"") and Morgan Freeman (""Million Dollar Baby""), Liam Neeson (""K-19: The Widowmaker""), Katie Holmes (""First Daughter""), Gary Oldman (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""), Cillian Murphy (""28 Days Later""), Tom Wilkinson (""In the Bedroom""), Rutger Hauer (""Blind Fury""), Ken Watanabe (""The Last Samurai""), and Linus Roache (""The Forgotten""), in which they all gave excellent, top-notch performances throughout!

I'm sure everyone knows the story of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. But for those who don't, then here's the story in a nutshell. As the movie begins, we are introduced to young Bruce Wayne (Gus Lewis), son and heir to Gotham City's humanitarian billionaire Thomas Wayne (Roache). We see Bruce endure two childhood traumas: first, a fall into a well that becomes a harrowing bat attack, and then the murder of his parents at the hands of a mugger (just the kind of impoverished soul that the good Thomas Wayne was devoting his money toward helping). Fast forward a few years, Bruce has grown up to be played by Bale and is a prisoner in an unnamed Asian country's torture camp. He is there by choice, to learn the limits of human fear and the extent to which darkness will rule a man's heart. While there, he is mentored by a league of mercenaries, led by Henri Ducard (Neeson) and the dangerous but honorable ninja leader known as Ra's Al-Ghul (Watanabe), and is taught the ways of combat and discipline. When Bruce refuses to kill an enemy of the league, they turn on him. He escapes - but not without the warning that his compassion will one day undo him. When Bruce returns to Gotham, he not only tries to rekindle his relationship with his childhood sweetheart/assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Holmes), but also assumes the rightful place as the unofficial prince of the city - a playboy billionaire with the world as his oyster. By day, that is. By night, he studies the slimy workings of the corrupt city and devises a means by which he can continue his father's work to better its people. He must be more than a man; he must be a symbol. A symbol of fear - Bruce's fear. A bat. He becomes the Dark Knight himself...Batman! As Batman, and with the help of his faithful servant Alfred (Caine), rising cop Jim Gordon (Oldman), and Wayne Enterprises weapons specialist Lucius Fox (Freeman), Bruce works to stop the city-conquering plans of mob boss Carmine Falcone (Wilkinson), the evil Dr. Jonathan Crane, a.k.a. ""The Scarecrow"" (Murphy), and a mysterious third party that is quite familiar with Bruce and waiting to strike when the time is right. We are introduced, along with the villains, to the elements by which we recognize and appreciate Batman and his legend: the cape, the cowl, the gadgets, the Bat Signal, the newly-redesigned Batsuit, the Batmobile. Each element is familiar and, when tweaked, made more real than in previous incarnations.

In conclusion, ""Batman Begins"" is the ultimate Batman movie! ""Batman Begins"" has it all: an unforgettable cast, ground-pounding action, a mesmerizing and electrifying musical score, explosive special/visual effects, and dynamic storytelling! ""Batman Begins"" accomplishes the fact that it resurrects a fallen film franchise and an anti-hero for the 21st century. More than likely, I think there will be an upcoming ""Batman Begins"" sequel in the future according to the end of the film. And I imagine that by the time the Bale Batman encounters his Joker, this series will have ironed any wrinkles from the cape. All in all, no one has done it better than Christian Bale as Batman! And ""Batman Begins"", without a doubt, a DVD must-have!",1119484800,,4558,5.019815059445178
1576554,4,B00005JNJV,"Your overall opinion of this movie is entirely dependent on your personal relationship with the Batman franchise. Let me explain: I saw this movie with my fianc. He grew up reading the Batman comic books. I have never opened a Batman comic in my life. My impressions of Batman were solely based on watching reruns of the old Adam West TV series and then seeing the first four Batman films. Therefore, it's not surprising at all that my fianc enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did. I can appreciate the film for what it was trying to do, but it just didn't win me over completely.

""Batman Begins"" basically throws out everything that happens in the first four Batman films and starts from scratch. We get to see Bruce Wayne as a child and as a young man. The film does a great job of exploring Bruce's character, which I thought was fabulous. According to my fianc, there are also a lot of incidents and characters in this movie that are taken from the original comic books which have never been utilized in the movie franchise before, such as Morgan Freeman's character. That was pretty cool.

Here are some things I liked and disliked about the film:

+ Christian Bale did a great job as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Some people have complained that his Batman voice and characterization are too similar to his Bruce Wayne persona. I think that's the effect they were going for, though, and I had no problem with it. (Bale looks like a young Dylan McDermott, though...it's creepy. I was like, ""Why is that guy from 'The Practice' wearing the Bat Suit?!'"")

+ I love the fact that the Bat Cave was an ACTUAL CAVE that Bruce fell into as a child. The whole concept of him having to overcome his fear of bats was brilliant. (And those bats were SPOOKY! Great special effects!)

+ When the first publicity photos of the Batmobile were released about a year ago, I was disgusted by them...why were they making it look like a Monster Truck? I sorely misjudged the new vehicle, though...it was AWESOME! I love the scene where the police radio a description of the car: ""It's a black...tank.""

+ Michael Caine did a great job as Alfred. No one will ever take Michael Gough's place in my heart, but Caine made the character his own and brought a lot of classy humor to the role. (""All those pushups every day and you can't even lift a bloody log!"")

+ Liam Neeson. He's fabulous in everything he does, and this film was no exception. He did a great job in all those fight scenes!

- Katie Holmes...she was SO AWFUL! I laughed out loud during the scene where her character slapped Bruce Wayne twice in the car...she looked like she was swatting at flies! It was SO PAINFUL to watch!

- The Scarecrow character really freaked me out. My fianc tells me that he was exactly how the comic books depicted him, so I guess that's a good thing, but I miss classic villains like Catwoman and the Joker.

- I really didn't enjoy the first 40 minutes of the movie, and the idea that Bruce Wayne was trained by a pack of Ninjas in the mountains still does not sit well with me. I understand the need to explain how Bruce was trained, but the whole Ninja concept was just a tad overboard, in my opinion.

The bottom line with this film is that it's really good for what it is, but people who were expecting this to be like the Michael Keaton movies are going to be slightly disappointed. I think that the most important thing is that the Batman franchise has been reinvigorated. Hopefully there will be more movies in the future...and with any luck, Katie Holmes won't be in any of them! (Who will they get to play the Joker, though? I just can't picture anyone but Jack Nicholson in that role.)",1119484800,6,3668,4.459701492537313
1576555,5,B00005JNJV,"MOVIE: Remember the old days? Where Batman was just Superman without the super powers, where Batman felt like a comic book, where Gotham City felt like some caricature of New York City. Remember those horrible days, the days of Joel Schumacher, the days of Batman looking like some freak show circus. Well my friends, those days are gone and buried . . . at least until they release a collector's set of all the Batman films to date, then we have to relive them. Christopher Nolan brings a new and darker vision to the Batman franchise, and our new Batman couldn't have been a more perfect fit. In this film we go to the roots of the character of Bruce Wayne, and that is what is so special about this film. It manages to make a movie about Bruce Wayne, not about Batman. The movie begins (no pun intended) with Bruce Wayne somewhere in the far east, I guess to do a little soul searching. There he meets Liam Neeson's character who trains him to use his fear to fight crime. After his training, he is asked to behead a known murderer but refuses to do so. Bruce Wayne feels it's the job of the justice system to seal a fate of a criminal, not a lone enforcer. That brings us to his return to Gotham City, a place so corrput and full of crime that it is tearing itself apart.  Gotham City plays a major role in the movie as the backdrop, this is the location of Bruce's home, but the poor state of the city was what lead to his parents getting killed during a mugging when he was a child. Bruce feels it was his fault for his parents' death, it was his fear of bats that led them out of the theater and into the streets where they were killed. Now his father's business is going public, his past and future don't seem to be where he wants them to be. Bruce Wayne now uses what he learned from his journey in the east to enforce justice in the west. He is aided by his good butler Alfred, and a man who works at the abandoned technology wing of his father's corporation, played by Morgan Freeman. This brings us to the antagonist of the film, well actually there is no real main nemesis for Batman in this film. No crazy Joker, or Riddler, or Two Face. Nothing of that nature, but the main person that is contributing to the corrupt justice system of Gotham City is Dr. Crane. A man who seems to get all the criminals convicted of a crime not to be charged by pleading insanity. What he does though is put on a scarecrow mask and release a toxic hallucinogen that basically causes brain damage. This leads Batman to discover a bigger plot. A plot to have Gotham City destroyed from within so that it can rebuild itself back into a civilized city. That is a major theme in this film, the theme of starting over and rebuilding. It seems like a good theme given that this is exactly what this movie is doing to the Batman franchise. This movie is not a superhero movie, but a real film with values. It introduces interesting ideas and has a continuing social commentary on society, which has been plagued by corruption from the times of monarchy up until now. What is really noteworthy of this movie is the score of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. Usually when composers work on the same film it is never together, but as we all know, Hans Zimmer puts emphasis on collaboration. These two long time friends worked closely together to deliver a very dark and intense score.  It's obvious that Zimmer had the greater influence on the score, but you can feel a good deal of Howard's style as well. The score compliments the new dark vision of Batman perfectly, and it really adds depth to the character of Bruce Wayne. This is the perfect action film, with an amazing cast, a dark look on society, and an intense climax.

ACTING: Christian Bale fills the shoes perfectly. This is the new Batman for this new vision. There is no way that Michael Keaton or Val Kilmer could fill the shoes with this new twist on the franchise. Those actors are better suited for the comic book version of the series. What amazes me is that Christian Bale is such a natural actor, he has never taken an acting lesson in his life yet manages to pull such interesting characters. I was also amazed at how much bodybuilding he did for the role, it put a shock on my face because the last time I saw him was in The Machinist. A role he lost 63 pounds for, was nothing but skin and bones, and basically a walking skeleton. As for the supporting cast, they were all cast perfectly. Micheal Caine makes a perfect Alfred, the old and wise Butler. Morgan Freeman shines as he always does, but he has limited screen time. Liam Neeson is great in his role, but his character always seems a mystery to the audience. I kind of felt like I wanted to know his background too. Gary Oldman plays Chief Gordon and I'm always fond of Oldman. I believe he is the most versatile actor we have. Cillian Murphy plays Dr. Crane, also known as scarecrow. I think he did a great job, but I also think maybe someone older should of played that role. Although he was able to capture the menacing feel of that character perfectly. Katie Holmes plays the long time friend and love interest of Bruce Wayne, and she does a good job as well.

BOTTOM LINE: A film I really enjoyed. A darker and more disturbed vision guides this new Batman to great heights. Christopher Nolan is a director who knows how to create atmosphere. He did it with Memento, he most certainly did it with Insomnia, and now he brings an amazing atmosphere to Batman Begins. Great acting, great directing, and great music combine to make Batman Begins not only a summer blockbuster but a film with character and plot.",1119484800,2,5634,4.39367816091954
1576556,5,B00005JNJV,"I seen this film with high expectations, I've seen all the Batman films, and I liked them all, well, Batman and Robin was...sub-par. Batman and Batman Returns were well done, and Batman Begins could easily compare. Christian Bale is a magnificent actor, after I seen him in ""Reign of Fire"" and ""American Psycho"". He did have a little problem with his Batman voice, it was a little too raspy and tough-guyish, but other than that, he was a frightening hero who saved Gotham from a deadly gas.

The film has a large and effective cast. Micheal Caine, a great choice for Alfred, brings laughs and a warm heart. Morgan Freeman plays Batman's gagdets man Lucius Fox, who has only a small role, but still great. Katie Holmes plays Rachel Dodson, Batman's close friend and heart's interest. She's pretty good, compared to Kim Basinger and Nicole Kidman. Gary Oldman plays Gordon, Batman's friendly police officer, and does a good job at it too. The Commisioner Gordon in the later Batman films is Pat Hingle, and he wasn't that good. Liam Neeson is awesome as Henri Ducard, Batman's former trainer turned villain. Cillian Murphy played the horrific Scarecrow, but only

had a small role, which was dissapointing because it was such an awesome character, and he didn't appear to be defeated, he was electricuted by Rachel and then he was gone from the rest of the film. Too bad.

The action was great, great car chase scene, and explosions and things crashing and smashing, and the fighting was good too, except the camera was awkward during fights, making the view close up and weird to distinguish between whats going on and who's getting hurt.

Something that bothered me was how it interacted with the first Batman film. In Batman, Jack (the Joker) kills Bruce's parents. But in this, some thug who's name I didn't catch (but it wasn't Jack) kills his parents. And at the end of Batman Begins, Gordon hands Batman a Joker card telling him this is his next villian, but in Batman, Jack doesn't turn into the Joker until later in the film.

Overall, an awesome and well-done and well-casted movie!",1119484800,5,2091,4.765193370165746

I just can't. Batman Begins clearly isn't backed by a McDonald's Happy Meal and clearly deserves credit for representing the protagonist more as abstract concepts, the chief of which is on the theme of Fear.

I won't go into the whole movie beyond the fact that I was completely impressed with the cast of characters (because of the ""star-studded"" quality that usually turns me off) and their unbelievable ability to bury themselves in the thick plot. I recommend to you, the moviegoer, to forget the Fantastic Four, screw the Spiderman, and dump the Daredevil. Go see a real hero and not just some over-the-top screenplay from characters with quirks and powers. Go see the movie that revived the horrors of a campy series. Go see Batman Begins, and be satisfied.",1119484800,2,980,5.012269938650307
1576558,4,B00005JNJV,"The most entertaining and conventional movie of the ""Batman"" series, Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" seeks to create a launching pad for new slew of Caped Crusader films, and this origin story, while choppy and imperfect, sets the buffet table. Here's report card of the movie's strengths and weaknesses, something to differentiate this review from others:

STRENGTHS:

THE APPROACH - No Marc Chagall nightmare worlds. No zany gay chic. Nolan (""Insomnia"" and ""Memento"") and screenwriter David S. Goyer bring realism - considering it worked so well in ""Spider-Man"" series - back into the fold. Gotham is a slightly futuristic, burned-out New York. But we can still recognize it; the movie's most glorious shot is of Batman high atop Wayne Tower, looking down upon a candyland of city lights. No special f/x - just a gorgeous shot of a man above his city. ""Batman Begins"" has an amount of restraint to it.

THE SCREENPLAY:  Short on one-liners and ominous phrases, long character development and serious talk. Even the Burton ""Batman"" movies had a lot invested in being funny; Goyer and Nolan are content to use the natural humor of Christian Bale and trust audience to pay attention, not wait to be entertained.

CHRISTIAN BALE: Here's the edgy ""Batman"" they've been looking for. Bale's played enough villain roles - ""American Psycho,"" ""Shaft"" - to approach the anti-hero a swirl of swagger, anger, conviction and droll humor. Physically, Bale surpasses Keaton, Kilmer and Clooney. As an actor, he's less mysterious than Keaton - and a little less believable a billionaire tycoon, too - and his ""tough"" voice - well, it sounds a little forced. Still - right guy. Fine pick.

ORIGIN STORY: Wayne is investigating the nature of evil in a Chinese prison when his mentor, Ducard (Liam Neeson), rescues and invites him to a training facility in the Himalayas. Ducard teaches him the dark arts, and extracts the story of Bruce's childhood. There are nice touches about bats, the death of his parents, Bruce's planned revenge against his their murderer. Ducard invites Bruce into the League of Shadows, led by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). The League wants to go a little farther than Bruce is willing to. Bruce declines their offer in violent fashion, returns to Gotham, and, with butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Wayne Enterprises scientist Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman. The ""origin"" material is always a little slow - and the cross-cutting between training and Bruce's childhood is a bit annoying, but ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" both survived these growing pains for excellent sequels.

MICHAEL CAINE AND MORGAN FREEMAN: Old pros. Instant credibility.

GARY OLDMAN AS SGT. GORDON: Finally, a Gordon who's not a caricature or a punchline. Oldman plays him simply as a decent, honest cop, one of the few left in Gotham, and Batman's first partner. The role isn't overplayed, but Gordon does more than just proclaim and stand around - he's shoehorned nicely into the climax.

VILLAINS: Not unforgettable. Just not stupid. It makes sense that the first criminal worth fighting is simply mob boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul is a thinking man's villain, and The League of Shadows are pretty faceless but not cartoonish. Cillian Murphy is funny/creepy as Dr. Johnathan Crane/The Scarecrow, but he doesn't have much to do. ""Batman Begins"" is focused more on the Bat than it is his tormentors, as it should be, because these villains likely won't roll around again.

MUSICAL SCORE: By Howard Shore and James Newton Howard. Never intrudes, usually enhances. During the ""money shot"" scene - that one atop Gotham - it's quiet and grand.

LEAGUE OF SHADOWS INITIATION: Mysterious and unpredictable, Nolan shot and edited this sequence more for the idea being enclosed by 30 deadly assassins than clarity. Suspenseful.

WEAKNESSES

KATIE HOLMES:  Her Rachel Dawes, childhood friend of Bruce Wayne and gritty Gotham prosecutor, is a grim one, a stick in the mud who talks at length about doing justice without accomplishing much. In this day and age, is a lawyer really a symbol of virtue? Holmes isn't in the movie much, the romance is downplayed, but her character wears a rather unfortunate silk blouse in the movie's second-to-last scene.

CONTINUITY: At times ""Batman Begins"" strikes me as cobbled together in parts. The beginning is especially jagged, though necessarily so. The plot is a little too jammed, though: Rutger Hauer has no purpose as the de facto head of Wayne Enterprises - unless he figures into the sequel. Rachel's boss disappears without much fanfare. Falcone, the mob boss, goes off the map halfway through the picture.

BATMOBILE CHASE: The vehicle itself - cross a Hummer and the design of a B-2 Stealth Bomber - is interesting. The chase through Gotham, more than ten minutes long, is blah.

ACTION SCENE AT THE DOCKS: Again. Blah.

CLIMACTIC ACTION SCENE: On an elevated train at night. Not nearly as effective as a similiar scene in ""Spider-Man."" Anti-climactic and, since it's in the dark of night, not exactly thrilling.

VILLAINOUS PLOT TO DESTROY GOTHAM: It's a blatant steal from the original ""Batman!"" Chemicals combining with other chemicals. Deadly gases. A poisoned populace.

Overall, ""Batman Begins"" takes on a bigger assignment than its predecessors and passes, well. The franchise is built to last with a grounding in semi-reality and four excellent actors - Bale, Oldman, Caine and Freeman - to carry it for a couple more films. Nolan, should he continue, will get a bigger budget to play with a splashy villain and maybe a more interesting female lead than Holmes, who is pretty and upstanding but a bit of a bore.",1119484800,2,5665,5.05793991416309

Bruce trains incredibly hard, but declines the offer to join the League.  He returns to Gothan City with the desire to ride the city of crime.  With the help of his faithful butler Alfred (Caine) and inventor Lucius Fox (Freeman), Bruce develops an alter-ego that will help him install fear into the criminals of the city.  The two biggest are crime lord Carmine Falcone (Wilkinson) and The Scarecrow (Murphy), a twisted psychiatrist who works for a mysterious employer.

The establishment of Batman is fully fleshed out, in this excellent film from director Christopher Nolan.  Almost no stone goes unturned as we learn how and why Batman does what he does.  Nolan has yet to make even an average movie, and was a great choice to re-boot the franchise.  And re-boot it he does.  The previous four films are ignored and a fresh look at the superhero is given.

Bale is perhaps the best Batman, pulling off both Bruce and Batman convincingly.  His anger, pain, and determination are very real.  Neeson is excellent in the role of teacher, perhaps channelling his inner Qui-Gon.  Caine brings dignity and compassion to Alfred the butler.  Murphy is absolutely perfect as the crazed Scarecrow (a villian I knew nothing about).  The film is dark, gritty, and violent; just as it should be.  There are even some scary moments.  And of course, the ending sets up another film.  Nolan has said that he envisions a trilogy, and I for one hope that he stays with the franchise for a while.

""Batman Begins"" is one of the best superhero movies ever made.  It is also one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  I highly recommend this film.  See it at once!",1119484800,3,2138,4.664879356568365

1576652,5,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins"" is all about a man who battles his enemies and inner demons. It's about fear, acceptance, morality and reality: Batman is not a superhero. He doesn't have extraordinary powers. He's human, physically and emotionally.

Bruce Wayne is a fascist at heart - but has enough moral fiber to resist devolving into an executioner. ""That is the only thing that separates us from them,"" Bruce says in ""Batman Begins."" And that's something that the film latches on to - amongst other topics - and what makes it not only the best of the ""Batman"" movies, but also a great film by any standard.

Christopher Nolan, the British filmmaker who bent all the rules in 2000 with the nonlinear and mind-boggling masterpiece ""Memento"", directed ""Batman Begins."" When news first broke, many message boards churned with disgruntled fans claiming he was ""selling out"" by helming this project. What Nolan has actually done is take a severely over-bloated, seemingly unredeemable series of films and completely reformed them; ""Batman Begins"" opens with digital bats encompassing the screen, which is important, because otherwise countless cinemagoers would be sitting awestruck for sixty minutes, wondering whether they've walked into the wrong film.

""Begins"" opens somewhere in Asia. Bruce has voluntarily become a prisoner in order to research the lives of criminals. When he is visited by a mysterious guru named Ducard (Liam Neeson), Bruce is freed from jail and becomes Ducard's protg. Ducard is a member of the League of Shadows, an ancient ninja brotherhood bent on the destruction of all evil and wrongdoing. Of course, their methods are flawed. Bruce flees back to Gotham City after refusing to murder a rapist on Ducard's command. He invests stock in his father's old company, Wayne Corp., and uses the underground lab of the facility to ""borrow"" high-tech military weaponry.

Bruce and his butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), hide the equipment underneath the Wayne Estate in a creepy old bat cave. Bruce takes on the persona of Batman and begins to fight crime under the watchful eye of the corrupt city.

Gotham's only honest cop, Sgt. Gordon (Gary Oldman), who comforted Bruce as a child after his parents died, is the only person who believes Batman means well - others think he is a sadistic criminal, especially after a famous mob boss (Tom Wilkinson) is found pinned to a skylight, his drug-smuggling thugs all left unconscious.

Assistant District Attorney Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) meanwhile finds reason to believe that the city's resident psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), may be involved in a scheme to harm Gotham with the help of an outsider - she is subsequently put on a hit list and Batman, who learns the truth, races against time to save her. (Oh, yeah, she was Bruce's childhood friend, too; which is more a convenience than a coincidence.)

I admire the technical skill of this production. The fight scenes are fast and blurred - I usually hate this, but it works well in ""Batman Begins,"" because we're meant to fear the unknown. Sounds are used to great effect. Cinematically, Batman becomes a movie monster on occasion - the scene where a group of smugglers are picked off one-by-one in the darkness, with scattering sounds overhead and screams and gunshots piercing the silence, brings to mind Ridley Scott's ""Alien."" In another segment, Batman questions Crane while he is on drugs, which results in some truly terrifying images that will shock children who are familiar with Batman as a flawless hero.

I also like the fact that Nolan - who admittedly does not prefer using modern special effects - bases his film around the characters so much indeed that he uses very little CGI. Apart from a few action sequences and swarms of bats, most of ""Batman Begins"" is real, and that really impressed me. (I do not like modern effects, either.) I could tell the city was real, I could tell the Batmobile was real, and I could tell Batman was real. Remember the segment in ""Batman and Robin"" where they surf 30,000 feet above ground on pieces of an exploding rocket ship and look like cartoon characters? There's none of that crap here.

The script is by David Goyer, who co-wrote the visionary ""Dark City."" That film was heavily influenced by German expressionism - it moved quickly, awkwardly, with scenes interrupting other scenes out of the blue.

""Batman Begins"" is formed on a similar scale. During action sequences, it's not rare to suddenly see other characters, far away, in the middle of a discussion, before cutting back to the action. I would usually detest this, because in most American films it's a sign of poor editing, sloppy writing or bad direction; but I think it works here - not because it's a comic book movie like ""Sin City,"" but because it's just the style of the film itself. Complemented by the fast editing and Nolan's impressive direction, ""Batman Begins"" walks the fine line between pretentiousness and sloppiness - it is artsy and careful, clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes, but the edits and fight sequences are clearly inspired.

Bale is perfect as Batman, and the best yet, because he fits every aspect of the character; he is believable as a smug, ruthless playboy. We can see him as a troubled young man haunted by his past and an unbearable sense of guilt. And in the suit, he looks confident without being comfortable - he's still learning how to adapt. We can imagine how far he will progress in the sequels when, at the end of ""Begins,"" he has finally become the Batman we all know.

The rest of the cast range from above average to very good: Michael Caine is fun as Alfred; Katie Holmes is surprisingly better than expected, Gary Oldman is great whilst Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer are pushed aside somewhat, serving little purpose. Liam Neeson is somewhere in between.

The movie is grim like Burton's but more realistic, and not as glossy and perfect; the suit is imperfect, Batman's technology and secrets are exposed, the Batmobile is ugly and efficient, and the bat cave was originally part of the underground railroad and doesn't have any gadgets or special super-duper display cases for the suits. (I never did understand the point of encasing the Bat Suit in a special shiny glass container when no one was supposed to even see it except Bruce and Alfred.)

In an era when bigger is better, and audiences are used to Batman making his appearance on-screen in mere minutes of each film, ""Begins"" does something completely unexpected (and risky). It actually takes its time. Bruce Wayne doesn't don his famous suit and cape for the first hour of the film - and when he finally does, the costume isn't fantasized. It's imperfect, awkward and ugly. And best of all, there are no bat-nipples this time. All considered, is it really so surprising that ""Batman Begins"" has only made a disappointing $71 million in its first week? Audiences are not used to blockbusters of such depth, scale and grandeur. Especially if it has the word ""Batman"" in its title.",1119398400,7,7038,4.893456375838926

The characters are well developed and well acted. You actually care about them. The story and atmosphere are real. You get sucked in from the beginning and stay until the very last frame.

1576654,5,B00005JNJV,"I'd heard good things about the movie before I went to see it, so I was enthusiastic about seeing the movie.  I was willing to give Christian Bale the benefit of the doubt because I hadn't seen him do very much of anything.  Bale had his work cut out for him-Michael Keaton, IMHO, was the best live-action Batman to hit the big screen, and Bale had to at least equal Keaton's intensity in order to earn my respect.

The good news is, Bale makes the cut.  The great news is, this is by far the best live-action Batman movie in existence!  This was a big bang, folks-a total regeneration.  It invites you to throw out every previous impression of Batman that you've seen live-action and embrace a ""new Batman order"".  Christian Bale brings the character of billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne to the next level, a level consistent with the characterizations aptly portrayed in the better Batman cartoons that are on television.  And I would be remiss in my duties if I didn't acknowledge that stellar supporting cast-gadgetman Morgan Freeman and the affable Michael Caine as Alfred.  Someone had to have some serious connections in Tinseltown to make that happen!  And who is this newcomer, Cillian Murphy?  I was frightened...he was fantastic!  And Liam Neeson, big Irish brute that he is, playing the self-righteous, but no less dangerous, villian.  I was in awe!

If I were to change anything about the movie, I would have ditched Katie Holmes as a love interest.  Frankly, for a movie that scored the way this one does, it required a babe of the Kim Basinger caliber, and Holmes does not make the cut.  She's got age and naturally occurring collagen on Ms. Basinger, and little else.

Overall, I rate this movie 5 stars, and give it the highest possible recommendation.  I am suitably gratified.",1119398400,,1793,4.747572815533981
1576655,2,B00005JNJV,"Many people think that I am destroying this film simply because I am a ""tim burton fan."" This is somewhat true, only because I perfer the time burton version(s) of batman.

There are many mistakes in this movie, and choices to bring the story of batman to the mainstream that dissapoint me. For one, the characters. Ra's Al Guhl is hugely misrepresented and could of been a greater (if yet the best) batman enemy. If you read the comics/saw the cartoon, bruce wayne falls in love with his daughter (which could have been played by katie holmes...not the character she DID play)...and the fact that Al Guhl needs to jump in ""the pits"" to revive himself of his power, which temperarilly transforms him into a madman.(where is it?!) The scarcrow was merely his henchmen, and the way the story uses his ""fear effect"" is definately flawed (SPOILER...) When Bruce is infected with the fear poison, he passes out for 2 days, and just takes a cure. It would have been better if it STAYED in bruce wayne's system which would have given the writer/director to give bruce ""nightmares"" of his past. (instead of stupid random flashbacks). Plus, could of shown the dark side of batman.

Another thing I would like to point out is the action...where is it? There was the fighting scene at the end, bruce vs ninjas (good) and the batmobile chase. Definately not exciting.

One thing that truly ruins the new age factor of batman: Using the fact that some random junkie killed bruce's parents (true in older books), when according to the old movie and the newer books, is in fact the joker (who is unnamed) who killed bruce's parents...which makes him a even more sinister enemy.

Props to the director for showing the training, and how bruce wanted to become batman. thumbs down on the new batmobile and how bruce ""borrowed"" equipment to create all his batgear. christian bale was a horrible bruce wayne. He didn't show his true anger, imo.

I could go on and on, but imo, if u want to see the best representation of batman...

watch batman the animated series or the batman/batman returns",1119398400,4,2073,4.696969696969697
1576656,3,B00005JNJV,"Easily the darkest version of Batman thus far.

And it takes the cake when it comes to scares. What were the BBFC (UK Censor Board) thinking with the ""12A"" rating? This qualifies for a ""15"". Head-buts, kicks, bones breaking, faces becoming twisted and contorted, demons taking shape, etc. Gothic stuff indeed!

However, I have a horrible feeling the film has been cut. There were a number of sudden cuts and these edits looked very ropey...

As a film, it's a vast improvement on the farcical sequels of Tim Burton's original. However, some of the designs are rather weak - the costume remains a rubber-suit. Why-oh-why couldn't they use the type of design seen in the live-action short film - Batman: Dead End?

The performances are spirited, the film has a punchy pace and the music is sweeping and graceful.

However, after 140mins, I felt empty and unfulfilled.

It was good but it lacked the zest and passion of the comic-books.",1119398400,2,933,4.8
1576657,5,B00005JNJV,"This is the ""Batman"" film I've long waited to see. While I did like Tim Burton's vision in 1989's ""Batman"", I still thought certain elements were missing that I really loved from the ""Tales of the Dark Night"" comic book series. By the time Joel Schumacher completely turned the film series into a perverted, campy gay parody, it was obvious that Warner Brothers simply can't be trusted with any superhero franchise (as they also ruined the ""Superman"" movies after the second one). If it weren't for the astronomical grosses of ""Spiderman"" and its sequel, ""X-Men"" and its sequel of the rival Comic Book company and movie studios, I'm certain that ""Batman"" would never have been ""rebooted"".

My hopes were raised when I heard that Director Chris Nolan and actor Christian Bale were attached to the project. Christian Bale fits my image of Bruce Wayne. Certainly more than Michael Keaton anyway. The trailers then impressed me into seeing this film and when I finally did see it, I was simply awestruck that someone managed to make the perfect Batman film, finally!

This is not a film for the children. One moviegoer walked out with two children in tow an hour into the film. This movie was made for the adult fans of the comic book...not those who love the campy 60s TV show or the Joel Schumacher parodies. For once, I wanted to see a Batman film that focused on Bruce Wayne/Batman and not the villains and this one is it. We don't even see the appearance of Batman until halfway through. For the first hour we get a fuller understanding of Bruce Wayne, his childhood tragedy, how his fear of bats leads to a guilty complex regarding his parents murder, and his soul searching to the mountains of Tibet. This is a very deep, profound, spiritual beginning and provides the most picture of Bruce Wayne yet, helping people understand the kind of person who would spend his nights dressed as a bat going after criminals.

In Tibet, he receives special training from a mysterious Ducard, played by Qui-Gon Jinn himself, Liam Neeson. Wayne learns about the tactics of a vigilante group who operate in the shadows of society. There is a disagreement over the use of violence/vengeance, causing Wayne to part company in cool style and return to Gotham after a 7 year absence. The corruption of the city politicians wakes him up from the naive idealism his parents had instilled in him. Such a privileged life he led, where he thought money could help defeat poverty and crime. He learns otherwise and thus in one uniquely spiritual scene, when Bruce Wayne achieves ""oneness"" with a flurry of bats, we see the transformation. Batman is born!

Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow is an excellent villain, using a vaporized drug mist to induce psychotic episodes in people. While this plot might seem a bit of a stretch for a straight foward, dramatic film, it works in ""Batman Begins"" because that's what generally happens in comic books. In comparison to the motives of the previous line of whacked out villains of the four ""Batman"" films, this one with the Scarecrow is the most realistic and plausible. I saw many allusions to the 2001 Anthrax attacks, so this plot worked. The entire premise of the film is the use of fear to control oneself and others...which is very relevant to today's world.

Nolan's Gotham City looks exactly as I had imagined it from the many ""Batman"" comic books I've read as a teenager/young adult. More than Tim Burton's or Joel Schumacher's version, this Gotham looks liveable and realistic (a cross between Chicago and New York City). I also liked that Arkham Asylum was featured, as that hospital for the insane is well featured in the darker Batman comic books. There are underpinnings of psychology and insanity running through the entire comic series, so a Batman film simply isn't the same without Arkham Asylum looming in the background, foreground or anywhere else.

By the film's end, we get a hint of things to come (much like the ending of ""Spiderman 2""), which isn't bad. It might not be a ""satisfying conclusion"" for some people, but if this film makes enough money, a sequel is guaranteed. However, even though this is by far the best Batman film ever made, its dark vision and loyalty to the comic book might not go over well with parents who bring their children expecting the bright zaniness/cartoonish quality of the Joel Schumacher films. This film is the complete opposite of Schumacher's two films and that is a good thing. I believe that Schumacher is the person responsible for ruining the franchise and I'm glad Warner Brothers Studios had the good sense to wait 8 years and trust a director with ""indie cred"" to give TRUE Batman fans the film we have waited decades to see. This is that film. I even like it better than ""Spiderman"" 1 and 2, which is saying A LOT. I hope for the next ""Batman"" film, if they feature the Joker, that they base the story on what I consider the greatest Comic Book episode ever created: ""The Killing Joke"". That would make an awesome film!",1119398400,2,5007,4.749425287356321

If you're a fan of the animated series, before Robin/Nightwing and Batgirl of course, this is for you. Batman is dark, mysterious, and drives a car that looks like a Lamborghini and a tank's love child.

I'm looking forward to the next movie in this revamped series. This is how it should've started 15 years ago, except Christian Bale was probably still in elementary school back then. I hear he's also interested in sequels, so keep it coming!",1119398400,2,608,4.62037037037037
1576659,5,B00005JNJV,"This is a great new direction for Warner Bros' Batman series. It's much edgier and realistic than the previous films, and lacking much of the campiness found in ""Batman and Robin."" Christopher Nolan's incredible direction certainly shines through on this film as we see a more human side to Batman, and we explore the difficulty of managing two lives.

There were only a few flaws with this film, but they were pretty major ones. The romance between Wayne and Rachel (Katie Holmes) seemed too forced and wasn't developed enough. It was given may be 5 minutes' time in the movie and I just didn't care enough about her character or their past because I didn't know anything about it. I don't even recall them kissing in the film. This could be setting up for future films but she just felt like a character that could have been left out.

The action. There just weren't enough scenes of Batman. He was in costume for maybe 10 minutes of the movie, if that much, and it just wasn't the Batman we're used to from the comic books. Granted, this was an origin story and he's not supposed to be proficient at crime fighting, but I would like to see more of it.

Lastly, the enemies were very sub-par. Scarecrow was not very evil, and went down very easily. Ras didn't impress me much either. I don't want over-dramatic acting from Jim Carrey or Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I would like a little more evil in the film. This wasn't what I would call a ""Superhero movie."" It was more of a gritty action film that happened to have the main character in a cape some of the time.

Even with these ""flaws"" as I consider them, maybe this is why I enjoyed the film so much. It's much more believable than the past films, especially when we see Batman falter while trying to use his new gadgets or become accustomed to his new skills. This isn't a Batman that can easily get around any situation, so I respected him more. If you want a huge Bruckheimer/Bay Summer popcorn movie, you'll probably have to wait for ""War of the Worlds,"" but if you like some decent writing and want a new look at the Batman franchise, you should definitely check out ""Batman Begins.""",1119398400,,2145,4.506426735218509
1576759,5,B00005JNJV,"At first I was not very appreciative of the trailers. I was uncertain that this movie was any good. I heard from others that it was, so I saw it once and became hooked. I have seen this film three times already. Twice at a theatre down the road, and once at the Boeing Imax theatre in Seattle. I have to say that I believe this film is far superior to the previous films including the Tim Burton films.

With the introduction of CGI vs. the scale models for Burton Batman, the bar is raised considerably higher. The production design was breathtaking. I loved how Gotham is a huge metropolis( kind of a mix between New York and Chicago. Daylight does exsist in Gotham and it is not always raining.

The sound design was suberb yet a little loud. I loved the music. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard did a fantastic job potraying the emotion of the film. Take for example, Batman encounters the Scarecrow in one scene and one would think he has the upper hand. And when Batman fails, you really do feel for him and the man under the mask.

I enjoyed the fact that the filmmakers decided to make everything in Batman's arsenal plausibe, and everything serves a purpose. Some of the characters/actors that never signed on board for another film have been given an excellent way out. I suspect we will definetely see Michael Caine and Gary Oldman again.

The actors all hit their marks right on the money. I don't know what the big deal with Katie Holmes is, but eh, whatever floats your boat. I look forward to buying the DVD on the one of the best websites around.

The characters, writing, directing, acting, and plot were so bad, that fans went into shock. With Batman Begins, director Christopher Nolan has gone back to basics, jettisoning both the silliness of the TV incarnation and the gothic and fetishist elements of the '90s version. This is a hard-core, down-and-gritty origin story - the tale of, as one might reasonably expect, how Batman begins. It isn't intended as a ""prequel"" to the 1989 film, not only is Gotham City a completely different place, but key events of the Batman chronology are re-spun. Batman Begins is designed as the start of a new life, a reboot for the franchise. In the process, Nolan has not only crafted the best Batman movie, but arguably the second-best motion picture superhero narrative.

I was surprised by the approach the director took on Batman Begins, and I'm sure it was a very difficult execution, but superb craftsmanship and originality bring this Batman very lively unto the screen, although he's humanized and the origins of his ""powers"" are explained.

It didn't hurt to see familiar movie legend faces such as Liam Neeson, Michael Caine (he's everywhere these days, but that's fine), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer (from e.g. Bladerunner ... and in a sense this motion picture reminded me a little bit of Balderunner in some scenes). The twist of the story is very interesting and my 11+ year old said that it was a cool movie and he found it a little scary at times. There's plenty of action and it's the least cheesy Batman film ever made so far.

In this film you learn about the humanity of Batman, although we all know it's a fictional character, but it's interesting to say the least. Bottom line, it's well worth watching Batman Begins and this flick has an edge to it and it is more serious and darker than the previous takes on this comic book hero.",1119312000,2,1233,4.545045045045045

Eveybody by now knows the plot. Bruce Wayne is searching for answers concerning redemption and justice and meets an army of ninjas where he recieves training. Then he returns to Gotham City and finds it more corrupt than he left it. He starts to create fear among the criminal world and show them that crime does not pay. Among the chaos, he becomes Batman and must save Gotham from a diabolical villian out to destroy Gotham City.

It is a well-told story that involves Bruce Wayne and his transformation into Batman. The film is filled with high caliber actors with Christian Bale as the best Batman ever and forever!! I have seen Christopher Nolan's Memento and loved that entire story as well. He is a superb writer and director who knows how to mess with our minds.

I cannot say enough about this film except that it deserved to be nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor (anyone of them would be worthy). This film(notice I am stating film instead of a regular movie) be a sweep at the Academy.

I have never seen a superhero movie that was perfect all around!! See it NOW!!

In addition, I am getting tired of all the negative reviews of this great film. The fact that most of the negative reviews have no supporting reasons why they hate it or they didn't even see it is no excuse to dismiss it online. If you don't like Batman, that's fine, you're entitled to your opinions. But if you don't watch it, you have no reason to hate it.

This Batman movie is the best Batman movie (ranks up there with the original Superman) in terms of better writing, actors, effects, and score.

1576765,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is, without a doubt, the best movie of the franchise. Less a crowd-pleasing pop video (Batman & Robin, diak!) and much more a true disturbing, adult film, this is the best approximation of Bob Kane's comic book, if not a ""literal"" version, which I applaud.

The film, directed by genius Christopher Nolan, has at its core, the real struggle of a man who's not perfect, makes mistakes, has a lot of anger but at the same time, tries to balance all those nasty inner feelings by doing something for the ""greater good"", but as a flawed man, can't control feeling a little bit excited by tormenting other disguise as a bat (which is a little sick, but understandable).

It's complex movie, filled with contradictions that play beautifully against each other. At the core if the plot is, of course, Bruce Wayne, a multimillionaire boy that watches how his loving parents are killed by a mugger, and from that day, becomes a whirl of rage and anger. Guardian by his faithful butler, Alfred (wonderful Michael Caine), Wayne grows intensifying his guilt and hatred, until he leaves to study the natures of evil, and meets Ducard (Liam Neeson), a man who becomes his mentor and teaches him to confront his fears.

Wayne decides to return to Gotham City to fight crime and injustice, and in the process decides to use a bat as a symbol to terrorize the criminals that have plagued his natal but very corrupted city. In his fight, some allies help him (Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman's Sergeant Gordon and Katie Holmes' Rachel) in one way or other to achieve his goal, although I must say, with lots of ups and downs.

We discover why Wayne identifies with bats, why he hates evil, and this story is given to us with depth and a complex psychological background. The process itself of becoming a hero is slow and full of mistakes. Batman isn't born from one day to other. It takes painful lessons that we are pleased to see.

I didn't feel there were a lot of special effects in the movie, but I was grateful for that. Moviemakers often confuse saturation of effects with plot development, and Batman is not one of those films (Episode III is). The characters are given a lot to do to cement the storyline. And there are not cheesy love plots like the past movies, although I must say Holmes's character, though tries to be sort of a working class girl, is so irrelevant (because of her acting, it's like watching Dawson's Creek) we don't mind her fate.

Everything in this movie is dark and gritty, from the production design to the characters, and it's a welcome change. The gadgets, the batsuit, even the car is raw and not fancy modern items like they were purchased from a sharper image catalog.

In terms of acting, Bale comes strong like the caped crusader, and I can't wait to see him evolve in the next chapter. Freeman and Caine are the other two rocks of this movie, and I loved Gary Oldman vulnerable Sergeatn Gordon.

Kudos also to the screenwriter and Chris Nolan, for creating such an remarkable film and the very ultimate definition of what a superhero movie should be. I cant' wait to buy the DVD!",1119312000,4,3127,4.621621621621622
1576766,5,B00005JNJV,"Christopher Nolan, with his new Batman Christian Bale, set out to tear down the franchise as it existed in the previous four ""Batman"" films and reconstruct it anew.  They did so with great success by building the movie around the Batman character, and by building the Batman character bit by bit.

Here were the two main problems with the Batman franchise in the other four films: (1) the directors; (2) the Batmans. Pretty deadly combination. And be honest, it's true. Fans of the Batman comics despised the choice of Michael Keaton to play Batman, and I thought he actually did a better job as Batman than as a rather doddering Bruce Wayne. But he was upstaged by the villains (especially JACK) and Keaton's weak chin always detracted from the stalwart defender-of-justice Batman is supposed to be. Tim Burton did a decent job in the semi-plotless Batman, but he mailed it in on the sets and atmosphere in Batman Returns and all that rot about hiding behind masks was just a useless directorial essay inspired by a 17-year old (at that point) Billy Joel song, The Stranger. Who cared?

As for Val Kilmer -- a nondescript Batman and Bruce Wayne hampered by a cruddy director (Joel Schumacher), a poor script, an overemphasis on the man-boobs in the batsuit and a just-picking-up-my-paycheck performance by Tommy Lee Jones. So bad, I didn't even see Batman & Robin, with the over-smug George Clooney and what were reportedly the two worst performances by villains in any action movie not involving Timothy Dalton.

So the bar is not high for Batman Begins to beat any of the prior four. It does, but it does more than that. Indeed, if Batman Begins had been the first of the five Batman movies, its reputation as one of the most mismanaged comic-hero legacies would never have been made. And here's why:

First, the Batman. Christian Bale is a creepy bugger primarily because of his starring turn in American Psycho. But as a brooding, damaged and haunted Bruce Wayne, he conveys the essential roots of the Dark Knight as an avenger who will do justice better than any other on-screen Batman. Indeed, the only one who approximates Bale's heavy soul is Kevin Conroy -- the voice actor who was Batman in Batman: The Animated Series. A milquetoast Kilmer and clueless-playboy Keaton did not come anywhere near to conveying Bruce Wayne's pain or dark side; Bale hits those notes and does it well.

Second, the direction and story. Christopher Nolan essentially destroys the previous Batman movies in order to recreate the legend here. Batman begins as a rich American in a Southeast Asian wilderness who has lost his sense of himself, only vaguely knows his ultimate goal and needs a lifeline from the mysterious Henri Ducard to help him find his way. Nolan shows the decline of Gotham as it parallelled the decline of the Wayne family, the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, the child's stifling guilt and loss of his moorings, his Asian martial arts training (shown also in the animated series) and his initial fight against the corruption of Gotham. Through all this, Nolan is capable of showing the building of the basic foundation of the legend: the Batcave, the Batmobile, the Batsuit, the utility belt, and the answer to Joker's question in the 1989 Batman: ""where does he get those wonderful toys?""

Some critics complain that this is a slower, duller Batman. Not so: there's plenty of action throughout, but this really isn't a classic action movie, it's an action movie and a drama rolled into one.

Third, the villains: not merely outcasts who are oddly twisted by fluke physical transformations, the Batman Begins villains are power hungry, clever and coldly evil.

There are weaknesses: Katie Holmes is 26 but seems 21; so she's miscast as a hard-charging anti-corruption assistant DA. The motivations of the Scarecrow (one of the villains) is unexplored (although that may be fodder for another film) and there are other minor concerns.

Ultimately, however, Batman Begins is the only Batman movie that is a flat-out good movie. It deserves the sequel it will spawn.",1119312000,5,4073,4.889855072463768
1576767,5,B00005JNJV,"I think we're in for good things with the new Batman movies.  Batman Begins is epic in scope and feel.  At 2 hours and 20 minutes, a lot happens in the film.  Not only does it setup how Bruce Wayne became the Batman but it also introduces a slew of baddies and sets an epic struggle for Gotham City.  I remember as the movie ramped up to an excellent climax, sitting there and seeing everything that was happening and I wondered, THIS is the BEGINNING?  It was so well executed that it felt like the end of an epic series, rather than the beginning.

And what a beginning it is.  Taking different aspects from the comic books, Director Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer create a very realistic universe while at the same time making it thematically Batman.

The big bone of contention is probably the Batmobile which looks nothing like the comics nor any of the movies.  I happen to like it, it's a different take on it and fits into their realistic mode more than the sleek and slender car does.  The other slight problem is that Christian Bale's ""Batman voice"" gets pretty corny towards the end.  His growling at enemies, while masking his voice true, really takes away from the drama and tension of the scenes.

The villains are great as well.  Cillian Murphy (from 28 Days Later) is my favorite as the Scarecrow.  Talk about gritty and pretty frightening.  Tom Wilkinson as a mobster also was really well done.

I don't know what to say about this movie that doesn't spoil the joy found within.  All I can say is that this is the best version of Batman released yet.  It even towers above the Tim Burton Batmans that I loved back in the 90s.  It's a great new start, and Christopher Nolan isn't shying away.  Look for the gutsy calling card at the end of the film.  A very gutsy move indeed for the next villain.  Great film, great time, I doubly recommend it.  The summer movie season has finally begun.",1119312000,2,1921,4.488439306358382
1576838,5,B00005JNJV,"After being bitterly disapponted after seeing Revenge of the Sith I was half expecting to see another dismal franchise film, thankfully I was wrong.

Batman Begins is a fantastic film in most ways, it's entertaining, action packed, has a good mix of chemisty with the talent, decent plot with some twists and most importantly it has ninjas. Any films with ninjas in it can't be too bad after all.

This film is dark like the original Burton films but has a better cast, plot and overall style to it. I thought the best Batman was Micheal Keaton, however Christian Bale captures the character of moody Bruce Wayne just as well or even better than Keaton.

You can't go wrong with any film that has the acting likes of Morgan Freeman in it, like Samuel L. Jackson Freeman always delivers a certain cool and an excellent performance to ANY film he has starred in.

Gary Oldman and Liam Neeson also add to the overall effectiveness of the plot with both actors making their roles in this film their own and adding a distinct class and style to the movie.

1576840,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins, directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento), co-scripted by David Goyer (Blade Series), and starring Christian Bale, Michael Cain, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and Morgan Freeman is the spectacular release of the year so far. While Star Wars had the great visuals, Batman brings the entire batcave. The visuals are great and yet more real, adding a plausible flavor. The acting is outstanding! The story is tight and for a movie 2 hours and 20 minutes, one wants more, never feeling it is too long.

It is by far more superior to the other films. While I liked the Batman film by Burton, it has slow and silly moments, too many one liners, and actually is a Joker origins story. The other movies in the series, while satisfactory entertaining (well, not Batman and Robin), are not plot driven and too many characters take the center stage. This movie loaded with characters, support the story and one never feels that they have stolen the show from Batman.

I'm not going into the plot, other reviewers have and one should just go see the movie/dvd. Supporting films like this one encourages Hollywood to produce films with strong stories and excellent direction. This is a big budget with an arts feel, and one begins to understand Batman/Bruce Wayne.

To Batman purist (I consider myself one), this film should excel. Most true Bat fans know that in the Dark Knight's 60+ year history, he has had re-interpretations but has stayed in essence Batman. This film brings many of the different comic elements form Frank Miller, Jeph Loeb, Tim Sale to Dennis O'Neal.

This film has a strong narrative which is why so many movie critics from Roger Ebert to Jeffery Lions have complemented this film. This is a film deserving of repeat showings. Batman takes flight and never slows down until justice is brought to Gotham - let's hope Warner Nros. makes a sequal.

The second disk has plenty of extras and it is outlined in the form of a comic book.",1119225600,,1980,4.777777777777778

This film succeeds in a way that ALL of the Batman films failed, where most HOLLYWOOD films fail for that matter.  Instead of ""big stars,"" it has great actors, chief among them being Christian Bale as  Batman.

Whereas Tim Burton's films seemed obsessed with the way the films looked, Nolan cares more about plot, script, performances, and other concepts long since abandoned  by Hollywood.

Comparisons to Joel Schumacher's Batman films aren't necessary, as they were horrible.

Go see this film.  It's easily the best film of the year. Period.",1119225600,4,618,4.990196078431373
1576842,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is EVERYTHING that was the wrong with the previous series of Batman movies. It is dark. It is gritty. It has emotion and heart...  and most importantly, it rediscovers the DETECTIVE in Bruce Wayne aka Batman... something the original series COMPLETELY FORGOT and replaced with Hollywoodish one liners and sillyness.

BATMAN BEGINS takes the time to show you the man behind the mask. Why he became Batman? How the Batcave came about. It's exciting watching all the things unfold. The suit. The mask. The Batmobile. The wings. The grappling hooks. The story behind Alfred (Excellently played by Michael Caine). The back story behind the relationship between the future Commissioner Gordon who is now Detective Gordon.

Replaced is all the cartoony, goofy settings and bad guys and inserted is a dark gloomy world that lends to the reason why Bruce Wayne does what he does. Crime and corruption have gutted Gotham city from the inside out and he's on a mission to change the citys future.

The new Batman is not as KID friendly as the original series... but that is what I love about it. I'm not a kid anymore, and to be quite honest, I would have loved this as a kid anyway.

The Scarecrow is PHENOMINAL. Frightening scenes where he rears his ugly head. Tormenting the minds of his victims. Superb effects that made me say ""Awesome"" outloud in the theatre (not loud though... just enough where my girlfriend could hear me).

The only things I could possibly say negatively: Some of the fight scenes were hard to tell what was happening, because of the way it was shot (Too close), and even though I loved the early scenes in the movie, the setup, the introduction, the stories behind the mask and his tools... The movie was much more interesting once Bruce Wayne began to dawn the mask and fight crime... which wasn't till halfway or so.

Although this little catch has me wanting more when the credits roll because the movie ended in way that made me wish they were already shooting the second installment of the Batman series.

Which I can gladly say... HAS BEEN SAVED!!!!!!!",1119225600,2,2089,4.751381215469613
1576843,5,B00005JNJV,"After leaving the theather, I was one happy guy. Batman was always the coolest and most interesting comic book character to me but all of the big screen adaptations all failed in my opinion. While the first two were above average, they still were not at all like the good comics. The next two were absolutely horrid and now this one is absolutely fantastic. The acting is superb with an exceptional performance by Christian Bale as Batman. He IS the best batman. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson are superb as usual while Katie Holmes does a nice job. Cilian Murphy is perfect as Scarecrow and the mask he uses is great. The movie is good because it first introduces Batman and his training with Liam Neeson. The lines pronounced by Liam Neeson are fantastic and it shows Batman's great fear of bats. He thus must learn to conquor his fear and return to Gotham where he can fight crime. I loved the new Hummer like Batmobile and when Bale was Batman, it was perfect. The words pronounced, the anger, and the appearance of the awesome costume had me and probably the rest of the world in true glory. If you don't like Batman, you should still watch it as it is one of the year's best films. If you don't know anything about Batman, this movie explains his roots. If you are a true Batman fan, it will be by far one of your favorite movies. If you think that the movie is going to be for children, it's much more dark than the others. This is the Batamn that I've been waiting for and it isn't just good, it's one of the best movies that I've seen.",1119225600,,1560,4.382758620689655

I am anxiously awaiting the next film by Christopher Nolan, with the cast from this movie.",1119225600,2,312,4.396551724137931
1576845,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is the first truly great, instant classic film of the summer.  Forget the cartoony fiascos that were Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.  Christopher Nolan's sweeping tale of one man's quest to bring justice to a dying, corrupt city is deadlocked with Sin City as 2005's best movie.  Odd how two motion pictures inspired by the work of Frank Miller are so far the most memorable and entertaining films to hit theaters this year.

It doesn't hurt that the main focus in Batman Begins isn't gaudy set design, extravagant costumes, or a deep rooted desire to imitate; the number one priority is story.  Taking almost, if not all of, the humanizing elements of the Batman character and infusing it with an astounding balance of realism and comic book action, moviegoers the world over are in for something of a rarity, a superhero movie not dumbed down for the supposedly simple masses.  That a big budget summer blockbuster not only delivers on the action front but comes equipped with such a well written script has to be something of a studio fluke.  Hopefully a new trend in filmmaking has emerged, the smart action film.

Don't worry for all you folks just looking for slam-bang intensity, this Batman ain't no codpiece wearing wuss. From Bruce Wayne's martial arts training to the jaw dropping capabilities of the Batmobile, the onscreen fisticuffs and pyrotechincs are enough to necessitate a drool cup for any hardcore action junkie.

Batman Begins also delivers a sucker punch in the casting department.  Christian Bale gives us the most believable and downright scary Batman to date.  Michael Caine is eerily convincing as Alfred.  Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow proves his mettle and gives rise to an overall feeling of unease regarding psychiatric professionals everywhere.  Liam Neeson, although seemingly typecast in the mentor role of Henri Ducard, as always makes you believe he knows what he's talking about.  Morgan Freeman, well, he could recite Suess and it would be awesome; his Lucius Fox is way more believable (and a hell of a lot less annoying) than James Bond's Q. Katie Holmes as determined young District Attorney Rachel Dawes puts an exponential Grand Canyon gap between her and the teenybopper Dawson's Creek role that made her famous.  Tom Wilkinson as gangster Carmine Falcone proves once again that he's one of the best actors out there (don't believe me go rent In the Bedroom).  Now everyone mentioned above gives at worst an admirable turn, and this ensemble cast is a director's fantasy come true.  But there's one performance that's so surprisingly, unexpectedly good, I'd say it deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar right now.

Gary Oldman as the up and coming Gotham City police officer Jim Gordon gives the performance of his already stellar career.  In a departure from his previous psychos and deviants Oldman plays his honest cop to unerring perfection.  We feel his conflict and his discomfort as he continues on the straight and narrow in a city filled with venomous curves.  He's Batman's number one fan and also his number one ally.  Oldman plays the workingman hero, the average Joe, the family man who keeps his head down to keep his loved ones safe; he not only nails it he redefines the archetype.

Batman Begins is the must see movie of the summer.  I'm hoping word of mouth on this cinematic masterpiece will bring it well deserved box office success.  Extremely rich storytelling along with phenomenal character development should keep folks coming back.  I'm doubtful there will be a better movie released this year, at least one involving superheroes.

Parents please take note, almost the entire film revolves around the concept of fear and accordingly there are some frightening elements and intense images.  Batman Begins definitely earns its PG-13 rating, so if your little tykes have a nightmare tendency you might want to check this out first before you bring them along.",1119225600,,3948,4.995412844036697
1576846,5,B00005JNJV,"I've always believed that the original Batman was the only one that worked. It got a little too complex with Batman Returns and some of the style started to stray with that one. The less said about the next two, the better. Batman Begins was really exciting because from the first trailer I saw I knew that this was going to be the one to turn it around. Gone are the stupid sidekicks and over-the-top music (though it's a shame the batman theme from the original isn't in there).

Begins totally revamps the Batman formula, giving it a much harder and more realistic edge. The costume of batman is incredible, a lot more thought was put into it this time. The Batmobile is no longer a weird thing with fins coming off it but a real vehicle. And cool as hell. The editing is hard and fast, wrapping you up in the story and not letting you go. Acting is well done, with top-notch performances from everyone, including Christian Bale who I think did a wonderful job bringing back some dignity to the character of Bruce Wayne who had gotten a 2-D and cardboard during the last few movies. You really believe this guy could be Batman.

Villains in this are a lot more complicated in this than the other movies, at least in my opinion, because there's not just one main super-arch-nemesis. It requires a bit more thinking but doesn't detract from the film, but enhances it. Oh, thankyou Christopher Nolan! Don't you ever let Warner Bros get that Schumacher guy anywhere near Batman again!

They've got a winner on their hands here, and if they let Nolan do another it'll mean big things for the Batman franchise. I can't wait for the DVD and for the inevitable sequel. Keep it coming.",1119225600,,1679,4.534653465346534
1576847,4,B00005JNJV,"First off, I'll tell you that I saw ""Batman Begins"" on an IMAX screen in NYC, my hometown.  I mention this because maybe the film would get a different reaction had I saw it on a ""regular"" movie screen, although I doubt it.  I believe I'd love this film even on a crappy 13"" B&W TV with mono sound.  Nevertheless, the fact that I ""experienced"" it in what I suppose are State of the Art conditions certainly didn't hurt.  I won't spend much time with plot recaps, since I figure that unless you've been living in the Batcave for a while, you know well enough what it is we're discussing.

Since the last Bat-movie, ""Batman & Robin,"" which I believe qualifies as the worst movie ever made, I actually hoped never to hear from Gotham City's favorite facsist vigilante ever again, but then I read that the director would be Christopher Nolan, whose ""Memento"" was an astounding mindbender of a noir, I allowed myself to hope.  My hope is confirmed big-time by this film, which burns the previous franchise to the ground and gets us back to basics, telling the story of just how poor little orphaned billionaire Bruce Wayne got in the habit of dressing like a nocturnal flying rodent and fighting crime in the first place, concentrating on his training.  Somewhere in mountainous Asia (Nepal, maybe?) he joins a mysterious group called the League of Shadows, led by the really mysterious Ra'as Al Ghul, played by Ken Watanabe.  He trains as a ninja with Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) then splits when he finds out he must commit a murder to officially enter (I guess a simple fee wouldn't do).  Back in Gotham, Bruce comes up with a really kick-butt fashion statement...and you can guess the rest.

Nolan's vision for the veteran comic book crusader would work even if you had never before heard of ""Batman"" or known any of the accumulated mythologies.  This is a dark, gritty tale of a PERSON who becomes a crime fighter and not the other way around.  We get a real idea of who this Bruce Wayne is, and that's where our sympathies lie.  His obsessive need to control his childhood traumas and the external forces he believes caused them are what drives this story instead of gaudy action sequences.  Of course there's no shortage of that either; a car chase across the city proves especially effective and the fight scenes have the grace and speed of the finest Asian martial arts movies.  If I must nitpick, the climactic action sequence features editing that is so fractured and rapid that it's like watching the trailer; it's almost incomprehensible.

Then there are the performances.  Christian Bale, who lost more than 60 pounds just for his role in ""The Machinist,"" has buffed up physically but stays wounded and bruised psychically.  This is one messed up superhero; he can't connect with anybody unless it's on his terms.  The real star of the show for me, though, is Michael Caine as loyal butler Alfred, whose class, dry humor and Cockney accent let him steal every scene he's in.  Morgan Freeman, who gets the most laughs but also the most respect as Wayne's tech guru proves that he could play Q in the next Bond flick, if they were smart enough to cast him.  Katie Holmes, a.k.a the Bride of Cruise, can't escape her basic sweetness but is tough enough to play Gotham's last honest District Attorney.

Now a few notes on IMAX.  If you haven't seen the film yet, and live in an area with an IMAX screen, I heartily reccomend seeing it there.  The picture is enormous but crystal clear and the surround sound is terrific; in a scene where people are chattering in the background, I thought for a second that it was rude people in the audience!  Since IMAX theatres are by nature stadium seating patrons with big hair were no problem.  Best of all: no commercials and only one preview!  True, it costs a couple of bucks more, but it's well worth it.  If only all movies could be shown this way, instead of short documentaries and big Hollywood Blockbusters.

""Batman Begins"" is one Hollywood Blockbuster that deserves your full support, though.  Don't wait for DVD!  (If you do however, I have an idea where you can buy it...)",1119225600,,4128,4.644628099173554
1576948,5,B00005JNJV,"As a long time fan of Batman I have longed to see a big screen Batman that displayed the depth and power of the character I had come to enjoy while reading: Batman: Year One, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: The Long Halloween, Batman: The Killing Joke.

I longed for a Batman movie where Batman was not overshadowed by the villians he fights. When I first heard about this movie I almost screamed in pain, expecting another Joel Schuemacher insult to Batman. A movie that had more in common with the campy Adam West series of the 60's then the character I had come to enjoy in the comic books.

Walking in with no expectations I was blown away by what I saw. Here was a movie that not only reached the dark, film noir levels of Tim Burton's original Batman, but reached even farther. I could almost see flashes of Frank Miller in the script with I'm sure fans of Batman: Year One will recognize and enjoy.

I know some people don't like how the fight scenes were shot in this film, but I think they were perfect. You don't get to see all of Batman's style, but it makes the fights seem more real. Like you are there trying to follow a real fight between Batman and the thugs of Gothman's underworld. It highten's the drama, and makes the movie seem less like just another hollywood action film with crisp easy to see fights. If there is a sequel I implore Chris Nolan to leave the fight scenes like he did in this movie.

Batman Begins is filled with great performance from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Nieson, and Gary Oldman. But not even that all-star supporting cast can steal the light from Christian Bale. As Batman he delievers the sharp obessiveness that I had come to look for in Batman. For that is the Key in my mind to Batman, Bruce Wayne died the night his parents died, and in the pain of that night Batman was born.",1119225600,3,1846,4.388888888888889
1576949,3,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Returns"" may satisfy aficionados, but it it won't create converts.  As a comic book adaptation, it is average.  Those who are not particularly enthusiastic about the genre will most likely just watch as the movie goes by, unwilling to be fully drawn in to the fantasy universe of Gotham City in ""Batman Begins"".

The special effects are decent and the City looks real.  The acting, however, particularly on the part of Christian Bale, is near non-existent.  As for the training sequences, the story is bland, stale and sometimes unexplained.  The fight choreography fails to impress, as the editing is too heavy-handed.

Unlike the rest of the Batman series the script of ""Begins"" tells the story of Batman as a boy.  The story of Boy Bruce Wayne is in line with the movie as a whole, as it is interesting in some some regards and unconvincing in many others.",1119225600,3,867,4.771812080536913

In fact, unlike any of the previous films, this one centers on Bruce Wayne and his evolution into Batman.  He doesn't even appear in costume until halfway through the movie.

Batman Begins is dark, intense, and completely faithful to the source material.  Christian Bale nails the parts of Batman and Bruce Wayne perfectly.  It also doesn't hurt that the supporting cast is stellar, featuring names like Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Katie Holmes, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson and Michael Kaine.  The story flows fast and fierce, with few slow points.  There is even a perfect segue into a possible sequel in the movie's final scene.

This movie comes with my highest possible recommendation.",1119225600,2,1008,4.808139534883721

It's those kinds of showings that really mark what Batman is to me. I just figured I'd put that out there before I got into Batman Begins.

First off, the cast was well chosen but... the villains weren't really how I thought they should have been. I loved the supernatural feel through Batman: T.A.S. and this was... well... a bit too much like a real life sort of thing. The car was also a little disappointing and in a way... just made it one of the things that made me want to say ""This isn't Batman, it's a character in a suit saying he's Batman"". OK, onto things I liked. Gary Oldman. He did a good job of playing Gordon because he was someone you could tell wanted to do his job right. That's what Gordon is supposed to be about. One of the few good cops in a corrupt city. Next... the batcave. I really do prefer the new cave over the last ones. It's a lot more realistic and more... well... cave. There shouldn't be more technology than cave in my opinion, regardless of how much cash you have. Also to put it out there... *SPOILER, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET* I had a dream that I was Bruce Wayne and I burned my house down and rebuilt it. I had that dream before I knew anything about the movie. So... it's weird that it happened in the movie. Really weird.",1119225600,3,1453,4.226618705035971

X-men really started a new craze in Hollywood by being a super hero movie that was actually enjoyable. Spiderman continued the new fad. Yes, there are still failures in the super hero movie world, The Hulk, Punisher, etc. But, this latest venture into comic book reality is amazing. Batman Begins is Premium Super Hero Movie Making!

Not since Tim Burton had the helm in the first Batman has a Batman movie been this good. Better yet, this movie might actually be better than Burton's vision. Christian Bale might never be better than Keaton as Batman, but for the time being Bale is the best we have. And truthfully there could not be a better choice for the Dark Knight.

There are small instances of comic humor in this movie, but for once, reality prevails in a comic book movie. This movie looks and feels great. The effects are state of the art, the bat-gadgets are actually believable and have a hint of science behind them, and the action isn't totally ridiculous (i.e. the Mighty Morphin ""Batman and Robin"")

Even though he is a little underdeveloped, but it still works, because it is a movie about Bruce Wayne!!
  Even the Tim Burton films lack what Batman is really about.  If you watch the first Batman movie now you will see that it is cheesy, like the corny Joker.

1576956,5,B00005JNJV,"I have not been so wowed by a movie in decades! Just about everything was right --  plot, script, dialog, tone, characters, acting, special effects, you name it. Christian Bale was completely convincing as a young man struggling with the inner demons acquired when his parents were gunned down by a thug. He was perfectly played Bruce Wayne's cover story as a spoiled and shallow boy billionaire. Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon of the Gotham PD was also spot on -- making Gordon a believable and sympathetic figure as opposed to the buffoonish one we might have expected. Even Michael Caine, as Alfred, pulled more out of himself as an actor than in his last 5 films.

""Batman Begins"" gives us a new take on the genesis of the Caped Crusader -- from Bruce Wayne's childhood (when after a well into a well, he was attacked by frightened bats), to ""the missing years"" when he salved the guilt and rage over his parents' murders by hanging with criminals, to his return to Gotham, his discovery of the Batcave, and the development of his costume and Batmobile (thankfully never called such in the movie). It was genius not to lay the development of Wayne's martial arts skills AND incredible gizmo invention on one man. Morgan Freeman, as science guru Lucius Fox handled that task flawlessly. And the scriptwriters came up with some truly frightening bad guys whose evil plot (a weapon of mass psychosis) was truly inspired and frightening. Gotham -- a twisted take on NYC -- never looked so seedy, corrupt or hopeless.

This was an incredibly well-crafted movie -- with special effects always in the service of the story. The scriptwriters tied up every loose know and left no details hanging. The plot spun around like a cave full of bats, turning back onto itself in delicious spirals. An incredible achievement!",1119225600,,1806,4.80064308681672

But Christopher Nolan finally got the feeling of a Batman movie right.  And Christian Bale was very good as Bruce Wayne.  We didn't get to see much of Batman after all.

But the movie was too predictable and the storyline boring, and just a little too star-studded which came off as pompous.  I can only imagine where all these 5-star reviews are coming from: the 15 - 23 age group.

It was not a great movie.  The evil bad guy was obvious since they wouldn't knock out a big star from the plot like that so early.  Katie Holmes was so boring and lackluster as the girlfriend, truly whiny and dull.  She's no Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman that's for sure.",1119225600,7,672,4.3983739837398375
1577028,4,B00005JNJV,"I think it's obvious by now that the majority of Batman fans are declaring ""Batman Begins"" as the best film in the franchise. I'll second that. Tim Burton's first 2 Batman films were good in their own right, but oftentimes too twisted and bizarre. And I won't even comment on the piles of excrement that were ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin."" But Christopher Nolan has awaken this franchise from the coma it was in with ""Batman Begins."" His vision of Batman, Gotham City, atmosphere, etc. is what we've all been waiting for. I knew very little about Christian Bale prior to seeing this movie, but I thought he did a fantastic job as Batman, while playing the superhero as well as playing Bruce Wayne. All of the supporting cast were impressive as well although Morgan Freeman was rather underused.

But despite my high praise for this movie, I did have an issue with something, which bothered me enough to knock off a star from my review...no memorable villains. The majority of the bad guys in this movie are either corrupt crime bosses or average-citizen slimy thugs. This is a Batman film after all...we want to see villains with novelty superpowers, powers that equal those of Batman. Powers that will challenge Batman. Unfortunately, Batman is able to get rid of all villains (or should I say, thugs) in this movie way too easily. Most of them don't even put up a fight! The only somewhat-memorable villain is of course The Scarecrow, and his character is definitely cool. The special effects used in his fright scenes were magnificent. However, he is given very little screen time. I also found his character highly under-developed and one-dimensional. He is gotten rid of too easily, and Batman isn't even the one who does it. We also have Batman's former trainer (Liam Neeson) showing up at a later point in the movie and becoming a villain, but that doesn't go anywhere other than an obligatory fight sequence that's uninspiring. I really think this movie short-changed us in the villain department. But I have high hopes for the sequel, now that we know that The Joker will be making his appearance.

But I will reiterate that ""Batman Begins"" is an all-around awesome movie. The PG-13 rating is very appropriate; the kiddies will probably be scared by many scenes. And this movie is LOUD. Then again, that's one of the thrills of seeing it on the big screen. All in all, a great film.",1119225600,2,2401,4.755395683453237
1577029,4,B00005JNJV,"The previous incarnation of the Batman franchise crashed and burned upon release. I was self-hating enough to catch the truly abysmal Batman and Robin on the big screen in Summer 1997. My expectations were low, but I was still gobsmacked at how bad the movie was. So bad, in fact, that Warner let the franchise cool for 8 years before rebooting. It was a long time for a cash cow to lie dormant, but Batman and Robin really was THAT bad.

Christopher Nolan brings the character out of the gaudy, cartoonish world of Joel Schumacher and into reality for the story of Batman's origin. I'm quite sick of every single comic-book hero getting an origin story instead of just throwing us in at the deep end. The 1989 Batman didn't bother with origins and was able to further the plot without it. Despite the 140 minute run-time the plot of Batman Begins is side-tracked and 'last minute' when compared to the rest. Everything builds up to the last act but there's no consistent hook. Nolan also does himself favors, as well as shooting himself in the foot, by the naturalization of the character. The gorgeous anamorphic Panavision photography looks absolutely stunning, but I do miss the oppressive, German expressionist vision Gotham from the Tim Burton movies.

The wide cast of actors all do well with their roles, despite getting relatively little screen time between them, though I never felt close to any of them. As with all Nolan films they're all so serious and straight it's hard to see a real human being behind them. I only ever see them as a plot function and never anyone I can identify with or recognize. The film is just too slick and confident. There are no rough edges, which I think would have made it much grittier.

It's a good film, and light years ahead of Schumacher's embarrassment, but it's not as brilliant as the sycophants proclaim it to be.

The Blu Ray features a stunning 1080p 2.40:1 picture with Dolby TrueHD sound and plenty of features.",1119225600,2,1967,4.6927536231884055

I was really surprised after the attempts to make these movies with the comic feel that they went back to the dark script and sets.

Christian Bale was a great Batman; he was dark, upset about his parents. It was a great balance. I also really enjoyed the relationships that you were able to understand more: Bruce & his Parents, Rachel (Could have done without), Alfred, and Lut. Gordon. It was create to know the story and watch as they set them selves us for what we all know is coming.

1577031,5,B00005JNJV,"After seeing the last three awful Batman movies I had to be coaxed to see this one.  I was very glad that I went.  This is not only by far the best Batman movie I have seen but the best comic adaptation film outside of the Spiderman movies!

What always bothered me about Batman and my main sticking point with the Michael Keaton film was that he had all this elaborate equipment and this super high-tech batcave and it was never explained how he got it.  Also, you wondered how nobody would be able to figure out who he was, especially the person who built the batmobile in that movie.  Finally, we have a movie that explains everything and does it well.

Also, Batman doesn't appear till more than halfway through the movie and we don't really care.  The character of Bruce Wayne is fascinating and the director did such a good job of telling the murder of Wayne's parents that it was difficult to watch the scene without crying yourself.

Liam Neeson is super in this film as a teacher to a troubled Bruce Wayne, schooling him in Ninjitsu and other fighting arts.  Morgan Freeman is excellent as an employee of Wayne Enterprises who was pushed aside after the senior Wayne was murdered and who is in charge of a lot of R&D military equipment that he provides for Bruce.  And of course Michael Caine makes a super Alfred!  Then there is ""Sargent"" Gordon, who seems to be one of the few non-corrupt police officers that Batman immediately identifies as someone he can trust for help.

There are many memorable scenes in the film, especially where Bruce is making his first batarang and designing the Batman suit.  The city looks a lot more realistic than any of the previous films (even though it doesn't look like the Gotham of the comics) as does the bat signal (it appears in the sky distorted, as it should).

I hope the director can do as well with a sequel and not be tempted to go off on the ""camp"" road that the other series of Batman films followed.",1119225600,,1959,4.466292134831461
1577032,5,B00005JNJV,"I've always been a fan of the Batman series. Tim Burton created films with dark undertones and flamboyent villains. After he and Keaton left, the series became extremely epic if losing some of its apeal. I was beginning to think the series would never recover.

Even in the Burton days, however, I always felt that something was missing from the series. The movies were great looking with great action, but they seemed to have a huge difficulty understanding why and how a rich orphan would be compelled to vigilante justice and dress like a flying mammal. When asked why in 1989's Batman, Wayne stated ""Because no one else can."" I liked the movie, but that just sounds like a bored writer taking the easy way out.

Christopher Nolan, in this latest and greatest installment, has made an entire film on the premise of that question. He provides a deeper look into Bruce Wayne, who in the previous films was shown as a bored billionaire who wants to make some halfassed contribution to society by buying gadgets and hanging junkies off rooftops. Now, he's a tortured sole who comes to the realization that before he can exorcise Gotham's demons he has to exorcise his own.

The film opens in a Tibetan prison where Wayne has confined himself so he can fight the inmates. When a hulking Asian goon informs him, ""This is Hell and I am the devil,"" Bruce nonchalantly replies, ""You're not the devil. You're practice,"" before unleashing his rage onto him and five other inmates. The guards lock him up for protection, but Bruce insists he needs none. ""Not yours, theirs!""

He is recruited by the League of Shadows and journeys into his own fears that he might turn it against the villains of Gotham. He is trained by Liam Neeson, who reveals harsh truths about his society, justice, and his past, ""Your parents' death wasn't your fault...it was your father's!"" Nolan delivers these philosophies as devoutly as DeMill delivered the Ten Commandments, but when Wayne's training ends, he realizes that the League is no less corrupt than the villains they fight.

He returns to Gotham having destroyed the League's headquarters, killed all its members, and been declared legaly dead after an eight year absence. He returns to a city that is not only corrupt and run down, but in denial. One of the things I loved about the film was the fact that it took time to develop Gotham's history. It never fully recovered from the Depression that hit it twenty years earlier, the city's worst criminals are running the show, and a deranged psychiatrist conducts unnatural experiments at Arkham Asylum.

Bruce struggles to gain the necessary compontents to make Batman a reality while still maintaining a playboy persona to avoid suspicion. He slowly masses his resources while immediately plunging into war against an entire city of enemies. By the end of the film little has actually gotten better, but Gotham has a symbolic hope from their new hero. Bruce Wayne, however, has disappeared. He is a mask that Batman wears.

This film is not afraid to delve into the true nature of the basest of human emotions and conditions. It provides honesty and realism to a genre that so often lacks it. The questions are not easy, but the answers are even harder.

1577035,4,B00005JNJV,"After 16 years of bad Batman movies, BATMAN BEGINS is a quite a refreshing flick. It is exciting and intense and boasts terrific characterization and themes. Arguably the best thing about the movie is simply the style with which it is approached. The movie examines the character of Batman and sort of asks the question: What would it take to be Batman? The film is visually impressive as well, including some very nice scenery and interesting contrast. The action is also exciting, but it emphasizes adrenaline and movement over what actually happens (my dad complained heavily about that).

  The biggest disappointment of the movie is not so much a problem as a shortcoming. At the beginning of the movie, as we begin to examine the character of Batman, we are given some interesting observations and conversations about fear. Batman has to face his fears, etc., etc. Therefore, it just makes sense that the Scarecrow would be among the villians Batman must face. Unfortunately, the writers did not make use of this wrinkle that could have been very well executed. After we find out about the Scarecrow, there is no further use of fear as a theme when we could have had Batman having to face his fears and confront the Scarecrow, proving himself a worthy crime-fighter.

  Despite this shortcoming, the movie is extremely entertaining and is easily the best Batman movie yet. I hope for more in the style of this one.",1119139200,,1420,4.847107438016529

I also like the James-Bondish way Bruce assembles the techno gadgetry that becomes the Batman suit, utility belt, etc.  And it is fun seeing the origins of the Bat Cave, the Bat Signal (in the sky), etc.  The acting is also solid, especially by Bale, Caine, and Freeman.  Howver, I had a problem with the main villain, R'as Al gul.  His motivations made no sense to me.  The secondary villain, Scarecrow, was a little better.  Another problem was that in most of the fight scenes, Wayne/Batman was just a blur - I really couldn't make out much of what was going on.  I could understand the use of the blurry-action style to show Batman's quickness, but it was ineffective for me.

1577138,5,B00005JNJV,"I've never been much of a comic book fan, but there have definitely been superheroes that have intrigued me over the years.  From the Marvel universe, I have found myself drawn to the character of Spider-man, while DC's Batman is my favorite hero from that universe.  So far, both of those heroes have gotten (for the most part) great film adaptions.  Both Spider-man movies have been amazing, while the Batman films under the directorship of Tim Burton have been great.  The third one was enjoyable (to me at least), while the fourth was terrible; a very campy thing in the vein of the 60's TV show.  So I guess that any halfway decent Batfilm would look good after that flop, so the fact that Batman Begins is in fact great (possibly my new favorite Batman movie) is all the better.

This movie has effectively restarted Warner Bros.'s Batman franchise.  Robin hasn't shown up yet, James Gordon (Gary Oldman) is still only a lieutenant, and the Joker is still a petty criminal (nowhere near his status as the Clown Prince of Crime).  Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), the son of Gotham City's greatest benefactors, has been spending time in prison in order to beat on the criminals housed within.  A two-bit thug killed his parents right before eyes when he was just a kid, and he wanted revenge, but circumstances prevented it.  Now his anger drives him to attack criminals of all kinds in order to avenge his parents.  Soon however, he meets a mysterious man named Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) he introduces Wayne to the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanbe) and he begins training Wayne martial arts and dramatic theatrics.  This training allows Wayne to manipulate the fears of his enemies and become a crusader against crime in Gotham City, which has degenerated into a crime-ridden hell where gangsters like Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) run everything.  In a way, it's almost poetic that the film was shot in Chicago, seeing as how some friends of mine see Gotham as a parallel to Chicago, if things had gone differently back in the 30's (and hey, they refer to Gotham as ""man's greatest city"", which accurately describes Chicago).

Upon his return to Gotham, Wayne moves back in with his childhood butler, Alfred Pennysworth (Michael Caine), and reunites with his old friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), who is now an assistant District Attorney.  He also meets up with Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman), who is a sort of Q type character who provides Wayne with all of his bat-gadgets, including the batarangs, the body armor in the batsuit, the cape, and the batmobile (which is still awesome, even though it's an SUV instead of a sports car).

Aside from Ra's Al Ghul, we also get the Scarecrow/Dr. Jonathon Craine (Cillian Murphy) in the villains department.  Since he's one of my three favorite Batvillains (the others being the Joker and the Riddler), I was very happy to see him in this film.  I think that the Scarecrow can be pretty cool if done right, and this movie definitely did him justice (unlike Two-Face or Mr. Freeze in some of the older films).  The only thing is that they didn't really go into his backstory, which I find interesting.  However, this movie was already 2 1/2 hours long, and the main focus was on Batman himself.  This is actually the first Batman movie where Batman was the star of the film!  In all of the previous ones, the villains were the ones who got more attention; in the first Batman, Jack Nicholson even got top billing over Michael Keaton, even though Keaton played Batman and Nicholson played the Joker.

The main theme of the story was fear (which made the Scarecrow a very appropriate villain).  It was about mastering fear, using fear to fight, and using fear to destroy.  For those of you who don't know, the Scarecrow developed a serum that induces a paniced state in people who breathe it in, forcing them to see the things that they fear most, which led to some pretty cool sequences.

It was pretty cool to actually see Wayne discover and prepare the batcave for use, along with being trained, both of which were passed over in the original Batman movie.  In that one, Wayne was already Batman, and while we know that his parents were killed, we never saw all the hell that he went through to go from Bruce Wayne to Batman.  In Begins, however, we see all the torture that occured that had to happen in order to create the Dark Knight.

For a comic book movie, the acting was exceptionally good.  Caine, Freeman, Murphy, and Neeson did the best in my opinion, in their respective roles.  Bale did a great Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Gary Oldman was great as a good guy (no, I am not lying; Gary Oldman plays a good guy in this movie).  Holmes was fair, but her good looks made up it.

But the love story with Rachel the DA played by Katie Holmes is flaccid and wastes a lot of the film. The ""face your fear"" lectures made my eyes roll more than a few times.

Most of all, the style was all over the place. At times realistic; other times hyperreal in the best sense like the masterpiece film Sin City, Batman Begins ultimately was a pastiche of cliches and empty chase scenes.

Problem 3, the allstar cast. Did anyone else get the feeling that the big stars were casted just to have their name added on the credits? There was no reason to have Morgan Freeman in his small part, Katie Holmes didn't impress me, Rutger Hauer was good but wasted in such a small role, Michael Caine (of the original Italian Job 1969) wasn't a spectacular Alfred, Liam Neeson (of Rob Roy 1995) was very good as Batmans tutor, but I hated that part of the plot, and Christian Bale (one of my favorite actors from American psycho 2000) was a good Batman, but not as good as the original keaton.

This film was okay, but not as good as the original 1989 Burton film. Yes, it's a return to a darker Batman, but it's a very boring Batman with very few if any interesting characters. One character I liked was Scarecrow and the actor who played him, but there wasn't enough scarecrow. As soon as Scarecrows plot got interesting it was over and replaced by a boring plot involving the ninjas and a water vaporizor.

Anyone remember the Saturday night live skit with Christopher Walken were he plays a record producer, and he is asking for more cowbell? Well, Im asking for more Scarecrow. I have a flu and the only cure is more scarecrow. Jokes aside, the film was a bit of a letdown.

(update 6/25/05)
I knew alot of people would be so desperate for a good batman that they would lie to themselves and say this movie is great. In my opinion, you can take this film and throw it in the overrated garbage bin! It's retarded people like you (the ones who like this movie), who are killing American mainstream movies. You keep settling for garbage and that's what you will keep getting. morons!

A sequel is already in the works. Well, pump it out quick while there is people still desperate and stupid enough to see this Hollywoood garbage.

Hey, anyone remember the days when movies were made to entertain people instead of making fast money from a desperate public?

1577143,5,B00005JNJV,"""Batman Begins,"" superbly directed by Christopher Nolan, is a film that works on many levels, but above all, it makes a modern hero relevant again, much like Sam Raimi's spidey flicks.  We all knew Batman was awesome, we just needed to realize it again.  And no one could have done that better than Christian Bale, who was born to play the Dark Knight.  Exuding equal parts menace and wounded heart, he makes Bruce Waynes' familiar fear, anger and rage fresh again.  His fear and guilt stemming from his beloved parents murder is palpable and real.  At first, Bruce Wayne is in a Chinese prison, on a lifes' quest to understand the criminal mind, and how best to fight them and rid himself of the guilt that has haunted him for years. From this, a mysterious stanger named Ducard (Liam Neeson) plucks him and takes him into the Himlayan Mountains,  where he trains Bruce the ways of the League of Shadows, led by the nefarious Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, given too little screen time).  Their goal is to purify the world through by purging it of wickedness.  Bruce jets the League when he is faced with the execution of a suspected criminal and makes his way back to Gotham where he seeks redemption by saving the city his father loved, now overrun by gansters and corruption, most of it personified in Carmine Falcone (a commanding Tom Wilkinson).  Working with his beloved butler Alfred (a heartfelt Michael Caine) and good cop Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, in a role that finally gives Gordon something to do), Bruce goes to work to renovate the caverns underneath his house, collects hardware from scientist Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman at his wryest and loosest) and builds a batsuit with which to turn his fear into a weapon against his enemies.

From the beginning, ""Batman Begins"" is fixated on fear, and how it can move or change a person.  One of the main villians is the Scarecrow (a creepy Cillian Murphy) a psychologist who scares the living crap out of people using a toxin that makes the person see what they fear most.  And Batman must fight them all by using his skills of manipulation to defeat them.  And although director Nolan leans a little too much on the jump cuts and close-up shots, the action scenes are among the brawniest, most bracing and innovate in recent memory, including an amazing car chase feauturing the souped up Batmobile and a climatic monorail fight between Batman and some old enemies from the League of Shadows.  But above all, Nolan and fellow screenwriter David Goyer focus on the characters an motivations in the bat story.  And even though the ending begs a sequel, the indulgence can be allowed.  After all, after resurrecting the Batman franchise in such rousing fashion, who can't wait for the next of Batman?",1119139200,5,2754,4.7301255230125525
1577144,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman has been brought back to full life and over powers all the rest except the fist one, because I'm still a fan of the first Batman but this one is purely fun and exciting with satisfaction written all over it. Christian Bale (American Psycho) jumps into the role as Bruce Wayne, who has had a fear of bats all his life. His father Thomas Wayne, played by actor Linus Roache (The Forgotten) and his wife were killed by a thug. Wayne grows up in the hands of Alfred Pennyworth, played superbly by Michael Caine (Get Carter). Years later the thug that killed his parents is found not guilty and is shot coming out of the court room. So, Bruce Wayne turns to the life of crime and ends up in a prison camp where later he meets a man named Henri Ducard, played nicely by Liam Neeson (Kingdom Of Heaven), who tells Bruce Wayne that he can become a ""legend"". So, Bruce Wayne goes to the temple of Ra's Al Ghul, played by Ken Wantanabe (The Last Samurai), and begins his training but Ra's Al Ghul has devious things in plan which Wayne doesnt want to be apart of, so Wayne fights his way out of there saving Ducard's life. So, Wayne returns from being gone 7 years and his father's company being run by another man, who is played by Rutger Hauer (Sin City). Plus, Gotham City is corrupt all over by the hands of Falcone, played with a overhammed Tom Wilkinson (Rush Hour). Wayne's childhood sweetheart Rachel, played by Katie Holmes (The Gift) is on the verge of getting rid of Falcone and his scum. Enter Dr. Jonathan Crane, played with balls by Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later), who puts on a orangish sack over his face spraying his victims with a powder substance that the victim can see what they fear....his villain name is called The Scarecrow. Soon, Wayne becomes Batman...a very buff Batman with help from his father's friend Lucious Fox, a very groovy Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) and Wayne also has the help from cop Cheif Gordon, played by Gary Oldman (State Of Grace). Soon, Wayne finds out that the baddies are trying to poison the water supply and an old friend is behind it all. Fast, fierce and exciting....much, much better then 1997's Batman and Robin which was a big disappointment with the Batman suit having nipples and Clooney's unconvincing performance. Bale makes his role his own putting a twist on it and he works it out perfectly. Also starring Mark Boone Juinor (Se7en) as Gordon's corrupt partner.",1119139200,,2430,4.575688073394495
1577145,5,B00005JNJV,"Let me just start by saying that Batman Begins is not only the best Batman movie ever made, it's also the best movie of the year. Batman Begins goes for a really dark gothic look with director Christopher Nolan (Memento) looking deep into the Dark Knight's life before he became a hero. Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne/Batman and he is absolutly perfect for the role, Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce's butler, is played by Michael Caine, Gary Oldman plays Sargent Gordon, Katie Holmes plays Bruce's love interest Rachel, Liam Neelson plays Henri Ducard, the man who trained Bruce while he was in Asia and the science whiz Lucius Fox is played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. It's been nearly seven years since Bruce Wayne left Gotham City disgusted by the corrupt society. He goes to train with a man by the name of Henri Ducard, and meets the sinister Ra's A Ghaul (Ken Wantabe, The Last Samurai). He must face all of his darkest fears including his parent's death and his fear of bats. After his training is over he heads back to Gotham to restore justice to the people. But as Bruce returns he sees that Gotham is more corrupt then ever and he must strike fear into his enemies, thus the Batman is born. When a mob boss who Batman has apprehanded goes mentally unstable, the Scarecrow is to blame. With a great story with many twists and turns, Batman Begins is defiantly a movie that shouldn't be missed by Bat-Fans and people who are just looking for a great film.",1119139200,3,1462,4.626923076923077
1577146,5,B00005JNJV,"Just to make it clear some other reviews are saying that they dislike this movie and it alters things in the Batman universe and that it all feels a little strange changing or challenging what we already know.

The only problem with this is that the reviews making this kind of idiotic statement are taking the original batman movies (by Tim Burton) as gospel and saying that changes to there earlier series of movies is of putting is simply ridiculous. For example in Batman Begins it is Joe Chill, as in the comics, who killed Bruce Wayne's parents not the Joker. The fact that this movie stays true to the source material should be applauded not question by no nothings who give it 3star reviews for challenging their myopic view of the caped crusader.

I was a huge fan of the first two Tim Burton movies but the time as finally come to relegate them to the third and forth spot as greatest batman movies with Batman Begins edging out the superb Mask Of the Phantasm in to second place.

As a fan of Batman and movies in general if another comic adaptation reaches these heights again I will be very impressed.",1119139200,2,1114,4.5049504950495045
1577147,5,B00005JNJV,"I loved this movie. ""Batman Begins"" has done something other movies have failed to do in my opinion, it lived up to it's expectations.!!!!!!

Words can't describe how the good the movie was except it was excellent. I knew this movie was going to be good when I saw the cast list: Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, the question mark seemed to be Christian Bale could he pull of the biggest role of his career? The answer to that movie fans is yes!!!

Bale is somewhat underrated, he's appeared in some good movies and some stinkers but this movie interviews he did for ""Batman Begins"" on Access Hollywood, I knew he could do He was sincere and serious about making a good impression and he did on them some. He underwent some serious training to get into the role and it definitely shows on screen. Bale did an excellent job!!!

Liam Neeson who I praised on ""Kingdom of Heaven"" likewise comes through with another memorable but short roles as Ducard, the man who takes Bruce Wayne under his wing and makes him a fighting machine.

With Ducard's help, Bruce Wayne (Bale) is able to come into grips about the murders of his parents, something that was eating away at him and destroying him. Through Ducard and Alfred's (Michael Caine) guidance, we see the origins of the Batman starting to come through until his Metamorphis in Gotham City is complete.

Plotwise the movie title says it ""Batman Begins"" we see the origins of Batman/Bruce Wayne in detail from childhood to adult as he grows from a child coping with the death of his parents to a man possessed by his own destiny to rid the world evil and battle the demons inside him.

Then comes the real challenge for Wayne as he faces the corruption and violence that is overtaking the city. Sure we've seen this in the other Batman movies but what sets this one apart from the other ones, is the acting, the character development, in Bruce Wayne's growth as a man as he struggles within his demons, the psychological battles he plays with himself.

Enter Katie Holmes who plays Rachel Dawes , Waynes love interest and Batman's love interest, a good girl being caught in some bad company. You know Wayne loves her but he is still dealing with issues, becoming the Batman then provides an avenue for Bruce to get closer to Rachel while protecting her at the same time.

Cilliam Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow, is also excellent, he actually seems like an insignificant foe but once he's alter ego shows on the scree, it's a different story. Ken Watanabe as the other important figure Ra's Al Ghul who aids Wayne's training is good and last but not ;least Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox who basically gives the first look at the creation that is the Batmobile is excellent.

Director Christopher Nolan not only deserves a pat on the back for his excellent adaptation of the comic book character but a hug from every comic book fan whose been wanting a respectable version of the ""Dark Knight"" for quite some time.

This movie had heart, it was gritty, it was dramatic, and Batman wasn't a stupid a cartoon cutout like George Clooney's stupid portrayal but he was a man, a real man with real problems and issues, and above you liked it, you really him We sympathized with Bale's portrayal as Wayne, and we cheer as he goes through his whole training until he becomes the Dark Knight and imprints his legacy as the defender of justice and truth.

I can't say anymore about this movie except it's perhaps the best if not the best Batman movie ever made, at the same level if not surpassing the original by Tim Burton.

Go see it now and enjoy!!!!",1119139200,,3610,4.597200622083982
1577218,3,B00005JNJV,"This is a new direction for the Batman franchise. Forget all about the 40's & 60's style Batman, and also, forget about the direction Tim Burton took it in the 80's & 90's.

Batman has been re-worked, re-thought, re-sculpted, and pretty much all that remains from the other Batmans is charactors names. So forget all you have come to be familliuer with in the Batman sagas, and accept this movie as starting a fresh new approach that obviously will start a chain reaction of sequels to come.

The movie kicks off alternating between past, present and in between. It shows how Bruce Wayne discovered the Batcave, how his parents died, what they did for a living, and what his role is now. Bruce wants to stop the corruption plauging Gothem City, but isn't strong enough. He ventures to Asia (I think) and trys to teach himself how to be tough, and then finds his way into a monk style ninja training place (I dunno, something like that) but then Bruce wants to use his new skills for good, not assasantion. He returns to Gothem and finds that his company have a warehouse filled with gadjets and weopens that the army never wanted to use or where just too expensive to market... and so Bruce, with the help of a new friend (Morgan Freeman) slowly build up into Batman. As well as the help from his butler Alfred played by Michael Caine.

The new approach is a little confusing when you have seen the other Batmans and this movie is doing something different. I was kind of distracted with the thought that it's not the Joker who kills Bruces parents...and alot of those things with a familuer feel have been altered... but thats why you have to forget everything you previosly knew about the dark knight.

The new direction is not bad, and it's a bit more believable then past Batmans... at least to the questions of why Bruce does what he does, and how he has so much money to do so... and of coarse, where the gadjets come from.

This film won't win a best actor award, but it's entertaining and never dull. But now that Batman has been reborn with a new formula, look for alot of sequels coming in the future.",1119139200,2,2111,4.486979166666667
1577219,3,B00005JNJV,"Varios escalones ms arriba que las olvidables pelculas sobre el encapuchado dirigidas por Joel Schumacher, pero inferior a las versiones del magnfico Tim Burton, 'Batman Inicia' le da algo de aire a una franquicia que, luego de dos fracasos consecutivos, pareca agotada.

El filme explora los orgenes del hroe creado por Bob Kane, uno de los ms oscuros y complejos del mundo del cmic. Logra profundizar -con aceptable xito- sobre la psiquis del personaje y su motivacin para enfrentar al mal, pero apenas sale a flote en un punto en que toda pelcula de este gnero debera destacarse: el entretenimiento. A 'Batman Inicia' le falta accin y las contadas escenas de pelea estn filmadas demasiado sobre los actores, lo que hace que los movimientos resulten poco discernibles.

Adems, si bien es necesaria una justificacin de las habilidades para el combate del hombre murcilago, el adiestramiento de Bruno Diaz con ninjas en un monasterio en la alta montaa, recuerda a esas pelculas de artes marciales que pueden encontrarse en la tev un sbado a la tarde.

Ya entrenado y de regreso en Ciudad Gtica (que con buen criterio nuevamente luce dark como la de Burton y no rococ como en las pifias de Schumacher), Batman debe detener a un capo mafia y a un psiquiatra descarriado, quien busca enloquecer a toda la poblacin.

La pelcula se debate entre un predominante paso lento y algunas escenas abruptas, que desentonan pero logran el avance del relato. La explicacin verbal por parte de un personaje de lo que est sucediendo, que se da reiteradas veces en el filme, denota cierta incapacidad para trasmitir desde las imgenes, que sorprende de un director como Christopher Nolan, quien se destac con 'Memento'.

Christian Bale, un actor no muy conocido para la mayora, pero que cuenta con varios papeles protagnicos en su haber ('El Imperio del Sol', 'Psicpata Americano' y 'Equilibrium', entre otros), realiza una buena labor y no hace extraar a Michael Keaton, quien se haba puesto el traje en 'Batman' y 'Batman Vuelve'. Los dems protagonistas: Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes y Gary Oldman, demuestran slo parte de lo que pueden ofrecer.

La trama, que no incluye a ninguno de los principales villanos del encapuchado y permite reservarlos para futuras secuelas, resulta relativamente interesante hasta el final, donde patina un poco por un cierre que no parece demasiado meditado. A pesar de sus carencias, el filme no resulta un fiasco como los dos anteriores -protagonizados por Val Kilmer y George Clooney respectivamente- y abre la posibilidad a que haya Batman para rato.",1119139200,3,2596,5.03962703962704
1577220,5,B00005JNJV,"And I don't mean The Force, but that would make for one heck of a movie.

I'm gonna assume that most of you have seen all of the previous four Batman films.  There are the bad/terrible, you get to choose, films directed by Joel Shumacher.  In these movies the bad guys are covered in neon colors and are busy ice skating around Batman while they are trying to fight him.  Everything is colorfull and Batman even whips out a Bat-credit card.  UGHHHH!  Then there are the good/great Batman films, once again you get to choose.  These films are dark and very intense.  Batman is played by a person who understands what Bruce Wayne's character is about, meaning how tormented he is by his parent's death and how he wants to bring justice to Gotham City.  Oh yeah, these films are directed by Tim Burton who seems like the person that Batman movies were meant to directed by.  These movies are the example that ""Batman Begins"" followed.  In this movie Batman/Bruce Wayne returns to his dark roots.

This film basically explores Bruce Wayne's past.  It goes into great detail of what happened to him after to his parent's murder.  It explains how he became a fearful, revenge-minded person that sought training to prevent criminals from flourishing in Gotham City.  It goes into how he came to decide on becoming Batman.  How he got his utility belt, his costume and the Batmobile.  There's also a story of him saving Gotham City from nerve gas that makes you go permantly crazy, but thats not were the main story lies.  Its kind of a side show.

First of all, any fan of Batman should thank Christopher Nolan if you aver meet him.  As mentioned earlier, he has made Batman a dark super hero once again.  One of the great things that he created an image of was the fear that bad guys had of Batman.  In this film, Batman would pop out a dark spot and snatch a bad guy, just like in the comic books.  The bad guys were really scared of the Dark Knight, which is how it should be.  Christian Bale did a great job as Batman/Bruce Wayne.  He played the most intense and darkest Batman to date.  His Batman voice was a little too scruffy, but nothing else was bothersome.  The rest of the supporting cast, which included Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, and Katie Holmes, did a good job also.  Not too much to complain about with the flick.

I would have to say that this film is definitely a challenger for the best of the series.  This movie is so far the movie to see this summer.  Definitely check this film out.  There's no way that you'll be disappointed.",1119139200,,2574,4.480603448275862
1577221,5,B00005JNJV,"After director Joel Schumacher made Batman a travesty of the character and left the series in shambles with his showboat-over-produced-butt-and-crotch-shot-flash-in-the-pan `96 release of Batman and Robin, it was extremely hard to see a Batman film in the future that would be worth any appeal whatsoever. Thankfully, director Chris Nolan saw this as an opportunity to do justice to the series, as well as completely reinvent it to peak the interest back into the original Batman fans, as well as create completely new fans for the new millennium.

Batman Begins is a spectacular visual feast that not only exercises visual style, but focuses more on Batman as a character as opposed to how flashy his suit or how many things his Batmobile can do. And that's what I really liked about this movie, it was more real than most of the Batman films, not substituting substance for rubberized crotch or butt shots.

And I think fans of the comic book will find this one especially interesting because this is probably the darkest Batman flick, both visually and thematically and definitely stays truer to its origins.

I was also very pleased to see The Scarecrow villain in Batman Begins, being a huge fan of his from the animated series on Fox sometime ago.

Aside from all that, I thought Batman Begins had a strong story going for it, answering all the right questions I've always had about how Batman became Batman; where did he learn to fight? and where did he get all his things like his suit and grappling guns?

If you were just as disappointed with the last couple of Batman flicks as I was or never found Batman appealing at all really, I recommend seeing Batman Begins, because it is in the truest sense of the phrase, a new beginning in the series and will have you praising Chris Nolan for either breathing a much need breath of fresh air in the series or giving you an interest in this more modern Batman.",1119052800,,1914,4.718562874251497

Then got warmed over for Batman.

Worth seeing? If you love comic book movies.

Any good? Not bad. Could've been much better.

Bruce existed. Batman barely did.

The Morgan Freeman character was not a character, just a function.

The Alfred character was not a character, just a functionary.

The ""girl"" character had some substance.

Most characters were not characters, just bodies to make things happen.

1989 Batman had a far better Danny Elfman score (with humor).

1989 Batman had a spirit this one at least tried to caoture.

1989 Zatoichi had editing technique used here for fight scenes. (You'd see a raised arm. You'd hear a scuffle. You'd see shadows. Then someone would be down.) You'd never actually see a fight.

But then that now-ya-see-it-now-ya-don't quality was the creative thrust of the whole movie. Which made it far less satisfying and involving than it might have been.

Carmine Falcone represented the corruption of Gotham, meaning of [name your favorite city] and this was meaningful. He was, however, neither an exaggerated comic character nor a realistic one, but a stereotype nonetheless. Identifying this form of evil was worthwhile.

Despite emotional characters, there was no emotion in the movie.

Oh yes: Some great comic book ""splash panels,"" mostly at the end.

And the ending might imply or build demand for a sequel. I think it suggested a full circle return to the content of the 1989 Batman. A good idea. Hollywood just does not trust us so they do sequels that never equal the intensity or creative impulses of the original. They futz with them and end up with more explosions and less story.

I think there was a fine movie in there somewhere that, in all the years since the last Batman movie, got dumbed down.",1119052800,2,1812,4.869281045751634
1577223,5,B00005JNJV,"We went and saw Batman Begins Wednesday night. I have to say, it was the best motion picture treatment of Batman, both the character and the story, I have ever seen. I have to give full credit to Christopher Nolan, who brought this film together. With his cast, which includes Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson, and Morgan Freeman (just to name a few), Nolan has woven a great, dramatic tale of the birth of Batman, making it seem an inevitable, logical conclusion of the tragedy that befalls the young Bruce Wayne, and enfusing it with a sense of realism which all of the previous movies did not have. Don't get me wrong, Gotham City has a taste to it which is not quite of our world today, but at the same time all of Batman's gadgets appear realistic, and Bruce Wayne suffers from a bruised and bloodied body following a hard night out as Batman.

The direction and cinematography are excellent, from the opening frame (with the flying bats suggesting the Batman logo) to the closing frames (the remnants of Wayne Manor, and the conversation with Gordon). I appreciated how the first combat scene for Batman in Gotham kept Batman mostly out of sight, with only the sound of a flitting bat to suggest his prescence--an enemy out of sight often conveys more fear.

The acting is superb as well. I do believe that Bale was an excellent choice for the lead; he brings an intensity to the role that others might have lacked. The supporting cast is all excellent, with a stand-out performance by Neeson, and a touching, human performance by Caine. Great choices here, all around.

1577226,5,B00005JNJV,"When the fourth film to feature D.C. Comics' character ""Batman"" was unveiled in 1997 (entitled ""Batman and Robin""), it certainly seemed that the ""Batman"" film franchise had forever died as it was an atrocious film.  When announcements were made public that a new ""Batman"" film would be released in 2005 (entitled ""Batman Begins""), I certainly had my doubts that the film would be good following the 1997 disaster.  However, director and co-writer Christopher Nolan, who directed and co-wrote the Oscar-nominated film ""Memento"" in 2000, has happily proven my doubts wrong.  ""Batman Begins"" is, in my opinion, the best ""Batman"" film ever produced thanks to a combination of superb direction, wonderful acting and an engaging story.

Beginning when Bruce Wayne is only eight years old (played by Gus Lewis), Bruce accidentally falls into a pit on the very wealthy Wayne Manor.  He is rescued by his father Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), who is a philanthropist that prefers to let others manage Wayne Enterprises, but Bruce's experience and memories of being in the pit torment him into his adult years with horrifying dreams of the bats that inhabit the pit and its adjoining cave.  It is not long after his rescue that he attends an opera with his father and mother (Sara Stewart).  When performers dressed in black remind him of the bats, he urges his parents to leave, which they do with him through a back door into an adjoining alley.  There, a petty thief kills Bruce's parents: an act that, like the bats, will haunt Bruce into his adult years.  It is also on that horrific night that Bruce first meets a Gotham City police officer by the name of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman).  With Wayne Enterprises under the watchful eye of Earle (Rutger Hauer), the Wayne family butler Alfred (Michael Caine) takes on the responsibility of raising Bruce.  As an adult still haunted by bats and the murder of his parents, Bruce (Christian Bale) attempts to understand the criminal mind by disappearing and living as a petty thief himself.  Arrested in Asia, he is discovered by an unusual man named Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) that offers him a better alternative to coming to terms with his past and his fears.  Released from prison, Bruce travels to a distant and highly secretive monastery where he is directed to pick a blue flower.  He does so and is accepted by the monastery's leader named Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe).  There, Bruce learns various martial arts techniques and slowly comes to terms with his fears, but when he is asked by Ra's Al Ghul to carry out deeds that would grant him full status in the monastery's shadowy group, he refuses.  This refusal and the subsequent actions alienate Bruce from the shadowy group, so he returns to Wayne Manor.  However, having overcome his fears, Bruce returns to the pit and finds the adjoining bat-infested cave and decides that like his father who helped Gotham City, it is his duty to help rid Gotham City of the crime and corruption that dominates it at every conceivable level; but can he? You'll just have to watch this exciting film to find out!

With its stark realism, attention to detail, dark cinematography, wonderful cast, collage of interesting characters and plot twists, ""Batman Begins"" is sure to keep its audience entertained and fully engaged with its 141 minutes.  Other wonderfully portrayed characters include the godfather-like criminal leader Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), former Wayne Enterprise board member Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), attorney and long-time friend of Bruce named Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and the corrupt psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy).

1577328,4,B00005JNJV,Fantastic come back for the film series with Christian Bale as the Cape Crusader starting his war on crime. Christopher Nolan recreates the series with a dark mood that almost rivals Tim Burton's first two Batman movies but he does lack the flare and the bravado that Burton brought to those films as well as the underlining sense of evil that Gotham had in it's core. Nolan meanwhile does give a sense of realism to the madness of the city and it's hero and that's where the movie big surprise is. I think that this is a great come back for the series and I hope there will be a sequel to it to see where Batman goes from there.,1119052800,,629,4.25
1577329,5,B00005JNJV,"Fear comes crawling on occasion to all people, the question is how do they respond to this frightening sensation.  Many try to live with their internal fears without ever trying to deal with them, but once and in a while some decide to look fear in the eyes.  Some of these fears are phobias strong enough to paralyze the individual's existence, which could possibly be very dangerous if a situation would present itself where the stimuli that trigger the phobia would appear in an untimely moment.  These stimuli that cause fear could be things such as heights, spiders, or small spaces, yet they all have one thing in common.  They all induce irrational levels of fear.  In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has such a phobia and how he acquires this phobia emerges in the opening of the film through a traumatic childhood experience.

The story opens with a dream sequence where Bruce is playing, as a child, in their gigantic garden with Rachel Dawes, as he for the first time encounters bats through a traumatic experience.  When Bruce wakes up he is a captive of an Asian prison, seemingly Chinese, but this is not confirmed.  He is in prison due to his personal journey to gain wisdom about the nature of evil.  It also appears that he has enemies whereever he wanders, as convicts are willing to end his life whenever opportunity presents itself.  As a consequence, the prison guards throw him into solitary confinement where a shadowy man, Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), offers him the opportunity to fight evil in a more productive manner.  However, Bruce must follow the instructions of Ducard and undergo rigorous training where he must face his personal fears.

Batman Begins opens with a fragmented storyline, which helps induce the confusion that Bruce might be feeling while trying to understand himself and how he should approach evil.  In this beginning, Bruce's past history runs before the audience's eyes through a number of interjecting flashbacks that present how he got to the situation where he gains the skills and wisdom necessary to battle evil.  Much of his wisdom and skill comes from intense training in ninjutsu and other martial arts while he is aptly ingesting all of the physical, spiritual, and philosophical parts of his training.  Intermittently throughout the training, scenes from his past emerge to increase an understanding of why he desires to combat evil.  The root of his desire stems from a harrowing childhood memory where his mother and father were brutally gunned down in his presence after having left an opera performance early due to fear experienced during the opera.

The scene leading up to the murder of his parents continues to display director Christopher Nolan's attention for detail, as he also plays with the analogous notion that fear can prevent people from fulfilling their destinies.  The scene also illustrates the internalized guilt that Bruce possesses due to his fears that frequently haunt his dreams with his personal nightmarish nemesis - the bat.  However, Ducard teaches him that in order to fully be prepared to face his destiny he must conquer over his own fears.  This lengthy beginning is essential in order for the audience to build a complete understanding of Bruce's persona, as he struggles to understand himself within a diverse and unjust world.  Nonetheless, Nolan accomplishes to keep the audience's attention with his hypnotic storytelling that has splashes of wit and insightfulness.

Eventually, Bruce finishes his education with Ducard, but finds himself at a crossroads where his personal philosophy opposes Ducard's organizations.  This leads him to take his own path, a narrow path, where he must struggle to be on the right side of justice.  In addition, when he returns home to Gotham City he discovers that he has been declared dead, as he has been gone for more than seven years.  Through the help of his family butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), he returns home to begin work in a small department of his company that is run by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) from where he finds several of his fantastic Batman toys while he is trying to find a fitting symbol for his new alter ego.  After much thought, Bruce settles for the name - Batman.

During Bruce's long absence from Gotham City, the city has disintegrated from rampant crime while corruption is reaching its peak.  The man behind the scenes seems to be the mobster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) who has a finger in everything within the city, but he is also cooperating with Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), a psychiatrist, that gets off all of Falcone's thugs with the plea of insanity.  The police do not do much, as most of them are in the pocket of Falcone.  One of the few that seems to pursue the criminals is the attorney Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), but without much luck.  Amidst this vile corruption Batman begins to restore peace and order within the city with his tough approach.  However, there seems to be something much bigger brewing underneath the surface of the city and Batman might be what Gotham City needs to save them.

Batman Begins provides an authentic image of Batman's true dark character, as he struggles with what is right and wrong.  Through this personal struggle of Batman, Nolan does a wonderful job in depicting a genuine society where things are not black and white, as he brings the film into the gray zone where nothing is completely clear.  This ambiguousness is vital, as it also heavily deals with the emotion fear.  Fear is crucial for survival as people can sense dangers when facing fears, but if neglected it could lead to worse sorrow.  The camerawork and the darkness in the film enhances the element of fear in a brilliant manner.  There is a scene where the bats seem to merge with Batman, which symbolically produces the notion that fear is an essential part of our own existence and cannot be neglected.  When the darkness of the viewing room goes into hiding from the light and the end credits fade away Batman Begins continues to expand beyond any of its predecessors with a thoughtful and innovative cinematic experience not soon forgotten.",1119052800,,6158,4.9073359073359075
1577330,3,B00005JNJV,"This movie isn't as great as I'd heard it was, but it was pretty good. Bruce Wayne's backstory following his parents' murder is all more interesting and emotionally moving than what takes place after he actually becomes Batman. After that, it lapses into formulaic action movie chiches with yet another ""big machine which must be stopped or we're all doomed"".Bale spits and hisses his lines as Batman a bit too intensely, and his scowling lip contortions remind me of Sly in Judge Dredd. He's not that great a Batman, in my opinion. Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, though, is picture perfect. Gordon has up till now pretty much been potrayed as a doofus on film, and Oldman looks and acts the way Gordon should. Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred, but that's no surprise. The villians were a tad weak, I thought. Not that I wanna see more of the over, over the top camp of the bad guys from the previous 4 movies, but Al Ghul and the Scarecrow aren't particularly interesting to me as potrayed here. Oh, well, I know alot of people aren't going to agree with this review, as this movie was being hailed as Batman's return to greatness long before it even came out. That's fine. It just didn't knock me on my can, and that's just how it is. Still, it's a marked improvement (to say the least) over the direction the Burton/Schumacher Bat-films eventually took, and I guess it will be forever revered for that reason alone. But to me, it's just another Batman movie, with nothing too stupid, and nothing particularly mind-blowing. With 7 big screen feature films under his utility belt (including Adam West, and Mask of the Phantasm), I feel the cinematic potential of Batman has yet to be fully exploited.

1577333,5,B00005JNJV,"After experimenting with imagery/scripting inconsistencies that had actually made the 1960's TV series look sophisticated by comparison (Batman and Robin, Batman Forever), the Batman movie series returns to the brooding and tortured millionare which we adore.

In this film, we see how a young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) copes with his parents murder. Because he has the money and resources, Wayne ultimately decides to become Batman--a vigilante 'anti-hero' hero who takes the law into his own hands when the police cannot stop evil from overrunning Gotham City. Bruce ultimately wants to ensure that other people will not experience the tragedy which he has known. He subsequently walks a very fine line between administering justice and exacting revenge.

There are some bumps along the way to Bruce's infamous 'reincarnation'. The begining of the film shows young ""Master Wayne"" recieving abuse in a generic prison camp for 'research' but ultimately concluding that even he cannot join in his rescuer's idea of justice, killing another person. Already traumatized as he is, Bruce is still a good guy due to his all-critical remaining shred of humanity. Yet, this scene also hints that he theoretically could have snapped under other conditions.

Immediately following an overseas trip, Bruce finds that Gotham is now in shambles. Adding insult to this injury, he also learns that his own company is now convieniently on the verge of being taken away from him.

Bob Kane's Dark Knight Detective was never supposed to be a camp icon(ala West and Clooney's portrayals); he was supposed to be THE thing which lurks in the shadows against injustice. Batman is a mystery precisely because he worked with the police, but was explicitly not one of them. This film also explains how Gotham PD ultimately came to trust Batman.

We see a young Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) who is destined to become Gotham City's police commissioner in the future. The city is SO corrupt at this point that he is the only honest cop left. Gordon desperately wants help maintaining law and order so turning to an outsider who can deliver this is his logical conclusion. Their early partnership thus lays critical foundation for why Gordon and Batman work together in subsequent years; Gordon knows that Batman also wants to clean up Gotham--and can deliver on it. Gordon recognizes that the Batman is an effective if wholly unorthodox crime control resource.

Morgan Freeman also stars as Lucius Fox, a family friend who helps Bruce create the Batman personna. He is a scientist in the then-taken over Wayne Enterprises who somehow managed to escape the scrutiny of a devilsh Rutger Hauer. Fox ultimately helps to devise all of Batman's awesome crime-fighting gadgets in the tradition of James Bond's 'Q'. I don't think there is a single film which Morgan Freeman has been involved with that I did not like. This man's name simply oozes talent.

We also meet Jonathan 'Scarecrow' Crane (Cillian Murphy), who is a really unethical psychatrist. According to this screenplay, he is Batman's first 'big villan'. The Scarecrow wants to control the City of Gotham by drugging the water supply with psychedelic mind controls. The special effects department did a wonderful job with the character, I definently was terrified after seeing this character throughout the screen play. I also could not find anything laughable about him.

Christian Bale is handsome as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and I feel guilty because I had never previously cared to see something which he was playing in before now. Bale brings the perfect match of sensitivity and unbalancw that is essentially needed for this part (Batman IS fundamentally a vengange gig from a disturbed milionare) and I know this film is going to be a blockbuster of the summer, if not the year.

I have not been this enthusiastic about a Batman movie since 1992's Batman Returns (with Michael Keaton then in the lead role). I am seeing this one release several times, something which I honestly have not done with any film since I was a little girl.

I am also willing to predict Batman Begins generates renewed interest in the Batman concept. The design people for this film have obviously taken considerable care to give depth and credibility to the 'begins' concept, the Bat signal is not as it would look in most other movies. There is a sense that Batman really is starting but is serious about wanting to do a good job of eliminating crime.

Hopefully, the studios ultimately now understand that turning Batman into a comedian was a recipe for disaster and thus will not be inclined to tinker with a masterpiece creation. I expect Bale and this scripting sophistication to hold up in subsequent movies, if nothing else because of the ending to this film itself .

Batman has begun a long-awaited period of revival both as a crime fighting force to be recokned with and a box office blockbuster to see.",1119052800,9,4919,4.992673992673993

Tim Burton's BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS hardly qualify much better, to be honest.  It was difficult to accept Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight.  Jack Nicholson steals the first movie.  And Tim Burton can't get any action momentum going to save his life.

Joel Shummacher's BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN AND ROBIN are actually just big-budget camp entries that should've been called THE AMBIGUOUSLY GAY DUO: THE MOVIES.

So not a very high bar to jump....

But, happily, BATMAN BEGINS arrives and it's easily the best Batman movie ever made.

Christopher Nolan, the director responsible for MEMENTO, and the writers actually take what would be considered the dullest part of the story--Bruce Wayne's early life--and make it fast-paced and interesting.

Christian Bale easily out-bats everyone else who ever put on the cape and cowl.  I loved how he appears from the dark in the Bat's early scenes and literally snarls at everyone he speaks to.

The rest of the cast is incredible: Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler and Gary Oldman as Sgt.-then-Lt. James Gordon stand out.  Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, and Rutger Hauer are also on hand to add weight to the proceedings.

Dark, psychological, well-paced and well written, interesting--this is the best Batman movie ever made, and I can't wait for the next one!

1577409,5,B00005JNJV,"Christopher Nolan and his co-screenwriter, David Goyer have chosen to postpone the crossover of Bruce Wayne (a soulful Christian Bale)  into Batman until half way through the new ""Batman Begins.""
And this is a crucial and important step that Nolan puts off until Bruce walks the earth in search of his own personal nirvana... in a sort of Christ-like journey to understand himself and his place in the world after his parents are brutally murdered. It is also from this quest that he acquires the knowledge and skills necessary for him to become a warrior, ready and able  to combat the ills  and rid his town Gotham of all evil-doers.
Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" is a more macho, masculine film than were the previous movies, which is not to take anything away from Tim Burton's elegiac, gothic and visionary takes on this story. But Burton's world is/was/ and will always be the world of the dreamer: his Batman is more sinned against than sinning. His Batman needs love and understanding while Nolan's wants and needs justice and revenge more than anything else: even the sultry Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes proves to be of little interest to Batman save a chaste kiss at the end of the movie. It's interesting to note that in the previous Batman films we had big beautiful bombshells like Kim Bassinger and Nicole Kidman as the so-called love interests while here, in Nolan's vision we have a more scrubbed clean, working class (Rachel is an assistant D.A.) heroine: a woman who is as interested in righting wrongs as is Batman and not merely someone meant as an adornment to the suave debonair Batman of Val Kilmer, George Clooney or Michael Keaton. It's an important and telling shift from woman as a plush toy to one who is, not only beautiful but also smart and dedicated to a cause other than self-promotion and self-satisfaction.
Christian Bale's Batman is real..i.e. a genuine, fleshed-out, beautifully written movie character: he is conflicted, he makes mistakes, he trusts the wrong people at times and he pays for his mistakes. It is a remarkable casting coup to have Bale in this role particularly since of late he has been playing a spate of radicals...i.e. in ""The Machinist,"" in which he transforms himself into a skeleton...literally. As Bruce Wayne/Batman, Bale dons the mask, assumes the persona, not out of a lust for power but out of a fervent belief that good will always triumph over evil: several times in this film he is brought to task for his trust in the basic goodness of people and one of his mentors ( Liam Neeson as Ducard) even goes so far as to ridicule Bruce as sentimental and weak for it. Though Ducard is his mentor and sensei, this relationship proves to be fraught with ambiguity as the movie progresses to the climax.
What is a Batman film without its villains? But this film is devoid of the cartoon craziness of the Riddler or the Joker. Here we have Cillian Murphy (so good in ""28 Days Later"") as a scary-as-hell The Scarecrow, alias psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane, who spews his  psychedelic paranoia and psychosis on an unsuspecting Gotham. His ""stuff"" is more thrilling and frightening than anything that the aforementioned villains could ever muster.
""Batman Begins"" is not only a physically gorgeous film, it is also an emotionally and ideologically complicated one. It wears its heart on its sleeve, yes...but it also has the brains and a profoundly strong back and pumped up physicality to back it up.",1118966400,546,3451,4.814502529510961

Instead of the flashy suits and fancy costumes and gadgets this film focuses more on the man behind the mask and how he came to be.  It reminds the audience again that unlike all the other superheroes to come to the screen, Batman has no special powers he is just an ordinary man behind the mask.  This is shown in the beginning, as the first part of the film focuses on how Bruce Wayne became what we now know as Batman.  It is quite interesting seeing everything that we've come to know as part of pop-culture come to life and see how it all evolved including the batcave and the famous symbol etched in the night sky.  The style of the film only amplifies the mood and makes all the other movies pale in comparison, this is how a good blockbuster should be made.  The acting is quite good as well, with Christian Bale fillling in the shoes that were so previously occupied by George Clooney and Michael Keaton.  Michael Caine gives a great performance as Alfred as well.  Katie Holmes plays a strong-willed DA who is the main squeeze for Bruce, sadly though there is not much too her character or her acting.

Tim Burton delved very much into duality and splitting his character in half.  Christopher Nolan cleverly directs and interprets Batman as one whole person...one WHOLE HUMAN BEING.

That's right, folks.  Let's not forget this - he's a human being; seeing Batman as actually someone who is traumatized and vulnerable not only works well, but is chillingly believable.

Push aside any of the far-fetched ideas and try to imagine crafting a story about a human being taking on villainy, and you'll see how this film is clever and emotional at the same time.  I especially love seeing how Batman himself gets developed along with the gadgetry.

True, the love interest is extremely muted, but it certainly acts as an excellent foil for Bruce's personality to be reflected upon and it's certainly NOT what this film is about.

Don't complain about ""slow starts.""  This is plot and character development at its finest in a Hollywood atmosphere that has almost forgotten both.

1577414,5,B00005JNJV,"FINALLY! I had to get that out after watching two pieces of crap that called themselves Batman. Joel Schumacher's reign of terror is over and Christopher Nole has taken the helm of the Dark Knight's latest project, Batman Begins. A tremendous improvement (how could it be worse than Jim Carry stealing the scenes or George in a nippled Batsuit?) over the last two and even grabs some ground from the gothic creations of Tim Burton, the original Batman and Batman Returns.

This story, like everyone knows, tells how Bruce Wayne went from the orphened son of a multi-billionare to the Dark Knight, avenging his parent's deaths and fighting crime in Gotham City. It begins in the Far East where Bruce learns how to disappear into the night and fight his enemies. While CNN found this a stupid beginning and too ""Asian-martial artsy"", I thought there was no better place to begin. I mean, Batman's entire technique is the night, a concept used by those steathy assassin/spies called ninjas. Also, you can't expect Batman to take boxing lessons to beat people up; no, you've gotta go martial arts for that.

Moving along, Bruce returns to Gotham, transformed from a Corescant-like wonder of dazzling heights and glimmer into a dark, Blade Runner-like LA, topped off with a island housing the poor, criminally insane, and modeled after a destroyed Hong Kong slum. In Gotham, we get the beginnings of Batman from Lucius Fox, a former board member of Wayne Enterprises played by Morgan Freeman, and the butler Alfred, played by the wonderfully English Michael Caine. However, Batman will find his troubles in the psychologically minipulative Dr. Crane, played by sinister Cillian Murphy, also known as The Scarecrow for the mask he wears. Crane uses a hallucinogen that induces horrifying day-mares which render the victim helpless in their own fear.

Speaking of fear, this movie uses psychological fear to a greater extent than any superhero movie, actually more than most movies, I've ever seen. The Scarecrow isn't really scary (well, maybe the mask is a little odd, possibly frightening to younger audiences), but he doesn't need to be psychotic or powerful to induce fear, he uses your own. Bruce's own fears of the past (not to mention guilt over his parents' deaths) provide a much more humane look at a superhero, like that of Spiderman 2. You feel Bruce is human, rather than just a symbol, as he attempts to be as Batman.

Overall, this film plays much better than the last two, possibly all, of the Batman's before. The cast is excellent (never seen one better for superhero films), the dialogue is witty (unlike the final Star Wars movie), and the plot is a great start to the Batman canon. The end leaves us with Batman, the new vigilante of Gotham, ready to take on the crime of the city, one villian at a time (and ready to find the REAL murderer of his parents, the Joker, who leaves his trademark card at the end).",1118966400,,2925,4.820717131474104

1577526,5,B00005JNJV,"Finally, a stylish and intelligent Batman movie that I found engrossing from beginning to end.  Played straight by a superb cast, Christopher Nolan's smart take on the Dark Knight was beautifully rendered by all concerned.  A wonderful noir look to the film that did not rely on full-frontal CGI, this Batman avoided winking at the audience or mocking its own characters.

Nearly a full third of the movie gives us a deeper background to the troubled hero, and his lost seven years of self-discovery.  I found every aspect of the film smart, well-thought-out,  and as logical as something like this could be. The dialogue worked for me, and the characters, played by this dream cast, had some depth and complexity.  And finally, the action was terrific.  This Batman attacks from and retreats back into darkness.  And darkness is the theme.

I often find amusing the complaints of people about a film like this.  If you want Shakespeare, go see Shakespeare.  If you want a comic book, read a comic book.  This is high class, highly intelligent movie making, done with style and panache and enough substance to satisfy most of us.  And it is great good fun.",1118966400,2,1156,4.807106598984771
1577527,2,B00005JNJV,"Don't think.  If you do you won't enjoy Batman Begins.  If you don't think about what is going on in the movie and just watch, you just might enjoy it.

I'll go into three major things that upset me about this movie:

One, all of the dialogue was so bad in this movie.  It rivaled the dialogue in the Star wars movies.  That's why I opened this review up by telling you not to think in the movie.  The dialogue didn't live up to other superhero movies recently like Spiderman.

Two.  Where were the villans?  Batman is supposed to have villans.  All batman fought were a docter wearing a canvas mask, some mob guys, and his ninja teacher.  None of them really seemed like villans to me.  They seemed more like normal angry people with some problems that they needed to work out.  In the past, Batman has had Joker to deal with.  He seems more villan like to me.

Three.  How many times are we going to see a fight on a moving train in superhero movies.  It seems like it's really getting old.  It started with Spiderman 2 on a raised subway car.  Now in batman we get to see basically the same scene only on a monorail train instead.  Both were running to the end of the track, and the hero needs to defeat the bad guy and get out of the train before it crashes.  It was almost the same scene.  I hope fantastic 4 doesn't include this superhero scene as well.

Batman Begins was better than DareDevil and the Hulk, but it still kind of a disappointment for a superhero movie.  Like I said, don't think to much, and you might enjoy the movie.",1118966400,2,1541,4.249134948096886

No brightly light faces, no one-liners to dilute the plot, and a ensemble cast human enough to understand without gulping down soda in vile disgust. Hopefully if there are future cards to be laid, and the jester shows his hand, this darker franchise will continue to satisfy without sacrificing itself to mockery .",1118966400,,655,4.8053097345132745
1577531,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is a fitting title, a statement in itself, stamping an end to a saga that had lost its direction long ago.

Gone are the cameo appearances, the paper thin plotlines and the one dimensional characters. It seems one comic book geek, Christopher Nolan, finally did what all arm-chair critics would never do. He got off his rear end and rewrote the whole thing. That alone is admirable.

The first move by Nolan was to cast a handful of well established supporting actors. Liam Neeson as the alluring mentor and conflicted villain, Michael Caine the witty and loving Butler, a perceptive Morgan Freeman as the trusted scientist, the list goes on. Interestingly, the part of Batman went to a less familiar Christian Bale, however, this is one of Nolan's best decisions. In the past this role has gone to actors like George Clooney, making it hard to separate identities onscreen. This way Christian Bale is Batman and not vice versa, and the supporting actors are dispersed carefully within the plot as to not overshadow the hero himself.

The second move by Nolan was to return to the roots of heroes\villains, explaining the essence of identities and characters. At first the flashbacks of Batman's childhood seem generic, but the progression of this story helps set stage to the action that follows. The action of man, whether hero or villain is less defined than most could understand. The birth of Batman is truly more intense that meets the eye, more philosophical than Hollywood would usually care to mention. It has captured a depth in comic books that is rarely celebrated by onscreen adaptations. It is a depth in story and character I would only expect in Japanese animations like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and so forth. And inevitably when Batman fails to stop a villain on his first try (being set alight and gassed), it doesn't feel like a predictable build up of tension, rather a moment in which we understand his weakness and his flaws. The world of Batman is shaped by humans with a cause, not supermen with magical powers.

Unfortunately, the movie has its flaws. The plot to save Gotham City plays second to the tension at hand, and the finale is somewhat an anticlimax to the concoction of identities that are born and interwoven. To save Gotham City was not high on my agenda to say the least. The action itself was awkwardly shot. Batman Begins is one of many recent releases of big-budget action movies that insist on close up cut scenes flickering at an indistinguishable rate. In the end all we see is hands jerking, heads turning, and the sound of `ching ching'. Is it cost saving, I don't know, but I would prefer a panned out view of all the butt kicking! Thankfully the childish one-liners (specially during the car scenes) were restrained just enough to prevent a `star wars' catastrophe.

I wouldn't go as far to say this movie is a classic, but I am hopeful this saga will resurrect a trend in story telling for our comic book heroes to come.",1118966400,,2985,4.732692307692307
1577532,5,B00005JNJV,"There's a constant debate, especially when it comes to superhero movies, if a certain screen adaptation of a character is the best depiction possible. The Batman movieverse is no different; with a majority of Michael Keaton supporters, a vocal minority of Val Kilmer supporters, and a two-bedroom condo of George Clooney supporters, the argument rages on. Keaton's reign on the throne of Batdom is about to come to a close with the emergence of Christian Bale in Batman Begins. Director Chris Nolan and his screenwriter David Goyer bring a gravitas to the franchise that never even existed in the darker Burton films. This is a film full of fleshed-out characters and an honest-to-god complex story, and the performers and technical crews have approached this material as if they were expecting major awards.  This isn't a film to chew popcorn and enjoy the cool action, but one that takes the Dark Knight serious on his own level and offers insights on his often frightening predicaments.

Begins starts as super-rich Bruce Wayne ends his tour o' crime around the world in an Asian prison. Why would a billionaire want to get in the minds of criminals around the world, you ask? Because the murder of his parents left him confused about the nature of crime and justice, and he must know the truth. In prison he meets another justice fighter, Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers to teach and train Bruce in the ways of fighting crime in an Academy in the mountains with his master Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). Bruce accepts and trains there, until after a falling out with the more reactionary group, he returns to Gotham City to put an end to the crime and corruption that has plagued the city for years. With the help of his family's butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), and the mis-used head of applied science at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Bruce creates a symbol of justice that will strike fear in the hearts of criminals in a way no man could. He becomes Batman. And that is just the start of the movie. Later, Batman battles corporate greed in the form of the new head of Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle (the always wonderful-to-see Rutger Hauer), mafia violence in the form of Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), and a more mysterious presence in Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), aka The Scarecrow. He is assisted in his fight by the few honest officials left in Gotham, District Attorney Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and a cop who probably has lots of promotions on the horizon, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman).

The story of Batman Begins is packed to the brim with themes of fear, vengeance, corruption, and family and each is given a satisfying length to develop. Suffice to say, this is one rich comic book movie that will reward further viewings. It gives the best answer of any of the movies to the question of why Bruce Wayne dresses up like a bat to fight crime, while neatly juxtaposing Bruce's childhood phobia of bats to the real horror of seeing his parents murdered. Fear fills Begins from beginning to end. The fear Ducard teaches Bruce to impose on criminals to the fear the Scarecrow's poison gives to the people under it's influence. Nolan portrays this in great effect as many of the scenes are scarier than any horror film you'll see this year.

Nolan's direction is receiving the most scrutiny in the area of the action sequences, which are deemed too choppy and not well-defined. NY Times film critic Manhola Dargis cites that Nolan's action should be like Fred Astaire's filmed dancing which I would agree with in a lot of cases but not with Batman Begins. The action is as it should be for Batman, dark and fast, theatrical but not flamboyant. Nolan's direction maximizes this effect without inducing headaches or motion sickness.

In the end, you have to ask yourself what makes the best superhero movie of all time ""the best."" Is it honesty with it's characters? An honoring of a long and rich legacy? An actual story that just isn't filler for elaborate action scenes? An ambition to be something more than what is the norm of the genre? If so, Batman Begins fits all these bills and starts some bill of its own. This is the sixth Batman movie (counting Mask of the Phantasm and not the Adam West cornfest), and they've just now got it completely right with Begins. I'm sure Batman Continues, but will he ever End?

1577533,4,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is a very good action movie, with a decent plot. This is probably the most true to the current comic Batman any of the movies has gotten and Bale is the best Batman since Michael Keaton, possibly even better than Keaton but I think it's too early to make that call (we'll see what he does in the sequel).

About 30% of the movie tells the origin of Batman. On screen, in the past we've seen why Batman became Batman. In this movie we finally learn how that all came about and it's adapted well from the comic origin written years ago. I've read some reviews that claim ""this is the best comic movie to date"" or ""this is one you can actually believe could happen"", both comments are ridiculous, this is most definately a comic book movie, while Batman doesn't have super powers, he never has in any of his on screen personas.

I gave it four stars because it's a very entertaining movie, that manages to take an exhausted franchise and bring it back to life in a big way for yet another generation. Staying inside the comic movie genre; while it didn't deliver the same emotional intensity as Spiderman II, Batman Begins is certainly is a very good movie with quite a few unexpected twist and turns, among the best of the comic movies ever made.",1118880000,,1258,4.441558441558442

ANY OF THIS FOUND IN ""BEGINS""? NOPE! CHRISTIAN BALE WHO HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER SINCE I SAW HIM ON AMERICAN PSYCHO IS BY FAR THE BEST BATMAN YET.  HIS ACTING WAS SUPERB.  THE MOVIE FOCUSED FAR MORE ON BATMAN THAN ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE FILM ALTHOUGH I REALLY LIKED GARY OLDMAN'S PERFORMANCE AS AN EARLY DAYS LIEUTENANT GORDON.  KATIE HOLMES ALTHOUGH PLEASANT TO LOOK AT WAS SADLY WASTED IN THIS MOVIE.  MORGAN FREEMAN SHINES AS ALWAYS AS HE DID IN OTHER MOVIES LIKE SEVEN AND LEAN ON ME AS BRUCE WAYNES PARTNER AND FRIEND LUCIUS FOX.

CHRISTIAN BALE IS STILL THE TOP HOMBRE IN THIS FILM.  HE PORTRAYS THE TROUBLED YOUNG BRUCE WAYNE IN A WAY THAT SHOWS THE VIEWER THAT THERE REALLY IS A SCARED AND VENGEFUL CHILD BEHIND THAT PLAYBOY IMAGE.

1577616,4,B00005JNJV,"Behind the city lights exists a subterranean society where crime runs rampant.  Who better to rid this society from corruptness than a man in a suit of amour that resembles a bat-like figure?  BATMAN BEGINS has the similar dark and sinister quality as the first BATMAN film, but with much more violence.  For the premise of the film, it is twofold.  First, Bruce Wayne attempting to come to terms with his demons.  Second, fighting municipal and corporate bureaucracy that is tainting the waters of Gotham city.

The highlight of the film shows how Bruce Wayne came to being the ""Batman"".  From his childhood recollection of falling into an empty well and encountering a flock of bats attacking him to escaping the fears of his past, Wayne seeks solace in an unidentified far away land that resembles a snow covered Shangri la Himalayan landscape where he trains amongst darkly clothed ninja warriors, which are led by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and Ra Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe).  Director, Chris Nolan, presents a somewhat ambiguous and sketchy depiction of Wayne's travel to the Far East.  However, Nolan cuts to the chase by with Wayne declaring his purpose in life is to serve justice and to conquer the Gotham underworld.  Some may consider the first hour of the film as sluggish, but it is the core of the film.  As a historical-side footnote, did the lower foundations of Wayne mansion, which later was converted to the bat cave, possibly serve as a passage to the Underground Railroad?  Ah, the fantasy of fiction.

Nevertheless, BATMAN BEGINS carries its weight with a parade of well-established stars.  Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Michael Cane as Alfred the Butler, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox steal the show.  However, the romantic entanglement between Wayne and Rachel (Katie Holmes) appears in fragmented segments.  The most frightening scenes are captured by Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy)who sprays some pscyhologically brain-poisoning powder with a sandpeople looking mask that results in an extreme depiction of a hallucination gone bad.  Despite the defining moments, there are subtle moments in the film where Wayne still has not come to grips with the loss of his father, and continues to have flashbacks and the repetitious scene with his father's stethscope.  Could this suggest that he wanted to cure the ills of society as his father had done to cure his patients?

BATMAN definitely delivers.  However, this is not a film that young audience members should see without an adult.  There is plenty of pop `em and sock `em scenes, but not without a tremendous array of explosive theatrics and cinematography that does at all resemble the old Saturday cartoons of yesterday.  So, if you're in a batty mood or would like to see the beginnings of a superhero, may Batman begin.",1118880000,2,2823,5.012875536480687
1577617,5,B00005JNJV,"I was fortunate enough to have seen the film before I read any of the standard assortments of critical reviews out in the press.  I had heard hearsay that Roger Ebert had said that this movie accomplished exactly what comics to movies should accomplish.  Nothing more, just the standard rumblings you'd expect from the standard summer blockbuster.

This film is not a regular summer blockbuster.  It saves the Batman movie genre single handedly from the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tommy Lee Jones and other terrible performances from the past five films based on Batman Comics.  This film is also the greatest achiever in the category of ""Comic Book based film.""  This film beats Spiderman II and X2: X-Men United.

This is one of those movies that accomplishes all that it could.  It is an achievement from every element, writing, directing, acting, special effects, and production.  It will be difficult to describe fully.

This film is directed by Christopher Nolan, who also directed the underground favorite ""Memento.""  Nolan holds viewers in this comic book world effortlessly.  The movie is 2 hours and 21 minutes in length, but the viewer doesn't notice this at all.  Even in films that are really good, like the LOTR trilogy, you still feel some dissonance as you realize you've been watching for a considerable length of time.  Not in this film.  There is only great disappointment that the movie has to end.  Nolan accomplishes much in this film, but most of all he brings the viewers into a different world, and keeps them their without complaint.

There are some great acting performances in this film as well.  Christian Bale plays the lead role as the young and troubled Bruce Wayne; he flees to another country before returning to Gotham to try to pick up whatever was left of his life.  Liam Neeson plays Ducard, the man who takes the young Wayne under his wing into a secret Ninja society before he and Wayne part ways and Ducard become an antagonist.  Neeson plays a character caught between good and evil: someone who has noble goals but dangerous means.  He's sympathetic, which makes him the perfect villain in this role.

Oscar winner Michael Caine plays Alfred, the beloved butler of the Wayne family.  Caine's performance overshadows all others, including the abilities of Morgan Freeman, who plays another Bruce Wayne confidant.  The only dim bulb in this cast was Katie Holmes, who does well, but her role is limited as the love interest and damsel in distress.

What makes this story so great is it escapes what I call the ""superhero problem.""  All movies that deal with how a superhero becomes a superhero are boring.  Superman is just an alien.  Spiderman gets bit by a radioactive spider.  The Fantastic Four are hit with extreme radiation.  The X-Men are just mutants, the next step in evolution.  None of this is interesting alone.  Even the non-super power superheroes have boring background stories.  The Punisher is just a guy whose loved ones were gunned down.  While this is the setup for Batman (the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents as a child) it isn't the full story.

Bruce Wayne becomes Batman in the event described in this film.  The persona evolves.  First Wayne tries to understand the man who murdered his parents by becoming a criminal himself, running away to the Orient for seven years.  There he ends up in prison, but is released and studies to become a Ninja at a mountain school under Liam Neeson's character.  The two have a falling out, and Wayne returns home.  His concern for Gotham and Katie Holme's character (a local district attorney) leads him down the path of vigilante-hood.

However, Wayne never fully embraces the idea, the persona ""Batman"" until he forced to deal with a super villain, in this movie Scarecrow.  As the movie escalates, we see Wayne evolve.  Despite my description, the plot is very fast paced and interesting.

Sure, there are some weak points.  Christopher Nolan felt the need to intersperse small tidbits of humor at inopportune times.  Some of the plot is wholly unbelievable, but we forgive these transgressions because even a diamond has imperfections, and this film is still a diamond in a sea of cruddy summer blockbusters.  Enough reading already, go see this film!",1118880000,2,4266,4.893854748603352
1577618,5,B00005JNJV,This movie showed some great things. Christian Bale is most likely the best batman to date (Keaton a close second). This movie really shows the pain of Bruce Wayne as a child and what he went through growing up. It is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. I would really incourage you to see this great movie.,1118880000,,328,4.222222222222222
1577619,5,B00005JNJV,"The film basically follows a plot of focusing mainly on Bruce Wayne. The other 4 films directed by Burton and others focused mainly on the villans and gave The Bat a backseat. Well, now Batman  now has his own movie. The first part is where Bruce Wayne's origins, and follows how he got to where he was and why. The second part follows the devolopment of his alter-ego, Batman. The third part is less plot developed, but packs a solid action punch. The third and second part focus on Batman's pursuit of Scarecrow.

Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece. Instead of putting Batman in the backseat like previous directors had, He has created basically a tribute to Batman, focusing on his life and emergence. He also adds his own style and darkness to the film, making it a lot better than the animated style of Burton. He makes Batman more realistic and helps us see how exactly Batman formed. The effects were supurb, and I had a fun time watching this fantastic film.

In closing, I thought this was the film that everybody has been waiting for.  Batman fans have been waiting a long time to rejoice over the story of their hero, Batman. He has been put in the back seat too much. This was his moment to shine, and by god, he has been given the proper film for it! Fantasic film!",1118880000,,1287,4.487179487179487
1577620,5,B00005JNJV,"Wow! How do you spell `Wow"" backwards? Sorry, that is an inside joke, a reference to my review of Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"", but an equally fitting reference to my feelings about Christopher Nolan's re-imagining of ""Batman Begins"".

Ducard (Liam Neeson) waits for Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a jail cell, somewhere in Asia. He tells Wayne about a mysterious group of men he works with, who train to rid the world of evil. Arranging for his release, Ducard tells him how to find their camp. There, Wayne meets Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, ""The Last Emperor""), the leader of the League of Shadows, a group of highly trained men determined to make the world a safe place. Upon completion of his training, Wayne travels back to Gotham and finds the city in a state of decay. His former girlfriend, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) is a District Attorney working to clean up the increasingly corrupt political system. She realizes that a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, ""28 Days Later""), is transferring all of a local crime lord's (Tom Wilkinson) henchmen into his custody at Arkum Asylum. Alfred (Michael Caine) welcomes Wayne back to his ancestral home, Wayne Manor. As Bruce announces his plans, Alfred becomes a confidant and assistant. Meeting Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), an inventor employed by Wayne Industries, Wayne begins to assemble the arsenal necessary for his transformation to Batman. As he begins to fight the evil in Gotham, he meets Sergeant Gordon (Gary Oldman), perhaps the last honest cop in Gotham.

I am a big fan of the Tim Burton ""Batman"" films, especially the first one. But Christopher Nolan (""Memento"", ""Insomnia"") has created a whole new vision of the character. I never really read a lot of superhero comic books as a kid. To me, the whole fun of watching the film versions is to witness the mythology of these characters. Some of the characters, like Batman, Superman and Spider Man, have been in our culture for so long they have reached the level of myth. Who doesn't know at least a little of the story of Superman's creation? Or Batman's? In ""Batman Begins"", Nolan creates a detailed, interesting, exciting film about the origins of Bruce Wayne and his superhero alter ego.

Fitting a lot of information into the film, Nolan moves things along at a breakneck pace. A lot is going on, but it is easy to follow as well because the director uses words, actions, visual references and more to inform us. Isn't this what all directors should do? But how many are successful? This is a tribute solely to the writer and director. As we watch Wayne go through his training, Nolan inserts flashbacks to Wayne's childhood, giving us a glimpse of the fears that have so far shaped his life. The training includes a terrific sequence in which Wayne has to find a particular man, standing amongst identically dressed warriors, as the men move in unison, before fighting him. Upon his return to Wayne Manor, the other characters enter the picture and we learn about them. This is one of the best things about the film; there is so much going on. Just because the film is about a comic book superhero, Nolan didn't feel it necessary to dumb down the plot or the characters or make it simplistic. This is a film for young (well, not too young) and old alike.

There is also a significant amount of humor peppered throughout the film. Wayne's relationships with Alfred (Caine) and Lucius (Freeman) create a lot of the humor, and warmth for that matter, in his life. In one scene, Alfred explains that Wayne needs to keep up appearances as a billionaire playboy, if he wants to divert attention from his alter ego. Therefore, he arrives at a party, in a flashy car, with two models sitting in the passenger seat. Alfred becomes less a butler and more a confidant to Wayne, more so than in any other incarnation of the story. And this works brilliantly, providing him with a sense of history, reason and grounding.

The look of the film is also fantastic. Using real sets, for the most part, the action has a sense of urgency and place. Thankfully, they didn't use CGI to recreate everything, as they did in ""Star Wars Episode III"". It is my understanding that Chicago provided the backdrop for Gotham, with embellishments created by CGI. When you see it, you will understand why this is so important. Obviously, there is a significant amount of CGI work involved, but using a real backdrop gives the setting a quality that has been lacking in other films lately. All of this work helps to create the world these characters live in, making everything more believable. Because we believe Gotham really exists, the action, the danger and the story all are more believable.

Christian Bale is a really good actor. One thing that can be said of all of his performances is that they are interesting. You might not like the character, or the film, but at least they were interesting. As Bruce Wayne, Bale brings a solemn air, an intensity that works. Wayne has some dark moments in his past and his upbringing and Bale is the right choice for this part. He is also able to inject humor and a lighthearted quality, at times, making the character three dimensional and interesting. When we experience a flashback of a traumatic event in his childhood, it is a very moving moment, because it brings us closer to Bale's portrayal of Wayne.

Let's face it, the supporting cast is fantastic. Any movie that has Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Ken Watanabe, Rutger Hauer and Liam Neeson isn't going to be bad. And ""Begins"" is great, in large part due to the superb work of these actors, Cillian Murphy and even the future Mrs. Tom Cruise. The key to the success of all is that they are all playing the roles seriously. Yes, some of them have slightly humorous moments, but overall, they believe in these characters, their world, their actions. I know I sound like a broken record, but because they believe, we believe.

Michael Caine, in particular, stands out. This, for me, was the most exciting casting choice in the film. The moment I learned that he had been cast to play Alfred, I was very excited. It is such perfect casting. In the role, Caine brings a layer of depth and conviction to the character we haven't seen before. Alfred has invested so much of his life in this family that he deeply cares about their legacy. This is a nice touch to the character and adds a certain amount of gravitas to the role.

Cillian Murphy is also great as Dr. Jonathan Crane. Completely believable, he brings a real sense of menace, creating a memorable villain whose plan is very diabolical and multifaceted. Again, Nolan keeps what could be a complicated idea understandable, by revealing various aspects throughout the story. Murphy is also completely convincing as an American psychiatrist, even though he is Irish. There is no trace of his accent. Murphy has created a small handful of very good performances and appears to be poised to continue this streak.

The story, as mentioned before, is very detailed. Towards the end, there are a few plot twists which surprised me. And I am almost never surprised by plot twists. They are developed well throughout and add a nice layer, creating additional suspense and intrigue.

Nolan also manages to keep the film dark, much like Film Noir, without going too far over the edge. Gotham is drenched in shadow, the streets riddled with crime. The hero and the tone throughout are dark, but broken up by some great action scenes and light hearted humor. As the villain's plan begins to unfold, the story becomes darker and may be too intense for little children. For kids over a certain age, and adults, this just helps the film become that much more... you, know, believable.

There are some terrific action sequences throughout the film. In a couple, as Batman fights the bad guys, the scenes are presented in a unique, almost impressionistic fashion. A glimpse of Batman rappelling down, a shot of thugs getting their heads knocked together, a brief look at another crook flying into the air with Batman. This is a unique idea. Generally, we see every fist hitting flesh, every cut, every ounce of blood spilling. In ""Begins"", a lot of the action is suggested to us, leaving our minds to sort out the actual details. This idea works really well.

The film also has one of the coolest beginnings I have seen in a long time. Again, rather impressionistic, the opening credits suggest rather than inform.

Generally, I can't stand the thought of a sequel. Can't anyone do anything original in Hollywood? They always have to rely on a sequel? ""Batman Begins"" was made because Warner Bros. wanted to reenergize the franchise. And Nolan has done that. At the end of the film, there is a brief coda setting up the inevitable sequel. In this case, Nolan suggests that there is so much more to be done with the story, the characters, the villains, that I welcome a sequel.

Bring on the sequels, Mr. Nolan.",1118880000,3,8988,4.7525641025641026
1577621,4,B00005JNJV,"It's still early in the summer movie season, but so far two beloved-but-ailing film franchises have gotten radical, much-needed reboots.

 Barely a month after the Star Wars saga wrapped itself up with a worthy finale, ""Batman Begins"" arrives and it, too, renews a series many had written off.

 There have been four previous ""Batman"" movies in the past two decades: Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" were wry, stylish epics but they got hijacked by colorful villains who stole the show from the hero. By contrast, director Joel Schumacher's follow-ups (""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"") were Day Glo affairs too campy to take seriously.

 But ""serious"" is definitely the operative word for this fifth, latest and best entry.

 Writer-director Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") rejuvenates the Batman legend by first unveiling a chapter the other movies avoided - the story of just how the Caped Crusader got his cape in the first place.

 Origins are always the best parts of superhero movies (think of young Clark Kent racing trains in ""Superman,"" or Spiderman coming into his own as a webslinger) and this ""Batman"" begins with as tall as tale as a comic book fan could want:

 After a mugger's bullets leave billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) an orphan, he dedicates his life to fighting crime. His quest leads him to Asia, where he learns martial arts from a terror squad called the League of Shadows and has to face some tough dilemmas about the divide between justice and vengeance.

 Upon his return to Gotham City, Wayne uses his wealth to become Batman with the aid of his trusty butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), and his Q-like weapons designer, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman); Fox's Batmobile is one of the movie's coolest touches.

 But Bats has barely even hung out his superhero shingle before he spots bad guys on the horizon: A powerful gangster whose vast network corrupts the city; a masked menace called The Scarecrow whose weapons give his victims terrifying hallucinations; and a murkier, more ominous threat from Wayne's past.

 This is clearly a comic book movie aimed at older fans and Nolan plays everything very, very straight, despite the fact that this is also still a story of a guy who runs around alleys in tights and pointy ears.

 Nolan's gritty, realistic vibe usually works, though, and it's aided by assured turns from some of the best actors around: Bale (definitely the most anguished of the Batmen), Caine, Freeman, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Gary Oldman, who can now add ""Commissioner Gordon"" to an acting resume that includes Beethoven, Sid Vicious and Lee Harvey Oswald.

 And though the movie's deadly serious tone prevents it from winking (which is good) it also robs it of a lot of the giddy fun of most comic book films - Batman may fly by night but by day Wayne is covered in bruises.

 In fact, as with the latest ""Star Wars"" movie, this is a joltingly grim adventure, a far spookier outing than most PG-13 films. While that edge will be exactly what most fans of the Dark Knight ordered, viewers in the Happy Meal demographic may find the movie's intensity and adult themes rough going.",1118880000,5,3153,4.894538606403013
1577622,5,B00005JNJV,"I just saw this movie last night, and it blew my socks off.  This is the beginning of a beautiful franchise.  It was even better than Tim Burton's takes on Batman, which I loved.  Christian Bale is the first truly scary Batman.  All of the actors are excellent, the story was exciting, the villians didn't overtake the movie...probably the best summer movie this year.",1118880000,4,368,4.703125
1577623,5,B00005JNJV,"Okay, I went in with pretty low expectations. The last two Batman movies were aweful, and the original preview of ""Begins"" didn't impress me much. I got a bit into the hype and saw it in the giant Imax theater, though. I was completely blown away.

This film pulls you in from the start and doesn't let you go till the last 'batarang' falls. It actually had a very interesting plot, some mystery, and a neat twist. Being Batman, it also had awesome fight scenes.

This movie really captures the essence of the Dark Knight. The movie is dark and paints a vivid picture of the real Gotham City. Bruce is a brooding, vengeful hero who walks the fine line between savior and conqueror. The movie really explores his inner demons and his moral dillemas.

This is a must see, even if you are not a fan of the series. It was ten times better than Spiderman 2, which I had thought of as the best hero movie prior to this. It has superb acting and the plot is just great. Christian Bale is perfect as Batman and Michael Cane is great as Alfred. I'd give this movie a 6/5 if I could.",1118880000,3,1073,4.275862068965517
1577704,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is such a good, involving film, it almost renders all past film incarnations obsolete! The only one worth mentioning in a positive light from now on is Tim Burton's 1989 original-but I still liked this better.

  Christian Bale is absolutely dead-on as Batman/Bruce Wayne! I remember being pleased with the news of his casting, but his performance exceeded my expectations. He nails both the intensity and the wry humor the character should always have, and he actually looks the part of both Bruce (handsome playboy) and Batty (physically intimidating, athletic). The supporting cast here is quite impressive (They actually support without taking away from the central character. Genius!). Michael Caine is actually better than the previous Alfred, which is saying a lot! Morgan Freeman is reliable as ever, as is Gary Oldman. Liam Neeson is also in fine form in what you initially think is an obvious prototype performance as the wise mentor. Even Katie Holmes comes off at least as good as Kirsten Dunst did in Spiderman.

  Other helpful attributes to this film are it's story, which thankfully takes the time to explain itself and, as a result, all the usual Batman myths become more than just convenient plot devices. Also, the tone of the movie just feels right. It's dark and serious when necessary, always edgy, and adds just the right amount of quirky winking humor at just the right times. This is probably due to Christopher Nolan's more-than-capable directing. He is a real talent and has yet to have a misstep in his short but impressive career. The music is typical Hans Zimmer material without much of a theme (not a criticism) and not very comic-book sounding a la Danny Elfman, but still evokes a since of legend and excitement.

  Overall, Batman Begins is a real summer treat! An entertaining film that rings true on just about every level. This lumbering franchise has been both redeemed and taken to new heights, and I for one can't wait to see how it unfolds this time in sequel form. As long as they keep the essential elements of this film intact, it should be a very enjoyable ride!",1118880000,2,2122,4.85595567867036
1577705,5,B00005JNJV,"Since his first dramatic appearance in Detective Comics in 1939, Batman has grown to become a pop-culture icon.  From movie serials in the 40's, to a classic campy TV show in the 60's, to a solid animated series in the 90's, fans have thrilled to the super heroics of this unique character. However, as a film franchise, he has brought results that were somewhat less than impressive creatively.  While the Tim Burton directed films, BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS were stylish and dark, they also suffered from plot holes you could drive a Batmobile through.  Then Joel Schumacher introduced a Day-Glo sensibility to the Dark Knight in BATMAN FOREVER, before drowning the character in ludicrous costumes (a Bat suit with nipples???), pun-filled foes, and whiney sidekicks in the lousy BATMAN & ROBIN.  By then, Batman as cinematic property had become a laughingstock.  Fortunately, indie film director Christopher Nolan reinvigorates the franchise in glorious form in BATMAN BEGINS, a reboot of the Batman legend that, for the first time, puts the focus squarely on our hero and not on the over-the-top villains of past films.  Nolan also bases the film in a strong semblance of reality that allows the audience to not only accept the possibility of the winged vigilante, but embrace it as well.

Most fans already know the story of how wealthy Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) loses his parents when they are slain during an attempted robbery, but the movie also tells how he chose the bat as his symbol, as well as the steps needed to become the avenger of the night that he turns into.  Disillusioned and frustrated by Gotham City's corrupt judicial system, the young Wayne goes abroad to study the criminal mind.  Later, while locked in an Asian prison, Wayne is recruited by the enigmatic Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers him a path in which to focus his anger and hone his skills.  Wayne eventually joins his new mentor as a recruit in the mysterious League of Shadows, headed by the sinister Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Wantanabe).  Eventually, Wayne realizes that he cannot follow the League's extreme methods of dispensing justice and returns to Gotham to forge his own way.  It soon turns out that Wayne's return is just in time as Gotham falls prey to a fear epidemic engineered by the twisted Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA ""the Scarecrow"" (Cillian Murphy) and a familiar figure from Wayne's past.

From the top on down, this film is blessed with a solid cast that adds wonderfully to Nolan's vision.  As the title hero, Christian Bale blows all other Batman portrayers out of the water with his intense and scary take of the role.  This is a Batman that you not only fear, but can relate to as well.  In fact, he turns in the definitive performance.  Michael Caine adds warmth and humor as Wayne's trusty butler, Alfred.  Liam Neeson does a great variation of his usual mentor roles as Ducard, a man with his own surprising secret.  As an assistant DA and Wayne's childhood friend, Katie Holmes does a nice job with what is basically a thankless role.  Cillian Murphy makes for a perfectly creepy Scarecrow, while Morgan Freeman is solid as usual as the man who provides Batman's wondrous car and gadgets.  Gary Oldman is wonderfully cast against type as Jim Gordon, one of Gotham's few honest cops.  The scene in which he drives the tank-like Batmobile is a sheer delight.

The screenplay by Nolan and David Goyer (who wrote the BLADE films) is awash with characterization and motivation...something that you don't see in many comic book films as a rule.  In fact, you get so engrossed by the proceedings that you almost forget that you are watching a ""superhero"" film in the first place.  The special effects are used to enhance the story and not overpower it, while the set design pictures a Gotham that is a unique cross of Chicago, New York and Hong Kong.  If there is a flaw, it lies in some of the fight sequences.  Done in close-ups and quick cuts, they can get frustrating for those who want to see more of Batman's fighting style.  However, this is very minor since the story never ceases to grasp your attention.

In the end, Nolan and his superb cast and crew succeed in achieving what was once thought impossible: the resurrection of a film franchise that, if not dead, was at least on life support. As a result, Batman is once again flying high and BATMAN BEGINS is a film that I wholeheartedly recommend.",1118880000,480,4406,4.752956636005257
1577706,5,B00005JNJV,"Bale has always been one of my faviorte actors ever since American Psycho. He always seems to never get any credit for his performances, and in this movie he shines. The movie is dark, action is heavy in places, but the writing was blah. The movie had a few flaws, but I still enjoyed the movie. People who don't like the movie are either iggorant people who write reviews to piss people off or they didn't like it because it didn't have enough action or have a short attention span and cant pay attention. First off, the acting was excellent, the action was great, and the movie didn't have a cheese factor like the other four movies do.

1577709,5,B00005JNJV,"Not to worry! ""Batman Begins"" is nowhere near the trainwrecks that were ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin"" .. aside from Katie Holmes (a poor choice for the character of Rachel Dawes), this movie is enjoyable from start to finish!

This movie is dark, gripping, and action-packed. The acting is OK for the most part, as is the plot, of course. Aside from a few dodgy scenes (including the death of the parents and when Batman confronts some fat villain-esq type character), this movie's filled with style and substance and will have you keeping your eyes glued to the screen.

Morgan Freeman, thankfully, is tolerable in this movie and fits nicely into his role. Nothing over-done, nothing small. Just right.

But surely the biggest flaw of this movie is the fact that Katie Holmes was cast(ed) as the leading-lady. This woman gives us a C-grade performance and somewhat de-rails this movie's potential. I say they should've gone with a stunning blonde or brunette who knew how to act well -- and who could've had actual chemistry with The Caped Crusader. Katie Holmes seems all right when she first appears, but ultimately she's D.O.A. and I'm not happy she was put in this film.

This film's not campy. At all. It has some good dialogue and some pretty sharp/ace lines. This film's a lot darker than its predecessors and it's more intense.

Christian Bale made for a decent Batman. He's a finer pick than Val Kilmer and George Clooney.

Oh, and the ending leads us to think that there's room for a sequel. Hopefully we'll get one in 07/08.

It was well worth paying $5 to see this movie in the theatre.

..Oh, and how creepy was The Scarecrow?! ..Ugh. I might just have nightmares! Awesome villain in this one!",1118793600,3,1715,4.712374581939799
1577710,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is a slow starter. It goes into great depth about Bruce Wayne's history with flashbacks inside of flashbacks. This is done early on in the movie to such a pain staking degree that some people may think it was a mistake to expect this to be an action movie. People may chalk it up to a boring movie and stop watching before giving it a chance.

Batman Begins may start slow, but it builds momentum so gradually that by the end you're on a roller coaster ride going breakneck speed and your not even sure exactly at what point the true ride started. Instead of being numbed by the non-stop, start to finish barrage of action, you're left with the thrill of having been taken through a progressive ride.

Batman Begins also makes an unusual choice in using some of the more obscure villains. Most writers would typically go for the big names: Joker, Riddler, Catwoman et al. This movie goes for villains that you wouldn't probably recognize without being a fan. Sure anyone who has seen the animated series knows who Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow are. But this has some appearances by some villains even more obscure than that: Zsasz and Joe Chill for starters.

While the character selection may seem to limit the audience to long time Batman fans only, what it really does is open the movie up to being taken to a place that most people have never seen Batman before.

There are several little nuances that make this Batman stand out from any previous incarnations. Newcomers can follow it. Fans can appreciate it. This is said with all possible respect due to the amazing movies done by Tim Burton. Batman Begins truly is the best of the Batman films out there.",1118793600,2,1676,4.576666666666667
1577711,4,B00005JNJV,"Today, on opening day, I watched ""Batman Begins.""  And while I am no expert on the associated comic books and graphic novels, I have seen Tim Burton's ""Batman"" movie from 1989 more times than I can count.  It's the only one that really mattered, until now, so the contrasts I draw will reference this movie more than Joel Schumacher's two lackluster attempts (""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"") and Tim Burton's own ""Batman Returns.""

Director Christopher Nolan is an appropriate choice for directing this franchise in that his work has, so far, been enigmatic and dark.  ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"" both played out as creepy yarns which demanded some attention from the viewer, and if ""Batman Begins"" feels a little too straightforward compared to those two films, remember the kind of subject matter we are dealing with.  Batman is a cultural icon like Darth Vader or Frodo Baggins, and as such, any tricky storytelling for its own sake is out of the question.

""Batman Begins"" begins with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) raising hell in a prison somewhere in Asia.  Liam Neeson, the mentor du jour for action stories, plays a martial arts expert named Ducard.  He recruits Wayne and encourages him to seek vengeance for his parents' slayings back in Gotham City, as part of a bigger housecleaning project he has in mind.  Nolan also goes to some trouble to set up Bruce Wayne's motivations: he thinks that his own fear caused his parents' deaths, hence his guilt, anger, and shame.  All of this is fine except that it takes a bit too long.  Where Tim Burton's ""Batman"" of 1989 skimped on the backstory, and just laid pieces of Wayne's past for the viewer to assemble, here the backstory ends up being a good chunk of the film.  It's action-packed enough, but a bit cumbersome.

When the story gets back to the States, Nolan avoids the eternal nightscape of a highly stylized, comic book style Gotham City (""Batman"" '89), populated by blocky American cars and one-dimensional yet entertaining characters, and instead creates a Gotham City that feels more like something we might actually encounter in the USA circa 2005.  It's the classic Gotham City crossed with the futuristic Los Angeles of ""Blade Runner.""  It's a city with slums, skyscrapers, and elevated trains, like Chicago or New York.

Bruce Wayne's metamorphosis from confused rich kid to tormented superhero is also depicted in some detail.  Where in previous movies Batman's existence is just taken for granted, here his transition comes into focus.  The effect is much like the explication in Sam Raimi's recent ""Spider-man,"" and although it answers many practical questions about our protagonist, it also leads to many other questions.  For example, Wayne Enterprises has for some reason created a $300,000 piece of body armor which Bruce uses for his alter-ego, but now we have to wonder: why did the company design it in the first place? The Batmobile, while very cool, falls under the same category.  It seems to exist, complete but for black paint, only because Batman needs a Batmobile.

The supporting cast is rather hit and miss.  Of the ones that Nolan got right, Morgan Freeman does well what he knows how to do, and Rutger Hauer is laudable as a condescending corporate man with ambitions.  Cillian Murphy is appropriately icy in his role as Dr. Jonathan Crane.  Michael Caine is flawless as Wayne's father figure and right-hand man Alfred.  Here he actually represents an important character, a moral compass in a murky world, whereas in previous iterations, Alfred was little more than a cliche.  The biggest surprise, however, is perennial villain Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the one honest cop in a city of crooked ones.  Who knew?

The misfires include Katie Holmes as D.A. Rachel Dawes; how exactly does a perky twenty-something pole-vault her way to the top of Gotham City's law enforcement community?  Tom Wilkinson is also miscast, as crime boss Carmine Falcone.  Wilkinson is an excellent actor (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""In the Bedroom"" both come readily to mind), but here he lays it on pretty thick.  I can't help but think Danny Aiello or James Caan would have been a more appropriate choice.

The action is good though, and there is plenty of it.  It's got those dazzling moments you'll remember long after you leave the theater.  Naturally the end of the movie sets up sequels, but not in an obvious way -- more in a way that makes you go ""hmmmm.""

Overall, ""Batman Begins"" is a pleasure to watch, and Christian Bale inhabits his character ably and credibly.  This rendition of the Batman story weighs in at 140 minutes, and although it does not feel extremely sluggish, it could have used just a bit of streamlining in the editor's room.

Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

Go for other reviews for in-depth analysis of this person's performance or the script's cohesiveness or the breathtaking quality of the cinematography. I'm keeping it simple. It freaking rocks.

I feel like I just rode the best rollercoaster at the fair, and now I can't wait to use the rest of my ride tickets to do the same rollercoaster over and over again. It's been years since an action movie elicited this kind of excitment from me and it feels great.

Will someone please buy George Lucas a ticket to this movie, so he can see how it's done?

1577803,5,B00005JNJV,"Oh good lord, it's about time a good Batman movie came out. I think it's safe to that 99.9 percent of the population was disappointed and offended by the proverbial turd that was ""Batman & Robin"" (released in 1997, it was the last time the Caped Crusader had graced the silver screen). Thankfully, ""Batman Begins,"" making good on it's name, has no connections to the other four films Warner Bros. put out (you know, other than the fact that they are ""Batman"" movies). This new film is an attempt at jump-starting and revitalizing a franchise that really needs it. What better time to bring the Bat back? Comic-book movies are enormously successful these days (unless you consider ""Elektra"") and fans have been screaming for years for a new film to be made. One that makes up for the bad time we all had in 1997. One that makes us all appreciate Batman again, and doesn't make us feel ashamed to be fans.

Director Christopher Nolan (""Insomnia,"" ""Memento"") steps up to the plate, leading an outstanding cast which includes Christian Bale as the big-earred superhero in question, and recent tabloid queen Katie Holmes as his childhood friend/love interest. Nolan knows style. If you've ever seen one of his films, you know why he was the obvious choice for this project. True, he's not very well-versed in action flicks, but his dark vision is perfect for Batman. Needless to say, he succeeds in making this the best Batman movie to date. Yep, I said it. Even better than Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns."" I love those films to death (heck, even ""Batman Forever"" was pretty decent), they are an important part of my childhood, but Nolan's Batman goes places Burton never bothered. Here, we are treated to the true origins of Bruce Wayne, the man, and how he came to be Batman. We get connected to him, and we feel for him, which is something I never quite felt in the other flicks. Half the movie is spent building up this enormous, complex character. True, it can wear down on you a bit if you're just in it for some heavy action scenes, or if you have a short attention span and just wanna watch an action figure commercial, but ""Batman Begins"" is better than that. Did I mention how good Christian Bale (who you may remember chasing a hooker with a chainsaw, wearing nothing but sneakers in ""American Psycho"") is as Batman? He's great. Cillian Murphy (""28 Days Later"") as The Scarecrow? Brilliant. I really can't picture anyone else in that role. Michael Caine definitely delivers as Alfred, as does Morgan Freeman as Lucuis Fox (but they're always great). Heck, even Katie Holmes manages to break free from her teenage fame, turning in a performance that is only topped by her topless performance in Sam Raimi's ""The Gift.""

Everything about this movie is just incredible. I thought we were treated when ""Star Wars"" went out with a fight last month, and now Batman finally gets his respect with ""Batman Begins."" How perfect. If you're a bat-fan, you'd be hard pressed not to like this movie. It is very well made and very respectful to the source material. Yeah, it's a little long, but so was ""Batman & Robin,"" and I know you watched that at least once. So why not give this one a chance?

1577805,2,B00005JNJV,"The Dark Knight returns?  Not like this.  Christopher Nolan's grand idea of putting Batman in a realistic setting has done nothing but stamp out the magic we used to feel.  Stripping a superhero and his world of their fantasy takes away something crucial: the film can't take us away with it.  It can't capture our imaginations.  Worse still, Nolan moves the film (and the editing) too quickly, and we can't absorb what we're seeing.  ""Batman Begins"" is a clunky, impersonal movie, devoid of any real soul, and woefully short on imagination.  Mostly to blame is Goyer's script, a collection of action movie cliches in the guise of a story.  It's so by-the-numbers that Batman could be replaced by any action hero; he's unnessecary in his own movie.  The same goes for the lead villain, Ra's al Ghul (Liam Neeson), who's stripped of everything that made his comic counterpart unique.  He isn't immortal, there's no Lazurus Pit,  not even Talia shows up.  Goyer transforms him into just another stock villain, blowing his chance to bring a character on par with the Joker to the silver screen.  The second villain, the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), seems to have ben added as an afterthought, but we need him.  He picks up the slack.  Murphy is the only one doing anything of distinction.  He's genuinely creepy, and he fills the screen.  He's enough for a whole movie, but he barely gets any screentime, and he has so little to do with the story that he doesn't need to be there at all.  Most of the screen time is devoted to Christian Bale's Batman, but he's a complete blank (a faceless actor for a faceless character), and his Batman's been nuetered; the movie preaches like an evangelist to choose justice, not vengence.  But Batman's a creature of vengence.  And this movie's Batman works through his issues like a therapy patient, leaving him with no need for vigilance.  This movie is less faithful to the comic than anything you've ever seen: this isn't Batman, just a stale Superman in black.  The first two movies transcended the comic book genre.  They had genuine artistry in them.  This film is nothing than typical action fare with a coat of black gloss, burdened with a flaccid lead and bit parts for its best actors.

I only hope that the film makers can sustain this pace for the next film.  For the first time a I actually believed that we were watching the real Batman for once. Michael Cane was exceptional as Alfred and Morgan Freeman was one of the  best choices for Batman's Q, as I call him. Q in the Bond movies created all the devices Bond utilizes in his missions. Liam Neeson was terrific as Ras Au Gul (if I spelled it correctly) there was at no time any credibility issues with the film. It was a winner from start to finish.",1118793600,,665,4.171875
1577807,5,B00005JNJV,I just saw this movie on opening day with my nephew and his friend..and my gosh!! I was so amazed by it. It was almost as great as the oringal Tim Burton film. And that's saying alot! Bale did a wonderful job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman...almost out doing Micheal Keaton. The acting was wonderful....every one really put everything they had into their given role. I loved the fact that we got to watch Jim Gordon as he rose through the ranks over the course of the movie.  Micheal Cain had some funny lines and all the flashbacks with young Bruce and his father really tugs hard on your heart strings! I must admit though the secnes showing people's fears after being exposed to Scarecrow's fear gas were a bit scary and could give younger viewers nightmares. Another than that I high recomend this movie to every one! Batman fans or just movie lovers GO SEE THIS MOVIE AS SOON AS POSSIABLE!!,1118793600,,895,4.49079754601227

1577809,5,B00005JNJV,"I just saw this movie and I came out of the theater really satisfied that it wasn't another Bat-astrophy.  Even more than that, it's a well plotted, intense action movie.  The best so far this summer.  They should bury those other four Bat-movies.  Well, maybe that's not fair.  This movie does owe a little to Tim Burton's original, but it has so much more substance to it.  For the first time Bruce Wayne is a three dimensional character I sympathized with.  His early years of training and the characters he encounters have far reaching effects on him, as do his parents.  And boy, does the suspense really build as the clock ticks down on Gotham City's fate.

  Something kind of interesting is, there aren't any big superhero fight scenes like we've seen in movies like Spider-man or X-men.  The fighting is gritty, camera-shaking action, usually shown in glimpses.  And there are trippy hallucinations that amp up the scary factor a bit.  It is intense...and just a great movie.  I want to see it again.",1118793600,2,1009,4.718390804597701
1577810,4,B00005JNJV,"It's funny how Warner Brother's didn't want Tim Burton back for the 3rd movie since he made the movies too dark. Yet Batman Begins is probably the darkest and most serious of all. I guess Warner Brother's learned that darker is better than goofy and overly colorful since Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. This is the best since Tim Burton's films and what a Batman film should be like. Christopher Nolan gives the film a human touch and makes it more about Bruce Wayne and his feelings than about the villains. The other movies sorta just made Bruce Wayne/Batman a side character to the villains. Speaking of the villains Nolan takes them seriously. They don't prance around saying silly lines in this one. Plus I also doubt Nolan is ever gonna focus on shots of Batman's butt like Joel Schumacher did. He takes everything about it seriously.

  Maybe too serious though since it could use to lighten up just a little a bit. Besides having a problem with that. I don't like how Batman talks while in the costume though. I found it a little silly how deep and monster like his voice sounds. Also Roger Ebert acts like the whole poison gas thing is 100% original for a villain to do in a Batman movie. The Joker did that in the first movie. I do like how this gas puts fear into people though. The gas in the original just made people die with goofy smiles on their faces. The Scare Crow (Cillain Murphy) is what a villain should be like. He doesn't burp and say ""was that over the top ? I never can tell"", he's 100% serious. Cillain Murphy from 28 Days Later does a fine job playing him too. The other villains are well played also and don't goof around what so ever.

  Christian Bale makes a great Batman and the best since Michael Keaton. He has a lot of inner-demons to fight in the movie. He first thinks he needs to kill the man that killed his parents. When he tells his childhood friend Rachel (Katie Holmes) his plan. She slaps him and says ""your dad would be ashamed"". So he runs away from Gotham City and meets Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard trains Bruce how to be a ninja and how to control his fears. When Bruce discovers that Ducard and Ra's Al Ghil (Ken Watanbe) have evil plans for Gotham City he decides that's not the sort of man he is. He then goes back to Gotham City. There he turns a tunnel he discovered as a kid into...the batcave. Then he gets all sorts of gadgets ""including the batmobile"" from a loyal Wayne employee Lucius Fox (Moragn Freeman). He decides to dress like a bat since bats were always his fear. So he decides to use his fear as a weapon.

  It's nice to the see the actual tranformation he makes to Batman in this one. That was never seen in the other films. We see him use all those gadgets in the other films but never had a clue how he got them. I always doubted he made all of them on his own. So the Lucius Fox character is a nice touch. Plus with Ducard we also know that Batman didn't just train himself to fight. There's just so many characters to mention in this film. Nolan actually fits in a nice ammount of screen time for them too. Rutger Hauer gets to make the best out  of a small part. He is the type of actor who can make a small part seem like a bigger one. That's how good of an actor he is. He plays the not so nice guy who takes over the Wayne business after Bruce's dad is killed. He told Bruce when he was little that he could have the business when he is ready. Which is a lie because he's not that eager to give up the job. I expected some crazy employee to kill  Haurer. I mean look at the other films. It isn't one where a villain doesn't kill his or her boss lol. Gary Oldman also shines as Lt. Gordon who is the only cop who trusts and befriends batman. I'd rather just see more of them teaming up than Robin or Batgirl ever being introduced again. Batman is much better without them. Batman is also much better without...Joel Schumacher lol.",1118793600,,3918,4.2668463611859835

1577899,5,B00005JNJV,"Batman Begins is a great addition to the Tim Burton Batman films and in my opinion it slightly surpasses those, but not by much. Let me just get the two negatives I have of the film off my back to begin with. The fight scenes were way too choppy to the point of not being able to tell who was hitting who and it lacks the comic book fun of the first two Batman films (I know it is suppose to be more realistic). Now the great things... Christian Bale shines as Bruce Wayne/Batman proving he is a star on the rise. Check him out in The Machinist where he went from 184 pounds to a skeletal 121 pounds. After he shot that film, Bale had to gain back his original weight and put on around 30 pounds (close to 100 lbs. in only 5 months) of bulk to play Batman. That is one dedicated actor if I do say so myself and I liked him just as much as Keaton in the role because he had the physical build (something Keaton lacked) to go along with the good acting chops to play Batman. The supporting cast is great as well, with Liam Neeson (very good here), Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman being the standouts. The villians are almost side characters in the story, which is drastically different from Burton's films where the bad guys were on screen as much as Batman was. I like how they used very little CGI and relied on real stunts and explosions. The score was well done as well, even though there was no great theme like in the Danny Elfman soundtracks. I am a fan of Burton's Batmobile design, but this one is just as cool in a more realistic way. Some people actually got up too quickly and missed the Joker reference at the end, so make sure you see the credits before leaving.",1118793600,,1676,4.208074534161491
1577900,5,B00005JNJV,"At the beginning of the movie, I was afraid about how Bruce Wayne become The BATMAN. But Christian Bale is since Michael Keaton, the only who can brought this legend come true.

  The screenplay is uncredible and very complete. You can forget everything you've seen before. BATMAN BEGINS is now the new reference in Super heroes movies. Spider-man, you don't have the lead anymore.",1118793600,,381,4.921875
1577901,4,B00005JNJV,"Don't get me wrong - this is not a negative review. I am speaking as another Bat-geek; one who has waited years for someone to get it right. Nolan & Co. gave us the most true vision we'll probably ever see. However, there is a HUGE flaw in the story. I felt this had to be shared where perhaps some of you will agree with me, some won't. In this movie, BATMAN DOESN'T KILL OR MAIM HIS VICTIMS. This is the best, darkest 'Batman' to date and Bruce Wayne IS scary as hell. But by the end of the movie, my fear of him deminished, as did everyone else's in the theater. This is due to the fact that Batman beats up all his criminals and leaves them to be found by police. The movie reveals that most cops are crooked in Gotham, as are high standing judicial and political figures. So why would a criminal fear The Bat if they're just knocked out, and then released from jail a few days later? That dilemma really undermines Wayne's effectiveness and ultimate goal: to strike fear and erradicate the criminal element. My main point: since the movie is so dark and was really tipping in that direction, maybe vigilante justice would be appropriate in this new Gotham that has been set up for us. It really is a terrific movie and I know I'm gonna catch hell for saying this, but please, PLEASE - for the next movie, let Batman kill off the heads of criminal organizations and maim their respective thugs. If not for people like me, do it for the children.",1118793600,,1449,4.330882352941177
1577902,4,B00005JNJV,"I didn't think the kid could pull off the newest version of the Dark Knight, but he does at least as good a job as Michael Keaton and actually comes off more dark - although contrived in places.

The story follows the origin of Batman but does not stick with the Tim Burton storyline. For one, Batman's parents are not killed by Jack Napier - the criminal who becomes the Joker. Commissioner Gordon also has his relationship bridged to Batman in this film but again, it doesn't follow the original 1990 film version.

The SCARECROW is not the scarecrow you might have remembered. They water down this particular villain so much that he looks little more than a drop in a bucket. In truth, he is merely the ""pawn"" of a much greater evil.

Once again, we see Liam Neeson portraying the mentor type(See also Star Wars Episode One, Gangs of New York, and Kingdom of Heaven), as he teaches a young Bruce Wayne all about the ways of fighting technique and skill. It is notable that young Bruce already possesses some knowledge of the martial arts. No explanation is given in how he came to know some very remarkable moves.

BEFORE YOU BELIEVE THE HYPE ABOUT THIS BEING THE BEST INSTALLMENT in the Batman series, watch it first. Even with the great acting ensemble (Morgan Freeman, Bale, Gary Oldman, Holmes, Nolan), the original Batman still has a slight edge in my opinion due to the Nicholson performance and deeper sense of darkness surrounding Michael Keaton's portrayal of the Batman character. That's not the say the style of the original is better. This current Batman film has some of the best shots I've ever seen in the series.

Hans Zimmer provides a typical Hans Zimmer score, which is, as usual, captivating.

This is right there with the original in terms of depth and acting. The storyline is a bit more believable but folks, this is based on a comic book. If you're looking for reality, try the Independent Film Channel.

1577904,5,B00005JNJV,"Thinking about it now, I consider myself to be very lucky. I was a member of an entire generation whose first introduction to Batman was Tim Burton's stylistic 1989 film. The only Batman I knew when growing up was Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" and in the weekday afternoon cartoon, ""Batman: The Animated Series."" Not a bad place to start, almost a bit spoiled, perhaps.

Taking this introduction to Batman into account, I believe that's why so many of us felt betrayed by Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"" and especially by ""Batman & Robin."" With these two movies, Batman suddenly became corny, a joke, and had lost his edge. Many older than my generation understood it was a throwback to the '60s, but for me and everyone else that grew up on Batman from the late '80s and early '90s, it was sacrilege.

However, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to announced that the Bat-nipples are gone and, at long last, we have the best on-screen incarnation of Bruce Wayne and The Dark Knight. I suppose I could go all nit-picky and nerdy and get into those phrases like ""it didn't happen that way in the comics, mwwaahh!,"" but that's not my style. Just as Tim Burton's take on Batman was not 100% true to original creator Bob Kane, Christopher Nolan's is not either. After all, where would the fun be in a word-for-word, shot-for-shot big screen adaptation without a little personal vision?

Nowadays, getting a little older and a little wiser, I have become even more scrutinizing with how I spend my free time and which movies I drop $8.00+ bucks on. For me, the summer movie event was not Star Wars, it was Batman. And it was the first movie in a long time that I went out of my way to see at midnight on opening day. And in my not-always humble opinion, it was worth it, from start to finish.

""Batman Begins"" gives us the best movie version origins of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Taking into account the success Marvel Comics has had as of late with their big screen adaptations, including top-notch casting and infusing characters with more humanity, ""Batman Begins"" incorporates both and uses them to perfection. In no other Batman film have we received such a clear understanding of Bruce Wayne's suffering, his anguish, and excellent divide between the mask he wears and who he really is: Batman.

Tim Burton's films were fantastic in their visual style and sense of adventure, but what lacked in my opinion was a clear understanding and compassion to our hero's cause. In ""Batman Begins,"" it's more than just good guy versus bad guy; there's genuine conflict between the life Wayne wants and the Batman he needs to be.

We are given a terrific tale of how Batman came to be. I enjoyed it because it gave us the intelligent, methodical, and brooding Batman who is the servant of justice, instead of the 'ka-pow,' wise-cracking cartoon.

The casting is outstanding. In my opinion, Christian Bale is the best Batman, even though many of you will undoubtedly disagree. My reasoning is not just because he carries off the suit, but because he also gives life to Bruce Wayne, showing the conflict in carrying on between the two. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Ken Watanabe, and Liam Neeson: well done. And, yes, even Joey Potter herself, Katie Holmes, was very good.

This, without giving too much away, leads me to another point. The subplots of Bruce Wayne's love life have always been more of a distraction for me than a positive. The only previous Batman film to not play up the damsel in distress role was ""Batman Returns,"" but that was because she also happened to be criminally insane. Fortunately, Holmes' ""Rachel Dawes"" doesn't fall into the abyss of hapless on-screen females.

This is the first movie in a long time that I will probably go back to see a second time in the theater. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I can't wait for Batman's return.",1118793600,5,3923,4.723684210526316
1577905,5,B00005JNJV,"When Batman first attempts one of his stunts in the truly remarkable Batman Begins, the thought flashed across my mind ""He's going to hurt himself."" That's the level of immersion into the world of Bruce Wayne that this film is capable of.

Sometimes titles really do indicate the subject matter of works, and this is one of those occasions. This is not the story of a man with a dual identity, like the first Batman, who has difficulty balancing roles that were thrust upon him by cruel fate. This is the story, first, of how a traumatized boy almost threw his life away in blind revenge, and, granted a reprieve, turned his back on his wealth to experience another world. (It is the story of Batman as American ninja, as cheesy and offputting as that might sound, the movie does it right.) This is not a Batman of chopsocky fights and kung-fu bad guys standing in a line for a chance to fight the hero. This is a Batman who lives veiled in shadows and who employs terror and misdirection as his weapons, not brute strength. This is the story of how Bruce Wayne forges himself into Batman and it is a powerful story, even for people far beyond the normal gravitional pull of the world of comics.

I found a criticism here to be on point: asking the question Why did Bruce's parents exist through the side door instead of the front? (setting up their murder). A fair question, but not one that occured to me while watching the movie. And, a great number of such questions may occur to us after the end of this film, but I suggest that very few indeed will occur while we watch it.

Another fair criticism is that the end is overblown. It is, it is, but that is partially the disappointment at having this film end.

I must also note that this is a scary movie. I don't want to give more than that away, but it is a scary movie, in part because of the effective special effects and in part because it is so good at making its characters real, so that we truly feel their pain.

Note about casting: The film is also exceptionally well cast, not only in the main roles, but in such minor parts as Bruce Wayne's father.

A note about the direction: Sure, it's a far more conventional story than Memento and some Nolan fans may be bitterly disappointed for that reason, but if this is the conventional, it is the perfect execution of the conventional and that is really good enough.

Note about vagueness in the review: I apologize for the vagueness in parts of the review, I didn't want to give too much of the movie away. The one spoiler there is discussed elsewhere in reviews here and should come as no surprise to anyone conversant with the Batman story. I hope you watch this movie, it really is good.",1118793600,4,2701,4.411646586345381
1577906,4,B00005JNJV,"After viewing Bale's shockingly realistic performance in the machinist, I was certain that he would be an inspired choice to play the dark knight.

And having just watched a sneak preview of the movie, I can safely the directors will arrange Bale to do many more sequels. Similar to how Tobey Maguire plays the role of Peter Parker/ Spiderman to perfection, Bale does even better in his version of Batman.

Take note of the characters played by Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman. They perform an excellent job of enhancing the character of Batman, rather than outshine him like the previous films.

Fans of the comic book will also note how the creators of the film (credit to Christopher Nolan and David Goyer) kept the story close to the essence of the comic book, especially the parts when Gordon is talking to Batman (I shan't spoil it for you).

But what struck me most was when Bale puts on the costume, he fits in seamlessly, both figuratively and literally. You can actually feel his menacing presence when Batman confronts the many villains during the fight scenes.

The movie itself was incredible, you see how Bruce became Batman, his training and why he is Batman. You him take on the Scarecrow (who looks like the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz and any one in the band slipknot had a child), If you have a chance go see this movie as an I-max, You will not be dissapointed",1118793600,2,517,4.078431372549019
1577908,4,B00005JNJV,"The major flaws with ""Batman Begins"" are in the first act.  A ""lost soul"" gets mentored in the ways of this-and-that in some faraway and inhospitable locale.  Lost soul must learn to ""conquer his fears"" or something like that.  Pretty cliche stuff, and we've all seen it a hundred times.

The biggest problem with this act, however, is more technical than artistic.  I am convinced that this act was chopped down in length (the final film runs 140 minutes, which is pretty much the longest running time the studios are comfortable with because they are trying to maximize the number of showings per screen per day).  The pacing of the scenes in the first act is clumsy.  It is either poor editing, poor direction, or both (but it is probably the editing).  Just as a movie needs a beginning, middle, and an end, so does each scene in its own way need a beginning, middle, and end, and each scene needs to ""flow"" properly or it looks clunky.  There are many problems in this area in Act One.  Plus, some of the warrior training stuff is just a little silly-looking.

Things improve a bit as we move stateside in Act Two.  The pacing and flow improve.  I guess when cuts had to be made in the movie's running time, the first act received the most blows in the editing room.

There are two main villains in the film.  The Scarecrow is the more interesting of the two, though I feel the part would have been served better by an older actor.  But some of the movie's best original bits center around the effects that The Scarecrow and his weapons have on his victims.  Pretty cool stuff, actually.

Tom Wilkinson plays a crime syndicate boss, but I think he plays it all wrong.  No real menace in his performance.

There are a disappointingly high number of genre movie cliches in this film, such as the convenient way that principal characters manage to find each other so easily in a city the size of Gotham during scenes of great citywide chaos.  There are other cliches that I won't get into now, but if you have seen plenty of movies you will easily recognize them.

The Batmobile is pretty cool.

The ""evil plot"" of the main heavies strangely mirrors the Joker's plot in the 1989 ""Batman"" film.

THANKFULLY, outdoor city scenes were mostly shot in an actual city (Chicago) rather than on a soundstage, like in ""Batman"", ""Batman Returns"", etc.

Like in ""Batman Forever"", many of the fight scenes are shot so close up that you can't get a feel for the space or a sense of the action.  Why do filmmakers ALWAYS do that?

Does Christian Bale do a good job?  Of course.  He is a very fine actor and does a splendid job here.  I never worried about that for one minute since learning he was cast in the role.

The music is good without being intrusive.  There is no specific theme melody, like Danny Elfman and Eliot Goldenthal did so memorably in 1989, 1992, and 1995.  You won't leave the theatre humming the Batman theme.  But that's okay.  It keeps your attention on the film instead of on the ""whole entertainment package"".

We learn in the film's final moments who the next film's villain will be.

************  Final Analysis:  poor editing and overused cliches nearly ruin the first act.  The second and third act are far superior technically and artistically, though they still make us suffer through the occasional genre movie cliche.  Bale looks great.  This script allows his Wayne/Batman to express much more anger than previous films did.  The Scarecrow is an interesting villain that should not have been played by an actor who looks barely 23 years old.  But the actor is cute, and this IS Hollywood after all, so.....

This film had all the ingredients to be an out-of-the-park Home Run.  Instead, it is a very solid Triple.  But compared to the last ""Batman"" film entry in 1997, it is a Grand Slam.  It is darker (though still not dark enough, if you ask me) and shows that there is still some promise left in the premise.

Final note:  The scene where Bruce Wayne's parents get killed by a mugger ---  Bruce and his parents slipped out of an opera performance early because something in the opera gave young Bruce the heebie-jeebies.  So why did they exit via a side door into an dark and grimy alley instead of walking out through the front door like 99.99999999999% of the rest of the population with a functioning cerebellum would?  Even just one well-placed line of dialogue could have covered that, but the filmmakers didn't even try.  Instead, we are left to believe that the elder Mr. Wayne is, despite his character's actions prior to that moment, a blissfully ignorant idiot.",1118793600,3,4599,4.598522167487685
1578029,5,B00005JNJV,"I have just returned from a midnight showing of Batman Begins, and my reaction is that of complete astonishment. Forget Tim Burton (and I won't even mention that other director), Christopher Nolan shows us what Batman should have been from the beginning of the series. It's too bad it took so long to get to this movie.

Batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne ended up becoming the Dark Knight. We see his training, and learn what inspires him to fight for justice. Christian Bale is perfect casting, and is the best Batman to ever grace the screen. Michael Caine is a brilliant Alfred with a great sense of humor, Morgan Freeman is brilliant in his supporting role, Katie Holmes is great as Bruce's love interest, and Cillian Murphy is effectively creepy as the Scarecrow.

Batman fans, THIS is what you have been waiting to see. While I enjoyed the first two Batman movies of the original series, I felt that they were both lacking something. This Batman brings everything you wanted to see to the screen, and I will be first in line for the sequel.

Thank you to Christopher Nolan, David S. Goyer, Christian Bale, and all the rest of the cast and crew for bringing one of my favorite superheroes to life the way he should have been from the very beginning.",1118793600,2,1269,4.581497797356828
1578030,5,B00005JNJV,"I was so thrilled that Christian Bale was cast as Batman/Bruce Wayne in this prequel, because he's such a great actor, and he's work in The Machinist was amazing. I think he's portrayal of Batman is more impressive than the previous actors'. He's very attractive as Bruce Wayne, and he's so captivating as Batman. He deserves extra credit for being a British actor playing an American superhero, and he had to regain more than 50 lbs of lean muscles for the role right after he finished The Machinist.

In this movie, we get to see the Bruce Wayne having flashbacks of the killing of his parents in the alley when he was a kid. His father Dr. Thomas Wayne is played by another British actor named Linus Roache(Wings of The Dove), who is perfectly cast for the role, especially he looks similar to Bale. The man who killed his parents never got convicted, and years later, it was upto Wayne to take justice into his own hands, despite the lack of support from his friend Rachel Dawes(Katie Holmes), who was a D.A. assistant to her corrupted boss Carmine Falcone(brilliantly played by Tom Wilkinson). Bruce Wayne abandoned Gotham City and embarked on a journey in Asia.

He eventually met his mentor, Henry Ducard(Liam Neeson) and the ninja warriors that formed The League of The Shadows, whose mission was to wipe out the corrupted Gothem City. Liam Neeson looks rather unattractive in a wierd beard, and he's probably the most outstanding supporting player in this film. When he completed his training, he headed back to the Gotham City seven years later.

With the help of his housekeeper Alfred Pennyworth(Michael Caine), and Lucius Fox(Morgan Freeman), who was a weapon specialist, Wayne was able to transform into full Batman gear for the first time. He teamed up with Lt. James Gordon(Gary Oldman in a rather lowkey role) to battle the evil forces including The ScareCrow/Dr. Johnathan Crane(Cillian Murphy) who conspired to spread massive ""fear hullucination chemicals"" to destroy mankind. Wayne eventually reunited with Rachel when she was in danger and rescued her from the toxic chemicals. Just when he thought he had defeated all the bad guys, Ducard and the Ninjas arrived at his birthday party.....

The sets are very elaborate, both the structure of the Gothem City and the remote landscapes were quite an eye candy. The fight scenes were great, especially the car chase scene when the Batmobile was crossing over rooftops. The cast is irresistable, but there is not enough screentime shared between Rachel and Bruce to allow them to develop enought romantic momentum. Overall, this movie is very entertaining, and it's the first time to see so much of Bruce Wayne that isn't depicted in previous Batman movies. I do hope it's going to be a blockbuster, so that they would get Christian Bale to play Batman again.",1118793600,2,2826,4.905857740585774
1578031,5,B00005JNJV,"This review is spoiler-free,

I have to admit that going into theaters, I had my doubts.  Christopher Nolan, the director, was primarily known for the exceedingly clever Memento.  A Batman movie would require this new director to flex muscles he hadn't yet displayed.  My worries were misplaced; the cleverness displayed in Memento translated well to Batman.  This is easily the best Batman movie yet.

The first two Batmans were well received and are loved by many.  The tone is unrelentingly dark for the most part.  These two never really did it for me....I could never buy Michael Keaton as Batman....he didn't seem large or menacing enough to wear the mantle of the Dark Knight.

The 3rd movie, Batman Forever, was a dramatic departure from the first two.  It featured a far more campy atmosphere.  Still, the cast handled the script well, and in my opinion, it worked reasonably well.

Batman and Robin was certainly the stinker of the group.  Clooney, Silverstone, and others tromped their way through a script that must have been difficult even for them to stomach.  Additional problems included moronic looking bat-vehicles and the reduction of Bane to ""minor house pet"".

Up until now, the Batman movies had failed to do several things:

1.  Put forth a really credible ""man under the mask""- Kilmer got the closest (some say Keaton), but none were perfect.

2.  Find the balance between darkness and humor.

3.  Credibly explore the factors within Batman's dark psyche.

Batman Begins manages to accomplish all of the above.  The movie is dark, but tinges of humor are interlaced throughout.

Cast/Acting:  Batman Begins has a huge cast of A-list names.  Sometimes, movies so jam-packed with names fail miserably.  Surprisingly, the movie juggles all of the characters so well that none of them feel under-utilized.  Michael Caine makes a great Alfred, if more serious than I expected.  Gary Oldman looks the part of Gordon and as usual, handles his role with care.  Ken Watanabe and Cilian Murphy play very convincing villains...Murphy, in particular, is very fun to watch.  Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are very welcome additions to the cast and provide some of the film's best moments.  The weakest link is Katie Holmes, who acts here just like she does in everything else.  Finally, Christian Bale is far and away the best man to don the Batman uniform.  He plays both Batman and Bruce so effortlessly that I hope he will get the opportunity to do so again.

Plot:  Superhero movies always have to walk the fine line of respecting the source material while making it accessible to audiences and conforming it to a cinematic format.  Sometimes this means making the material more politically correct; others times, important details are left out for money or time reasons.  I can't say I've read many of the Batman comics, but I'm very familiar with both Batman and his villains thanks to Batman: The Animated Series and other sources.  Batman Begins stays true to the Batman character while providing further depth than I've seen elsewhere.  The large cast accomodates a large number of relationships that define who both Bruce and Batman are.  The pacing is perfect, and the first part of the movie provides very believable background for exactly and practically how Batman became Batman.  Unlike other origin stories, this part of the movie manages to be every bit as enthralling as the rest.  The entire story simply feels so much more multi-layered than any of the previous Batman movies.  Batman Begins is both a character study and, in my opinion, a superhero epic.  The legend of Batman is handled carefully, with respect for long-time fans.

Music:  I'm a big fan of movie scores, and I wasn't dissappointed here.  I wasn't in the slightest bit surprised when, in the credits, I saw the names Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.  Howard contributes the beautiful quiet themes while Zimmer contributes the powerful themes he's so well known for.  Together, the two composers take the pacing of an already fantastic movie to another level.

I hardly imagined that this movie would turn out as well as it did; I should have known that Director Chris Nolan would pull through.  I'm leaving some things unsaid because they are better experienced as a viewer.  In conclusion, I can only hope that the same forces that came together to create this movie will bring us a sequel.  Batman Begins and returns, indeed!",1118793600,2,4431,4.932249322493225
1578032,5,B00005JNJV,"I'm so excited for this movie it looks so awsome it looks alot better than the first,second,third and forth movies. I mean sirious this is going to be the best Batman Movie because it shows him doing his training and finding the bat cave and not having those peice of junk so called Bat-Mobiles. This Batman movie without a doubt is going to be the best most Hard-Corest Batman Movie of them all. All DIE-HARD Batman fans will be happy and impressed speaking as a DIE-HARD Batman fan such as myself I can't wait for this movie to come out!!!!!!",1112918400,,544,4.45

I am looking forward to this movie and hope that many others are as well.",1112745600,,388,4.273972602739726
1578144,1,B00005JNJV,"Wow, can you say ""boring"" any louder? I would give this movie 0 stars if i could. I am a Batman fan, but this movie was just ridiculously boring. i mean seriously, it actually starts out with a little boy stealing a small rock from a little girl, and then he falls down a hole. talk about your exciting film openings. ah well, anyways, years later, he is Bruce Wayne, the only white man in an English-language Chinese prison. Bruce is pretty rich back in America, but he had himself sent to a Chinese prison so that he could train himself to beat people up, because he's peaved about his parents getting shot by a lame mugger. Okay. Then, he meets a guy with some sort of unpronounceable name, and this guy wants Bruce to join his group of evil ninjas. So, Bruce is like, ""Evil ninjas? Where do I sign up?"" Of course, when the evil ninja training is finished (wich totally sucked) and they want him to kill somebody, Bruce freaks out and burns down the whole place, probably killing quite a few people, very not Batman like since he vowed not to ""kill"" anyone(though Michael Keaton's wasn't a complete wimp like bale is here). Okay. Then, he goes home to rejoin the business world and fight crime. Luckily, he meets a guy at his father's company, and this guy makes superhero equipment for a living. Talk about your happy coincidences.

David Goyer must be stopped. Seriously. I have no idea how anybody could have looked at the script for this ****ing abomination and said, ""Hey, I want to make that!"" How many lame-brained action movie clich's can you fit into one film? How much cringe-worthy cheesy dialog can you make your overqualified cast choke out? How much cheesy sentimental BS can you squeeze into a movie about a guy fighting crime in a modified s&m outfit? If you're David Goyer, the possibilities are endless.

I cannot believe the ratings this film has received. It is a good example of what happened in ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". Long story short, two con men convince everyone that they've made luxury clothes for a king when in reality, they have made nothing. According to them, only those worthy enough can see the clothes. Everyone fakes that they can see them, including a very naked king, so that they can feel worthy.

My God, this fable fits ""Batman Begins"" perfectly. It is an overblown, poorly written, stiffly acted, and badly photographed film. The action is completely ""been there done that"" and is photographed WAY too up close, like many bad action movies of late. Christian Bale has a monotone voice and has NO EXPRESSION! Not ever. He frankly looks bored most of the time. That really bugged me. And yes, his voice as Batman was just plain embarrassing. It felt like an SNL skit of Batman.

I truly think that the marketing of this film was solely based on the idea that ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"" sucked. They weren't good, but lets remember, they each made a good amount of money for so films so critically drubbed. But they made money because people were entertained, even if they are too chicken to admit it. But Nolan gets to show us that they were stupid and frivolous movies and that he's going to blow them out of the water by being adult and intelligent. Audiences don't want to feel stupid, they LIKE feeling smart, thus with open arms people have accepted ""Batman Begins"" because they are told it is dark and unlike any other. But people truly are making more of ""Batman Begins"" than it is.

It strives so hard to be realistic and profound that it strips the energy and excitement form Batman. People talk in heavy handed riddles and the dialog is leaden and pretentious. And the plot is at times damn confusing. Characters appear and disappear, only to change motivations or create new motivations altogether. Blue flowers and weird organizations come about hoping the audience can fill in an explanation, and some Asian guy...has seemingly no purpose whatsoever, but appears in the film long enough so that one thinks hes there for a reason. Also, the montage of Batman training was very scatter shot. What did they show? Really...I think they just quickly edited a few hundred frames of nothing. The Pre-batman stuff, you know, the ""Begins"" part of the film, wasn't very strong at all.

In the end, I didn't care for anyone, because no one was developed! You can talk about fear all you want, but fear is not a character trait, nor is revenge, and Bruce had seemingly no character beyond this. Maybe its Bale's fault, as he was stiff as a corpse, but Bruce never felt real.

This is so far a very harsh review, so why would I even give the film a 4/10, when thus far it seems closer to a 2/10 from my perspective? Out of respect to Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkonson. By casting respected, award-winning actors in small parts, some which are truly perfunctory, each man is only given a few moments to strut their stuff. I cherished those moments because even in a bad movie, these guys can act. But really, Gary Oldman in a small role as a humble cop who - basically does nothing?? Come on!

Overall though, this is a huge letdown. People cite the darkness, and the depth of the characters, but the film is as deep as cardboard. You need not look farther than Bruce's relationship to Katie Holmes' character to see that this film is truly just a shallow hackneyed popcorn movie with a serious identity crisis, and really good marketing. If you want to see a REAL Batman movie that is not boring and actually takes risks and is original, see the aforementioned first 2 batman films BATMAN and Batman Returns. Tim Burton knew Batman (and had the most in common i think as well, lol), and while wtahcing HIS mvoies i felt he really understood Batman and Michael Keaton as well. They are more well made, more emotional, and far cry better then this new POS movie that should have been called ""die hard 5:now hes a bat"".
