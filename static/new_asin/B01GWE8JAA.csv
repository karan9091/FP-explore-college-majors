The film begins with news films of police arrests as part of a crackdown. Then it is November 1978 and a man is recording his thoughts about fear of an assassination. [Guilt feelings?] The film shows Harvey Milk's personality through a flashback to his earlier life in New York city. Milk relocates to San Francisco as if he would be welcome there. Businessman Milk makes plans to take over the neighborhood, and it seems to work. [A group that is organized has advantages over ordinary people.] Milk wants an organization to protect its members, like other groups. He runs for city supervisor on a platform of vague promises and loses. Even with a three-piece suit he loses again and again. What is he for?

The singer Anita Bryant becomes politically active. A redrawn political boundary creates a new opportunity. [Was this an accident?] Anger is channeled into a parade. A man who can manipulate a crowd and control votes is a politician. Milk blames Anita Bryant for causing this reaction. Milk gets a new campaign manager, one with experience who can get newspaper endorsements. [How much did they have to pay for this? They don't explain how it works.] Milk gets elected by appealing to a wider range of people. Milk wants a state-wide referendum for ""gay rights"" and a city ordinance. Newly elected Dan White wants to keep a psychiatric center out of his district. A new law is proposed to purge homosexual teachers ""and their supporters"". Its purpose is to prevent perversion of students. Milk has problems with his boyfriends. There is a conflict over the plan to defeat Proposition 6. Is there enough state-wide support to defeat this bill?

Milk reneges on his promise to vote against that psychiatric center. [Why put it in a residential neighborhood?] Cities vote against laws that control rental housing. The film shows how people are manipulated for political ends. Will the plan work? [Is there a hidden agenda behind low salaries for elected politicians? Yes.] Does Milk handle his personal life correctly? Why did his boyfriends attempt suicide? Is there some hidden fault? Milk the politician talks rhetoric to a crowd. He has a debate with another politician over a state proposition. Could that tragedy have been prevented? The advice from national politicians may show their control by corporate rulers. Could the ""gay rights"" movement be designed to foster a reaction among voters to back corporate political candidates? Proposition 6 passes, Dan White resigns. Milk threatens Mayor Moscone with political reprisals if he allows Dan White to return. [Is that opera meant to be symbolic?] Dan White enters City Hall through a window. There is an ending like some operas, but without music and singing.

This film could be edited for quickness. Did it really explain what caused this tragedy? It seemed like an accident from a personality clash rather than political rivalry. Could a ""lone gunman"" actually be working for hidden interests? Could sugar-rich ""junk food"" really be a cause for murder or just be an excuse for something that was omitted from this film? Political assassinations are rare, most murders are the result of love or money (lust or greed). The film does not mention ""Jim Jones"" and his organization. I think Anita Bryant was right to object about school teachers who push their homosexual agenda.",1498262400,,3347,4.992831541218638
