1669833,5,B00005V3Z4,"I went to see this film in the theater a few months ago, knowing very little about it, and was absolutely blown away by its inventiveness, cleverness, and vitality.  For some reason it never got a real release here in Boston, and so now it appears on DVD having hardly been in theaters.
But the DVD of this movie is extremely well made and complements the movie well: lots of commentary, and a ton of deleted scenes.  The movie is incredibly mysterious, and the DVD kind of helps to clear up the mystery.
Not only is this movie set in the 80's, but it also has an 80's movie feel: it has a tone that is somewhat remininscent of ""repo man"", ""heathers"", with a little ""highlander"" (?!) thrown in.  the high school slo-mo scene set to the tune of tears for fears' ""head over heels"" is a classic movie moment.",1016582400,9,805,4.3533333333333335
1669834,2,B00005V3Z4,"I was really looking forward to this movie, but so much of it strikes me as a really well made, feature-budgeted student film.
Why?
Because ""Donnie Darko"" is bursting with inspiration (some fresh, a lot borrowed) and yet it just doesn't seem to have the wisdom of very much actual experience. I was both fascinated and frustrated at every turn and in the end I was mostly just disappointed.
For starters, ""DD"" is saddled with one of the most opaque and least likeable main characters since ""Brewster McCloud"" (which comes to mind because it, too, is an intriguing and risky but ultimately unsuccessful experiment). Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie with the ""head down, eyes up"" sad-smile glower of a Kubrick anti-hero. Sometimes Donnie is smart. Sometimes Donnie is dumb. Sometimes Donnie is mean. Sometimes Donnie is cool. Sometimes Donnie is crazy. Which is like most teenages (or even most people) but it becomes problematic when we can never get a rough estimate of how many cards the central character is playing with.
The other characters aren't much help, either. The villains are cardboard and heavy handedly drawn; virtually free of any sort of complexities, they proudly sing the virtues of censorship, psycho-evangelism, and easy answers. Donnie's rebellion against them almost makes it appear that he's taking easy bait.
Everybody else just sort of wanders in and out of the story, and I was really surprised at how ill-used Drew Barrymore, Noah Wylie, Jena Mallone and especially Maggie Gyllenhaal are. They're all very good when it occurs to the script that they should make an appearance, but most of the time the script would rather watch Donnie be kooky.
Finally, there are just too many elements of ""DD"" that remind me of, or refer to, other stuff. There's the malevolent infomercial guru prancing around on stage and he seems to belong to another movie (say, ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Magnolia""). There's the mystical rabbit-like wanderer (probably only a coincidence that ""Sexy Beast"" has one, too, but what about, say, ""Gummo"" ?). The troubled wild child in counselling (""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Ordinary People""). When the movie wants to be cheeky, it displays a theater marquee with the ""Halloween Double Feature"" of ""Evil Dead"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (zing! crash!). And one would think, since Donnie's mother is versed in Stephen King (she's reading ""It"" when the movie opens), she'd at least have a clue where her story was going.
Based on the amount of deleted scenes on the DVD, and the wealth of information that's covered therein (including a particularly interesting but excised revelation about Donnie's medication) I think this was a movie that lost its way during the editing.  Director Kelly doesn't seem to have any real regrets on the commentary track so I doubt there will be a more coherent ""director's cut,"" but I imagine that a longer version would've filled in some of the blanks that I was left with at the end of the film.
Nevertheless, as a horror movie, ""Donnie Darko"" does strive for something MUCH more subtle than most of the recent offerings from the horror genre. It does have genuine moments of creepiness and dread. I felt led on and let down by ""Donnie Darko,"" but I'd rather see this creepy failure five times than see another variation on ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" which, fortunately, is one movie ""Donnie"" doesn't emulate.
I'll be interested to see what Richard Kelly does next.",1016582400,24,3449,4.93631669535284
1669835,5,B00005V3Z4,"I have seen hundreds upon hundreds of movies throughout my life and Donnie Darko is one of the most original, enthralling pieces of cinema I have ever seen.  Some people might complain that the movie is flawed, but I have to counter with the idea of choice.  This movie lets you choose what it means.
After I watched this spectacular film, I obtained the music from the film, listened to it all night, while pondering and running through all the ideas presented within.  Of all the junky movies out there, this movie deserves to be seen.",1016582400,,537,4.572916666666667
1669836,5,B00005V3Z4,"This is an incredibly dark, comedic, and somber film that largely lacks in linear narrative, but covers its ground well with a stunningly original plot and quirky, tone-shifting atmosphere.  At any one moment, you could be howling with laughter, staring in disbelief, or form goosebumps from overall creepiness.  The most satisfying fact is that it is all done extraordinarily well, servicing up what is--in my opinion--one of the best build-ups and conclusions I've seen in a film since SEVEN.
The movie is nothing like SEVEN.  It is the story of a 1988 teenager named Donnie Darko.  While at first seeming to have the cliched problems of teen angst and a dysfunctional family, his world slowly opens up to someone with a deep, psychological malfuntion.  He takes commands from a giant rabbit while sleepwalking.  One night, while out talking to this rabbit, he is told that the world is coming to an end in 28 days.  While he is out that evening, a jet engine that fell off an aircraft destroys his room.
That's all I'll say as far as plot, and I only have said that much because it all happens in the first fifteen minutes.  After that is a mystical journey through Donnie's mind.  While serving up a ton of foreshadowing and plot devices (which seem pointless until the film concludes), writer/director Richard Kelly gracefully churns out political satire, comedy, and insightful views on human nature and teenage rebellion.  I was also impressed by how well the characters developed, no matter how small or insignifican their roles seem to be.  They're all important in the overall scope of the film.
Like I said earlier, this movie does lack a linear narrative.  However, I feel that is overshadowed by how well it covers all the issues it presents.  This is a hard thing to do, but it is occasionally done really well (MAGNOLIA, SHORT CUTS).  The conclusion is something that will probably turn this into a bit love/hate film, if you throw things like implausibility and suspension of disbelief.  However, I am a big fan of such things, and I am tired of cash-filled, gutless Hollywood endings which are geared towards profitibility.
This film is risky, but made with some incredibly promising talent.  I, for one, love it for everything it is.",1015632000,21,2251,4.853403141361256
1669837,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is one of those rare suprising films that takes all your expectations and throws them in a blender. This whirlwind of teenage 80's schitzo-angst is a treatise on every adolescent ""outsider"" and their own self-discovery. It takes the idea of justifying ones existence through self-sacrifice and blows it up a hundred-fold to very unique ends.
The acting (aside from Barrymore) is subtle and carried through with great care so as not to burden the audience with the state of being that these suburbanites are burdened with. Donnie himself as the center of the film (and later, the universe) is bit player to his own demise and the careful development of his coming to terms with death is like nothing I've ever seen on film. The script and pacing allow for real empathy especially in his therapy sessions where he uncovers the source of his dilemna. Sure, the film is flawed (again, Barrymore's character and some wierd plot devices) but the ride is one of the most original takes on that awkward point in each of our existences.
Stunning in every way a film should be.",1014336000,6,1080,4.780748663101604
1669838,1,B00005V3Z4,"It baffles me how many good reviews I keep reading about this movie.  I saw it for the first time last weekend, and I'm pretty sure it's the WORST thing I've seen in the last 2 years.  It makes the movie Bats look like Citizen Kane.
As much as I can be fond of her, Drew Barrymore and this film seemed to struggle towards the same goal: to appear clever.  This film left me with questions that I don't even want to know the answers to, mainly about the whole time-frame of the picture (how long has this kid been taking medication, how long has he seen this rabbit, what the hell does The Evil Cult of Swayze have to do with anything?).  Maybe I would re-evaluate this film if someone raved about it in an intelligible manner, instead of just saying this Bubble Boy kid is an amazing actor, and it's sooo original.  It just seemed like a tired formula of a misunderstood rebellious teen who is supposed to become martyred in the end.  The era it takes place in is just about as inconsequential as about 8 of the other ""sub-plots"".  Also, note to the director: Cussing at the dinner table, followed by a little kid repeating it is so well-worn that it's depressing.  All this does is make the American Pie kids howl with laughter.  Oh yeah, and that ""Cellar Door"" plot device sticks out like an Eric Roberts Academy Award nomination.
If you are looking for something truly psychological that digs its claws into your head, I recommend Barton Fink, The Minus Man, or Straw Dogs.  If you're just looking for a more entertaining movie, that's easy, just see if your local family-owned video store carries Disorderlies, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, or Night of the Creeps.
It's a shame that a film like Run Ronnie Run gets shelved while this celluloid turd basks in the sunlight of shallow critics.
Of course, this is just my opinion.",1014076800,35,1829,4.498489425981873
1669839,5,B00005V3Z4,"Jake Gyllenhaal is unbelievable! Let's hope he stays versatile. This movie takes you where few movies dare to go. I can't give away plot details, but it's very stylized, eerie, menacing and surprisingly complex. Oh, and there is a giant talking bunny. The use of 80s music is excellent. Don't let yourself miss this one becasue it never played in theatres near you.",1011052800,,365,4.809523809523809
1669840,5,B00005V3Z4,"Sure there's a psychotic looking bunny-rabbit-suit-man with an eerily sweet voice, but that's just a detail; it's all about time-travel and destiny.  It is just so darn good.  It will either make you depressed, happy, or really confused depending how you interpret the film.  Plus there is just some truly classic American humor.

The bonus features are copious, although most of them are from the Fox Blu-ray (there is a new documentary that is decent). But, are the picture and sound greatly improved over the previous release? Barely. The sound is identical, and the picture is slightly - SLIGHTLY - better. If you already own the Fox Blu-ray, it isn't worth the upgrade unless you can get a very good deal (I got mine for $12). 5 stars for the movie, but the 3 stars are for the set itself when compared to the Fox release.",1512172800,,589,4.412844036697248

She literally comes across as a young person, trying to act the way they think a teacher would act ... which obviously is otherwise known as terrible acting.

If you're watching a movie or tv show, and the actor or actress' performance jumps out at you as pathetic or irritating, because you can immediately tell that he or she is acting in a way that a REAL PERSON would not act, ... well, that's crappy acting.  The end.  Drew Barrymore's performance is so ridiculously pathetic, so forced and contrived, I am left with but one alternative.  To deduct a star from an otherwise flawless movie.

1669898,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko (2001) is a most unusual film with a fantastic musical score; but it's the plot that makes this a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Yes, this isn't straight up sci-fi with nothing but special effects; it's about a troubled teen and the emotional turmoil he's in, all the while answering to an imaginary friend. Time travel is central to the plot, and twists appear throughout. What makes this an absorbing film is in how it makes the viewer wonder what will happen next, and to their astonishment, it most likely isn't what the viewer visualized. I don't want to spoil the plot, but it's a film that'll reward the viewer that sticks with it. This film also has a lot of humor. Donnie Darko touches on emotions, and is a feel-good kind of movie overall. The script is well-written, and there are memorable lines. And with a believable musical score, it all adds up to an unforgettable experience. I highly recommend the Director's Cut over the theatrical version, though the latter is pretty good as well. The blu ray is a good print, with very good picture and sound quality, with special features that beg for viewing, as I wanted to know about the evolution of this remarkable film.

I'm about 5 movies into collecting Arrow Video and I didn't think anything could be nicer than Scream Factory releases but I think Arrow might just be. I do not mind throwing money at quality releases. I understand bonus features aren't for everyone, but they are for this guy!

1669911,5,B00005V3Z4,"Back in 2001, I watched a movie that stuck with me for years. That film was Donnie Darko. A time travelling sci-fi flick with elements of comedy, drama and horror. (Oddly enough, Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly also directed one of the worst films I have ever seen (Southland Tales).)

The reason Donnie Darko stuck with me and not Southland Tales, is that it was a fantastic film that left you with a lot of questions and just when you think you had the movie figured out, another question will pop up. Most of these questions have been answered in the Directors Cut release, which until this review, I never did see.

From what Ive read online, there seems to be a divided fan base on which version they prefer. Some prefer the more open-ended Theatrical release and others like the Directors Cut due to it making the film a bit easier to follow, yet still leaving a lot of questions up in the air. Honestly, either Cut is brilliant.

I don't want to go into the specifics of the story for Donnie Darko as I feel it has already been dissected and discussed by several other smarter people than me, so I have nothing to add. My unpaid job is to tell you whether you should see it/buy it or not and that I can quickly answer with a resounding YES!

Be it the intriguing story, the acting or the amazing soundtrack that propels the film forward, with some great songs that make certain scenes all the more better, everything is top notch in Donnie Darko. Who can forget the school scene with Head over Heels by Tears for Fears playing or the ending with Mad World blaring through your speakers? Its all interesting stuff that sticks with you.

As for the downside of my review, I cant think of anything negative to say about Donnie Darko. Anything I could think up (say some shoddy CGI for example) is extreme nitpicking and this movie doesnt deserve that type of critiquing (Southland Tales on the other hand? Ugh). What it does deserve is to be watched over and over again.

There are a bunch of different copies of the film out there to watch it on, but throw all of those away as Arrow Video has provided the end all be all release. I cant stress enough how fantastic this box set is; I want to make sweet love to it. Coming in a hard box, with two digipacks, one that houses the theatrical on Blu-ray and DVD, another that has the Directors on Blu-ray/DVD and finally a book with essays and interviews. Each digipack also has a treat in store for the buyer. The theatrical has the poster, and the Directors Cut has an envelope filled with postcards featuring Donnie Darko artwork. Thats just the physical features, but what about the digital features.

The newest feature and the one that everyone will want to check out is the new feature-length documentary on the theatrical disc. Coming in an 1 hour and 25 minutes, Deus Ex Machina  The Philosophy of Donnie Darko features interviews with cast and crew providing a lot of details on the production. The rest of the special features have been available on previous releases, but having it all in one package is a truly ""cellar door"" thing.

As for the video transfer, Arrow Video provides a new 4K scan of the original 35mm camera negative, along with a scan of the 35mm digital intermediate element for the sections that are unique to the Directors Cut. Each cut has the film looking the best it has ever looked, keeping true to the overall look of the movie. Viewers may baulk at some of the heavy grain and lack of sharpness in certain scenes, but to me, this is how the movie was meant to look, and for that, Arrow Video has succeeded wonderfully. The same can be said for the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix, which has some fun with the rear channels whenever Frank pops up onscreen.

Even if you own Donnie Darko on previous versions, you still should buy the Donnie Darko set from Arrow Video. It is that great of a release. The work that was put into making this set look as amazing as it is, can be felt throughout every aspect of the box set. Donnie Darko is a film that will stick with you for many, many years and this Blu-ray release will stay front and centre in your collection for many more years.",1494979200,,4169,4.4521625163827

1669913,5,B00005V3Z4,"DONNIE DARKO has been one of my all-time favorites since I rented it at 11 years old the day it came out on VHS/DVD. I still remember the morning waiting for Hollywood video to open so I could be the first one in to rent it. Since then I've watched it countless times and it never ceases to amaze me. The atmosphere, the performances from the entire cast regardless of the size of their role, that soundtrack (both Michael Andrews original work, and the song choices), the mind-melting storytelling, and above all, the affecting poignancy. Donnie Darko has it all, a true modern classic of both independent filmmaking and cinema in general, and to date Richard Kelly's best film.

With that said, Donnie Darko for years has lacked the proper bluray release it deserves. The previous american bluray transfer was sorely lacking, to say the least, and it seemed no care was put into the audio and picture quality whatsoever. It was only a slight improvement over the DVD, and so I never went ahead and purchased it, hoping that someday a better quality package would be released.

Thanks to Arrow Video, my prayers have been answered. This limited edition four disc set is ESSENTIAL to all Donnie Darko fans, and is exactly what we've been waiting for. Firstly, the box set is gorgeous, as are the supplements. There's an informative booklet, as well as two digipacks- one for the theatrical cut, another for the directors cut- within those are a double sided Donnie Darko poster (one side is the poster for the theatrical release, the flipside matches the box set's cover), and an envelope appearing to be handwritten by Donnie to Roberta Sparrow. Inside are a collection of various post-card sized artwork. The digipacks themselves also have gorgeous covers that perfectly represent the atmosphere of the film and are nice to have in the collection.

However, as great as the packaging is, it would all be for nothing had the actual film's look been once again neglected. With great relief it can be said that this is the best the film has ever looked on home video. Thanks to a new 4k restoration approved by director Kelly, the film looks noticeably better. While it still has that intentionally hazy quality to it, the detail is sharp and clear, the grain is finely retained, the colors are appropriately saturated. There really is not one flaw I noticed while watching (and this is going for the preferred theatrical cut, as I have not revisited the director's cut yet). I can't state enough how great the film looks now, it's like watching it with a fresh pair of eyes.

The special features also don't disappoint, filled with interviews, several commentaries including the cast, crew, and writer/director, as well as a lengthy documentary exploring the genesis of the film, the making of it, leading to its release, and finally it's enduring cult legacy over the years. Plus the same special features from previous dvd/blurays have been carried over.

In short, if you love Donnie Darko this is a MUST OWN package that was long overdue, but I'm so very pleased to finally have it in my collection. Thank you to everyone involved in the process of making this special edition, and to the filmmaker himself for a film I'll never stop loving.",1494201600,9,3245,4.797853309481217
1669914,5,B00005V3Z4,"I will start by saying this movie is absolutely amazing. The extras included in this set are a great touch as well, including a poster, some art cards and a very nice book. Although my set did not come in the greatest condition. The slip cover box was dented on the top corners and the 2 movie cases and the book had dents on the corners as well and even creases down the spine of each one. My review is 5 stars simply for the movie and collection itself, not the actual condition as I don't feel I should dock the rating due to that. I guess I can't complain for the price that it is currently at right now.",1493424000,,608,4.075
1669915,4,B00005V3Z4,"It's safe to say that pandering to '80s nostalgia has gone mainstream.  Everything from TV shows (The Goldbergs) to streaming events (Stranger Things) to pizza commercials (Ferris Buehler lived in Chicago, people, he would never order from Dominos!) is coated with day-glo residue of pop culture references and one-hit wonders.  Released in 2001, well before the retro resurgence was even due to arrive, Donnie Darko uses the '80s as a colorful backdrop for its story of a troubled teen on the edge of full-blown paranoid schizophrenia...who also holds the fate of the world in his hands.

 Or not.

The beauty of director Richard Kelly's film is that it doesn't hand out easy answers for its interconnected theories of time travel, spiritual plans, invisible friends and intangible jellyfish sprouting out of everyone's chest.  It's a sort of sci-fi-afterschool-special that manages to treat mental illness with some real emotional weight and also get a laugh or two.

Set in a Castle Rock-style suburbia full of quirky neighbors and oddball students, the Darko family is an island of sanity in a world gone mad.  Yet, ironically, middle child Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is emotionally unbalanced and socially awkward.  Things only get worse when visions of a costumed rabbit (named Frank) interrupt his sleep, warning him of a 28-day countdown until the end of the world.  The new girl in school (Jena Malone) provides some romantic distraction, but even her fate seems wrapped up in Donnie's theory of impending disaster.  Is he hooked into some metaphysical information pipeline...or merely an imaginative psychotic break?

Premiering at Sundance, Donnie Darko brings along a lot of hipster indie baggage.  Drew Barrymore (also an executive producer on the film) plays a too-cool-for-school English teacher who gets sacked for challenging her students while slow motion scenes play out to alternative hits from the likes Echo & The Bunnymen and Tears for Fears, interrupting the action like a Greek chorus.  Even the Smurfs get name-dropped.  But Kelly only uses these elements as decoration.  Underneath it all is the disturbingly tragic profile Donnie's broken mind and its effect on world around him.

Kelly, making his feature-directing debut, shoots with a confidence he never quite recaptured in subsequent films.  And he lucks into a real humdinger of a cast, including Gyllenhaal, his sister Maggie, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle and a handful of before-they-were-stars bit players.  As good as Gyllenhaal is - and he's very good - it's Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother who delivers some of the most heartbreaking scenes, torn between her unconditional love for her son while recognizing the danger he poses to himself and others.

Donnie Darko is an addictively puzzling film.  And Arrow Films new Blu-ray / DVD limited edition revisits it with a brand-new 4K transfer and gobs of extras to help you dig deeper.  It starts with the usual trailers, TV spots, storyboards and archive featurettes (mostly carried over from previous editions) then gets real with the Deus Ex Machina documentary, production diaries, more archive interviews from cast and crew, three full audio commentaries, B-roll footage, twenty deleted and alternate scenes (with Kelly commentary) plus Kelly's 1996 short film, The Goodbye Place.  Spread across 4-discs, the biggest perk is still probably having the theatrical and director's cut (which adds close to 30-minutes) in the same set with a spiffy new restoration.  If you snatch it up quick you also get a collectible book with in-depth interviews, stills and promotional material.",1493251200,3,3617,5.272251308900524

1669917,5,B00005V3Z4,"The Donnie Darko (4-Disc Limited Edition) is an amazing example of how a limited edition should be executed. Arrow video has outdone themselves.

I did not see an unboxing video before buying and I was blown away when I received the box. It really feels like a bargain at $31. The artwork done throughout by Candice Tripp is awesome. The included 90 page book is very well done and I found all of it interesting. I have not read the 2001 Donnie Darko book which the long interview was from and I really found it to be quite compelling. The post cards included with the Directors Cut and poster with the Theatrical Cut are both done well. The amount of special features and extras included is very impressive. I have watched some of them and I'm looking forward to watching the rest. There is material here that has not been released before.

The video quality of the special edition is impressive and a huge improvement over prior Blu-rays. Critics that have reviewed the Blu-rays are also very impressed. The difference for me is more obvious in outside scenes. Overall it offers better clarity and it is a bit darker. The Blu-ray appears very film like and shows details that I have never noticed before. Shadows and dark areas are handled very well and look great. This is not a Blu-ray to show off your home theater with. Look for more recent titles shot digitally. This is an older low budget movie shot with 800 ASA stock. The 800 ASA film was used so that film could be shot with less light. 800 ASA film has more grain and grain is apparent on these Blu-rays but it is not distracting. Bottom line is that this is the best this movie has ever looked and likely the best it will ever look. Arrow Video did a top notch job with their restoration.

Sound is very good and I cannot tell a difference from earlier Blu-rays.

This is a fantastic Limited Edition and well worth the money. For people that have bought the earlier editions and others that have not seen the film this is highly recommended.",1493078400,65,2005,4.5

The improved video quality is marginal at best.  Not worth even near the cost.  I'm running this on an Oppo BDP-103D through a Denon 3313CI receiver and shown on a last-generation Panasonic plasma.  Not audio/videophile quality but well above entry level.

Utterly disappointed.  I've seen remasters like An American Werewolf in London and Patton where the remaster was an obvious upgrade.  This is NOT.  Grain is ridiculously overbearing.  Color is muted and pale.  Same as the 2009 print with a marginal upgrade.

Audio continues to be outrageously good.  The DTS HS-Master soundtrack plays nutzo on my Martin Logans and Boston Acoustics surrounds with my massive Paradigm sub.

Overall, not nearly worth the upgrade price.  A terrific movie, but still way short of a reference disc.

1669923,5,B00005V3Z4,"Before I delve into this, I should probably come clean. I did not enjoy or understand a whole lot of what was going on with ""Donnie Darko"" throughout my initial viewing two years ago. To put it more bluntly, my first reaction was, ""what the heck did I just watch?"" But this is not the sort of movie, I've lately realized, that one goes into without the intent of applying the proper train of thought.

Let's just say I wasn't so quick to write everything off this time. I decided to give ""Donnie Darko"" another chance recently and came away with a far different and decisively more appreciative opinion of the intricately layered story it was trying to tell. Certain movies have a way of doing that to me every now and again.

Writer and Director Richard Kelly is somebody whose future endeavors I will almost certainly continue to anticipate with much enthusiasm. And Jake Gyllenhaal, it has to be said, is a remarkable standout among a rich and talented cast of great actors. He plays the exceptionally troubled young man of the title with a brilliant intellect and a vast imagination, struggling with the boredom of standard education and a society that is very apparently afraid of its own shadow (e.g. contemporary America). His imaginary friend, ""Frank,"" a six foot tall metal-headed skull-faced demon-rabbit, saves his life by removing him from the the scene of a catastrophe mere moments before it occurs, only to lead him down an alternate path to a far more bleaker oblivion complete with forecasts of doom, psychiatrists, and self-help charlatans.

This film feels as creepy as any well-made ghost story I have ever seen in my entire life, yet redefines the genre of supernatural storytelling in a very unique and original way.

""Donnie Darko"" is...at its core...a film about heroism and sacrifice, peppered with disturbing imagery, the horrors of everyday life, and a soundtrack reminiscent of something you'd find within the confines of a David Lynch film; I was particularly intrigued by the usage of ""Head Over Heels"" by ""Tears For Fears,"" a long-standing personal favorite of mine. It is clearly a film worthy of several viewings, a fact that I myself have only recently come to recognize, and at least as many varied interpretations.

That being said, I still cannot honestly recommend it to just any casual movie buff....especially those who attend films for the pure sake of entertainment. Nor could I ever suggest it to people who need straightforward spoon-fed answers or who have limited attention spans. This is art, and does not need to provide pat explanations for itself. As uniquely interesting as some may find this film, it does have an unrelenting and merciless dark side to it that might very well disturb even the most veteran indy film curmudgeon.

But make no mistake when I say, this IS an overall great and complex film. See it by any means necessary.",1492473600,,2887,4.869653767820774
1669924,4,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a look into the mind of a troubled teenager. At dawn, along a remote mountain road, a teenage boy named Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens next to his bicycle, surprised to find himself where he is, and maybe pleased to discover hes still alive. After peddling home, he finds his family engaged in an argument incited by his Harvard-bound sister when she announces her preference for a political candidate.

Donnie is in therapy, prone to sleepwalking, and has an imaginary friend  a six-foot rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world is going to end in just over 28 days. During that time, Donnie narrowly avoids death when a plummeting jet engine crashes through his bedroom. He becomes a sort of celebrity at school because of this, but a series of crises occurs  the flooding of the school, an axe in the head of the schools mascot statue, and Donnies English teacher (Drew Barrymore) getting into trouble for assigning a controversial book to her class.

The film has a stylish look and, like Catcher in the Rye, focuses on a young, rebellious character yearning to express himself in society. Gyllenhaal infuses Donnie with a wry sense of humor and grounds the movie in the here-and-now. His Donnie is a regular kid balancing daily life as a teenager with the doomsday pronouncements of his imaginary pal.

The supporting cast includes Jena Malone, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Katherine Ross, Seth Rogan, and Noah Wyle. The soundtrack consists of 80s classics by Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears For Fears, and Duran Duran.

Bonus features on the unrated, widescreen 4-disc Blu-ray + DVD box set include both the theatrical and directors cut of the movie; three archive featurettes; storyboard comparisons; the music video Mad World by Gary Jules; archive interviews with director Richard Kelly, actors Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, James Duval, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Holmes Osborne, Noah Wyle and Katherine Ross; 20 deleted and alternate scenes;  The Goodbye Place, Kellys 1996 short film; The Donnie Darko Production Diary; galleries; trailers; TV spots; limited edition packaging featuring new artwork; and a collectors book containing an in-depth interview with Richard Kelly, introduction by Jake Gyllenhaal, original stills and promotional material.",1492473600,,2309,5.2411924119241196

1669927,4,B00005V3Z4,"Released in 2001 and written/directed by Richard Kelly, Donnie Darko is a drama/fantasy starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled California teen dogged by apparitions of a man in an evil rabbit suit who manipulates him to commit several crimes, after he narrowly escapes a peculiar accident concerning a jet engine falling from the sky. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays his sister, Holmes Osborne & Mary McDonnell his parents, Drew Barrymore his teacher, Katharine Ross his therapist, Jena Malone his girlfriend, Noah Wyle his science teacher and Patrick Swayze a self-help guru. Patience Cleveland is on hand as Grandma Death.

While the movie flopped at the box office, it has since become a serious cult hit. I saw it recently for the first time and went into it cold without knowing anything about the intricacies behind the plot. The only thing I knew was that the kid was harassed by an ee-vil bunny apparition. The film mildly works as a high school drama with a satirical smirk. But the storys just not engaging enough on that level. While the movie has some quality women, it fails to capitalize on their presence (Barrymore, for instance, is barely in it). But Jake is a solid protagonist, even somewhat sympathetic despite the curious things he does.

By the middle of the second act I found myself getting bored with the story and trying to figure out what was going on, but the film perks up in the last act, particularly when it reveals the truth about the scary bunny guy. After viewing, my overall impression was that the story never really took off and was burdened by perplexing ambiguities even while possessing some fascinating elements. I came up with a theory to explain the events (explained below) but, upon reflection, I realized that all the pieces didn't fit. And the movie simply wasn't entertaining enough to bang my head further trying to figure it out. I wouldve given the movie a mediocre 5/10 rating, but after investigating the official meaning and the alternative explanations I had to admit that the film is genius in this respect. It just needed to be attached to a more interesting story with more stimulating characters.

The film runs 113 minutes, which is the version I saw; the Directors Cut runs 20 minutes longer. It was shot in Los Angeles and surrounding areas (Angeles National Forest, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, Burbank & Calabasas).

GRADE: B-

ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (*** SPOILER ALERT***Dont read unless youve seen the movie):

My casual interpretation turned out to be one of the alternative explanations of the movie, the so-called Donnie Is Shown the Future explanation, which suggests that Donne is shown the future via the future ghost of Frank and so he sacrifices himself at the end to save everyone. But, as noted above, there are too many holes in this interpretation.

A couple of other popular explanations are the banal Schizophrenia Theory, where the film shows the protagonist going through an episode of his illness, and the Dream Theory, where it was all just a dream, which is too clichd and idiotic to even consider.

The official interpretation I wouldve never pieced together because its just too sci-fi-oriented and complex: Its the Tangent Universe Theory, which suggests that time in the Primary Universe (i.e. reality) is occasionally corrupted and an unstable alternative universe is created, but it will only last a few weeks. Nevertheless, it threatens to destroy the universe. The events you see happening in the bulk of the film are this alternative reality where the universe (or God) is correcting the error to get back to the Primary Universe using an Artifact (the jet engine), The Living Receiver (Jake Gyllenhaal), a Manipulated Dead person (the bunny guy), and so on.  Google it and youll see that the Tangent Universe explanation ties up all the loose ends.",1491696000,,3847,4.961180124223603

1669999,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a straight up masterpiece. I highly recommend anyone who has only seen it once and didn't care for it that much to give it atleast a couple more viewings. The first time I saw it I thought it was very interesting but wasn't all that impressed especially after how great I heard it was. I've seen it probably 20 more times since then and it's one of my favorite films now. A lot of people seem to prefer the theatrical cut over the director's cut but I highly prefer the director's cut a lot more. Maybe it's because it's the version I've been the most used to. I only watched the theatrical once to just see what the differences were and there's quite a bit. I also prefer the music choices in the director's cut over the theatrical as well. There are actors out there who were born to play certain characters and Jake Gyllenhaal was born to play Donnie Darko (who is not a super hero btw as the title may sound). He is incredible in his performance as he is with most of his performances. He's one of my favorite actors of today. The movie is filled with great cult favorites such as the late, great Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore and Jena Malone and they are all outstanding. The movie is terrifically dark, intelligent, intriguing, creepy and darkly hilarious. It's also very confusing and pretty much impossible to figure out (which is most of the fun). It's an excellent film that deserves a couple more viewings if you didn't or don't really care for it your first time.",1474588800,,1503,4.469090909090909

Do NOT watch the Directors cut which totally messes up and ruins the flow of the movie. It just completely changes the viewing experience but it's good for a watch after you've seen the theatrical version.  The major difference is that the Directors cut spells out everything for you so if you're a fan of solving puzzles and mysteries then it will ruin it for you.  After watching the show look up ""Donnie Darko explained"" for a really good explanation of what the shows about.  Even if you get it there's going to be a lot of little things that you would never notice.  This show is truly genius and I have NO idea how the person who created it came up with it.

A dark and moving coming a age story. We watch him fall in love for the first time, rebel against society, his parents, his school, try to deal with the idea of loss and fight for those he loves all while trying to figure out the world and his place in it. A haunting and moving movie that is easily one of my all time favorites. As far as the direction edition goes the bonus features of that are listed.

If you have any expectation of a rational resolution of the conflicts presented within the film, well then just abandon all hope. Not only is there no resolution, there isn't even any rationality. Now, even in a film about psychosis I would expect than the non-psychotics within the film would resolve it for us. Or even in a science fiction film about time travel and alternate universes, one would expect to learn, by film's end, what the rules of time travel and/or alternate universes might be. Not here. Don't hold your breath expecting to understand what you just saw. I love sci fi. But I want to understand the science.

Even his body language--incurving shoulders, questioning eyes, uncertain smiles--reveal a vast, searching intelligence. Mary McDonnell gives yet another in a roster of thoughtful portrayals--this time as the despairing mother of brilliant and troubled Donnie, simultaneously loving and hating him for being emotionally beyond her reach. And Jena Mallone is just wonderful, one of the truest, most authentic young actors around today.
This is filmmaking at its best--an adventure for the mind--not to be missed.

1670378,4,B00005V3Z4,"I've read a lot about this movie and seen it on lists of best science fiction movies.  At first I didn't really sympathize with the spoiled upper middle class catholic characters, especially the protagonist.  I was planning to give it 3 stars and call it over rated, with maybe an honorable mention for Drew Barrymore.  Then at the end I got it.  SPOILERS FOLLOW
Here's my take on it.  The point of it all is that all these people, with their flaws and all, would have been better off without Donnie Darko.  When he was saved by Frank the first time all these lives were diverted to darker paths.  So there was a redo, in which Donnie Darko did in fact get smashed by the jet engine.  And all these lives were better.  Still not perfect, but better.  That in itself is troubling.  For most characters it's fine.  For example, the teacher who leads the dance team isn't a perfect person, but letting them have their happiness is harmless enough.  But if Swayze's character is meant to represent a priest, as I suspect, then what does it mean that he lives this life of hypocrisy in which he is privately a kiddie pornographer while pretending to be an inspiring if simplistic pop psych speaker and writer?  Is this a statement about sometimes pedophile priests, and if so is it saying that when they sin they should be allowed to suffer only their inner pain because they're ultimately doing a lot of good?  Or am I reading too much into it?  At any rate, whatever I may think of the message it was well done, the whole buildup with all the misdirection and then this ambiguous punch line.  Not a total let down, worth having watched it, still a tad over rated.",1455580800,,1660,4.461794019933555

1670435,5,B00005V3Z4,"A young Jake Gyllenhaal stars in this 2001 psychological teen thriller as Donnie Darko, a troubled but intelligent high school teen, living in Middlesex, Virginia with his parents and 2 sisters, Samantha and Elizabeth. The film is based off the 80s, taking place around the time of the 1988 Presidential US Election. One night, Donnie is awakened by a mysterious voice and lead out to the front yard where he encounters monstrous, bordering demonic rabbit called Frank eerily informs Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.

He awakes the next morning on a golf course and returns home to find that a plane engine has fallen from the sky and crashed into his bedroom. The strange part is, no one knows where the engine came from and there are no reports or signs of a crashed airplane. Over the next 28 days that'll lead to some sort of doom, Donnie Darko will find out who he is, how to love, what it means to be alive, and ultimately will may discover the key to the universe that could alter time and destiny.

Overall: Donnie Darko is a film that's hard to explain. It's mixed with drama, comedy, creepiness, intensity, laughs, and sadness. It's one of those movies that you can't really describe too much in detail or else you'll give away parts of the flick. What I love about this movie so much is the Donnie Darko character and how relatable he can be to some viewers. He's not just your average teen. Everything about the character is appealing. His intelligence, his frustrations with the world and ""the system"", his exploration of good and evil, his mental anguish, and so on and so forth. The pace of the film moves at an adequate rate. Not too slow and not too fast, but just at the right pace to keep you buckled in and captivated beginning to end. Watching this at first, this film can be a bit confusing to understand--as I know I was a bit confused and seeking answers about certain things when it was all said and done. But it's completely intentional. I believe the overall point of this movie is for the viewer to use their mind and draw their own conclusions on the premise. I searched for so many questions and answers about Donnie Darko and found numerous philosophical and psychological answers, I was intrigued. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie Dark is absolutely astonishing. He takes the role, runs with it, and never looks back. The Donnie Darko character is filled with layers of mystique and he staggeringly unravels each one to perfection. The film is star-studded to say the least. Drew Barrymore appears in the flick as a laid back but dedicated English teacher, Karen Pomeroy. Patrick Swayze also appears as a smug, motivational speaker, Jim Cunningham. Really, everyone who had a part in this movie did an astounding job. But I can't forget about that freakin creepy bunny rabbit! Seriously! It takes a lot to creep me out but that rabbit did the trick (not for kids). Overall, Donnie Darko is an intriguing gem. The plot is gratifying, the acting is on point, and it offers up every emotion and feeling possible from happiness to laughter to sadness and others. It's a movie that stands out by itself and can't be touched. A great for the ages that should be on everyone's to watch list. It'll definitely have you watching it again, that's for sure. Well? What are you waiting for? Go buy it and give this a watch!",1453075200,,3397,4.622516556291391

1670582,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a science fiction psychological thriller that stars Jake Gyllenhaal in the title role. It depicts the adventures of the title character as he seeks the meaning and significance behind his troubling Doomsday-related visions.

Donnie is a bright and charming high-school student who also has a dark and willfully eccentric side as he does little to mask his contempt for many of his peers and enjoys challenging the authority of the adults around him. He also visited on occasion by Frank, a monstrous six-foot rabbit that only he can see who often urges him to perform dangerous and destructive pranks. Late one night, Frank leads him out of his home to inform him that the world will come to an end in less than a month. Later, the engine of a jet aircraft comes crashing through the ceiling of his room, making him think there might be something to Frank's prophesies after all. The rest of Donnie's world is only marginally less bizarre, as he finds himself dealing with his confused parents, his sister, his perplexed analyst, a rebellious English teacher, a sleazy self-help expert and the new girl at school who is attracted by Donnie's quirks.

This film is a daring, original vision, packed with jarring ideas and intelligence and featuring a remarkable performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. Also,it is an unclassifiable but stunningly original film obliterates the walls between teen comedy, science fiction, family drama, horror, and cultural satire but it remains wildly entertaining throughout. The debut feature of writer-director Richard Kelly is a shattering, hypnotic work that sets its own terms and gambles-- rightfully so, as it turns out that a viewer will stay aboard for the full ride. Also,80's Tears For Fears hit songs such as ""Head Over Heels"" and ""Mad World"" are part of the film soundtrack. No wonder it has become a cult classic.",1441238400,,1869,5.006430868167203

1670608,5,B00005V3Z4,"For many years, I had mostly ignored this movie. I had heard about it here and there, but nothing made it stand out in my mind. But the idea that it was a cult classic always stuck in the back of my mind. So one day, I finally bought it. It was one of the best finds I've ever made in movies. For a movie that was made on a shoestring budget, it is incredibly well-written, and Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect in the lead as Donnie Darko. The basic premise of the movie is that Donnie is an outcast teen who can't stand his family, school, or most of his life. One night, he gets a visit from a giant rabbit-looking being named Frank, who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days and change. Right from the beginning, you're left wondering if Donnie is just schizophrenic or MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder), or if what you see through his eyes is real, and this plot point is used to perfection throughout the entire movie.

Through the rest of the movie, Donnie has to perform certain tasks at the behest of Frank, all of which seem nuts to everyone else around him, but which he doesn't question in the slightest because he comes under the thrall of Frank whenever a new task is presented to him. In between, he finds a girl (Jenna Malone) who in her own way seems to understand him, and they have a sort-of romance. Donnie keeps encountering strange happenings and even stranger characters, and he goes on an obsessive search for what's going on that leads him into darker and darker territory. In the end, he must make a fateful decision (which I will not spoil here).

For anyone who likes a movie that needs several viewings to catch all the small nuances and plot twists, this movie is definitely for you. And the movie itself isn't the only wonderful thing here--even the soundtrack (which features a Gary Jules cover of ""Mad World"" by Tears For Fears which is actually superior to the original) fits perfectly with the movie. Overall, this is a gem of a movie, and I can now see why so many people over the years have extolled its virtues.",1440288000,,2058,4.398950131233596

1670633,5,B00005V3Z4,"Due to my burgeoning interest in supernatural/celestial movies, I purchased this dvd of Donnie Darko; The Directors Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition) on February 12, 2015.  As many people know, this movie is about a Virginia teenager named Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) who appears to be the only one who is able to see a spirit who has already died and crossed over to another world named Frank (James Duval). Donnie Darko is naturally at first leery of communicating with Frank but starts to trust him a little more after his life is saved from an aircraft crashing in his room. Both his parents Rose and Eddie Darko (played by Mary Mcdonnell and Holmes Osborne) and his siblings Elizabeth and Samantha Darko (played by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Daveigh Chase) care about Donnie Darko in their own way. However, even they are unsure on how to deal with what appears to be insane mind even though Donnie Darkos unconventional communications with Frank allow him to glimpse into the future. Donnie Darkos world brightens a bit when he falls in love with a teenage female named Gretchen Ross (played by Jena Malone) who is a newcomer to the Middlesex Virginia area. There are a number of other multiple famous people featured on this dvd; such as the late Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Seth Rogen, Ashley Tisdale etc.). However, the ending made me understand why my husband politely told me that it was a good thing that I had my Shania Twain concert dvd and a Strawberry Shortcake movie to watch for cheering me up afterwards. Even then, I would still watch Donnie Darko again (especially since I own the dvd), but I would definitely still have something uplifting to watch afterwards. The following are some of the extras associated with this Donnie Darko movie: dvd is divided up into two dvd discs and would also be of interest to aspiring writers/scriptwriters as well as movie buffs; disc one has audio commentary with writer/director Richard Kelly and Director Kevin Smith, disc two has Donnie Darko production diary (with optional commentary by director of photography Steven Poster), They Made Me Do It Too-The Cult of Donnie Darko, Storyboard to Screen Featurette, and Directors Cut Theatrical Trailer. Last, but not least, there is the feature of The #1 Fan; A Darkomentary; Darryl Donaldson, a Donnie Darko movie fanatic, is shown meeting James Duval (actor who voiced Frank) and meeting various people affiliated with the movie at a San Diego California Comic Con. One more thing; there are various pop culture references in the Donnie Darko film such as; snippets to the song Head Over Heels by Tears For Fears, a homage to Tears For Fears with the feature of The Mad World song and a scene where Donnie Darkos younger sister is part of dance troupe called Sparkle Motion (dancing to the song Notorious by Duran Duran) plus more pop culture references which would probably take up the length of another review.",1437609600,,2919,4.88508064516129

1670673,5,B00005V3Z4,"ive seen this movie many, many times over. it never fails to impress, inspire and entertain.

there are many themes, plots and sub-plots. the characters are off-beat enough to create tonal subtleties that lift up the main plot.

of the themes that can -and should- be discussed i think that the most impressive is ""the end of the world"". The very phrase conjures up any number of ideas and metaphors. in this case, i feel that ""the end of the world"" for donnie would have been the series of events that actually came to a head on halloween night at Grandma Death's residence (i'll leave out the details so you can see for yourself). However one detail that i won't leave out is that ""the end of the world"" would have been the tragic death of his mother. Their relationship is perhaps the most subtle and poignant of all. I believe that she was/is the center of his world, she was the only one that appeared to truly empathize with him, yet was still willing to offer some sort of strict/stern parental guidance for her son. Again, everything that transpired on halloween night, topped by her death would surely have put donnie (already struggling with borderline paranoid schizophrenia) over the edge; in other words it would have been ""the end of the world"".

THAT'S JUST MY OPINION!!

This director's cut is really good,a lot of the extra footage ""fills in the gaps"". I enjoyed finally getting to read/see excerpts from roberta sparrows book; and seeing more of the inter-dynamics of donnies' parents. if you're a fan of the original release then you will enjoy this version - how can you not?! oh, just one more thing .... cellar door ....",1434240000,,1642,4.651724137931034

Then that extremely interesting face of Jake Gyllenhaal  his expression of blankness as if he was deeply medicated (which his character was) sparked my interest then combine that with this typical upper class Suburban hell  finally throw in a demented  extremely disturbing rabbit  this elevate Donnie Darko to wonderful and chilling.

The filtering of time and place, character arcs, cultural commentary, neo-metaphysics, hypnosis, cultural commentary (the ""VOTE DUKAKIS"" message on the refrigerator, after the father's displeased look, is priceless) and too-many-other-things to name is so aptly handled -- so ""fitted-together"" -- that one feels the well-worn metaphor of a ""chinese box"" is relevant, here.

Jake Gyllenhaal had no reason to doubt himself, after he made this movie (as DeNiro once said, during the making of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taxi-Driver-HD/dp/B008Y6UOQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taxi Driver [HD</a>]: ""We felt we were making something people'd still be watching 20 years later!""); no matter what, THIS one was in the can!

WOW!  Every turn of the narrative manages to follow a straight path and pack in an additional detour, while getting there.  This film is a masterful lesson in how not to overstretch the canvas: little details keep brimming under the surface, making it worth your while to pay attention.  On top of that, Richard Kelly has a masterful eye for the way we view cultural figures as icons; hence Noah Wyle as the understanding science teacher and Drew Barrymore as the progressive English teacher come across as neither out-of-place, nor offhandedly sewn into the fabric of the movie, but *deliberately* placed there to play off our intentional-and-otherwise impressions of the people on the screen.

Hilarious, heartbreaking, scary, insightful and tragic by turns, ""Donnie Darko"" is a movie that looms large.  Already it's an essential component of its decade, too dense in content and meaning for any one reviewer to plumb the depths of, exhaustively.  How did this happen?",1429228800,,2050,5.544871794871795

1670712,5,B00005V3Z4,"This movie is great; don't get me wrong however I also have seen We Need To Talk About Kevin and I thought it was much better and was blown away and deeply moved by it.  Generally I like symbolism and determining what is and isn't real as in The Machinist and American Psycho.  Here, though, the movie is entirely based on the science of time travel and having never first read the book I went into it not knowing this and taking much literally that wasn't happening at all.  By the time the movie ended I was just glad it was over. I thought the portrayal of Donnie Darko was great and that the overall feel of mental illness rang true.  However when I watched We Need To Talk About Kevin I was so mesmerized that I couldn't turn away for a split second.  They are two different types of mental illness, Donnie seemingly harmless to anyone except himself and in fact having a need even to save the rest of the world from evil at least as he sees in these alternate universes whereas in Kevin you have an extremely dangerous teen and the progression that they show beginning when he was so young was fascinating especially because all the actors playing Kevin were so authentic and remarkably seemed like the same person.  I will close again by saying that Donnie Darko, too, was a remarkably believable person however you never got to see the progression of how he came to be that way and I ask please that if you loved this WATCH WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN; it may blow your mind like it did mine!!",1428796800,,1501,4.3428571428571425

1670800,1,B00005V3Z4,"Donny Darko has become a movie with a cult following.  Many fans say that they relate to Donny not trusting adults, being an outsider and not fitting in, while some say they like ""dark"" movies.  Many also say that Donny Darko is a movie for intelligent people, which implies that they themselves are intelligent - these same fans often make comments about people who dislike the movie as being ""stupid"" or ""having no active brain cells.""  Personally, the people that I would consider ""intelligent"" understand that tastes in movies are subjective, much like music or food, and would not call anyone names for having different tastes.  There are also a group of fans who love the movie but admit that they don't understand it.

*Warning, Spoilers!*

After being disappointed by the movie, I read the literature about this movie and was left even more disappointed.  The movie felt slow paced, the characters and dialogue were dry.  The movie is based on sci-fi concepts that the director created.  Donny is caught in the middle of an event that creates a ""Tangent Universe,"" or parallel reality. He is guided by the ""manipulated dead"" and ""manipulated living"" to guide an ""Artifact"" or object out of the Tangent Universe within 28 days or the Universe may be destroyed.  The manipulated dead are those who have died in the Tangent Universe and must help Donnie in order to prevent their own deaths, while the manipulated living have no idea that they are helping Donny but must do so or they will die.  Donny has been given certain powers to accomplish his task, such as increased strength, telekinesis, control over the elements, and the ability to create wormholes.  However, none of these concepts are explained in the theatrical release of the movie.  Donny is a troubled teen with psychological issues. He spends much of the movie with either a dead, unhappy expression on his face or wears a smirk when he is about to do something mischievous.  Throughout the movie, a person in a giant bunny suit than only Donny can see tells him to do things such as flooding the school or burning down a house.  At the end of the movie, Donny watches the engine come off a plane during a storm and the engine falls into what looks like a tornado or water spout.  Donny actually removes the engine from the plane with his telekinesis and creates a wormhole from water using his powers - of course this again isn't explained or apparent in the movie, as Donny is simply shown sitting on his car observing the events.  Once the jet engine is through the wormhole and removed from the tangent universe, the normal universe is restored, and the last 28 days in the tangent universe are undone.  Donny awakens back in his room where the jet engine falls through the roof and kills him.",1420761600,6,2770,4.711618257261411

Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a typical, upper middle class, cringing dork with anger issues and a friend called Frank, who appears to be a cross between a pooka and Satan Bunny.  Frank informs Donnie that the world only has till the eve of Halloween to live.

Jam-packed with ideas, some of which should lie on the cutting floor: we have surreal visual homages to the paintings of William Blake and John Martin, a soundtrack oddly reminiscent of Badlands, a rock video sequence with (of all things) Tears For Fears songs, Drew Barrymore as an irresponsible teacher of literature, a terrific Jack Palance style turn by Patrick Swayze as a dubious motivational speaker on the subject of controlling fear, Katherine Ross as a mushy Jungian psychologist, a Grandma Death who keeps crazily checking her letterbox, a crippled plane, and a slice of hokum concerning the dynamics and philosophy of time travel.

In some cases the extra material helped, but in most it just needlessly extended scenes or overly explained things.

1670944,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko came out in 2001 & was written and directed by Richard Kelly.
This is a very unique and memorable film.
It's a forward thinking 80s throwback grounded in innovation.
There are very few films that successfully achieve a vintage feel mixed with a more modern philosophical outlook.
Because of this, Donnie Darko was destined for cult classic status from the start.

The soundtrack, the style, the look and feel are all on point.
Aside from the visual presentation there is certainly something more.
Notably, this film marked the arrivals of Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Jena Malone.
Furthermore, in a masterclass of casting, Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze are also featured.
This inclusion of 80s icons successfully strengthens the legitimacy of the throwback aesthetic.
You can see Richard Kelly had a vision and he brought it to the screen.

In Spielberg fashion, the film focuses on a family unit in the middle of America.
The center piece of the story revolves around Donnie Darko.
Donnie is a medicated sleep walker troubled by intensive apocalyptic visions.
And that is only the beginning.

A jet engine mysteriously falls out of the sky and smashes mercilessly into the Darko home.
To heighten the paranoia, no airline is reporting that an engine is missing from one of its jets.
Where did the engine come from? It had to come from somewhere.

This inexplicable occurrence is the basis for Donnie's increasingly complex & disturbing visions of mass destruction.
In a quest for understanding, Donnie converses with his therapist, questions the science teacher, listens to Joy Division, & celebrates halloween.
All of these activities contribute to Donnie's potential grasp on the very complex structure of time and space.

Donnie reads The Philosophy of Time Travel, written by Roberta Sparrow, in an attempt to figure this puzzle out.
The searching leads Donnie further down the rabbit hole. What does it all mean?
Yes, there are a number of questions. Some are answerable and some, not so much.

Donnie Darko's ability to transcend cultural eras could be considered time travel in it's own right.
It will take you back, then back further, and then possibly forward.

Overall, a fun thoughtful mental expedition.
As with all great adventures, it's about the journey and not necessarily the destination.
If you appreciate cult films, Darko is required viewing.

""A wrecking ball smashes into the tall building, and a few floors collapse into the big hole. Hours later, the office building has been reduced to a pile of rubble, and a job has been well done. The workers had executed the demolition ""with the seriousness of creators--and destruction after all is a form of creation.""",1400371200,,2712,5.078651685393258

1670958,4,B00005V3Z4,"After reading a number of reviews about this movie (both the original theatrical release and director's cut) and finding them somewhat mixed, I ordered both versions to judge for myself. Having never seen this film before, I was kind of excited to see what all of the hub-bub was about.

I watched each of these versions twice, and I have to say that I can now understand why some fans prefer one over the other. Without going into detail that would spoil the experience for future viewers, the basic premise of the Donnie Darko story is a conundrum - what is real and what is the product of a troubled or disturbed mind, and how would one ever prove either without any tangible evidence? It's much like proving the existence of God, which is addressed and plays a part in the plot, as is the concept of metaphorical irony.

In short, the original cut offers a more thought-provoking experience for the viewer by omitting certain details included in the director's cut that seem to tip the delicate balance in one particular direction. However, it also has a few annoying disconnects to references that begged for a little more depth or explanation.

The director's cut, though still quite good, goes a little too far in depth or explanation about certain details that has led some viewers astray from the basic premise of the Donnie Darko story, which is the conundrum. I don't believe that the director intended viewers to ""understand"" or ""solve"" it strictly from one perspective or another, but to consider the irony of the human mind - that the very thing on which we totally rely for our perceptions of the world around us as well as our identity can't always be trusted - and how that irony is manifested in all of us to some extent.

As far as the visual and audio qualities of both versions, each offers a unique but pleasurable experience to the viewer. The differences in the musical scores and sound effects between the two versions are few but significant in some scenes, yet don't detract from the main plot of story in any major way. The original cut is faster paced and projects a darker ""feel"" to the viewer, but lacks some of the cooler technical aspects of the director's cut.

I realize that some of you came here to find a definitive answer to the question about which version is better. However, as disappointing as it may seem, my final opinion is much like the story of Donnie Darko. It's a conundrum.

But whatever you decide, don't use the excuse ""They made me do it"" (LOL - Just watch the movie and you'll get it).",1396915200,4,2540,4.596026490066225

In repsonse to the debate of which version to view first: I say view the original theatrical release - no question about it. Just as I don't care for the mess that is Star Wars Special Edition, I don't really care for the Director's Cut version. IMO it adds too much unecessary fluff and gives too much of what makes the movie unique, and that is to explain what everything is about. Plus the change to the opening song in the Director's Cut completely altered the mood and poorly fit some of the scenes. My advice - Just watch the original version and if you have questions, get online and search for the explanation and speculation to your heart's content.

This DVD is the Director's Cut: it's almost a half-hour longer and has alternate/deleted scenes and different music at a few spots. I'll say right now that I love both versions, maybe the DC a little bit more. Some people prefer the theatrical cut. Overall the story is the same, but the plot and theory are explained a little bit more in the DC. You can just search for all the differences between the two versions online.

There's still plenty of room for you to think for youself about some intriguing subjects. I can't say for sure that the video is greatly enhanced by the extra data of the BluRay process but It would probably be more evident on a larger/better TV and the sound is amazing to say the least.

I'm sure the other reviews out there over the last decade+ cover all the merits of the movie, but I'd like to focus on what the movie made me feel.  The movie brilliantly drew me into the main character.  He's part superhero, and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the world, or maybe just the world most closely connected to him.

The movie draws you in with the haunting soundtrack (which I highly recommend for insomniac's who like closing their eyes :-) ).  The score and the song selections are fitting and revealing.  What is most amazing to me is how out of their element so many well known actors and actresses are:  Drew Barrymore, Noah Wile, Jake Gyllenhall, Patrick Swayze, etc.

1671013,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is, quite simply, one of the most unique and thought-provoking movies of all time. Originally released just six weeks after 9/11, the film - with its early scene of a jetliner's engine crashing through the roof of a suburban house and its open-ended questions about life and death - initially unsettled many people. On first viewing, you likely will find yourself left with more questions than answers. And therein lies the very goal of the film: to weave a tale that is so multi-faceted that second and third viewings let the viewer into the story that much more.

The role of Donnie Darko is brilliantly acted by Jake Gyllenhaal. He completely transforms himself into the title role of Donnie. His sister (in the movie and in real life) is played by the delightful Maggie Gyllenhaal. The film opens with Donnie being found ""asleep"" on a golf course. And so the story begins. Patrick Swayze's performance as a self-help guru selling simplistic solutions (think Tony Robbins with a very, very dark side) shows the man's incredible versatility and his ability to commit to a role. Throughout the movie, constantly brilliant dialogue is intertwined with a soundtrack of 80's era pop that sets the scene perfectly. When Frank, the giant rabbit, first appears, what are we to make of him? Is he a medication-induced hallucination? A being from another dimension? Or something else, something running in parallel with Donnie's life? I think part of the answer lies in the exchange between Donnie and Frank: ""Why are you wearing that stupid bunny suit?"" ""Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?""

The Director's Cut restores some critical footage to the film, footage that helps flesh out some aspects of the story while also opening up other avenues for thinking about the story and its meaning. Bonus features include a ""Darkomentary"" about the cult following the film has garnered, that is quite an interesting watch as well. Donnie Darko is a film that I find myself watching again to look for new clues and theories. It is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy a movie that encourages thinking in new and interesting ways, Donnie Darko is for you.",1381795200,,2167,4.869918699186992

1671025,5,B00005V3Z4,"Richard Kelly's 2001 film, Donnie Darko, has both an impressive cast list and a thought-provoking story. Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore, and Patrick Swayze star in the movie.
Initially, the picture appears to be a simple, offbeat sci-fi flick. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Donnie Darko, seems to be a slightly disturbed yet average teenager surviving high school in the suburbs. He visits a therapist regularly because of his persistent sleepwalking, yet everything else in his life is as average as can be. Donnie's life changes when a man in a giant rabbit suit, Frank, visits him at midnight and lures him outside. His interference saves Donnie's life and launches him into a bizarre adventure. Donnie's mental health decreases as hallucinations plague him while he seems to gain superhuman abilities as well. He encounters Frank repeatedly, and the giant rabbit helps him realize his destiny.
However, Donnie Darko, refuses to be labeled under one genre. It boasts elements of romance, mystery, horror, drama, and comedy while acting as a relevant social commentary.
Rebuking simplified views of morality and emotion, this film promotes free-thinking. It satirizes the black and white ideology that so many education systems shamelessly promote. Rather than ranking all experiences on the ""fear or love"" scale, Donnie claims that humanity cannot be boxed into neat categories and that there are seldom blanket answers for any problems.
Kelly masterfully crafted the atmosphere of the movie and its significance to the storyline. The movie left me feeling constantly wary, hairs standing up on the back of my neck. It horrified me in a way that most traditional scary movies could never hope to. There were no spectacular special effects or any monsters to speak of, but it hammered uneasiness into my mind. Whether it was during a sunny day or the witching hour, I couldn't shake the overwhelming feeling that something was out of place and that was terrifying for me. It was like an entire film taking place in Uncanny Valley.
Jake Gyllenhaal's acting fits flawlessly into the movie's atmosphere as well. He appropriately balances emotional expression, the awkwardness of a high-schooler, and defiance against repression.
The romance in Donnie Darko transcends the stereotypical Nicholas Sparks formula. It's quirky, adorably awkward, and it highlights a vital aspect of romance that usually comes off as clich and melodramatic- sacrifice.
Donnie Darko is not a film for people craving action-filled scenes and a light plot. It is not a leisurely swim for the brain. Its style and depth are reminiscent of other great thoughtful works, such as Fight Club and A Clockwork Orange. Truly, though, Donnie Darko is a rare film that I believe anyone can enjoy if they watch it with the right mindset. Similarly, anyone watching it in the mood for a fluffy timewaster will be sorely disappointed.
It is a complex and intuitive piece that refuses to hold back its blows at society's conceptions of good and evil. Even within the serious context of its message, Donnie Darko supplies plenty of laughs and holds its place as one of the most influentially entertaining movies of the 2000s.",1378166400,,3203,5.185328185328185

1671030,1,B00005V3Z4,"In the subgenre of pshycological thrillers known as the ""Mindf***"" category, Donnie Darko is among the most liked and well-known. I have no idea why. Creating a confusing mess and explaining nothing about itself is not a Mindblow. DD shows demonic posession, talks about the possibility of time travel, and this is sll supposedly leading up to the prevention of doomsday. No attempt is made to explain how doomsday is prevented using a single jet engine. Nor why the incident with said jet engine repeats itself. Or why Donnie's letter to the old woman makes no damned sense at all. The list goes on and on with all the unexplained *wtf?!* moments in this film.

Of course, there are those that argue that Donnie Darko has no plot holes. The theories offered by internet folk to explain DD speak of superpowers, ""tangent"" universes, ""the manipulated dead"", etc. They make sense when you read them. These theories are worth checking out, because there is probably no way your brain will jump to such farfeched conclusions, based on the little-or-no info the film gives you in its supernatural aspects. Here's my theory: DD is a badly made movie that could have been compelling if it wasn't so lazy. Surely the taseless, pointless discussion about how smurfs relieve their sexual urges, could have been lopped to make room for explainations. Same with the sex-obsessed hypnotherapy session. why are scenes like these allowed to exist when they do nothing but juxtapose the movie's cerebral/mysterious tones?

I don't necessarily need the solution to the puzzle spoon-fed to me. I do ask that it explain itself SOMEHOW. Because Donnie Darko dosen't, it fails as a psychological thriller, not to mention a Mindblow.",1376438400,3,1711,4.979020979020979

I like some of the 'irony' in the film, for instance the movie theatre featuring The Last Temptation of Christ and The Evil Dead. Overall I think it's worth watching however the end of the movie makes me feel a tad empty, it reminds me of It's a Wonderful Life, only with the opposite results. I wonder if that's a good message to send? It does put a damper on the film for me but I can't bypass the other great attributes the picture has to offer, hence the 4 star rating.",1375488000,,957,4.351955307262569

And unless you are extremely smart and known something about time travel, you will probably be in the same boat as me.  After some internet research (YouTube, Yahoo Answers)for the complete plot unveiled, I felt much better about the plot and the next day I watched it again.  It was amazing to see everything fall into place and I found my own meaning to the movie and its amazing ending.  If having to do a little research and taking observations from those smarter than you after watching a movie isn't your thing and if you don't enjoy feeling a little confused, then this movie probably isn't for you.

1671090,5,B00005V3Z4,"I've heard a lot about this movie, about how good it really is etc etc... but I've never watched it until now....

At first... it just seems like a teen flick trying to do Scream, but then as the plot developed, and the different story arcs started emerging, it became more and more and MORE engaging. Really. I didn't not even pause for a toilet break.

And then the end... WOW!! Not the big kind of Blockbuster movie wow... It was a really subtle sequence. But it resonated so loudly in my head... I honestly cannot remember any other movie that made me just sit there and contemplate everything that Donnie Darko had for me, the viewer, for so long. In such deep thought... Sad, happy are just words describing insufficient emotion to what I am really trying to say.

I would compare it to American Beauty... Donnie Darko is better, more entertaining, MUCH more engaging than American Beauty. Even the romance part... it didn't need flashy nudity or what... but well, I'm a hopeless romantic, and I just loved the way that part of life was portrayed in Donnie Darko.

If you haven't seen, go watch it. NOW. If you HAVE seen it, then I know you just want to watch it again but you just can't seem to get past contemplating the whole movie and so its just sitting on your shelf now while you cannot move on and get off your seat to the toilet.

It also makes it easier to understand with the interspersed shots of the Philosophy Of Time Travel book shown throughout.  You can pause the movie and read paragraphs from the book which bring the movie into focus for people confused as to what is happening.  A big difference is the sound track.

This is one of the most unique movies that I have ever seen. I cannot add anything new to this review because most of the other reviews pretty much sum it up. The script is excellent; The music is fantastic (one of my new favorite songs and ringtone is Head over heels by Tears for fears); The acting is also great. Because of the bunny I thought that Donnie Darko was a horror movie and it took me months to get up the nerve to watch it because I don't like horror movies with demonic type stuff. After reading several of the reviews here on Amazon, I concluded that that bunny may look like that but there is more to the bunny than meets the eye (no pun intended. You have to watch the movie to understand what I mean *Smile*) I don't have a full understanding of this movie. I have to watch it again but it is well worth viewing several times over alone and/or with others; definately with the input of your family, friends and associates. I must own this movie!

He's visited in his dreams by a rabbit that tells him of the terrifying  things that he will soon experience. Can he change the future or is he doomed to stand by and watch his nightmares become a reality.

Despite having a cast that I don't particularly care for, this movie is awesome. I usually think Jake Gyllenhaal is kind of flat and boring. In this movie he is exactly that. The good news is that his character is very strange. His acting style suits the role perfectly. I'm not really sure why, but I've never liked Drew Barrymore either. Fortunately her role isn't big enough to hurt the film. Patrick Swayze,0 Mary McDonnell, and Jenna Malone also do a great job at their respective roles. This a movie about the future, the past, and most certainly the present. The concept of time traveling through a wormhole is also a major theme here. The soundtrack, the screenplay and the dialogue all come together beautifully to make this one of my favorite all time movies. The story is complex and the movie needs to be watched several times to get everything that is thrown at you. I definitely believe that everyone should see this movie.

This movie caused hours of debate between my friends and I when we first watched it.  The fact that it does leave questions is only a part of why I can watch it again and again.  Let's get to why I gave it only four stars.  The director's cut is flawed.  Richard Kelly added pieces from the Donnie Darko book and other images that break up the movie so it doesn't flow as well.  Also, I like the movie starting with Killing Moon by Echo and the Bunnymen as opposed to Never Tear Us Apart by INXS (which is a great song and it works, but it just throws me off cause I had watched it several times before I saw the director's cut.)  Personally I loved the feeling of things being unexplained, which Kelly tried to fix in the director's cut.  There are some great additions though. One of my favorite additions was a scene where Donnie reads a story he wrote in his English class.  So in conclusion, I recommend the movie whole-heartly, but watch the original version before the director's cut.",1345766400,,1129,4.358851674641149
1671253,4,B00005V3Z4,"Any time you hear the words ""cult classic"", you should know right off the bat that you're dealing with a movie that's not suited for a blind buy. If you are a fan or independent films, specifically indie sci-fi movies, you've probably already seen Donnie Darko and know whether or not you are willing to buy it (by the way, if you haven't seen it, rent it as soon as possible.). For those who have already experience this film, here's how it fairs on blu-ray.

The video is nothing special, but there's no reason to hate on the studio for this. Donnie Darko looks like crap and always has, but it looks its best here.

I was very surprised by how well the film sounds, though. Donnie Darko's sound design is unlike anything I've heard for a movie like this, and this blu-ray makes sure you are able to take in every bit of it.

Alright, extras. We get both versions of the film, the theatrical cut and the director's cut (for those of you who haven't seen the film, make sure you see the theatrical cut first.). The real meat of the extras comes from the three commentaries.",1345593600,,1074,4.386934673366834

1671256,4,B00005V3Z4,Item came to me in a reasonable amount of time with no damage.  Operated correctly without any problems.  Just what I was looking for.,1343088000,,134,4.541666666666667
1671257,5,B00005V3Z4,"I came very close to not buying this DVD, based on the bad reviews, but I am SO glad I did!  The negative comments from others led me to expect a horrible abomination from the theatrical cut, but it actually wasn't as bad as I feared.  Different, yes, but not bad.  Yes, the sound effects are different (for a reason), yes the song tracks are different (for a reason), yes, some of the visual effects are different (for a reason).  (The reasons are all fully explained in the commentary of this edition.)  What you have to understand is that the director, Richard Kelly, considers this a ""remix"" version of the film, not a ""replacement"" version.  He's not pulling a George Lucas and trying to usurp previous versions with this one instead; he was given the chance to make an additional version, so he did.

What is awesome about this edition, however, is not the changes from the theatrical version, but Kelly's commentary track with Kevin Smith, because it finally makes everything so perfectly clear!  When I first saw the original film on the theatrical DVD release, I kind of understood it, but not completely.  Then I watched the deleted scenes and the extras (the Philosophy of Time Travel excerpts) on the original DVD and I got a much better understanding of the film.

With the director's cut, the deleted scenes and the POTT excerpts have now been added into the film, so if you've never seen the theatrical release you might find this one easier to understand.  Completists should be aware that some of the deleted scenes that have been restored to this version are NOT available in the deleted scenes on the theatrical release DVD - they are making their first appearance here.

But it's when you listen to the director's cut commentary that we finally get the full explanation of what Kelly meant to convey.  I won't spoil anything here, but even if you think you sort-of understand what the ""manipulated living"" and the ""manipulated dead"" and the ""receiver,"" etc all mean (from the POTT excerpts), it's never really made completely clear until this commentary with Kevin Smith -- even Kevin Smith admits there are things he didn't understand until this meeting with Kelly, like what the other characters were (subconsciously) doing throughout the story to influence Donnie.  And there is one relationship between two characters that I don't think anyone but Kelly got until now.

Now, this might mean that Kelly is just really bad at getting his point across on a dramatic, script level - otherwise why would it have taken this many tries to get the true plot structure clear to the audience?  Unless he meant this film to be the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for its generation: deliberate vagueness to leave it open for individual interpretation.

And for those wanting to know why Kevin Smith was chosen to assist in the commentary, it's because Kelly was attempting to make the movie more like a comic-book film (despite his own admission of not being knowledgeable about comic books) and asked Kevin Smith along to talk about whether or not he succeeded.

Bottom line, which version do I prefer?  Well, the theatrical version, but mostly because I prefer its song selections to the director's cut song selections (song choices and song placements, which both changed).  But to truly understand this film, you need to be familiar with the deleted scenes, the extras, AND the director's cut commentary - all of which are in this edition.",1342310400,,3448,4.8217317487266556

1671278,2,B00005V3Z4,"In my opinion, this movie is pretty terrible. I bought it about a year ago, after reading that my favorite celeb likes it and seeing the high IMDB rating. I finally watched it several months back and could not understand why on earth so many people enjoyed it. Then a couple weeks ago, my brother, two cousins and I (mixture of males and females, ages ranging from 24 to 40+) were searching through my collection for a movie to watch. I warned them that I found ""Donnie Darko"" terrible, but they still wanted to check it out because of the buzz. I gave in, hoping I might form a different opinion after watching it again. At various points during the movie, my family members commented about the slow pace and/or the bizarre dialogue and occurrences. By the end of the movie, all three of them had come to the same conclusion as I had: this is quite a bad movie. So perplexed by the ratings and reviews, we watched the bonus material. Even with a few things we didn't pick up on explained, still a bad movie.

When I think about ""Donnie Darko"" and the positive reception it gets, I almost feel like this has to be a joke. Today I randomly Googled the movie to see if there was still something I was missing. I read this entire article: [...]. It didn't change my opinion. I can't believe the creators went so far as to make an elaborate website: [...]. I can't believe both the IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes pages for the movie have such high numbers. I can't believe there are all these positive reviews here. The problem is not that I don't understand the theories about how everything ties together and the overall meaning. The problem is not that I can't suspend reality. Or that I judge movies harshly (I rarely consider a movie ""terrible""). I argue it's that, no matter how you slice it, ""Donnie Darko"" is sucky. I am giving it two stars because at least it makes you think about relatively interesting things and because the awfulness of it is a little entertaining, as is the fact that so many people think it's great. I probably wouldn't be leaving this review if it weren't for the deficiency of similarly poor ones. I almost feel a duty to write this.",1339372800,2,2157,4.460759493670886

Anything more, or less, is considered sacrilege. I left those thoughts behind me while watching and came out with an appreciation for the full Darko experience.

Liked:

- The talk between father and son about dealing with other's preconceptions of who you should be, and how full of BS many people are

- The book overlays that preceded new scenes... gave a sense of fatality, that this path was hard-wired somehow... as Donnie once stated, he felt it was ""God's Plan""

- The statement at the end how some might recall events that happened in the tangent timeframe, brought forward into the current... did not recall this in theatrical cut. It gave a sense that what was done in the tangent timeframe wasn't for nothing. It also gives the sense that Donnie Darko was a metaphorical modern Jesus Christ, dyeing for their sins and then giving them a second chance to change things in the proper timeline.

Disliked:

- The checkerboard pattern and fireworks scene... only thing I felt was a bit overdone

Many who have had differing opinions of the film especially with the release of the Director's Cut version of the film.

But ""Donne Darko"" has a pretty considerable following and yes, has achieved cult status.

Not surprising as ""Donnie Darko"" is one of those films that tends to mix reality, non-reality, time-travel and possibly a parallel universe to give a surreal film that people need to watch this film more than once.  And sure enough, with each viewing of the film, people tend to find certain things that they have never seen before.  And I have to agree because each time I watch this film, I always discover something different, something new.

So, what is ""Donnie Darko""?

""Donnie Darko"" is a film written and directed by Richard Kelly (""Domino"", ""The Box"", ""Southland Tales"") and while it was not successful in the box office (the film was budgeted at $4.5 million and took home $4.1 million), the film has done much better in home video release.

In 2002, a DVD for the film was released.  Followed by the ""Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut"" 2004 DVD featuring 21 additional minutes of extra footage and new special features and in 2009, ""Donnie Darko"" was released on Blu-ray with both the Director's Cut and theatrical version of the film.

And here we are with a 2011 Blu-ray release titled ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"".  While pretty much the same release as what was released back in 2009, this edition includes the Blu-ray with both theatrical and Director's Cut release and the special features DVD from the popular 2005 Deluxe Edition release but also includes the original 2002 DVD that came with special features (which were not included on the Deluxe Edition or the 2009 Blu-ray release) and a digital copy of the film.

VIDEO:

""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is the same Blu-ray release from 2009.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:#5:1 aspect ratio), the picture quality is quite soft.  The film is not actually vibrant but there is clarity over the previous DVD release.  There is a good amount of grain and black levels are good.  But maybe its the original film elements but I did notice a good amount of noise as well.

Overall, ""Donnie Darko"" (theatrical or Director's Cut) has good PQ and while not as vibrant or very detailed compared to modern releases on Blu-ray, the PQ for the film is good.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  While dialogue and music is what comprises this film's lossless soundtrack, there are times where you hear immersive sound.  From the fall of the airplane engine on Donnie's bedroom, the sound of the worlmhole, the brooding sound of Frank or the sound of 80's music from Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears or INXS, the audio quality for the film is good but don't expect full immersion via the surround channels.  The film is primarily central and front channel driven!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.

""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Donnie Darko"" is a film that I don't know if it's even worth explaining because it's a movie that is meant to be seen and watched again.  And even if you do watch the theatrical version or even the Director's Cut, only those willing to rewatch and dissect the film, to piece together the various clues, will find the film to be quite entertaining.

For me, I love films that make you think, I love films that have a lasting rewatch value because you tend to have different interpretations of what is going on and what is happening.  What is real?  What is not real?  Are we watching scenes from Donnie's perspective or reality?  Or is it a parallel, alternate timeline?

Needless to say, this is not a film that will be easily accessible for those wanting a simple, formulaic storyline.  And to make things even more confusing is the inclusion of the Director's Cut which has scenes that further make the series a bit more confusing and different, that you either will prefer on or the other.

Speaking of the Director's Cut, it's essentially almost like you are getting two different films.  The Director's Cut changes a few musical sequences and adds in other sequences that make you wonder why the Director added them but needless to say, the film was complex to begin with and now it's even made a bit more complex with the additional footage.  Especially the addition of the title cards showing the contents of the Philosophy of Time Travel.

Personally, when I watched Donnie Darko, I just thought it was sick individual who didn't take his medication and what we are watching are neither reality but a figment of his imagination.  But then again, that would be too easy of an explanation.

So, the next time I watched the film, I felt that perhaps there was  deeper meaning and almost what we see with those who have mental issues and end up hurting or murdering people because they have a problem with society, I often wondered because Donnie had so many issues of society, was always a challenge to authority, that perhaps it was his way of trying to free himself from society.  To conjure any thoughts of escaping the reality through time travel and in some way, while a smart individual, it's his inability to fit in that puts various situations in his mind.

I often feel that there is also a message from Kelly that he felt towards society.  Where his sister is a dancer for Sparkle Motion, the parents put too much emphasis on their children to achieve but for the wrong reasons.  We see it at the beginning of the film when Rose is talking to her daughter about Harvard, we see Rose more concerned about Sam's dancing and the parents for the other children are no different.  And I felt that Kelly was trying to demonstrate how messed up society is because of this thinking.  That people are consumed by this culture that there are other things that that should be cared about but no one was willing to make that change.  But it's not just Donnie's parents, it also can be seen with the teacher (played by Drew Barrymore) and other adults where society is literally heading to darkness and decay and perhaps Donnie is the one to fix the world.

But that leads me back to the people with mental problems who go on to hurt others.  In their head, they are also thinking they are trying to make the world a better place when in fact, no one sees them like that.  More like a cancer to society... the same can be seen with Donnie Darko, hero for a new generation or a cancer to society?

Last but not least, there is almost a lax of parental authority. Children are free to cuss on the table, the father just laughs.  Donnie tells a teacher to shove something up her butt and his father just laughs.  And as for Frank, the demonic rabbit, this is Donnie's figment of his own imagination.  Think of it as the devil and angel on one's shoulders, telling them what to do and not do.  Well, remove that angel out of the equation and substitute that devil for a demonic rabbit.  The rabbit is the yearning of Donnie to be destructive because afterall, who will really care?

And the irony of it all, is that destruction is going to happen but yet, Donnie seems to have found love during destruction and to see that love taken away.

Of course, I have had several interpretations of this film over the last ten years.  It's an artistic expression that reminds me of a Picasso painting where you can see a painting that looks so off, so dark and bleak, but someone else can see it as light, vibrant and unique.  Donnie Darko is a film that is not mean to be understood 100%.  It's mean for the viewer to take what they got from the film and interpret it their way.  Some may find it complex, some may find it as a simply love story.  Some may find it as a film of sacrifice.  It's all subjective to the viewer.

As for the Blu-ray release, unfortunately there is not much new aside from the downloadable digital copy that is included with this 10th anniversary of Blu-ray and the inclusion of the original 2002 DVD release.  Those hoping for a remaster or newer restoration are not going to find any changes from the 2009 Blu-ray release. But for those who have not purchased the 2009 edition on Blu-ray, then by all means, definitely give ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" a chance!  It's definitely worth checking out if you are open to creative, artistic and a different style of film.

I have heard cinema fans who talk about how they disliked the film at first but now consider it a masterpiece.  I've read people who love intellectual films to surreal films but couldn't get into ""Donnie Darko"".  Suffice to say, people do have an opinion of it.  There is no doubt that ""Donnie Darko"" Is definitely a different kind of film and possibly one that didn't do well in the box office because of its unusual nature.  But to see how this film has grown its fanbase in the last decade is quite intriguing!

Regardless of how my interpretation or others interpretation of the film may be.  Positive or negative...really, it doesn't matter because this is not your average film where one can watch once and give a definitive answer.  It's a film that requires multiple viewings and because of that, it either may peak your interest or turn you off.

""Donnie Darko"" is meant to be experienced and re-interpreted.  It's a film that is thought-provoking, intriguing and surreal but at the same time, I can easily say that it may not be accessible for the general public and it may not be for you.  But if you are into artistic expression of cinema, then ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is worth watching!

Definitely recommended for the cineaste!",1323993600,8,12004,4.774914924647545

However, if that is the case, I have to say you will have one of two reactions; this is one of the best movies of the last 20 years or these people are nuts and it should have gone (and basically did) straight to DVD.

I fall in the first camp though I know that the film has weaknesses.  I know it had some cheap corners cut, that some of the otherwise strong actors (Drew I mean you) were just off, but something about it just works.  And no, I won't pull the ultimate prententious statement and say that anyone who dislikes it ""just must not get it"", it is a little complex but it is no Momento.  You do need to carefully watch some parts to see how it all fits together and at the end, you will be faces with putting the pieces in back, but it is not crazy complex.

What is so great about `Donnie Darko' is that it remains oddly focused throughout the compelling insanity thrust onto every frame.  The core of `Donnie Darko' isn't as clear as some may want it to be, but that is half the fun.  Melding genres together to create something wholly original; it is safe to say that this film is unlike anything you've ever seen before.  Jake Gyllenhaal is phenomenal as the emotionally reserved young man who talks to giant rabbits and becomes obsessed with time travel.  As the world continues to evolve around him, Donnie finds himself increasingly fixated on a world inside that world, one that moves him and propels him to conclusions that will warp your mind.  The cast is extensive (Swayze, McDonnell, Barrymore, Malone, the hot Gyllenhaal...) and they all play their part, making the most of limited screentime to create whole characters that are interwoven into Donnie's destiny.  UGH, and please don't compare this to `Urban Legends' and `Final Destination'.  Those films, while entertaining to a point, are trashy slasher films that serve no purpose but to scare the audience.  `Donnie Darko' is a smart and provocative thriller that haunts more than it outright scares.

Which is the main reason this film has replay value, but is a tad overrated by it's cult following, though one of the better films influenced by David Lynch. It does lack the visceral images of violence, sex, & general complex ambiguities of the best surrealistic Lynch, like ""Mulholland Drive, ""Lost Highway,"" & ""Twin Peaks,"" or the memorable characters & dialog from Lynch's, ""Wild at Heart,"" but never the less, a very good film in the head games department.

1671319,4,B00005V3Z4,"Preface: Apparently there are several versions of DONNIE DARKO floating around. I watched The Director's Cut, true--but it was a Net flix version all on a single DVD.

I must have been well bolted down in my coffin when this movie was first released because it went completely under the radar. I had seen Jake Gyllenhaal in 2 later films & I thought he was a really good actor. So, I was finding out a little more about him & sort of stumbled on DONNIE DARKO. The film, of course, is fantastic (both literally & figuratively), but I can't help but wonder what it would have been like without JG in it. I felt the same way about AND THEN THERE WILL BE BLOOD with the amazing Daniel Day-Lewis. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfection itself in the leading role. And those eyes! As ambiguous & mystifying as the character he plays. KG could well be the equivalent of a Daniel Day-Lewis for his generation.

If permitted, I would have given DONNIE DARKO 4 & 1/2 stars. In the end I witheld a star because I felt there were a few cliches in the film. The ""overweight"" girl & the gym instructor seemed a bit sterotypical. The girl's graceful dance could have been lifted from a TV TWILIGHT ZONE episode where the same idea of the plump woman who fantasies being a ballerina is featured in it too. The chief bully was a bit over the top as well--I mean, snorting coke by the student's lockers--give us a break!

Then there's the scene where Donnie's therapist tells him that she has only been giving placebos. If not outright illegal, in the real world it would definitely be seen as the height of unprofessionalism...not to mention dangerous. I suppose it can be chalked up to another one of the ambiguous & ambivalent themes that run throughout the movie.

Other than the above, I was very excited by DONNIE DARKO, primarily because it visualized aspects of the Parallel Universe theories that have popped up in the scientific explorations of quantum mechanics. One theory promotes that idea that every possibility of our physical reality plays out with every possibility of outcome on each level. There's a certain element of Nietzche's ""Eternal Recurrence"" in these rather mind-bending concepts as well.

Any work of art (especially an American film) that generates the interest & cult-following (true, largely fostered by the ""official website"") has got to have something real going for it. I watched the movie twice in a row & twice the second day. To turn a phrase of Leonard Cohen (""Democracy is coming to the USA""), maybe appreciation for surrealism is finally coming to the USA.",1308787200,,2571,4.704444444444444

1671321,4,B00005V3Z4,"Review based on DIRECTOR'S CUT.
As GROUND HOG DAY made use of Nietzche's idea of the ""Eternal Recurrance"", DONNIE DARKO uses Nietzsche's ideas of ""Beyond Good and Evil"" -- using terms of the motivational speaker Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze): ""Fear and Love"". Nietzsche thought that life experiences are too variegated to simplistically interpret as being either fully good or fully evil, and this is the critique that Donnie says to his teacher Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) during the ""Fear / Love"" class exercise. Now, as far as plot structure, and where reality begins and ends... It seems that [PLOT SPOILER] Donnie is destined for tragedy, but gets a chance, through some odd combination of divine intervention and time travel, to save the world from the day of destruction. He is led in this by the Rabbit figure, Frank (James Duval), who could be Christ/angel/demon. The events cannot be interpreted simply as good or evil: [PLOT SPOILER] Burning the house down seemed evil (fear-based), but the result was good (an act of love) because the porn ring-leader was busted. [PLOT SPOILER] The scene with Donnie and Frank in the movie theatre: Frank reveils his eye wound (from when Donnie later shot him), but appears fine at the end of the movie. A risen Christ figure? [Going back and reading some of the reviews, there are some who argue that Donnie IS the Christ figure since he sacrifices himself to save others. I'm sticking with Frank, however, because Frank has the Christlike knowledge and power. ""Jesus will walk with me down through the valley..."" Frank was there for Donnie, just as Christ is there for us. Any sacrifice Donnie makes is done in imitation of Christ -- a disciple following his master.]

Then again, it could simply be a case of possession, either demonic possession or possession by the Holy Ghost.

WWDDD? What Would Donnie Darko Do? Ever since watching this movie, whenever I get an urge to do something maybe not completely rational -- something impulsive -- I see Donnie shouldering his axe with his heart glowing.",1302480000,,2048,4.916184971098266

There is nothing wrong with this movie. It's not a bad mvoie. The performances are quite moving. It comes at you from interesting angles and the characters are subteley bizzare.

The problem with the flick is that once you get past the daring artistry, the movie is pretty boring. There's not a lot going on. I know I may sound old, but the whole ""what do you mean you didn't know you were dead? on your way to dying bit "" has been done in TV shows, movies etc.

With a six foot bunny predicting the end of the world, a bad girl teacher (Drew Barrymore), teen angst that isn't annoying, a 100 year old deep thinking neighbor woman...and a time traveling jet engine that crashes into our protagonist's bedroom, you won't mistake this movie for some other one you've seen before.  It's wonderfully dark and manages to be a coming of age story with intense psychodrama, but with bits of satire and irony that made it that much richer.  Insightful and creepy turns out to be a surprisingly compatible combination.  I'm a sucker for skillful cinematography (that supports but doesn't upstage the story) and a powerful (but not overpowering) music score.  This film made great use of both, which made the overall effect extra gripping.  I saw the original movie, but the director's cut gave me lots of new perspectives that make the movie that much more meaningful to me.  It's too bad that this film didn't do well at the box office: a lot of people missed out on a gem.

Any reviewer would be hard-pressed to discuss this film without giving away significant details. Donnie Darko is a snake eating its own tail, a story where the circularity of the plot is an integral part of its enjoyment, and so many seemingly insignificant moments through the film prove crucial to the end result, a kind of dark surprise different from any of the tired twists found in recent big-budget films.
It is 1988. A borderline schizophrenic teenage boy, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is haunted by visions of a man-sized rabbit named Frank. In addition to the prophetic announcement that the world will end in ""28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds,"" Frank forces Donnie to commit a series of increasingly serious misdeeds.

As if this is not enough, a crash course in Einstein-Rosen bridges aka wormholes by physics teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff (Noah Wyle,) along with a copy of The Philosophy of Time Travel, convinces Donnie that a ""fourth dimensional construct"" has touched down right in his home town, allowing him to see such apparently hallucinatory events as streams of computer-generated liquid that hint at people's intentions.
Set to an eclectic 1980s soundtrack, and also starring Drew Barrymore (producer for this project,) Mary McDonnell and yes, Patrick Swayze, Donnie Darko is deliberately vague as to its genre--the film moves effortlessly from horror to science fiction to psychological drama, and does so successfully. The setting is vintage to the time period, but not prone to the heavy-handed display of era-specific props as other near-period pieces.
The DVD (from CBS/Fox Home Video) contains the 113 minute feature film in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1,) deleted scenes, theatrical trailer, director's commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal, the The Philosophy of Time Travel, music video for covered 80s song ""Mad World"" and an art gallery with production skills.

1671330,5,B00005V3Z4,"I was having dinner with some friends about 6 months ago and our conversation somehow became about time travel and parallel realities. Possibly because I mentioned at some point how much I love the TV show Fringe. Later that evening they asked if I had ever seen the movie Donnie Darko. I replied that I had never heard of it. They handed me the movie and told me to check it out, that it is probably something I would enjoy. Looking at the cover and jacket, I thought it was some kind of slasher flick and I wondered why they thought I would like it as they know I am very much against violence and cruelty towards any living thing. I graciously accepted it and when I got home I put it in a drawer. A few months later I came across the DVD and decided to watch it so that I could return it to them afterward. Imagine my surprise. What a brilliant thought provoking movie. Great acting, wonderful soundtrack, and a plot that makes you want to watch it again and again (which I did) to keep uncovering new things that you may have missed. I reluctantly took it back to them and told them how much I loved it and that I was going to buy myself a copy. They insisted I keep it saying they didn't care for it but they knew I would.

I recently saw the original and enjoyed that as well. I think it compliments the directors cut nicely and I hope everyone will experience both versions. The original is a bit more mysterious as you don't have the clues from Roberta Sparrow's book and a few more defining scenes. Both will leave you with unanswered questions. And when you wake from a vivid dream ... could that mean ....?

Only negative to the director's cut is that I wish they had left the Watership Down scene on the cutting room floor. And Rose Darko smoking at the end of both versions was a distraction as she doesn't smoke anywhere else in the movie (and I'm pretty anti-smoking anyway).

Eddie Darko was way cool. What a great father.

And the 'Mad World' ending, which I have watched over and over is so beautifully done, I get chills thinking about it. Especially Frank touching his right eye and Patrick Swayze grieving for all the evil he has done. Wow.

1671333,4,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko doesn't strike me as suspenseful horror in any shape or form.  More like light elements of psychological weirdness that never really hits you on a deep personal note.

It basically consists of a teenager constantly questioning his reality, questioning the possibilities of time travel, and wonders what would happen if you were to change the past so it never happened.  Mental problems perhaps a tad worse than usual for a confused teenager contributes to some wild, hallucinating effects.

Now when I was a teenager, I went through problems similar to the kid playing the role of Donnie Darko.  I'd confuse and worry myself silly *almost* to the point I'd wonder if my existence was even real or not.  This resulted in questioning whether the universe was actually real among other crazy problems.  Nothing really out of the ordinary there- most teenagers go through the same phase.  We grow out of them eventually (at least, most of us do) as we accept that death is inevitable, so I can totally see why Donnie Darko is a huge hit among the younger crowd.

Perhaps I'm too old to really appreciate it, but many of the scenes felt rather cheesy with Donnie constantly seeing odd, orb-like transparent snake images floating directly in front of his family members and friends while they were walking around the house.  Supposedly the theme is that Donnie was seeing images of a terrible situation that couldn't be avoided.  However...

I don't want to spoil the ending because that would ruin everything, but you may be shocked by the conclusion.

If anything, Donnie Darko delivers with an interesting storyline that makes you wonder where it's going, and that's it.  I honestly didn't sense any truly earth-shattering deep meaning here.  Obviously the rabbit creature *itself* isn't supposed to be scary- it makes you think because it's an unexplainable hallucination.  So people who are putting down the rabbit creature because it's not scary... well, imagine looking in the mirror and seeing something like that.  Yeah, it would definitely be alarming *then*.

Anyway, I really do like Donnie Darko.  There's a variety of characters each with their own assortment of problems and the storyline does a great job focusing and giving enough time to each one of them.  However, the ending... haha.  That ending is just not too good if you ask me.  Perhaps I wasn't looking for a simple explanation after all.",1294876800,,2421,4.955334987593052
1671334,5,B00005V3Z4,"While not a perfect movie (the acting is a bit thin and contrived in places, and the character behavior is not fully believable), it's faults are easily forgiven, especially seeing as it was filmed in 28 days on a tight budget. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece, with stunning visual effects and cinemetography!  The story is well thought out and intertwined/interwoven in a way that will make you think for days, even after the third time you have seen it.  Of course, the story is not fully ""Explained"", which is a big part of it's alure and enjoyment, however, if you prefer nice ""cut and dried"" stories with ""answers in the back of the book"" endings, this is not for you.

Might not be appropriate for younger children(under 15ish?) as the plot and story are mentally challenging and likely disturbing. I even read some pundit accuse this movie of possibly ""inspiring"" Jared Lee Loughner to kill 6 people in Arizona!  It's not THAT disturbing!  But is will help adults re-aquaint themselves with how it feels to be a teenager agian, feeling like you do not fit in, you do not belong, and the world is somehow ""not right""",1294790400,,1127,4.671717171717172
1671335,5,B00005V3Z4,"This has been one of my top ten favorites since the first time I saw it. When I hold a movie in high regard, I try to wait as long as possible between viewings so I can experience the story with the same awe - and often more - than the first time.

I'm not in any way knocking the fact that many people watch their favorites quite often. My husband and I are especially inclined to do that with comedies full of great one-liners that make us laugh by simply quoting something (Christpher Guest movies are a good example). But personally, I need to be in the right frame of mind - with very little distraction - when I watch an intense film that requires attention to detail.

It's been a little while since I last saw Donnie Darko, and I was very hesitant tonight to watch the director's cut because I didn't want to risk having the story spoiled somehow. I'm glad I decided to because it didn't change a thing for me. But I'm also very thankful that I've seen the original several times because it was a thrill to ""get it"" ... and even more so each time I watched it.

If the only version that had ever been released was the director's cut, I wouldn't have a different view about the film. No offense intended to anyone, but if you've watched both versions and are still at a total loss as to what happened, this movie is definitely not for you. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that!

If you're like me and you do not have every detail of the theatrical version burned to memory, the difference between it and the director's cut was not monumental and didn't change my perception in any way. Now I'm compelled to watch the original again so I can compare the two.

For those who haven't seen the film: the acting is superb, the story is very compelling, and it's probably not at all what you were expecting to see. Keep an open mind.",1294185600,12,1845,4.305475504322766

As for the fact that this one came with a collectable tin, plus I got the limited edition Hot Topic version, so I got a necklace with Frank the demented bunny as the pendant; that was just the cherry on top. I  highly recomend this version to anyone who isn't a theatrical version purist and likes to get a little bling with their Darko...",1286582400,2,760,4.205479452054795

1671339,5,B00005V3Z4,"The dark, seemingly evil rabbit in ""Donnie Darko"", the movie written and directed by Richard Kelly, may stick in viewers' minds as much as Bugs Bunny stuck in mine as a child.  And, at the end of your first viewing, you too may be asking ""what's up doc?""

Tom Keogh, who wrote the review of this film for Amazon, stated that this movie is unclassifiable.  I don't necessarily agree with that view.  Although it is part drama, part romance and part teen movie, it is primarily science fiction, with a sub-category of time travel.  Keogh goes on to add that ""Darko"" is stunningly original--with that I do agree.  Richard Kelly seems to be able to aptly create a David Lynch-like atmosphere that will keep the audience watching--and guessing--until the end.

Jake Gyllenhaal does an admirable job in the title role and is supported by an ensemble cast, including his sister Maggie, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell (and even Ashley Tisdale in a small role).  Jake is able to give ""Donnie Darko"" the needed dark off-centered, delusional, mind set that shows in his eyes in the distant haunted stare he conjurs up at just the right time during the story.

When it comes to eerie, mysterious science fiction flicks, you'll have a hard time finding another one nearly as good as ""Donnie Darko"".  If you haven't checked it out, now's the time.",1285459200,,1376,4.767932489451477
1671340,5,B00005V3Z4,"This film is hard to classify and I am still trying to digest and classify it 24 hours after seeing it. It is disturbing but not in any horror sense. Like the film ""The Fountain"" you must be patient and see it all the way through before you will really understand it - and maybe not even then at least at first. This is a sleeper in that you probably won't come to true clarity and understanding until after you have slept on it overnight. I guess the best way to sum it up, as much as it can be done, is to call it a psychological time traveller story, but that hardly does this film justice.

Originally I put off buying this as it sounded like a horror film with all that that possibly entails. I am not a horror fan, nor like gore. I am glad however I took a chance and bought this film and watched it. Unique doesn't even begin to describe this film. Rest assured the R rating is mainly for extremely strong language. There is no graphic violence or gore involved, nor any nudity or sex, whatsoever. The disturbing part comes from anticipation and not understanding what you are seeing here.

It is a profoundly unique well done story and no scene can be anticipated in advance as in many other Hollywood films.  It is not hard to understand now why this is such a cult classic!

The Blu-Ray Directors cut is very high quality, extremely crisp, and the sound excellent. The soundtrack is really good and I really like the ""Mad World"" song and have since bought the soundtrack separately just to have it and some other unique tracks as well.

If you are a fan of films like ""The Fountain"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", ""Dark City, ""12 Monkeys"". ""V for Vendetta"", ""Man from Earth"" and other similar type cult films this would be one to add to your film collection. Highly recommended!",1285459200,5,1806,4.395209580838324

But even given this frustration, there is so much that is good about this movie that a little bit of incomprehensibility can be forgiven.

Donnie Darko, the character, is, undoubtedly, a very special young man.  But he's also a troubled young man, and in this respect, he's actually *not* special.  The nature of his unhappiness with the world in general is probably what most adolescents go through.  Donnie's actions, however, are not ordinary in the least.

The question is, what is it that ultimately motivates Donnie?  Is he just schizophrenic, or is something deeper going on?  Is Donnie just a suburban hoodlum, or is he a hero, or is he a pawn?

It's a good story, extremely well acted, directed and shot.",1285113600,,796,4.837037037037037

This is chock full of special features, and a very insightful commentary with the Director Richard Kelly and the lead Jake Gyllenhaal.

-Great Plot
-Phenomenal cast

Jake Gyllenhaal tends to overact sometimes but overall, his performance as the title character is quite engaging. His sister Maggie Gyllenhaal also stars, she is such a powerful and intense actress. Even Patrick Swayze is a marvel, probably his finest performance of his short, amazing career.

Since ordering this DVD, which was (i think) my first purchase on amazon, I have bought all of my entertainment on amazon. By entertainment, I mean CDs, Movies, Books, etc. Amazon has everything, and I have saved soo much money already.

For one i'm not a fan of Jake Gylenhall at all, for another this movie makes no sense even in the world of a demented mind. Seeing visions, time travel, jet engines falling on your room for no reason, doing something because you take medication for your troubles and an evil guy in a scarey bunny mask tells you to? Ok. Well it seems the general premise of the movie was to be clever, just like a lot of bands, and tv shows try to be, or speak cleverly to prove its something unique. This movie is a joke within itself, it contradicts itself, by trying to be serious and again by trying to be darkly funny. Well neither work and the movie just falls flat and you end up fast forwarding through the last 40 minutes or so. Anyways movies like this just make me wonder how people can try and come up with ideas, and i think to myself wow i could come up with something ten times more clever.

In all honesty I prefer the original cut with the sequence of music in that version as opposed to the director's cut with the new sequence of music and the placement of songs that they could not afford to include in the initial release. That being said, the director's commentary assisted by Kevin Smith is pure gold and is the highlight of the DVD release. It reminds me of the comedic DVD commentary found on the Coen Bros movie, 'Blood Simple.'",1280793600,2,481,4.4772727272727275
1671349,5,B00005V3Z4,"I didn't see *Donnie Darko* in its theatrical release--matter of fact, I didn't even know it existed until I heard the song ""Mad World"" and found out it came from a movie. I was curious so I looked up the movie online, and what I read made me even more interested in seeing it. But I was concerned I might be bored because I knew the plot.

So I found it on TV one night and sat watching so spellbound I didn't even change my position on the couch. About an hour into the movie, my husband came upstairs and said, ""What are you watching?""

""Donnie Darko.""

""Oh. What's it about?""

I had to sit there for about 30 seconds, and then the only explanation I could give was a sigh from the deepest part of my chest. And even then, when the movie was done, all I wanted to do was stare at the black TV screen for about another hour.

So if you're worried about the surprises being ruined, rest assured it is impossible to write a spoiler for this film. Complex, layered, ambiguous, intense, and yes, dark, it is something you have to see to even begin to understand.

The reviews here cover most aspects of the film's possible meanings, so I'm only going to add my one take. Now I'm not one to find religious messages in everything, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say I did see a few parallels between Donnie's story and the Jesus story. First, when Donnie starts telling the truth, people really resent it. The results are sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but they all have one thing in common: Nobody wants to listen because they're afraid of what they'll hear.

Then you have Donnie's choice to accept his death. If he saves his own life, many other people's lives will be ruined; if he chooses to die, these people will be spared. And yet....Donnie dies and the motivational speaker is still mired in a horrid mess of a life; Donnie's family is devastated; and the gym teacher is still blinkering herself into a black/white paradigm. So did Donnie's death really serve any purpose? I won't give my answer to that question, because this is a film everyone must see and process for him- or herself. And this is why I would definitely recommend getting a DVD, because you need to watch it more than once to even start to sort it out.

Very rarely does a film this powerful and affecting come along. Do not miss it!",1280707200,2,2315,4.367441860465116
1671350,5,B00005V3Z4,"I watched the theatrical version of Donnie Darko multiple times. I loved it, and really enjoyed how it played with my mind. It was just one of those movies that I could watch over and over, and the humor never got old. It is a comedy, with sci-fi undertones, but it is also so much more. Everything in the movie clicked just right, and watching it is always a real joy. When I saw the directors cut, I immediately realized what I had been missing just watching the theatrical version, and I liked it even more. I think personally, you have to watch the theatrical release first, and really think about it, and then watch the Directors Cut and enjoy all the added explainations. The directors cut is a much more solid movie, and everythiing is more crisp, and clear. All of the questions I was left wondering about after watching the theatrical release were answered for me in the directors cut, and that was great. I hear complaints that it took the mystery out of the movie. Well, if Donnie Darko had been a mystery movie, that would suck, but it wasnt', it was a Dark Comedy. The directors cut didn't take any of the darkness, or the comedy out of the movie, it simply made it make more sense. I don't see how any true fan of Donnie Darko could not like seeing a fuller version of the movie they claim to like. The directors cut doesn't take anything away from the movie, it just adds to it. Everything that is added is done so with great care, and only enhances the original film. It made a really, really good movie into a great movie.",1280016000,2,1539,4.365853658536586

It added elements of the science fiction aspect of the story that were missing from the original.  Yes, in the original it was more ambiguous whether or not this was all happening in Donnie's head and the director's cut gives a more clear conclusion (that it was all really happening) but why is that a bad thing?  For those of us who were wondering we now have a more definitive answer; especially if you listen to the commentary banter between Richard Kelly (director) and Kevin Smith.

That was the real bonus from the director's cut DVD -- the conversational style of the DVD commentary made it the best I've ever heard.  The one thing that sucks about DVD commentaries is most directors will say stuff like this, ""Oh, this was an interesting scene because it was raining that day and it took us several takes to get it right.""  Who freaking cares???  I'd rather know the intent behind a scene especially in a film that it is to be interpreted -- like ""Donnie Darko"".  That's what you get from this DVD and that's why it's a must for Darko fans.

Overall, the added footage plus the Roberta Sparrow interpositions make the director's cut a more definitive science fiction classic; one that shouldn't be missed!",1277510400,2,1339,4.639830508474576

I got the movie for Christmas, and it's been sitting there, waiting for me to sit down and watch it. I kept thinking it was a slasher movie or something, and really didn't want to see a slasher movie, but because everyone kept saying I'd like it, including my son, I finally watched. It's not a slasher movie - chalk that up to really bad marketing years back when it came out. DONNIE DARKO is by far one of the best dark, strange, and brilliant films I've watched in a long, long time. And I don't use the word ""brilliant"" for movies lightly. OK, I can be pretty easy to please sometimes, but in this case - wow. Now, it might not be for everyone, it's a little surreal, definitely creepy, but the cast, especially (but not limited to) Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, is so strong, the writing and, hell, everything down to the music, it is an experience you should treat yourself to. Now, I strongly recommend getting the Director's Cut - it's 20 minutes longer but I can't imagine a minute of it being cut, and supposedly the special effects were ramped up - so if you end up missing the stunning visuals towards the end, then you're missing out. Won't get into the plot much, but I will suggest that to understand it, read carefully the pages of the book he finds (you'll know what I mean when you watch it), even pause the DVD enough to do this. They might make no sense, but it'll get your head ready for the ending.

Overall, for now, I appreciate schizo Donnie as the hero - giving his own life for the sake of others - in the end which is really the beginning and the end. Oh, and obviously the guy in the bunny costume, Frank, was really freaking freaky. I'm glad he eventually takes off the suit, though, because that would have given me nightmares if I hadn't known who or what was really inside it. Biggest surprise - seeing Patrick Swayze. I didn't know he was in this movie before I started watching. He was good, and it made me sad seeing him again. Still, I'm glad he's got another good film credit. Yes, I do think this was a good movie, even though I don't fully understand it all yet. I'm still intrigued by the time travel elements. I love time travel in movies and the way it messes with my mind. Oh, and favorite line so far - Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. This movie has some excellent weirdos.

Maggie Gyllenhaal played Jake Gyllenhaal's sister, and that was neat to see the real-life sibling actors acting together. This was Jake's first major film I believe (not sure), and he was excellent as dark, troubled, sleep-walking schizophrenic Donnie. Jake has continued to get better and better over the years, and, I have to add, hotter and hotter. I patiently await the day he's up for an Oscar.

At first, I was turned off by the inappropriate dinner table conversation and foul language at the beginning of the film, but it really displays the disfunctionality of the family, which is important to the plot. The mother especially comes across as cold. In fact, I cannot think of any wasteful moments in this movie that do not further the plot. Everything is relevant, which is very much a schizophrenic experience; this movie is a wonderful insider view of the schizophrenic mind. I could really relate to the main character, although most schizophrenics don't act on their thoughts by becoming violent. The twist ending is really satisfying.

This review however is about the Blu-Ray version.  In short, I'm not really sure it's worth the money to invest in the Blu-Ray.  In comparing the DVD image quality to the Blu-Ray, there is very little discernable improvement with the Blu-Ray, and that's the whole point in having a film on blu-ray.  So if you have the DVD, I'd just stick with that.  Besides, the DVD has excerpts from the Time Travel book, and that is not included in the Blu-Ray edition.",1270684800,11,649,4.478632478632479

Donnie Darko has a large legion of fans and I certainly understand its appeal. The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work. The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as our protagonist's father in what is almost always a throw away role in teenage dramas.

The school and kids remind me of my high school from the eighties, (Though this being Hollywood the music is much better than what the radio actually played in those years.) and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot. I was even able to look past the Holden Caulfield and Harvey flashbacks the movie caused me to suffer.

So what went wrong? Well the plot for starters. Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine. One wonders how the filmmakers are going to pull it off. The answer is simple.,they don't. If anything the end of the movie reminded me of that atrocious horror film from a few years back Soul Survivors. Like Soul Survivors Donnie Darko holds your interest with more and more implausible plot twists and coincidences then cheats at the end like a bad junior high school english essay.

1671375,2,B00005V3Z4,"Just a bit of math.  A blu-ray disc holds around 50 GB of data.  Movies that take advantage of the space are the ones that generally look better. This Donnie Darko Director's Cut puts both theatrical and Director's versions separately onto ONE disc, cutting the amount of space available for each in half. The result:  Neither cut looks better than a standard DVD. The image quality is soft to the point where film grain is barely even visible, and detail is poor, except in the occasional closeup.

I didn't actually watch the Directors cut until I bought this version recently, and didn't understand what the hub-bub was about.  The sound mixing in the DC is downright awful in places where changes have been made.  Most of the sound changes involve fading out the (excellent) score by Michael Andrews and putting loud sound effects in their place.  Extra material in scenes adds some slight character padding that portrays Donnie in a somewhat less sinister light, which the removal of some of the music seems to want to suggest, too.  There's nothing wrong with that, but a big part of the film's charm is the mood it evokes, and the score is a big part of it. Cutting it down just makes the tone of the film even harder to get a hold of, if that's possible...

The bonus disc contains a filmmakers journal, which will certainly interest film buffs, a documentary called 'they made do it too' about people who really liked the movie talking about how they liked the movie, and #1 fan: A Darkomentary (which I didn't watch).

The Philosophy of Time Travel book that was included in the original DVD is sadly not included here.

I'm a fan of the film, and even liked Kelly's Southland Tales (which was a good blu-ray, if not a great movie), but I can't recommend this release... it's just meh.

If they re-release the theatrical cut as a standalone with a better transfer, I'm down.",1268611200,8,1884,4.624624624624625
1671376,5,B00005V3Z4,"During the presidential election of 1988, a teenager named Donnie Darko sleepwalks out of his house one night, and sees a giant, demonic-looking rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. He returns home the next morning to find that a jet engine has crashed through his bedroom. As he tries to figure out why he survived and tries to deal with people in his town, like the school bully, his conservative health teacher, and a self-help guru, Frank continues to turn up in Donnie's mind, causing him to commit acts of vandalism and worse.  The performances in this movie are exquisite. The talent in this movie is top notch and Gyllenhall is just amazing. People will either love it, or despise it with all their heart. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who has a taste for dark humor and a desire to put the pieces of the puzzle together over and over, long after the movie has ended.

Targeting American suburbia, Kelly's film saturates audiences with its dark sense of humor and mind-blowing tale of time-travel and teenage behaviorism. Jake Gyllenhaal is given the title role, a trouble-minded high school student whose psychological state is being rattled by the commands of a destructive voice in his head--that of a 6-foot-tall prophesying rabbit named Frank, who alerts Donnie of the world's end, which is to come in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.

1671380,5,B00005V3Z4,"As most people do, I think this is a great movie.  I've seen it several times over the years, but decided to buy the blu ray version despite mostly bad reviews for the transfer.

As far as why the movie itself is so great, it's unique, there's a lot to figure out, and many of the theoretical physics type of topics such as time travel are interesting to a lot of people anyway.

The blu ray has both the theatrical release of the movie and the director's cut.  Each of them explain what's going on in different ways really.  The director's cut version explains a lot of things which the theatrical release leaves more open ended.  It explains by showing the pages from the time travel book on the screen between some of the scenes.  However, I personally like the ending of the theatrical version better.  A lot of ""helpful audio"" is present at the end of the theatrical version, but not there in the director's cut.

As far as it being on blu ray, I disagree with those saying not to buy it.  Most places sell it for close to $10, including here on Amazon.  The transfer seems BARELY better than the DVD version to me.  However if you don't already own BOTH versions of this movie on dvd, why not spend $10 to get to have both on one disc and compare them back and forth?  Then I still believe it has SLIGHTLY better picture quality also.

So if you own BOTH versions of the movie on dvd I guess skip it.  But otherwise it's easily worth the $10-$15.  The movie itself is one of my favorites of all time.

The director's cut mostly just adds in deleted scenes already on the original dvd abd then overlays those time travel book pages, but it also has different music, added audio, removed audio, a little more in way of deleted scenes, etc...  It's different enough to be interesting to anyone who loves the movie.  The music is better in certain places in the theatrical release though, so I still rate the theatrical as the better version.",1266192000,,1944,4.394957983193278

Why would you want to see a truncated, or shorter version ""vision"" when you can have it all. I like both versions but the longer cut always fills in more plot holes and or character development.

I don't know if I can say which is better, it's really up to personal preference. The director's cut is different in the sense that it adds in some scenes, slightly alters others, and changes/rearranges some of the music and scoring.

The theatrical cut is much more poetic. A lot of people say that it is better because it leaves so much interpretation as to what all happens to the viewer.

The Director's Cut helps explain more of what happens, and the supernatural aspect of it, and leaves less interpretation. It tends to put a lot of focus on the sci/fi side of it.

Most people tend to like the version better that they saw first. I would recommend the Theatrical Version, but really either is better. For any Donnie Darko fan, I'd say to have both. I really like the commentary on the Director's Cut, it helps get an insight into all the thoughts that went into the movies, the changes made in the director's cut, and the music. It is quite interesting to listen to.

Hope that might help your decision.

Visually, the DD blu-ray is no better then a DVD that is upconverted to 1080i, but for someone who doesn't have the original theatrical release and is looking to add to their blu-ray library, you can't go wrong with this. I will also note that it DOES contain the Director's cut so the converse is true.

When I first found out this movie was available on Blu-Ray I had to have it since it's one of my favorite movies. I already owned the DVD, and was happy with the quality of the video on my up-converting DVD player. I figured the Blu-Ray would have to look better since it advertised as HD 1080p. Unfortunately that was not the case; in fact the DVD looks better up-converted than the Blu-Ray does. How does that happen? It appears the studio did very little to prepare this film for Blu-Ray. If anything they made it worse by trying to doctor it up rather than spend the money to re-master it properly. The movie has a lot of dark scenes which are almost all grainy and not very detailed. The light scenes are not as noticeable but you can still see it unless you're sitting a good distance from your TV. I guess the point I'm trying to make would be to hang on to your DVD until they fix the Blu-Ray transfer. At the new price it's worth buying if you don't already have the DVD, but don't ""up grade"" to this from your DVD.",1259625600,194,1123,4.227906976744186

I'm not one to understand what Universe the film is in at any given moment, or try to decipher how time travel works. I can only fathom that the movie is smart, bratty, and for the most part brutally honest about high school life (or whatever Middlesex is), Jr. High etc...and the variety of students you would encounter.

Donnie is the independent one, who is smart enough to challange the norm, and stand up for what he believes...I think I understand why intelligent people are so angry and sometimes misunderstood, they see the world for what it is, they understand what is really going on around them, and they are really angry about it. Those of us who aren't intelligent to understand how we are being screwed, are just left in the dark, and it's up to Donnie Darko to save us all.

Very good film holds your attention, with some comedic moments, from whimsical to some off color comments that like I said are kids being kids, not always polite, and the music..the music makes this film all the more enjoyable. Good to hear some more alternative sounds, even the music choices are smart and are a major factor in the atmosphere of the movie.

Donnie Darko has a large legion of fans and I certainly understand its appeal. The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work. The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as the father in what is almost always a throw away role.

The school and kids remind me of my high school from the eighties (Though this being Hollywood the music is much better than what the radio actually played in those years.) and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot. I was even able to look past the Holden Caulfield and Harvey flashbacks the movie caused me to suffer.

So what went wrong' the plot. Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine. One wonders how the filmmakers are going to pull it off. The answer is simple. They don't. If anything the end of the movie reminded me of that atrocious horror film from a few years back Soul Survivors. Like Soul Survivors the movie holds your interest with more and more implausible plot twists and coincidences then cheats at the end like a bad junior high school English essay.

Richard Kelly's debut film aims for cult status at every level but fails to fly off the screen.

Writer: Richard Kelly
Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle

Donnie Darko has become a modern cult classic. It is Richard Kelly's masterpiece (at least from a screen writing perspective), and easily Jake Gyllenhaal's most famous role.
The movie follows troubled teenager Donnie Darko's experiences in the weeks after a jet engine falls from a phantom plane and crashes into his room while he is out for the night. He then begins to have some odd visions and out of body experiences. He starts experiencing the world, or rather the universe, in a very different way.
For me, this movie blends many different concepts into one bizarre, very visual, sometimes disturbing, and occasionally hilarious creation. It is a tale of existential philosophy and interdimensional time travel, full of paradoxes, and has some intense, deep meanings if you care to dig enough (and see it more than once).
With the major exeptions of Jena Malone's character and Gyllenhaal's masterful performance (only his second lead role, after 1999's October Sky), the acting and directing are nothing special. The set and costume design evoke something of a Stepford Wives or Edward Scissorhands visual vibe. They both compliment this idea of a very dark story taking place in a ""perfect"" suburban setting. However, the real reason to watch this movie is for the story and the evolution of Gyllenhaal's character into something metaphysically aware, and possibly posthuman.

It has many themes and ideas, from teenage angst, to first love, mental illness and theories of time travel. Some of the motifs come straight out of mythology, for example the old witch-like madwoman ho lives as a recluse turning out to be a scientific genius who authors the the book Donnie Darko uses as a guide through the "" tangent dimension"" he is in. The character of Frank dressed as a giant and mysterious rabbit, is no less than a version of the Pooka reminiscent of a 1940s film "" Harvey"" starring James Stewart, a mischievious spirit who takes the form of a giant rabbit. I could not begin to describe the science nor would I want to ruin things for a potential viewer by revealing the end. But I will say that the film is atmospheric, and frightening in places. It is also remorselessly sad with a genuinely tragic ending. Extemely well acted by the entire caste with great cameos by Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze.

1671413,5,B00005V3Z4,"One of my rules of thumb is that after running across three unrelated references to a film, book or TV show in the same week, it's time to see what all the fuss is about. Recently, several ""Donny Darko"" references drove me to pick up the film. And am I glad they did!

""Donny Darko"" is dark, hypnotic and stimulating. A young man, living in an affluent home, is obviously mentally ill. For reasons that are not clear, he leaves his home at  night and wakes to find himself sleeping on backs roads and golf courses. His parents seem concerned, but attribute his odd, though harmless, behavior to his condition. But soon, Donny Darko is hearing voices, and seeing a frightening, adult-sized metal-faced rabbit called Frank who tells him that the world will end within the month.

I'm not going to give up any more of the plot, except to say that it involves time travel, lost love and a chance at redemption.

Jake Gyllenhaal was born to play Donny. His dark features, sleepy expression and stiff movements perfectly capture the off-kilter inner world of his character. Mary McDonnell does knock-out work as Donny's mother, Rose. She has an incredible ability to portray two or more emotions simultaneously. The scene at the end of the film, in which she waves ambiguously and perhaps knowingly to another character, has had me thinking for days. Did she know? The real star of the movie, though is the music. Brooding, solemn and creepy, it gives the movie a thick, turgid and menacing aspect that perfectly complements the theme and acting.

I got a kick from the movie's social commentary. Though Donny seems mad, the world he inhabits is similarly irrational, often making crazy Donny the sanest one in the room. The film is set in a conservative Catholic school in 1988, more for reasons of mood than anti-religious ones. The health teacher worships a local self-help guru and forces the class to watch his amateurish self-help videos. Donny's dad has an irrational hatred of then-presidential contender Michael Dukakis. Donny's friends brag unconvincingly about their exploits and fantasies. Donny's madness seems driven as much by a reaction to the inanity and insanity of his straight-laced, ""normal"" classmates as by his brain chemistry.

Which makes it all the more ironic that he finds himself at the nexus of a cosmic tangle.

I'm not sure any linear narrative would do justice to the crazy plot of this film. There must be a logical disconnect somewhere. But for a terrifically well-crafted film that comes at you from everywhere and everywhen, ""Donny Darko"" is hard to beat.

1671416,5,B00005V3Z4,"I actually saw this version first and was moved by the enjoyable acting, dynamic characters, strict attention to detail, dark theme, and the cold yet controlled nature of Kelly's doomed split-off world.

Perhaps one of the best features of this film is its understated attitude toward Donnie's role (and the roles of all the characters for that matter) in restoring the damaged timeline to causal closure.  It's difficult to tell exactly where the story is going and what each event signifies until these roles are revealed, when the plot suddenly comes together and starts rolling, which was (for me) somewhat like a commoner piecing together an ancient prophecy.

I was very much surprised when I subsequently purchased this movie and found that a lot of important information had been cut!  (I didn't realize I had seen the director's cut initially, and had bought the theatrical release).  I actually said out loud ""how could anyone figure out what this movie is about?""  the excerpts from 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' and the references to Watership Down, the doomed family (pumpkin carving), and Donnie's sanity resolution had been totally removed.

Personally, I think the movie is almost wholly ambiguous in meaning without the majority of this removed information, especially the book excerpts.  While this is not a bad thing (the pacing is much better and the wonderful tone of the film is still in tact with the theatrical release) I definitely prefer this version because it's a true science fiction to me, whereas the theatrical version is more of a thriller/introspective.

Even if you don't get wrapped up in the mystery and go to any means necessary to decipher it, it still has a great atmosphere and is extremely well made.  Great performance, great script, great directing...  With that being said it's only an okay release.  The reason I'm saying this is because the special features are not in high def and the second disc is in fact simply the second disc from the Director's Cut release.  On the other hand this isn't a complete loss because you do get both versions on one disc so if you're someone like me who enjoys both films depending on their mood it works.  However, it's not a great transfer (although it's still better than the standard DVD release) which may matter to some. Once again, it works for me.",1243296000,5,803,4.503448275862069

It's not only about the death of a boy, but a statement about how wrong people are. Hypocracy, jealousy and redemption come to mind.

One of my top 20 movies of all time. Kelly's ""Southland Tales"" recieved a lot of flack, but still I enjoyed the chaos just as much. Only ""Donnie Darko"" had a much more coherent story that was easier to follow. I think it's a shame that there was a sequel (S. Darko) to this work of art. No one should touch it if it isn't broke. Hollywood can really suck... I may watch the sequel when I am bored one day, but I won't go out of my way because I just have a feeling it's not going to measure up to this classic.",1242691200,,999,4.1179487179487175

Don't get me wrong; this is a great film regardless of what cut you're watching, but I found myself watching the director's cut and wishing for...a little less.

The main difference I think, is the amount of explanation. The theatrical release is very ambiguous, very unapologetic, and very unexplained. I loved it. It forced you to draw your own conclusions, judgments, and explanations for the events of the film. The Director's Cut, probably in an attempt to answer all questions from fans and make sure that the message was not misconstrued, is very clear in its explanations and messages by comparison. And that, for me, kind of ruined the magic and mystery.

Again, this is a fine film, so if this is the only version you watch, you'll probably love it. But I would suggest watching both versions, and deciding for yourself.",1239494400,5,1000,4.8023255813953485
1671428,3,B00005V3Z4,"This film appears to be written and directed with the marketing strategy of appealing to mixed up and angry adolescents in that stage of life where they think the whole world is crazy, absurd, and working against them. It is a science fiction film yet we are given enough background to also think that maybe this is a film about a mentally ill or schizophrenic teenager. The lose ends of the film are eventually resolved, but in a way that appeals to the romantic aspect of adolescents that seeks some dramatic way to change the world.

We are shown a world of dysfunction around Donnie. His mother seems to think discipline is a bad thing and allows her son to curse her out and then sobs around the house in a depression thinking she failed as a mother. His father tries too hard to be a buddy to his son rather that be a strong father. His teachers range from the intellectual, to the weak, to the right wing fascist type. The school principal fires the one teacher that treats the students as intelligent and supports the most outlandish right wing teacher on the faculty. School bullies dominate the school and community. A crazy motivational speaker begins to dominate the community with an evangelical style self-help strategy. All of this Donnie seems to recognize as out of line and yet he also sees things that are definitely not real, and thus whereas he sees through hypocrisy with x-ray vision, he also is plagued with odd hallucinations of a demonic 6 foot sharp toothed rabbit.

Well where does this weirdness lead us? It finally leads to mysterious airplane engines falling from the sky and then to acts of sacrifice and heroism, again appealing to the romantic and idealistic instincts of American youth.

It is an odd film, neither outstanding nor terrible. The film uses the classic strategy for maintaining suspense, which is to withhold information from the audience. Eventually the viewer is given enough information to have the structure of the film come together and for there to be resolution of all the issues in the plot, or at least the major issues. I don't think many folks over 21 would find this film to rank high however.",1238630400,3,2154,4.708222811671088
1671429,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is my favorite movie of all time, no other movie could deliver the interesting characters, complex plot, or intriguing storyline as Donnie Darko does. Not only that, but the acting is superb, especially Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, he portrays a deeply disturbed character who has visions of the end of the world told to him by a six foot bunny rabbit named Frank. (Note that it really isn't a bunny rabbit, it's just a man in a freaky rabbit costume).
This movie has humor, romance, intrigue, mystery and ingenuity. I dare anyone who has not seen this movie to go out and rent it or buy it. Watch it at least twice (the first time may leave you completely confused), and try and say that you don't love this movie. I have yet to meet someone who said they don't like Donnie Darko.
The movie aside the UMD is incredibly well packaged, aside from the movie itself it also includes the theatrical trailer, complete audio commentary with the writer/director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, extended and deleted scenes with audio commentary for those that wish to hear it, and a Mad World music video. (By the way, a lot of people, myself included, got absolutely addicted to the song Mad World by Gary Jules. Richard Kelly could not have picked a better song to end the movie with.)
The picture quality is great (but then again what isn't off of the PSP's excellent LCD screen?) The only issue I have with the movie (and it's not really the movie itself, but the PSP's design) is that the movie is a little hard to hear sometimes, even with the volume turned all the way up. But like I said, it's not really the UMD, it's the speakers that come with the PSP, they're not exactly the best known to man. This is an easy fix though, as long as you have some headsets or some of the aftermarket speaker systems for the PSP you're good to go.
Overall great movie and great deal for the UMD. Highly recommended for fans of the movie (and anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet.) I mean, who wouldn't want to have the best movie ever made in your pocket?",1237507200,2,2056,4.456233421750663
1671430,4,B00005V3Z4,"A bizarre, stunningly original film that shows clear influence from writer Philip K. Dick and his surreal novels/short stories and film directors like David Lynch/David Cronenberg, ""Donnie Darko"" even sounds like a Phil Dick novel title. The plot concerns a giant rabbit in a bizarre twist of the film ""Harvey"" that tells teenage Donnie that his mission is to save the world and how he has the ability to manipulate space and time. A quirky mixture of cultural satire and science fiction, ""Donnie Darko"" may be an acquired taste but if you have a taste for the off-beat, then you'll love the film.

My focus here is on the Blu-ray presentation of the film and while it looks better than the two previous DVD releases of the film, the Blu-ray is not a huge leap up. I've been underwhelmed by many of Fox's recent Blu-ray catalog releases and this one isn't an exception. While images are a bit clearer here they still appear flat and the darker scenes aren't rendered with as much detail as one would expect from a Blu-ray.

The major advantage of this Blu-ray is that it features both the ""Director's Cut"" and original theatrical cuts of the film which feature some different songs and with the former running about 20 minutes longer with a more lucid, involving story than the latter. All of the extras have been ported over from the two DVDs in high def so that's good news for fans. If, however, you already have this on DVD in both versions I'd suggest waiting to buy this on Blu-ray since the image quality while better isn't a huge leap (unlike some other catalog titles). I suspect that this was rush released using older high definition transfers because of the direct-to-video sequel that Fox is releasing in March. Fox should have spend as much time on new, pristine high def transfers for this rather than rely on older elements because it clearly shows in the presentation here.

While this is a terrific film, I can't suggest taking the plunge if you already have the first two movies on DVD. While this looks slightly better than the previous version and features all the extras from BOTH the theatrical and ""Director's Cut"" of the movie, you might do well to spend your money on something that you don't already have on home video.

If you are in your late 20's to mid 30's (if you grew up in the 80's), you should appreciate much of the 80's themes and music.

1671434,5,B00005V3Z4,"Like a movie iPod, ""Donnie Darko"" cycles through several familiar tropes: there's the Rift in the Space Time Continuum, not in deep space or the future, but in the Seemingly Ordinary Town Where Nothing is As it Seems, also surreally exemplary of the Hypocrisy of American Suburbia. There we meet the Troubled, Misunderstood Loner who occupies both a Waking Dream and the Painful Gravitas of Adolescence, and walks the Tightrope Between Genius and Madness... you get the idea. There's not one, but two Deus Ex Machinas bookending the movie: the first a literal god-machine falling out of the sky (we even see it suspended from a crane, just like in one of Euripides' plays); the second an ""It Was all a Dream"" sequence. Each turn the chief clich&eacute; about deus ex machina... that it's an escape hatch for an unskilled storyteller who's run out of ideas... on its head by making it the basis of this bravely entropic, mesmerizing story instead of a clumsy copout.

These themes have been explored so many times, and so often badly, that the threat of clich&eacute; should be overwhelming and constant. But neither we nor Donnie are ever explicitly told this is a sci-fi movie. Since a parallel universe would look just like our own, how could he (or we) know? Everybody ""knows"" that an alternate universe is highly unstable and threatens to collapse the real one, but who can really say why? Such understanding is seemingly embedded in the hive mind of human DNA; it was probably there before such a story was ever told. ""Donnie Darko"" exploits these profound, resonant themes with a poignant touch. By setting the End of the World in 1988, the movie humanizes its futuristic plot with the elegiac, selective patina of memory.

We learn in the Director's Cut commentary that writer-director Richard Kelly began his script as a stream of consciousness and worked backwards. He tries to reach an internal circle of logic that he never quite figures out how to close, and we're all the richer for this slight failing. Kelly claims that each of the characters are subconsciously helping Donnie fulfill his mission, for instance... which he never adequately conveys on screen. But such ""shortcomings"" make ""Donnie Darko"" play like a classic rock album side, or a poem excerpted from a Thomas Pynchon novel. Even in this slightly more explicit Director's Cut, ""Donnie Darko"" re-casts that most plot-bound of genres, science fiction, as lyric.

Kelly's plot dumps any pat exposition of time travel's well-known logic in favor of broad, painterly strokes.  ""Donnie Darko's"" many moods... reverie, thriller, ghost story, drama, satire...  probably wouldn't flow with the same engrossing continuity had Kelly ever found a way to close those nagging gaps in plausibility. Each genre, instead of jarring the viewer out of the story, becomes a deeper fold in the maze of the minotaur's lair. Intentionally or accidentally, the film strikes the perfect balance between authenticity and mystique... with most of the former carried by Kelly's quirky, perfectly cast portrait (especially Jake Gyllenhaal) of a dynamic, intelligent and caring family who at once exemplify and transcend the typical foibles of the upper middle class.

The film's other anchor in plausibility is visual; its concrete geography (the wealthy American suburbs) and distinct, recently lived cultural history (the 1980's) are filmed with a documentarian's eye. It's a clever extension of the historical-fiction, the-personal-is-political conceit: a time-travel story about the fate of the universe that's uniquely timebound and never leaves the hero's neighborhood, keeping our attention on its characters' hearts and minds. Because the film never resorts to a facile description of its own logic (a sometimes annoying ""shortcoming"" of life itself), the well-worn clich&eacute;s of time travel are restored as a vessel (a portal, if you will) to ""Donnie Darko's"" deeply human, profound themes.

Only after Donnie fulfills his heroic mission do the lives he's saved get a fleeting, disembodied glimpse of his sacrifice. Even the audience isn't quite sure what Donnie's accomplished. We wake, with the whole town, from the film's dream logic to its final, tragic consequence. We only know, from Donnie's laughter and the peaceful (return to) sleep he faces his fate with, that his victory has brought him a happiness and comfort no earthly existence ever could.

""Donnie Darko"" isn't a puzzle you solve. Because we're never comforted with a solution, our empathy stays squarely with Donnie, as we join his struggle to understand man's place and purpose in a universe where Everyone Dies Alone. And because these, like the movie itself, are insoluble riddles, we watch again and again.",1234742400,5,4742,5.181462140992167

1671437,5,B00005V3Z4,"I wish I could understand in this day and age what exactly it is that makes a cult film. Quite possibly, it could be the following that film has and how rabid they are about the film itself. It's true that Donnie Darko has one of the most intense followings a film could ever ask for. The fans of this film has dissected it from the inside out, trying to explain each and every little facet of the film. Which is cool, if you're into having information spoonfed to you and not really interested in figuring it out for yourself.

However, I find that to be the most interesting and entertaining aspect of this film. Nothing is really explained in full, but it's not so vague that it's completely impossible to understand. Richard Kelly wrote a brilliant script, full of true emotion and at times horror, complete with science fiction elements so strange it will be hard to wrap your brain around them if you're not entirely into this kind of film. It certainly is not for the casual viewer.

But with the Director's Cut, we get a whole new look at the original Donnie Darko, with over twenty minutes of additional footage and a whole new soundtrack.

Before Bubble Boy and Brokeback Mountain, Jake Gyllenhaal established himself as an incredible actor with his portrayal of Donnie Darko. Indeed, it is the acting in this film that makes it so powerful. The interaction between the family, especially Jake and real-life-sister Maggie, and the dinner conversation between the two, makes you believe that these two really are siblings in the context of the film and doesn't feel like just two actors going at each other's throats. Maybe it was just the fact that they grew up together that made it so believable, but I tend to lean more towards the fact that the two were just great actors as it was, and used the influence from their lives together to craft a bond between the two characters. And of course, Jena Malone is fantastic, as she always is, as Gretchen Ross, Donnie's girlfriend and unfortunate victim in the whole scheme of things. But there isn't really a weak actor in this film, they all do excellent in their roles, and it all just seems completely believable.

The cinematography is also top notch. For a first time director, Richard Kelly really knows what he's doing and always manage to find the most beautiful and effective shots to emphasize what's going on in the scene. That's what's beautiful about this film- there isn't a shot that is just there to further the movie, every shot is there to increase the impact of what is going on in the story. Even in the simplest shots, there is something special about each one that I rarely see in films.

Also with this Director's Cut, Richard Kelly changed the score around, which was hit and miss. Most of the time it was a hit, but I miss hearing Echo and the Bunnymen playing during the opening scene. INXS's Never Tear Us Apart isn't bad, but I remember falling in love with The Killing Moon because of the original cut. Basically, that's my only gripe about the change in score, as everything else works perfectly.

If you haven't seen Donnie Darko and want a film that isn't a spoonfed 'here's what's going on' formula, do yourself a favor and see it. If you loved the original cut, chances are you'll love this one too. This is a film every should see at least one time, even if just to say you did.",1228608000,3,3370,4.56198347107438

1671441,5,B00005V3Z4,"-This review pertains to the Director's Cut edition of Donnie Darko-

WARNING: This review contains spoilers! DO NOT READ THIS UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!

In Richard Kelly's Director's Cut of his cult classic, Donnie Darko, we are given nearly twenty minutes of additional footage, which pulls us deeper into the tangent universe. In 2001, Donnie Darko was praised by critics and audiences during its exhibitions at film festivals, however during its theatrical release the film failed to grab the attention of the mainstream U.S. audience. It wasn't until British filmgoers hailed the film as being one of the most original movies of the decade that the film was given a second chance. Now with this 2-disc Director's Cut edition, we can explore the fractured world of Donnie Darko in greater detail. Though the theatrical cut has become a cult classic, the Director's Cut is an even more complete film. Now that Richard Kelly has established himself as a noteworthy director, he's able to reclaim creative control and reassemble the film to match his original vision (20th Century Fox executives ordered the film to be shortened and simplified after a disappointing showing at the Sundance Film Festival). In this new cut, the characters are given more attention, which is wonderful as each member of the cast gives an amazing performance. The story, which will still likely mesmerize most of its viewers, is clarified with the addition of new dialogue scenes.

The story is set in the year 1988, in Middlesex, Virginia. Here Donnie Darko, a troubled teenager, begins to have disturbing blackouts and hallucinations. During these episodes he loses track of time and often regains consciousness only to find himself in some strange place with no memory of how he got there. Donnie's home life is also stressful, as his emotional problems lead to conflicts with his family. One night, after a confrontation with his mother, Donnie is awakened by an eerie voice. It's the voice of a man in a rabbit suit, a man named Frank. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. After Donnie wakes up the next morning in the middle of the country club's golf course, he walks home to find out that a jet engine landed on his family's house, destroying his bedroom. When Donnie returns to school the following day, he is treated like a quasi-celebrity... and he meets the new girl in school, Gretchen. Donnie and Gretchen are immediately drawn to each other. On his ride home from school, Donnie's father almost hits Roberta Sparrow, a reclusive 101-year-old woman, who tells Donnie, ""Every living creature on Earth dies alone."" Donnie confides in his psychiatrist, Dr. Thurman, and tells her about his problems and anxieties.
Meanwhile, Frank tells Donnie to flood the school, which he does by taking an axe to the school's water main. When school is canceled Donnie walks Gretchen home from the bus stop and they develop a close relationship. Donnie is given support by Gretchen, but also by his bohemian teacher, Ms. Pomeroy and his science teacher, Dr. Monnitoff. However he also faces obstacles put in his way by Mrs. Farmer, the school's puritanical and patronizing gym teacher and by Jim Cunningham, a self-righteous and hypocritical self-help guru, who uses cheap New Age philosophy and pop-psychology to control people. Donnie rebels against these two negative influences when he makes an obscene comment to Mrs. Farmer and accuses Jim Cunningham of being the anti-Christ.
One day Donnie asks Dr. Monnitoff what he knows about time travel and Dr. Monnitoff gives Donnie a book that was written by none other than Roberta Sparrow. The book describes an anomaly in which one universe is split into two by a disruption in the space-time continuum. The tangent universe, or secondary universe, is made unstable and will collapse upon itself. This is only preventable if one can travel back in time and stop the tangent universe from being created. If the tangent universe cannot be unmade, if the timeline cannot be corrected then the tangent universe will collapse destroying both itself and the primary universe. Donnie tries to explain these discoveries to his psychiatrist, Dr. Thurman, but she sees no connections between Roberta Sparrow's book and Donnie's ""hallucinations"" of Frank. Dr. Thurman believes Donnie to be a paranoid-schizophrenic. Unsurprisingly, Donnie isn't convinced that that's the case. There are too many similarities, too many parallels between the chapters of the book and what Frank has been preparing him for. Donnie consults Dr. Monnitoff about the nature of time travel and how it would be possible, but when the discussion takes on theological overtones Dr. Monnitoff ends their talk.
One night Frank reveals his identity to Donnie, by taking off his rabbit mask. Frank is a young man, not much older than Donnie, and his right eye is missing. Frank tells Donnie that he must burn down Jim Cunningham's house. Donnie torches the house while the rest of the town is at a school talent show. There, Donnie's little sister, Samantha, is part of a dance team called Sparkle Motion. When Sparkle Motion is invited to appear on Star Search, Donnie's parents must accompany Samantha on a plane trip to California. While his parents are away Donnie throws a party for his older sister, Elizabeth, who's just been accepted to Harvard. Donnie and Gretchen leave the party prematurely and a series of incidents lead to Gretchen being killed when a car hits her. Donnie, using a gun he stole from his father's closet, shoots the driver in the face, in the eye. It was Frank. Early the nest morning Donnie watches as a black hole forms in the Earth's atmosphere, dissolving the Earth's gravitational pull, dramatically affecting the weather, and pulling apart the jet that his parents are on. Using the knowledge that Frank gave him, Donnie sends the jet's engine into a wormhole, back through time where it lands on the family's house, destroying his bedroom. By doing this he prevented the creation of the tangent universe, thus saving the world. But because there was no longer the threat of absolute destruction, Frank never died at Donnie's hands; his death was effectively reversed, so his ghost never went back in time to warn Donnie that night that he went sleepwalking. Donnie was in his bed, laughing at the realization of what he'd done, when the jet engine crashed through the ceiling, landing on him. He sacrifices himself to save Gretchen, his family, and the world.

Donnie Darko may very well be one of the most complex, thought-provoking debuts for a filmmaker. Not only does Richard Kelly direct, but he also wrote the meticulous screenplay, which utilizes a knowledge of quantum physics, psychology, mythological archetypes, religious concepts, and modern moral and family issues. The film's multi-layered characters are portrayed by a talented ensemble cast including Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie Darko, Holmes Osborne as Mr. Darko, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Elizabeth Darko, Daveigh Chase as Samantha Darko, Mary McDonnell as Mrs. Darko, James Duval as Frank, Patrick Swayze as Jim Cunningham, Beth Grant as Mrs. Farmer, Jena Malone as Gretchen, Noah Wyle as Dr. Monnitoff, Drew Barrymore as Ms. Pomeroy, and Katharine Ross as Dr. Thurman.

The 2-disc Director's Cut DVD includes an audio commentary with Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith, Production Diary documentary, They Made Me Do It Too- The Cult of Donnie Darko featurette, Storyboard-to-Screen featurette, #1 Fan: A Darkomentary featurette, and the Director's Cut trailer.

1671442,3,B00005V3Z4,"Film student here.  This is a good example of a modern expressionist film.  In other words, the filmmaker made it for himself, not for an audience.  And of the few people who are receptive to it, no two understandings of it are the same and certainly not the same as the filmmaker's since this is basically a look inside his own mind.  Anyone who thinks they understand this film only understands it for themselves.  I think this movie is interesting for it's bizarre way of provoking philosophical and supernatual wonder, however, do not mistake that and the plot complexity for cleverness.  This is not a 'clever' film; it's just one particular filmmaker's canvas strokes which, on the surface, is somewhat random.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)  A clever film would be one that has an overall conceptual or narrative hook that keeps all spectators on the same page.  (Remember, moviemaking was invented as a communal spectator medium; not a home video stoner gathering on a basement couch with friends.)  A film doesn't have to tell a coherent story or even have a story; it just has to be engaging in some way.  This movie it worth a shot if you haven't seen it, but I suggest starting with the theatrical version.

Also, the Blu-ray transfer is very unimpressive as far as picture.",1227052800,2,1301,4.758928571428571
1671443,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko. What a ride, what a character. In fact, I think this kid just had to be my personal hero!
I haved loved this movie for years, and not just loved it. It is like a beautiful, intelligent woman, where you love every part of it, in every way. It is a flawless creation.
The characters are incredible. Donnie is a broodig teenager that any can relate to. He just happens to be visited by the future and traverse space and time. His parents are completely realistic recreations of sad, worried, yet oddly hopeful elders. And his teachers, Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and one crazy lady who loves Patrick Swayze, are all tremendously entertaining figures, in every way.
Many people at the beginning roll their eyes at such a perceivedly dark piece of work, But by the end, they are enlightened, laughing, scared, and astonishingly overjoyed. This movie has a toll on the senses unlike any other. And the hip 80's soundtrack will make any viewer fill with uneasy glee.
There is no need to describe the plot. No one can. It must be deciphered through multiple viewings, and even then, the viewer is left up to their own interpretation. It is an admirable mind-twister, and you will spend many nights awake arguing with yourself over the meaning of the film.
I loved the film. it perfectly blends dark comedy, horror, drama, intution, curiosity, and virtuosity into one complex, compelling mastercraft. And the fact that it is independent with a rookie director only heightens the sense of accomplishment felt here.",1224374400,,1518,4.819923371647509
1671444,5,B00005V3Z4,"After several viewings and much thought, all I can say about this movie, in seven words or less is, ""My God, what a totally fantastic flick!""  A film, which I only finally saw (but had heard about, many years after it hit theaters and later DVD and cable).  I really cannot say how great this film is, but I'll try.  Note however, that on Amazon's rating scale from 1 star to 5, if I could, I'd give this SIX stars, but am limited to five.  For this is a work which rises above the five star Amazon rating level for me, and few films have ever done that actually.  Overall, despite some minor stumbles along the way, and many, confusing non-linear moments which occur throughout, I can seriously say this is certainly one of the most unique, touching, and mind-expanding movie efforts I've seen in a long, long time. It entered my top 20-50 films of all time quickly at the very least, when I first experienced it, and continues to move up, upon repeated screenings and reflections.  That's saying a lot because my list of such top films of all times includes dozens of great films, too many to name here.

This is a small and independent but yet, GREAT movie, and is a must-buy for those with the funds and who loved/love this right off the bat as much as I did/do, because more viewings not only add to one's understanding and appreciation of it all, but will over time, as it has for me, simply add to one's thinking about it all deeply afterwards and lead to finding new meanings in various scenes and ideas/insights.  Basically. ""Donnie Darko,"" if you see it and you enjoy it upon initially watching it and re-watching it as I did (and still do), is a strange, wonderful enigma of a film, which you will come back to, for further and deeper appreciation.  With the rather obtuse at times, and certainly non-progressive temporal structure however, repeated viewings and closer attention, almost seems essential for a full appreciation of this masterpiece.  Along with so many various interpretations from viewers, if you collect DVD's, and fell in love with this film early on, as I did originally and much later on, this is really a movie you'll want to come back to and watch again, many times.  While my review does not distinguish between released DVD versions, I can only concentrate on the basic product, which in its original film, is really something special.

It's hard to know where to begin to describe this absolutely amazing movie/film, which I found so surprisingly fascinating and unforgettable and great, when I first saw it, and since have, upon repeated viewings.  As a general rule, I have never written short Amazon reviews, since my main deal here has been to try to impart upon readers, more in depth thoughts on all things entertainment-wise.  I could just say, ""this is a little-known, but important, cult-ish example of what Hollywood/Independent cinema can be, and mandatory viewing for any real, thought-stimulating movie fan,"" or ""it is a complete and enlightening surprise from beginning to end,"" but I will instead just give my totally personal opinion (with a lot more words) that this is a film which everyone should see at least once.  Whether afterwards, they get the same mental digestive overdrive reactions I did when I first saw it and which has been validated by seeing it again and again, is unknown to me.  Because I loved this movie the very first time I saw it, and watching it again has only reinforced that opinion.  I would hope to believe others have experienced this gem as much as I did originally, and have found enjoyment from repeated viewings.

While this film is, indeed, very non-linear. which is usually a quality which more often than not, has turned me off to so many other such movies besides notable exceptions like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Go,"" and ""11:14."" ""Donnie Darko"" is very deliberate in its intent and purpose, and its oftentimes ambiguous nature, is just one of its many charms.  If you first see it, and like/love it, you'll eventually refer others to it, if for no other reason, than for that of trying to search for other's explanations as to what it's all about, from others besides yourself.  However, if one first experiences this little jewel of a film and doesn't quite understand/appreciate it, I would advise one to simply devote the time if possible to watch it again, and again.  In time, I would trust that it will all eventually become clear, what this enigma of an independent, but Hollywood release, really means.  While some unnecessarily may want to over-interpret this, or dismiss it entirely from a possible feeling of just being too lazy to simply THINK, to me, ""Donnie Darko"" is simply amazing.  Whether watched initially, repeatedly, and/or thought about later.

I came to eventually see this film long after its original release and subsequent impact, as I have so many other great movies, but in the new century,  That does not diminish its importance and meaning to me as a truly great cinematic effort in the long run, and this new century film holds up very well, with anything from the last few decades.  It is a one of a kind, at the very least, and I only wish more modern-day films came to equal this cinematic excellence.

I could go on to list the many stars and their fine performances, including Jake Gyllenhaal (our teen-aged hero which this middle-aged man can still truly identify with), his sister in real life and in this movie, ""Maggie Gyllenhaal,"" Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, and Jena Malone among others, but let it be said, this is a great cast.  And their characters all perform key roles in the overall whole.

""Donnie Darko"" is one of the best films I've seen this century.  It is strange, open for debate as to meaning, but entertaining and compelling throughout.  The film style is original and effective, the soundtrack and appropriate ""songs"" right-on, and the whole film, while dealing with some rather disturbing and/or depressing subjects, is a winner from frame one to the last frame.  If you have never seen this, by all means, do.  If you have, a lot of what I've hinted about without spoilers, should touch base.

An unforgettable experience, I watched this in amazement the first time, and have since, upon every repeated viewing.  One of a kind, tight, and almost perfectly presented from beginning to end, along with a near perfect cast, directorial style, and musical background, ""Donnie Darko"" is truly a must-see experience.  What it all really ""means"" in the end, is up to the viewer, which makes it forever more a total and timeless winner.",1223596800,2,6593,4.76274165202109

You can really take this movie 2 ways, not getting it at all, or totally loving it. I was somewhere in the middle. It was both funny, and chilling at the same time. It reminds me of a movie I saw a long time ago, called: Jacob's Ladder. Without spoiling the end of the flick for those who haven't seen it, I do encourage you to check it out. I saw someone's earlier review stating it was kind of like a Napolian Dynamite Nightmare, in that, it's again, kind of like, you either get it, or you don't. I can see alot of people coming off of this movie with a question mark....but, I totally get the end, it was fantastic. I saw it on cable, one of the reviews said they has watched the commentary a second time around, and connecting the dots was very well put. I can very much see how this flick has and will become a cult classic. Check it out!  ;)",1222905600,3,944,4.075268817204301

This combination sci-fi/moody teen/drama-comedy/time paradox leaves you haunted, for all the questions left unanswered. The plot is indescribably complicated. You can't tell whether Donnie is hallucinating the giant evil bunny (a la Harvey) that tells him the world is going to end in 28 days, or whether you have joined him in a bizarre parallel world, where all the laws of science and the universe are warped, while others are living normal lives all around you. Is he seeing the future? Reliving his past? Or is it an alternative reality or a reversal of fate? Entwined within the plot are cutting condemnations of Society in the fat girl, the pyromaniac, stuck-up teachers, unyielding parents, snotty neighbors and self-help gurus. It all culminates in a fateful Halloween party. Unforgettable scores of '80s hits includes the theme, ""Mad World."" The cast includes executive producer Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze.

1671448,4,B00005V3Z4,"-This review was written in conjunction with the standard edition of the DVD, not the 2-disc Director's Cut-

2001 was a year full of outstanding films, but one film stood out from all of the others for its sheer inventiveness, its brilliant vision, and its director's ambition. No, I'm not talking about The Lord of the Rings (although, my previous statement could easily be applied to that film as well). Richard Kelly's feature debut film as a director, Donnie Darko, is a fascinating science fiction drama. The film looks at the life of a troubled `80s teen named Donnie Darko, who suffers from blackouts, sleepwalking, and bizarre hallucinations. The film features an awesome&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/soundtrack/dp/B0002XMF2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">soundtrack</a>&nbsp;(which is unfortunately unavailable on Amazon.com) and some nifty camerawork and visual effects. Since its initial release, Donnie Darko has developed a loyal fanbase across the globe, especially in the U.K. where the film first achieved its cult classic status.

The story tells us of an emotionally troubled teenager, Donnie Darko, who begins having hallucinations (or are they) of a man in a rabbit costume. The man refers to himself as simply Frank, and he warns Donnie that the world will end in 28 days. Meanwhile, Donnie's family struggles with his peculiar behavior and his general disregard for their feelings. After meeting a new girl at school named Gretchen, Donnie seems to find new purpose in life, but his blackouts become more severe. During these episodes he vandalizes the school and even burns down his neighbor's house. Soon Donnie discovers that he and everyone around him are being manipulated by a mysterious force, the Deus ex Machina (roughly translated this means God of the Machine). If Frank's prediction is right and the world were truly to end, the sky to open up, and the universe torn apart, could anyone or anything stop it? This is the ultimate challenge of Donnie Darko. Can he save the world from oblivion?

The film features an all-star cast including Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Beth Grant, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne, Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze, and Noah Wyle. The film's director, Richard Kelly, proves himself to be one of the most extraordinary up and coming filmmakers.

1671449,5,B00005V3Z4,"This review is for the regular version, NOT the Director's Cut.

I love this movie, even though I don't get it worth a squirrel's nuts.  I read this whole recap of the plot, bit by bit, at Salon.com, and I was TOTALLY wrong about what I thought was happening in the film (I'll spare you the details; this is a movie you cannot spoil for people) and yet I STILL LOVE IT.

Jake Gyllenhaal is just awesome. He plays Donnie SUPERBLY.  Every single person in this movie is PERFECTLY casted, from Donnie's parents, sister, and therapist, to that awful awful woman who insists that Graham Greene was on Bonanza. And Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Patrick Swayze are ingenious background players. Jena Malone is great, Frank-the-Bunny is great, Roberta Sparrow, even that chunky Asian chick who says ""Chut up."" EXCELLENT EXCELLENT casting is my point.

Also, this is one of those movies that you don't have to really ""get"" 100%.  I certainly didn't. And I watch regularly. It proverbially lives in my DVD player so I can just push play whenever the heck I feel like it. (Okay so sometimes I switch it with Fight Club but that's besides the point).  Here's the deal:

 - the movie is based primarily in the notion of time travel. It's science-fiction disguised as not-science-fiction, which makes sense because it's both and neither.

 - it's one of those ""makes a big statement about humanity"" movies. I like that. Some people don't.

 - don't expect the ending to wrap everything up. In fact, it'll probably just confuse you further.

 - you NEED to watch the ENTIRE movie before you cast judgement, at least in my opinion.

 - if you don't like to think, ponder, be confused, question, rewind, ask people what the heck is going on, and genuinely say ""huh"" then this movie's not for you. Call me dumb but I've seen this film at least fifty times since I own the DVD and I still can't crack the code of the website.

The whole movie is excellent from the storyline to the casting, but it's a mystery wrapped in an enigma shrouded in shadow.  If you don't like that, watch something else.",1220745600,4,2079,4.600543478260869

The viewer is thrown into the world of a bi-polar, highly intelligent young man, Donnie Darko, who is sleepwalking his way toward disaster. There is a strange way to prevent all the tragedy and the 'way' is exposed after Donnie's near death experience awakens him to the possibility of portals and time travel. Will he go back through the portal to save lives, even though it may bring an end to his own life? I love tales that 'bend the brain', and this one sure works on the ole noodle.

1671453,4,B00005V3Z4,"The Good Things
*Very interesting filming style.  Lots of vivid, memorable imagery.  Good special effects that don't overwhelm the film.
*Rather interesting story (although it's very weird and hard to figure out; at the very least, everything came into full circle though).
*Interpreting the story is only half of the fun.  There are also many thought-provoking elements regarding theology, the nature of humanity, the nature of youth, and the nature of space and time.
*Characters are good; acting was great.  I could almost relate to the title character, as he tried to stand up against so many self-righteous adults.
*Frank is probably the freakiest bunny rabbit I've ever seen.
*Good music.

The Bad Things
*Good luck trying to figure it out! Aside from being strange, it's also quite complex.

Definately the strangest high-school film I know of, but also probably the most thought-provoking.  It's definately more than a story about a schizophrenic kid; there are many different elements, both visual and in the content, that are crammed into the film.  At the very least, it will leave you trying to figure out the plot.  Then, perhaps you'll be thinking about the characters or the themes.  It's definately food for thought.

The DVD has good video and sound quality.  The two-disc special edition includes a fifty-minute production diary, about forty minutes of fan cult featurettes, some storyboard comparisons, and the trailer.",1216339200,7,1438,5.2043478260869565

But in even that future bad things happen. I suppose this is just a slice of everyday life with an alien that looks like a big rabbit given evil shots. I enjoyed the movie but it is by no means entertaining. When a young man has no future even in a dimension where he survives a jet engine hitting his room, but his girlfriend is ran over and killed, I think you get the point. Although this has a cult following it does have limited watchability by the general public. Most everyone will be glad they saw it as the acting and directing are excellent. The movie's story on the other had is a little strange and may not suit all tastes. We see a few days in the life of a teenager struggling with typical problems but hanging over his head like Damocles sword is his life, the life of a girl he loves, and the life of another man that kills someone by accident.

The episode is called ""Ring-a-Ding Girl"" and is, in essence, the entire story of ""Donnie Darko"" told under half-an-hour, in a much more touching manner.

1671468,5,B00005V3Z4,"Richard Kelly's quirky ""Donnie Darko"" was an audience-pleaser at Sundance then a bomb at the box office in 2001 before becoming a cult hit on DVD. It isn't clear what kind of film it's trying to be, which is part of the problem and part of the attraction. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high school student whose life is disrupted by sleepwalking and hallucinations of someone named Frank wearing a grotesque bunny suit. On October 2, 1988, the bunny tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 6 seconds. That would be on Halloween. It's assumed that Donnie is mentally ill. He doesn't know himself. Between the bunny's commands and other bizarre incidents, Donnie begins to think it all has something to do with time travel, which will come to an abrupt end on October 31.

Donnie is a thoughtful young man with a problem of unclear dimensions. He's trying his best to figure it all out, so the audience roots for him. Richard Kelly places ""Donnie Darko"" in the science fiction genre. But it's also satire, family dramedy, teen romance, and a period film of the 1980s. This works, because different themes are compartmentalized, and when they intersect, they do so naturally. The satire involving a gym teacher (Beth Grant) who idolizes a puritanical motivational speaker (Patrick Swayze) is over-the-top. The family dynamic is sincere and good-natured. Mary McDonnell is particularly touching as Donnie's mother, who feels her son's pain and reacts with respect and kindness. But there is a nagging feeling that things in Middlesex, Virginia are somehow out of whack.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2003): On the standard disc, NOT the director's cut, the bonus features are a theatrical trailer and 5 TV spots, selected filmographies of 11 cast and 9 crew members, 20 deleted or extended scenes with optional commentary, ""Mad World"" music video performed by Gary Jules (3 min), a web site gallery that features documents that fill out the past and future of some characters, liner notes for the soundtrack, ""Cunning Visions"" infomercials (6 min) with optional commentary by the company's fictional CEO and director, Cunningham's full ""His Name is Frank"" presentation, Cunningham's book covers, an Art Gallery with nearly 50 production stills and 27 pieces of concept art from the film, and 12 pages of ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" by Roberta Sparrow.

There are also 2 audio commentaries. The first is by writer/director Richard Kelly and actor Jake Gyllenhaal. This includes their recollections of filming, discussion of themes and characters, Gyllenhaal's thoughts about Donnie, discussion of the film's mysteries, and what the director hoped to reveal as the film progressed. The second audio commentary is by 8 (I think) members of the cast and Richard Kelly. They are a friendly bunch, conversing with the director and each other about the film, commenting on the scenes. Kelly does offer some different ideas in this commentary than in the first, so it's not a repeat. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.

The soundtrack is just the way the director had originally intended, and they also had more time to work with the special effects.
And well, yes, the original movie is far more ""open"" to interpretation, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. As for me, I liked to know what the director's idea for what was behind the events that happened in the movie was.

STORY: Donnie is a troubled young man who doesn't get along well with the family. One night, he escapes death after an airplane engine crashes in his bedroom. The being because he follows a giant bunny named Frank, a bunny who tells him that the world is gonna end. This leads him to commiting a series of crimes before it ends.

THOUGHTS: Cool! You might not wanna watch it when you're depressed, there are a lot of depressing scenes in this movie. Yet the last 20 minutes are a series of nail-biters that will not fail to amaze you. And the ending? Good use of the song ""Mad World""!

1671474,5,B00005V3Z4,"Your ""helpful"" votes are greatly appreciated. Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie. I've just noted the general theme.

Don't be put off by the title ""Donnie Darko."" This weird time-travel movie, involving other dimensions, is great. There's a witch in it, but it's hard to describe, so as an older guy who often doesn't care for teenage movies, I'll just give it two thumbs up. I was surprised that I liked it so much.

When so many movies are the same, it's nice to find something original, and I hope to see more such efforts.

Here are some other cult movies that I would highly recommend.

1. ""Blue Velvet"" (a weird murder mystery set in recent times).

1671480,5,B00005V3Z4,"I know there may be lots of interpretations about this film, but to me there is a huge depth hidden beneath the surface, like an iceberg, that finally strikes your mind. So don't make the mistake of trying to get a trivial meaning from a simple glance, neither a conventional meaning. This film can be called everything except conventional or trivial.
One has to watch the film to the very end to understand its sense, to face as well that the end is completely open to interpretation, which is a curious paradox. However, every moment, every fact, every character, turns out to have a purpose. You even understand why Grandma Death is always expecting the mail and why she whispers that awful truth to Donnie.
I agree with some people who said that the film gets too over-analysed. I don't think that a too rational comprehension is needed at all, but an intuitive comprehension. Otherwise, you can get lost in a labyrinth of interpretations.
The search for God, the meaning of life, the meaning of freedom as the ability to choose, the purpose of suffering, the difference between reality and fiction, the complexity and darkness of the mind, redemption by love (in the final act, when Donnie is about to complete the circle), the utter loneliness of human beings, the role of chance or fate in our lives and the inability to remove the veil of God's designs, which must ever remain mysterious and inscrutable, are some topics that I've extracted from the film.
Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie is superb, so are the rest of the casting, perfect in their roles. Plus the music is excellent.

He doesn't fit in with the rest of his schoolmates so he has a friend that only he can see,a man size talking bunny rabbit named Frank. As of lately Donnie has been sleep walking and waking up in places other than his home,this proves to be a good thing when a plane engine lands on the Darko household and crushes Donnies bed. Donnie wakes up one morning on a golf course and he quickly runs home to find the plane engine that should have killed him,he thinks back to the reason he was on the golf course to begin with and knows it was Frank that saved him. From that day forward Donnie Obeys his ""Imaginary"" friend Frank and it starts to get him into trouble. Frank tells Donnie when the world is going to end and it turns out it's going to be soon. Donnie doesn't quite understand why this is going to happen but he knows that plane engine should have killed him and he is going to live life to the fullest until the end comes. As time passes Donnie gets a girlfriend,stands up to his uptight teacher and follows the will of his big bunny buddy Frank. The things Frank makes Donnie do are a bit destructive but there may be some kind of master plan at work that Donnie is unaware of.

1671484,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is the movie that everyone should watch, but yet should just leave it alone.

Donnie Darko is magnificently philosophical and beautiful. The concepts and themes in the movie are explored excellently, although in the middle of the book one might find there to be too many such themes.

The wonderful thing about Donnie Darko is that it'll haunt you. The ending is not particularly explosive, or particularly violent, compared to action flicks such as Die Hard, but once the movie ends, you'll find yourself constantly reexploring the movie, finding plot points and character developments.

The direction of Richard Kelly is particularly fantastic. The way he makes each scene connect with the viewer and symbolizes so many of the characters is fascinating... One might assume him to be a seasoned director, but he is really young, and his gifts and talents are not to be taking for granted.

Donnie Darko, however haunting, makes you want to just cuddle up in a corner as well, wishing you had never watched the movie for the great amount of depressing characteristic it presents. Donnie Darko is the cult classic that is beatifully dark and tranquilizing... you'll never be the same once you watch it.",1186617600,,1214,4.9950495049504955

1671486,5,B00005V3Z4,"I'm not sure why some people are saying the Director's Cut is not worth getting, or watching. I've watched both and I believe the Director's cut is superior. How can it not be if it is what the director wanted? Not only is the insertion of the songs the way they were originally intended important (and one of the things I love about Donnie Darko is its attention to details), you also have the title pages (from The Philosophy of Time Travel) displayed in the Directors Cut. In addition there are key lines (such as Donnie's therapist's telling him he is an agnostic) and visuals(particulary toward the end in the montage) that can totally change the perception of the film.

 I picked up a copy of Clockwork Orange recently and was suprised to learn that Burgess's original text released everywhere else (besides the United States) had 21 chapters. In a brilliant intro to the re-released Clockwork Orange, Burgess states that each work created has a duration and a reason for its particular order and that editing it alters the perception of it (he states this edited version in the U.S. also effected Stanley Kubrick's retelling in the film version). In short,the story should be available the way the author,filmaker, or artist intended it to be told or you alter the meaning. In relation to Donnie Darko, placement and pacing are crucial to the interpretation of this film, to alter it is to alter what the director/writer was attempting to convey.

1671488,4,B00005V3Z4,"It is hard to describe the plot of 'Donnie Darko' without making the movie seem repellant.  'Donnie Darko' is purposely ambivalent, and the causality of bizarre events is intriguing from the very start.  The journal development is a retro trip in itself.  Using footage of the Dukakis and Bush (I) debates before the 1988 election, the movie authenticates its setting of a high school near the end of the eighties.  How they manage to mix nostalgia with an eerie tale and dark manifestations is a mystery, but they pull it off.  Uniquely enigmatic with the memories they elicit, the movie has the effect of being a 'Twilight Zone' manifestation of 'Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.' (Aptly, the soundtrack draws from ""Tears for Fears"" instead of ""Bow Wow Wow"".)

Now about the story.  Our titled tortured protagonist (Jake Gyllenhaal in another talented role) is undergoing psychiatric care complete with medication.  The first hint we have that things aren't going well is when an ominous voice summons Donnie out of bed to meet him somewhere in the dark.  What we discover there on a golf green is a six-foot rabbit, who, if his processed voice weren't so menacing, could only be dismissed with chuckles.  (One can only describe the creature as a rabid or demonic 'Harvey'.)  And, indeed, our best evidence of a demonic presence  is when Donnie asks him later, ""Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?""  To which the voice quickly replies, ""Why are you wearing that stupid human suit?"")  Here he announces to the disturbed adolescent that the world is going to end in approximately a month--Halloween 1988--to be exact.  After that we get varying degrees of maladjustment with some foreboding events.  Upon his return home he discovers he narrowly escaped death when an airplane part fell through his bedroom, leveling much of the house.  A grateful Donnie will do anything for ""Frank,"" who saved him from the debacle.  From there a series of inexplicable events take place that leave one glued to the screen with magnetic interest.

'Donnie Darko' is a mysterious and disturbing alternative movie.  Some of the draw comes with the acting.  Keeping it real is no short order.  The scenes of hypnosis are mesmerizing with Dr. Therman (played with expert delicacy by Katherine Ross) who tries to uncover Donnie's pathology.  But it isn't that easy.  In the meanwhile, Donnie, himself, seeks a teacher at his private school and an elderly woman down the road who has written a book about time travel.  Dabbling with penetrating thoughts about predestination and the occult, Donnie's predicament is fascinating.  Drew Barrymore, whose mere presence could singularly bring flashbacks of the eighties, is the producer and plays lively English teacher, Karen Pomeroy, a character who provides a pivotal place for social commentary.  (Besides a mysterious mood piece, some satire is accessible.)  On the staff is stalwart moral zealot, Mrs. Farmer, who is almost painted in clown white during her ignorant tirades.  There's also preacher-like motivational speaker, Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze who makes his character creepy enough) who has a few skeletons in his own closet.

'Donnie Darko' deserves accolades for being so original.  With effective performances that include the delicious novelty of having Donnie's sister played by real-life sister Maggie Gyllenhaal, the elements speak for themselves.  Nevertheless, the overall effect is not as satisying as the creativity, and the story leaves some gaping holes that, while like real life, are unsettling nonetheless.  'Donnie Darko' will fill a black hole for teenagers who will relate to some of Donnie's difficulties that beg for meaning.

And about that rabbit reference, anyone who's seen or even heard of ""Darko"" knows that there's a rather odd-looking, man size rabbit-like character named ""Frank"" appearing in this film. While he's definitely no Bugs Bunny, he does set some looney toons type moments in motion.

Example? At Frank's behest, Donnie floods his school and buries an axe in the head on the school mascot statute. It's funny too see at first, but after a moment you also realize it's pretty creepy.

But despite Donnie's tendency to turn a little destructive when Frank talks to him, this movie isn't about a tennager going off the deep end and turning into an axe murderer.

In fact, it's hard to generalize as to what this film is about. It's about being a teenager in the eighties. It's about relationships. It's about time travel. Trust me, it all makes sense in the film.

 It certainly doesn't tie everything up in a neat package at the end. But that doesn't mean the ending isn't one of those that leaves you hanging. It does come to a definitve conclusion, one that actually pretty much brings you back to it's starting point.

Okay, you just have to see it to appreciate it. It's a film that makes you think about what you just saw and what the meaning of it all was. In fact, a small cottage industry has grown based on ferreting out the meaning of,  and events in, ""Donnie Darko.""

The acting is great throughout. The storyline provacative.

After viewing it for the first time, you'll probably do as I did and start combing the Internet for the book ""The Philosophy of Time."" Oh, a bit of a warning if you do start googling ""Donnie Darko,"" the original site, [...], has been hijacked by some Internet squatter. Don't click on any of the links there and reward this guy for hijacking a url.

It lacks most of the haunting score and some of the period songs have been substituted, such as the Echo and The Bunnymen song in the opening.

There are also entire sequences from the original stripped of a score.

The director cut also extends some scenes unnecesarily, such as the first night in the hotel.

It is still a great film, but not as cool as the original.

1671500,4,B00005V3Z4,"I was told by many of my freinds that the director's cut of this film is very dissapointing because of the change in the soundtrack. For the first 45 minutes I too was bothered by the apparent lack of musical background which provides alot of light to the film. With the sparser soundtrack the film seems more eerie, more like an art house thriller and less like a sci-fi teen drama/comedy. This really changes the nature of the movie, as does some of the added content.

However, as the film progressed I felt the weight of all the eerie quiet and more drawn out scenes where starting to build alot of inertia. The details in the plot, as well as the more rich universe the director creates build on each other to make a very deep and heavy film. And of course, much more is explained than in the theatrical cut, so it is a little easier to comprehend the film even if it ends up being even more complex.

Here too, the added information, especially from the Philosophy of Time Travel also change the film dramatically. What had before appeared to be a story of Donnie on a sanity challenging mission of his own actually becomes the story of the web of characters and events pushing him and leading him on his path. Things that I once took at face value as simply interesting plot twists seem to be the hand of God manipulating people's behavior to create the path for Donnie's time portal. You begin to question who the characters really are and what is the REAL purpose of their actions. I even began wondering about Gretchen and her role in the story. Before her relationship with Donnie appeared to a simple love story, but now it becomes deeper and more mystifying.

Also the director's cut explains Donnie's transformation from nihilism and hedonism into altruism and belief in God. This is the thread traces from Donnie's sexual digression in hypnotherapy, to the scene where Donnie and his freinds discuss the sexual habbits of smurfs and finally the classroom scene with the rabbits. Gretchen and Ms. Pommeroy's comments about the meaning of the rabbits seem to be the crucial turning point in Donnie's understanding of the nature of the events surrounding him. The scene in paricular seemed random at first, but after I returned to it became very important.

I was not dissapointed by this version of the film. I think the original is more entertaining and palatable, and it brings the films elements together in a much more emotional and cohesive way. This version does soften some of the overly simplistic pop elements of the original, but it loses some of the warmth. However, having seen this version the original gains alot more meaning and depth that would have been difficult to spot. The director's cut almost seems to be like supplementary viewing, or even an appendix to the original film. I enjoy both, but now that I understand the richness of the plot I would probobly rather watch the original. Despite that I think the director's cut is essential to fully appreciate this movie.",1170892800,9,3004,4.69449715370019
1671501,3,B00005V3Z4,"The director's cut of Donnie Darko dwells too much on a bizarre sci-fi metaphysics of time travel. The original, more compact and eliptical, plays as a moody meditation on the omnipotent, interconnected and paranoid aspect of adolescent fantasy. Less is definitely more when it comes to Donnie Darko.

For me, the original cut is a terrific film, whereas the director's cut is overdone and lacks interest.

BTW: anyone have as guess as to why the film was set in 1988?",1170806400,7,468,4.8375
1671502,5,B00005V3Z4,"I fell asleep on this film a few years ago when I started it too late the night before it was due back at the video store.  It's not what I expected of a so-called ""cult"" film, or even a sci-fi or troubled-teenager genre flick.  Now, having some more time and patience, I gave this Director's Cut the careful attention it deserves, and the rewards are considerable.  The 26-year-old Kelly shoots movies like a pro if not an art movie director.  None of the ""shock editing"" that we've become so accustomed and desensitized to.  Instead, he favors long takes, slow pacing, and some of the most fluid camera movement in recent memory.  Moreover, he has a true artist's eye for shot composition, using the 2.5:1 anamorphic lens to maximum aesthetic and narrative effect in practically every frame.

All the same, I've just ordered the earlier, shorter version to see if some of the apparent flaws I noticed in the Director's Cut are lessened.  For one, some of the scenes are overly formulaic and obvious--both in the scripting and filming.  The hypocritical, self-righteous characters are played quite loudly, bordering on flat caricature.  Moreover, Kelly pulls gratuitous tricks like mocking them with ""fast action"" shooting (whereas the youthful romantic hero and heroine, of course, are shot in slow motion).  Drew Barrymore seems to occupy unnecessary screen time toward the end of the film, tilting this POV film to her situation rather than Darko's.  Also, all the time-travel nonsense, which I understand has been exaggerated in both this version and on a Johnny Darko website, could be reduced to the betterment of the film, imo.  Still, the script is light years ahead of juvenilia time-wasters like Dazed and Confused (unless you're a teenager).

Although Kelly talks about the film as Reagan-era social satire (an easy target, since the 80s were a rerun of the repressive 1950s), the movie is less about an historical period than about other movies: in fact, it's a collection of mirrors reflecting other movies.  Several shots of Darko recall Norman Bates, when we learn about his dual identity at the end of Psycho.  Darko's alter ego, Frank, recalls Jeffrey Beaumont's dark twin, Frank (Dennis Hopper), in Lynch's Blue Velvet.  The playing off of psychological vs. chronological time, challenging the viewer to decide which temporal dimension he is currently viewing, reprises Lynne's remarkable film, ""Jacob's Ladder.""  And the time-travel theme owes less to ""Back to the Future"" than ""serious"" science fiction movies like ""12 Monkeys"" and the 30-minute influential French film classic by Chris Marker: ""La Jetee.""

But most strikingly, the film echoes the central theme of Burgess/Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange,"" where Alex and his Droogs talk Nadsat and commit rape and violence to assert their free choice and humanity in a world that threatens to ""condition"" them, transforming them into deterministic machines.  Two key moments in Darko: the intercut chapter with the quote, ""The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from oblivion,"" and Darko's conversation with his science teacher, who explains to him that if he were able to know his future, he would have a choice to accept or avoid it, which means that destiny would come to an end.

This is a film that celebrates choice--not just its characters' but the viewers'.  Moviegoers need not subject themselves to mindless surrogate experiences in virtual reality, pretending that loneliness and fear are more imagined than real. The attentive viewer is likely to feel that the disturbed teen protagonist has made some significant choices which, however risky or even deadly, have prepared him to face the difficult circumstances of life that none of us can control.

Finally, this is a director who definitely knows Catcher in the Rye, infusing his main character with so much of Holden's spirit (obsession with sex and death, impatience with phoniness and pretense, adoption of grandiose thinking and a savior complex) that Donny Darko becomes the ""everychild"" in each of us, more recognizable than we may be inclined to admit.",1169683200,10,4113,5.142642642642643

1671509,1,B00005V3Z4,"Have you ever seen any Jimmy Stewart movies?  Well, Donnie Darko rips off two of them:  ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Harvey"".

Do you remember the last 15 or 20 minutes of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", when the angel, Clarence, shows George Bailey a horror scenario about what the world would have been like had he never been born?

Well, Donnie Darko is exactly like ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  Except it takes that 15 or 20 minutes of gloom and stretches it out for 2 hours.  Wow eh?  Really heartwarming stuff.

Also, instead of Clarence the angel as Donnie Darko's guide, enter the giant bunny rabbit from Harvey, who instead of speaking plainly, whispers to him cryptically in a creepy nightmarish sort of way.

And, at the end of the film...instead of discovering that life is precious, every second of every minute is a gift and that he can touch others through his life...is not alone...etc.  Instead of all of that, what does Donnie learn?  That the world would be better off if he were dead.

Wow eh?  So edgy and different huh?

Well, actually...tell you the truth...I think the premise sounds pretty dumb.  And the kicker to it all is...the movie doesn't make sense.  Nothing is revealed or disclosed.  Donnie has to die.  Why?  So that it can be gloomy and dark.  But why?  Who knows.  Oh right...he saved the world...by killing a guy for no reason, letting his girlfriend get runover by a car, burning down a house and flooding his school.  Don't worry...it will all make sense in the end...not.

And believe it or not...that's what people like about it.  They like that it doesn't make any sense.  Why?  They confuse poor storytelling, and an unnecessarily confusing script as being brilliant and ""deep"".  And then they can go around proving how smart they are that they ""get"" the movie, that it's a masterpiece, etc.

A highschool kid is given a quest to die.  The boy is depressed about this...and feels alone in the world...blahblahblah.  Insert some coming up age stuff, family problems...skip ahead, skip ahead...and he kills himself and the world is a better place.

1671510,1,B00005V3Z4,"I went into this movie with no preconceived notions, having read only the DVD case and nothing else.

I like a film that challenges the viewer to find their own meaning and doesn't just blatantly spell out every little nuance...

But there is a big difference between a movie that challenges the viewer and one that just throws disjointed and half realized notions at you, and then expects you to make some kind of cohesive sense out of it.

I liken this film to being given a box of interestingly shaped and coloured puzzle pieces, which then, fail to actually fit together in the end.

The film, The Jacket, did the whole time travel/twist on reality thing much better, even though it too asked the audience to stretch their imagination and use their minds, but the difference is, that this puzzle was solvable, as all of the pieces given, in the end, fell into place, and yielded something.

Granted, that something might be different for each individual, but the point here is that something could be made of all of the pieces given.

But with Donnie Darko, the end result was more like a who done it, where the killer turns out to be someone who just suddenly popped up in the last 2 seconds of the film, a cheat, if you like.

Anyone can take a bunch of interesting concepts and throw them into a film, and tell the audience to figure it out for themselves, but that doesn't make it a good film, just a bunch of interestingly shaped and coloured puzzle piece that fail to actually fit together in the end.

The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is a 2+ hour episode of The Twilight Zone. It deals in time travel, the butterfly effect, and the whole ""what would happen if certain events in the past didn't happen or were changed"" thing.

And apparently the formula works. At the time of this writing the average Amazon rating is 4+ stars with almost 1000 reviews to back it up. Wow.

Well, I say, what we have here is a good movie with a loyal following. Hence, Donnie Darko, for whatever reason, has become somewhat of a Cult Classic. But a 5 star film??? No. You have GOT to have Rabbititis to think that THIS is a 5 star film.

Donnie Darko is an interesting movie. Its Director Richard Kelly has a very short resume, so kudos to him for creating such a buzz around such a mediocre psychological adventure.

A lot of the situations are real and fun to watch. But the time travel part is the real point of the movie, which is bizarre and not easy to follow even if you are paying attention.

So, if after all that you are as I was inclined to give Donnie Darko a try based on the raves...rent it as I did. Then perhaps make the purchase if the movie compels you to join the group that makes this film a classic...a ""Cult"" Classic.",1166400000,,1405,4.32319391634981

The portrayal of the 80's is spot on and sparked a quick trip down memory lane.  Jake really took the role and ran with it.  He must've been exhausted after putting so much effort into this character.  A truly noteworthy job.

1671513,5,B00005V3Z4,"After seeing the director's cut first and the original version of the movie second, I must say that the director's cut is a far better film. The director's cut has is subtle differences from the original, but they are enough to drive the movie into a different direction. In the original many of the themes are explained in a concluding monologue almost leaving the movie rather transparent. The directors cut is a far more rewarding experience than the original. The director's cut adds much more depth to the plot than in the original. The added depth breeds an even more confusing movie, however if the movie is watched closely (and you will want to watch this movie closely) everything is explained. The original doesn't show the pages of Sparrow's book which introduces the concepts of the ""Manipulated Dead"", the ""Vessel"" and many other elements. The original does contain a spoiler at the end that explains much of the movie. The monologue at the end was wisely removed for the directors cut and the pages of the book were shown. The director's cut also has additional scenes and parts of scenes that were removed from the original movie.

While the movie may have achieved a cult following, the soundtrack certainly hasn't. The soundtrack is littered with hidden gems that have started to find their way into the mainstream. Gary Jules' ""Mad World"" is simply brilliant, which was recently used in an Xbox commercial. In fact, the soundtrack to this movie contains all standout tracks. The soundtrack mirrors the movie extremely well, and really embodies the spirit of the movie.

The existentialist concepts are thought provoking, prompting my second viewing of the film. The website is just as confusing as the movie. If you haven't visited the movie's website, it's a giant game that gives background information on the movie and even offers an epilogue.

Overall it's an excellent movie. The directors cut makes the movie a little bit more confusing, but adds a tremendous amount of depth to the movie that wasn't in the original. However after watching the movie a second time, the true depth and concepts of the movie are revealed and my initial confusing gave way to awe. This is an excellent movie that has been overlooked for a long time. Even if you've seen the original, watch the director's cut, it adds the extra depth to the movie, transforming it from a great movie into a spectacular movie.",1165363200,12,2413,4.866180048661801

1671515,5,B00005V3Z4,"I loved Donnie Darko. I thought it was a quirky, crazy 80s period piece and had a killer soundtrack (loved the use of the Killing Moon during the opening sequence, thank god they didn't stick with the INXS song I believe was supposed to go instead). Initially, I thought it was about schizophrenia, to discover later on that this theme merely wrapped itself around a much more complex, albeit ""unrealistic"", centre, concerning theology, the transcendence of the soul, and time travel.

I thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was very good, he gave body and credibility to a character who appears (and most likely, is) totally unfocused, troubled, nihilistic, yet proves to also be intelligent and aware of all the good and the bad around him. I wasn't much of a fan of the actress that played Gretchen, nor the character itself. I could never tell if she had any motivations, if she was truly concerned about her family situation, and why she was with Donnie in the first place. Other than that, I loved the styllization of the movie, the clever use of imagery, and yes... the Smurf monologue.

1671521,3,B00005V3Z4,"I really wanted this film to be a GREAT film. Based on the things I'd read about it, and what I'd heard from others, it sounded like the kind of film that would enter that pantheon of films that I must watch at least once every year or so. And I do believe that ""Donnie Darko"" is a very good film - I have watched it three times thus far, and there aren't many films on which I would spend that much time, if I didn't find them intriguing.  The film is extremely well-made, and evokes an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding very effectively.  The gleaming unreality of 1980s suburbia, which seems to just barely cover over some mysterious darkness lurking beneath which threatens to erupt and overwhelm the surface world at any moment, compares favorably with ""Blue Velvet,"" which achieved a very similar effect.  And the characters and dialogue are richly drawn, and we have high school kids who actually look and act like how high school kids really look and act - a rarity in American film.

But there are still some quite serious problems that I have with it. One is that I don't find Donnie to be a particularly sympathetic character. He's not especially likable - he's smart, but completely self-absorbed, nihilistic, and the friends he hangs around with seem to be a rather unsavory bunch (the ""Go back to China"" comment from one, said to an Asian student, being a particularly brutal example). He doesn't have any real problems, either, being the privileged only son of affluent and loving parents who give him anything he wants.  There's a bully who bothers him occasionally, and his ""emotional problems,"" although by the end of the film it seems that the latter is, in fact, essential to the ""mission"" he's called on to carry out.  Otherwise, Donnie's life seems quite golden, in the American suburban sense, so it's unclear as to what it really is that troubles him, other than the usual teen angst with which all of us must come to terms.

Another weakness is that the film seems to simultaneously try to evoke nostalgia for the 1980s, while some sort of critique of `80s values seems to also be implied.  Such ambivalence isn't necessarily a flaw, particularly in view of the light/dark duality that I mentioned earlier in its depiction of suburbia. However - and I'm entirely willing to admit that this as a personal quirk of mine - as I'm only two years older than the film's creator, Richard Kelly, and come from a very similar suburban background, I can't help but react negatively to this setting, as I experienced the same period in the same way, and found everything about the `80s to be vacuous and repulsive.  I'm still not sure exactly what Kelly's trying to communicate about the `80s - whether it's meant to be ironic or not - but I personally found it to be a turn-off.  This may be deliberate on his part, but I remain uncertain, even after multiple viewings.

Although for me, the greatest flaw didn't strike me until I made the mistake of attempting to ""understand"" the film.  I was fortunate enough to see the film for the first time in a theater that happened to be screening the Director's Cut - and the Director's Cut of ""Donnie Darko,"" I must say, is one of the few such re-releases that I felt actually added something of substance to the original theatrical version (which I have seen subsequently), and I recommend that first-time viewers seek out the Director's Cut for this reason.

However, even given this advantage, there were still a lot of things about the film that struck me as odd or inconsistent.  I should have just chalked it up to the film's surreal atmosphere, and left well enough alone, but I couldn't help but wonder if I'd missed something on my initial viewing, so I started searching the Internet and going through the special features on the DVD to see what I could unearth.  What I learned changed my view of the film, and not for the better.  (SPOILERS AHEAD!) One thing that stayed with me after my first viewing was the jet engine that plummets from the sky at the film's conclusion - what caused it to fall off the plane in the first place?  There's no way to know this from the film itself.  So I discovered an interview with Kelly in which he explained that the engine was, in fact, ripped away from the body of the plane by Donnie himself, with his ""new-found psychic powers,"" and that Donnie discovers at the climax of the film that he's a kind of superhero, replete with super-powers.  I found this to be kind of a cop-out.  After all, there's absolutely nothing in the film itself to support this...no hint that Donnie has ""super-powers,"" and yet clearly it's a crucial plot point, since the entire plot revolves around this jet engine.  Further reading only soured my view of the film further.  I made the mistake of reading the text of ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" book (an extra on the DVD) which is featured in the film, although within the film we never find out exactly what's in it.  This is for the better, since I discovered upon reading it that most, if not all of the characters in the film are being manipulated by whatever unseen forces are driving Donnie toward completing his ""mission.""  Frank, the guy in the bunny costume, it turns out is a ""manipulated dead,"" meaning that he was sent back in time from the moment when Donnie kills him in order to instruct Donnie in what he must do.  As for some of the other bizarre moments in the film, it turns out that these unseen forces can also manipulate the living, and that when Donnie's psychiatrist warns him about ""the sky opening up,"" or when Donnie's teacher tells Gretchen to ""sit next to the boy who's the cutest,"" this is all the result of them being manipulated by these mysterious beings.  This, for me, was a huge disappointment.  Basically, what this means is that ""Donnie Darko"" is basically about a bunch of characters who are all automatons without free will, being manipulated by unseen forces for some purpose that is never fully divulged in the film.  My reaction to this revelation was, ""So who cares?""  I watch films to see humans reacting in human ways to human situations.  Discovering that the characters in a film are basically puppets being forced to behave in particular ways is, for me, a devastating blow to the film's integrity, and, as I said before, a cop-out, since it gets the characters out of any responsibility or motive for their own actions.  (END SPOILERS) I was willing to attribute the strangeness of the film to its surreal character, but now that I know Kelly's intent, it's hard to put it out of my head when I'm watching it.  Maybe Kelly is trying to say something about free will and determinism that I haven't figured out, but as it is, knowing that the characters are all being manipulated to do and say certain things, it really takes away a lot of the compelling interest in the story for me.

When I've watched the film since finding out these things, I've tried to put what I've read out of my head, more or less successfully, but it's still weakened the film in my eyes. So, my advice to prospective new viewers of this film is: DON'T try to understand it, just take it at face value for what it is. It doesn't stand up to sustained investigation.",1159228800,10,7237,4.589604344453065

Only after I went through the commentary, did everything (except for one thing) make sense. I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't ""get it"" by watching the movie alone, I  say it is a failure on the film maker's part.

That said, I was intrigued by it. I guess the challenge of figuring it out is what attracts geeks (I consider myself one) everywhere to this movie. When you finally ""get it"", it becomes a wonderful movie. Just one thing that still doesn't make sense though, when the jet engine (the Artifact) appears in the primary universe at the end of the movie, doesn't it make it a Tangent universe?

Art can be interpreted so many ways, and we all have our own opinions. Nobody can be ""right"" or ""wrong"" in what they appreciate, which is one of the beauties of Art in itself. To me, Donnie Darko is like one of those paintings a person needs to stare at for a substantial amount of time before they see the beauty of the picture. Once you learn who the characters are in the film....what the Artifact is, the role of the Manipulated Dead/Living, and so on, it becomes a whole different movie, and it's quite a film after that. 4 stars is fair, to me, but I understand those that give it 5.",1156032000,6,872,4.190476190476191

It's very intense and very emotional, and for those of you who love extras, this DVD offers them for you.

I highly recommend this if you're a fan of Lynch, and for anyone who's not, it's actually much easier to understand than a lot of his work.

Trust me when I say that you should shell out the extra few bucks for the director's cut.  It's well worth it.",1156032000,10,623,4.024390243902439
1671526,5,B00005V3Z4,"This movie is about learning to live.  Donnie Darko is a troubled 15 year old who thinks life is absurd and meaningless because, in the end, everyone dies alone.

Set in the Fall of 1988, the movie is about personal transformation and how through your own personal transformation you can change the world.  The 1988 Presidential election serves as a handy backdrop for the despair caused by alienation and apathy.  The country has emerged from 8 years of conservatism under Ronald Reagan and has a choice to make.  This larger sense of place echoes within the community, where conservative values are prominent and people fear change.  The only kind of ""change"" people accept comes from the self-help guru who spouts shallow epithets; whereas real works about transformation and change are shunned and called ""pornographic,"" such as Graham Greene's short story which says, in part: ""It was as though this plan had been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons, now in his fifteenth year crystallised  with the pain of puberty.""

This could not be a better description of the angst of adolescence and of Donnie Darko himself, now in his 15th year, who is searching for the ""plan"" he needs to accept the yin and yang of existence:  that destruction and creation work together to create change.

Donnie is the only student in the class who understands the Greene story.  When called upon by his teacher he says the story is saying that ""destruction is a form of creation.  So the fact that they burn the money is..,.ironic.  They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.""

But how does one find transformation in a world that seems to offer only diminished possibilities?  In a world that believes acquisition leads to happiness?  What Donnie ultimately discovers--which is why he laughs and smiles at the end of the movie--is that meaning is found through your creative engagement with life and through the mark you leave on the world.

The song ""Mad World"" truly encapsulates the thematic concerns of the movie beautifully.  The music video, included as a special feature, is valuable in itself.  Highly recommended movie.",1155427200,24,2182,4.909836065573771
1671527,5,B00005V3Z4,"Writer-director Richard Kelly's debut feature, the Lynchian Donnie Darko, is a tale of adolescent angst ripe with enigmatic sci-fi underpinnings. Regardless of whether Kelly's titular protagonist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is seemingly deranged or merely on the brink of saving humanity from itself, his time-warping fantasies become startling metaphors for confused teenage male development. This endlessly inventive film is the virtual antithesis of happy-go-lucky '80s teen flicks, hauntingly gauging the pulse of a nation gripped by sexual repression and political uncertainty. Kelly's jabs at Reaganism are about as subtle as his devilishly boldfaced ""Vote Dukakis"" shtick. By film's end, Kelly has expertly transformed his comfortable '80s milieu into an apocalyptic sweat chamber nervously situated between moral complacency and heartbreaking could-have-been hopefulness.

""Maybe it's the story of Holden Caulfield, resurrected in 1988 by the spirit of Phillip K. Dick,"" says 26-year-old Kelly of his film. The students at Donnie's school free-float through hallways that begin to resemble portals into an alternate universe. Make no mistake, this is Kelly's deadpan notion of what life was like in the '80s. A school bully openly snorts cocaine by a friend's locker in one hysterical slow-motion shot. Kelly allows ample room for poignancy when the bronze statue of the school's mascot (here, a curious squatting dog) keeps stoic watch over a fat girl named Cherita (Jolene Purdy), whose swan-inspired performance at the school's talent show is rejected in favor of a lame Stacy Q rip-off. The group is named Sparkle Motion, spearheaded by Donnie's young sister Samantha (Daveigh Chase). They are the embodiment of '80s cheese-pop; their performance is ghoulishly applauded while Cherita's hopeful gaze into the future is tossed aside with polite disinterest.

A sleepwalking Donnie is lured out of his house by his alter ego (here, a rabbit named Frank), who saves Donnie from the plane engine that crashes into his bedroom. As a result, Donnie comes to believe Frank's prophecy that the world will end in 28 days. Halloween's arrival and the Bush/Dukakis race pitch-perfectly compliment the film's apocalyptic wind-down. With doomsday nearing, Donnie becomes an upstart messiah ridding the town of self-righteous false prophets, though he does find time to innocently woo new-girl-in-town Gretchen (Jena Malone) with retro come-ons like ""do you want to go with me?"" A New Age gym teacher who makes little emotional allowances outside her fear/love lifeline is Donnie's main target. Her downfall is followed by and linked to the fiery demise of a self-help guru played by Patrick Swayze, whose motivational shenanigans Donnie hysterically shoots to the ground.

Now in a hectic search for enlightenment, Donnie begins to believe that time travel is possible. For help, he looks to the town's 101-year-old biddy (writer of the fictional tome The Philosophy of Time Travel), who is as eerily frozen in time as her hopeful disciples. Taught in English class by quasi-hippie Karen (Drew Barrymore), Graham Greene's The Destructors and its tale of creation/destruction beautifully compliments the film's fateful finale. References to '80s pop-culture abound: Sparkle Motion is invited to be on Star Search '88 while Donnie and Gretchen catch Sam Raimi's Evil Dead before Donnie does away with the town's false prophet, whose participation in a kiddie porn ring seems to shatter the entire town's sense of complacency. Donnie Darko is a blazingly original evocation of better-place-than-here hopefulness, an affront to '80s naivete that is mindful of strange events that seemingly happen for a reason though not always for the better good.",1155340800,7,3733,5.511343804537522

1671531,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest, independent films in history.  A story of the choices we make everyday and their relations to divine intervention, Donnie Darko lives up to every expectation I have had to compare it to and leaves the viewer wishing for more.

When a plane engine crashes through the house of the Darko family, Donnie's life is spared by a hallucination.  After a six-foot-tall bunny rabbit calls Donnie out to a golf course and tells him that the world will end in 28 days, Donnie realizes that he would have died had it not been for the strange awakening.  What is happening to Donnie?  Of course, you will have to see the movie to find out.

The very powers that created this film - such names as Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and Jake Gylenhaal - don't ruin it at all due to their Hollywood status, but instead are able to shine in a movie such as this.  It really shows the true range of emotions these actors can portray without the sugar-coating of a Hollywood production.

The extended scenes and extras on this DVD are well worth it for fans and newcomers to this movie.  Not only does it add more drama and family connection, making the eventual climax much sadder, but it also adds more depth to the characters.  My only regret with this film is that they did not shorten Drew Barrymore's lines during her character's main scene, in which she is fired from the school in which she teaches.

The music and composition in this movie is excellent.  I personally prefer the tracks from the original theatrical debut, but the director's true intentions for the songs in this version do not interfere with the story at all.

Richard Kelly shines as director for this film, showing a depth and creativity rarely seen in movies anymore.  The success of this movie is his own doing, and hopefully Kelly will produce more films like Donnie Darko in the future.",1153872000,4,1912,4.601769911504425
1671532,3,B00005V3Z4,"Most movies fit neatly into one of the categorical drawers in your DVD rack. Each is either a drama, romance, teen, action, mystery, western or some other episode in film genre. ""Donnie Darko"" is simultaneously none of these and a half-dozen of them.

Similar to but better than ""Final Destination"", ""Donnie Darko"" is the story of a psychotic high school kid that hallucinates what appears to be a malevolent rabbit that orders bad things to happen. Sometimes Donnie participates in these events and they always affect him.

The plot moves eerily in many directions from this premise, at various times approaching science fiction, horror, family drama, teen angst, comedy, adventure and school hijinks. Not all these types are equally well done and the film occasionally loses focus and direction.

An all-star cast -- Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, Drew Barrymore as a misunderstood teacher, Noah Wyle, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mom -- lends consistent credibility to this movie, which sometimes goes quite far afield to make its point.

The movie is full of surprises you don't expect. The ending is  a cult classic and watch how moralist-weight loss-lifestyle expert Patrick Swayze -- who is cast wayyyy against type -- gets undressed later in the movie by an act of violence that offers an ironically satisfying twist.

Make no mistake, ""Donnie Darko"" is not a great film and will never make to the AFI 100. It is ultra-original and nearly impossible to categorize, however, and therein lies its interest.

I'm sure this was marketed to teens when it arrived in 2001 but its appeal is far broader; anyone bored with formulaic moviemaking should take in ""Donnie Darko"" to see how near the end of the box film can still move in the era of copycat prequel sequels.",1153872000,2,1813,4.983443708609271
1671533,5,B00005V3Z4,"Every once and a while, we come across a movie that just sticks with us in the back of our mind. Maybe because its greatness was too much for us to comprehend in one sitting. Or maybe because the lesson is much greater than what we as people are not used to in cinema. With a generation watered down by Hilary Duff films where somehow everything works out okay, even though it seems irrational and makes almost zero sense. Donnie Darko though, is an emotional slap to the face for all that think that is how the world works. This is a movie, that does not just have not one scene that tugs at the strings of your heart, the core of your soul or the center of your mind. Every scene does that and it's not everyday we come across that. from the serious scenes to the depressing yet humorous scene involing hungry, hungry hippos and well.....regret. To the discussion between Sean, Ronald and Donnie involving ""Smurfs"" which almost felt like a more blunt version of the famous Star Wars discussion in ""Clerks""

I must admit though, I judged this before I watched it. Which I kick myself now for. I judged it because it seemed to have a cult following of pudgy Hot Topic obsessed poser kids. Being a dedicated REAL metalhead, hot topic posers are the bane of exsistance in my eyes. So, I wrongfully wrote this off as a cliche joke of depressed stereotypes. I was wrong.

Anyway, the story starts off with Donnie Darko, a young man in the 80's going through,  depression, moral issues, arson issues, wonder of what the world brings and well a huge demonic bunny named Frank which brings news of the end of the world. He is surrounded what seems to be a normal family, a normal sweet younger sister, an older sister with obvious attitude issues and parents who are simply ""worried"" a love interest with the new girl in town, bullies and friends that really don't seem to be doing much in life. Watching Donnie transform through this movie was amazing and shwos his range as an actor. The last 10 minutes is truly thought provoking cinema.

I have cable, so that is how I stumbled upon this movie. So, I can't give youexact details on extras for the dvds. However, they h ave played it alot and i've watched it 6-8 times this month and I must say, you won't be dissapointed. I will leave you will a few memorable quotes. Enjoy.

Gretchen: My mom had to get a restraining order against my step dad. He has emotional problems.

Donnie: Oh, I have those too. What kind does your step dad have?

Gretchen: He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.

Donnie: Oh.

Karen Pommeroy: [to Principle Cole] I don't think that you have a clue what it's like to communicate with these kids. We are losing them to apathy... to this prescribed nonsense. They are slipping away.

Donnie: My parents didn't get me what I wanted for Christmas.

Dr. Lilian Thurman: What did you want?

Donnie: Hungry Hungry Hippos.

Dr. Lilian Thurman: And how did you feel, being denied these hungry, hungry hippos?

Donnie: Regret.

Dr. Lilian Thurman: The search for God is absurd?

Donnie: It is if everyone dies alone.

Donnie: [in a letter] Dear Roberta Sparrow, I have reached the end of your book and... there are so many things that I need to ask you. Sometimes I'm afraid of what you might tell me. Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction. I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep.

A truly strange and original take on the angstiness of adolescence--it capture the doom-laden, dazed, and desperated phase that so many teens go through at one time or another. (At least I did and most of my cohorts did; we were the pre-Goth kids who dressed in black velvet and sported Death sickles and white makeup long after Halloween.)

The movie begins subtly, making the viewer increasingly uncomfortable and subconsciously terrified.  If you like David Lynch, for instance, especially MULHOLLAND DRIVE, you'd love this.  It also has a sort of Alan Ball feeling to the visual narrative.

Donnie is a troubled teen who wakes at movie's beginning along the side of an abandoned road.  How he got there and why he knows nothing about his journey is the stuff of the movie itself.  A film that teases with time travel, personal responsibility, and the worst of teen society, it's definitely darkly humorous.  Think HEATHERS.

It takes a little thought and a bit of understanding of symbolism.  Remember those movies in lit class, where everything meant something?  Donnie Darko is like that.  If you look once too often into your popcorn or tip the coke can more than an instant, you will miss a phrase, or a scene that will allow you to understand something later in the movie.  I read a lot of the 900+ reviews on this site and the low reviews (excepting those directed simply at the Director's Cut version) are due to the viewer being more than a little obtuse. They don't and won't ever ""get it"". The Peanut's comic strip would have too much symbolism for them to understand.  Better they spend the evening watching something they can understand, American Idol, Fear Factor or something loaded with a lot of T&A.
I am 50 years old and love the movie, both versions.  Each had something to give if you looked close enough. The Director's Cut tried to make it more accessible to the general audience by spoon feeding some of the concepts.  I think it is a great movie and could watch it once a week.  It has so many nuances.  No I am not a tree hugging former hippie burnout.  I am a conservative, a geoscientist with one teenager and another early 20's something rocker wannabe for kids.  I introduced them to the movie and they loved it too.  So much for the generation gap.  That only happens if your mind turns to tapioca.  Buy the movie.",1149465600,11,1624,4.4391891891891895

Basically this movie is unlike anything I have ever seen in a movie. I have seen reviews that compare it to other teen horror/drama movies such as final destination. Don't be fooled by these reviews, nothing you have ever seen is like Donnie Darko. To compare it to other movies is unfair. It's complexity is mind bending and leaves you wondering what could possibly explain what happened. After watching it multiple times I have given up trying to explain it with rationality and simply excepted that it is meant to be a mystery that is meant to be interpreted how you see it. I do not think there is a single explanation that sums up all that you see. The story gives you just enough to make you think you know what is happening until the ending which sends your mind racing back wondering what you just witnessed. The performances by the entire cast are exceptional. Never once will you watch this movie thinking about the actors. You are convinced by their portrayals of the charcters they represent, drawn into the movie and their environment. In summary Donnie Darko does something that I think all great movies do.

This is one of the few times a movie improved by adding in the cut scenes (approximately 20 scattered additional minutes). The scenes that first-time writer/director Richard Kelly added enhanced the movie tremendously. The original release at the theater got off to a rough start premiering one month after 9/11 (2001) grossing only $500,000 at the box office. The nation was in mourn and this movie has an aura of gloom. It became a classic once released on DVD and gained a HUGE following. It's extremely mesmerizing and still popular.

Most have explained a large part of the premise and theories on this thought provoking, eerie and intriguing movie. Frank, the 6-foot-tall rabbit with what looks like the head of a science-fiction insect is worth seeing alone. Jake Gyllenhaal leads an all-star cast (including his real life sister Maggie as his screen sister). Actor Patrick Swayze plays a surprising role... The movie also includes one of the best soundtracks of any movie in recent years. Definitely a MUST PURCHASE!

1671555,4,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a teen horror film.  In addition, it's a teen romance.  In addition, Donnie Darko is a Hamletian study in familial relationship.  The viewer never really knows whether Donnie, a brilliant high school kid is wacko or completely sane while his adult world is nutty.  I particularly liked the scenes with the lady-shrink where under hypnosis Donnie has a self-pleasuring moment.  Things can go wrong in those shrink sessions for sure.

There are two groups of adults here, the Democrats and the Republicans.  Dukakis is smart and thoughtful.  Bush 1 is stammering and smarmy.  The Physical Education teacher is new-age bunko, book burning, inflexible along with her idol, Patrick Swayze, as the handsome motivational speaker with one message, there's Fear and Love.  To contrast, Drew Barrymore plays the really cool young English teacher that gets canned for being too Liberal.  Donnie rebels and insists there is a world of grays out there, not black and white.  Okay, this is relativism which has it's own critics.  I'd go along with the evil Dan Quail idea if it were more developed, but good and evil in Darko is pretty cardboard.

I'm not at all sure why Kelly decided it was important to do a 1988 film in 2001.  You got me on that one.  There's as much political animosity and self-help gobblygook today as there was in the 80's.  I can only assume that the 80's was a crucible for the director.

Finally, Darko is an incredibly creative film, very interesting to watch visually as things might fall out of the sky at any moment.  Donnie walks through life in movie time, effortlessly burning down buildings while his girlfriend sleeps during a movie date.  My teen dates were never like that.",1146441600,4,1714,4.824742268041237

1671557,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko was one of those kind of films that actually needed theories: people explaining just what was going on and what it all meant. Even watching the director's cut, I was like ""what?"" at times, but then re-reading some of the things, it finally clicked. Whether you should've been left in the dark or finally understood the movie is one of those personal things that you can have it either way best suited to your tastes. For me, I enjoy that I finally ""get"" this thing.

Donnie Darko(dumb name by the way) is a troubled teen under medication living in the 80's. One night while sleepwalking, a jet engine manages to land right smack in the middle of his room. That's not all as a 6-foot tall freaky rabbit tells him that the world will end in less than a month. To spoil the rest would of course be a big disservice.

Some directors will come out with a huge film, and either make films that surpass or films that are great on their own merits but public reaction is ""they liked the first movie better"". M. Night Shyamalan is essentially trying to match the impact of the Sixth Sense with varying degrees of success while David Fincher was able to grow beyond Alien 3's reaction with Seven and Fight Club. Richard Kelly on the other hand seems to be one of the few who's actually trying to change around its success. Donnie Darko didn't exactly make much money but it developed a big cult following meanwhile Kelly was saying it was wrong thing, wrong that, anything and everything was wrong, hence we get this release.

On initial viewing of the original version, I didn't know what the hell happened, it's like some weird story with core elements actually taken out. Here, it's practically spoonfed to you and a quick trip to a site like Wikepedia helps put everything in perspective. All the talk of Tangent Universes and Manipulated Living are just like ""huh?"" to some people but eventually they'll get...maybe. Some prefer the ambiguity, others like an explanation for once. Me? I'm kind of in the middle.

Since I didn't watch the original constantly, I have no idea what was added back in but some of the effects got better and music was changed, such as the opening song which I always preferred the original choice better but hey it's his movie. Got no problem with him adding scenes to create his ultimate ""vision"" of the movie, just glad he cast Maggie Gyllenhaal, easy on the eyes that one.

This is a release that I have no idea which to recommend. Both serve their purpose of providing a good film and I guess it just comes down to one choice: do you prefer theorizing, or do you prefer understanding everything?",1145232000,4,2635,4.5741525423728815

1671559,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is one F'ed up movie, but in a good way.  The movie makes you think and you know from the first frames of the film that this is one of those you'd better pay attention to or else risk missing something important.  If you're not prepared to challenge your mind then you may want to wait until your brain is ready to watch this.

The movie gives the viewer humor, horror, teen angst, family drama, psychological thriller and sci-fi rolled into one and remains fun to watch and interesting which is the feat, I think, that makes it as popular as it is.  Donnie, the perfectly cast Jake Gyllenhaal, is a darkly troubled teen that is either, crazy, a genius or a cog in a universal scheme that has the power to save the world.  The only consistent thing is that we have to see what he's going to do and say next.

Frank the Bunny is his horrific companion in his adventure and helps direct Donnie along his path, helping him to escape death and commit acts of violence that may or may not serve an important purpose.  Or is it all schizophrenic delusion?  This is a movie that a few minutes in you will know that many questions will arise and maybe not all will be answered by the end.

Many people who were faithful to the original cut of the film will point out that the director's cut may not be as ambiguous as the original and therefore not as challenging for the viewer.  That may be correct.  I was very proud of myself for figuring out the main plot (well, mostly) on my first viewing, but then I had the help of the time travel book text to assist me whereas, as I understand, the original did not.  I do know that even if the director's cut is ""easier"" it is still one of the most thought provoking and intelligent movies around.  It is also of note that the director does not expect us to forget the original but states this is just a re-mix and can co-exist with the original release.  Considering the subject matter of the film I don't see why that can't work.  He's not pulling a George Lucas on us anyway.

To sum it up, the movie is just too interesting to pass up.  It may sound like sci-fi but it has so many elements that it really defies that simple tag.  Watch it and enjoy the ride.",1144368000,5,2212,4.251196172248804

1671561,5,B00005V3Z4,"After seeing and loving ""Brokeback Mountain"" (five viewings?!), I embarked on a Jake Gyllenhaal mini-film festival, starting with ""Jarhead"" (BLECH).

Since I've been hearing about ""Donnie Darko"" since its release, mostly from slightly eccentric, highly intelligent people who mostly share my taste in movies, I rented it (The Director's Cut).

OHMYFREAKINGGOD.

From the first moments, I was completely and totally drawn in to this completely original, yet accessible film.  The plot has been discussed in countless other reviews, so I won't get into it here, save to say that is both bizarre and resonant.  Things are purposefully left ambiguous, yet there is an undeniable internal logic that holds the many threads (and clashing movie genres) together.  Visually this film is a stunner, with wild effects merging seemlessly with domestic and school scenes that seem perfectly normal but just a little bit ""off.""

Everything in this movie has a double or a triple meaning, and virtually everything is symbolic or foreshadows something later in the film.  Frank the Bunny's line ""Pay attention, you might miss something"" applies to Donnie, but also very much to the viewer.  This is an incredibly ""dense"" film; cross James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" with Kubrick with ""Requium for a Dream"" with ""Ordinary People"" with any John Hughes teen angst movie and you end up with ""Donnie Darko.""  That is, if you're an incredibly gifted screenwriter and director like Richard Kelly.  This film DEMANDS repeat viewings, as it reveals entire layers of meaning each time you watch it, and can easily make you obsessed.  A cult has formed around it, and there is a cryptic website as well as a multitude of ""Donnie Darko"" internet communities, FAQs, blogs, etc.

I noticed that many of the negative reviews were from people who'd seen the original and disliked the Director's Cut.  The criticisms mostly stem from the fact that Kelly explains a bit more in the Director's Cut, but I can tell you, as a virgin viewer, it STILL requires a lot of puzzle solving and analysis; once you've seen this film, you just can't stop thinking about it.  Also, people complain about different music choices, and some additions and missing lines (particularly a key line from Frank in the movie theater).  Shoot, now I have to buy BOTH versions!

All of the actors are superb.  Both Noah Wylie and Drew Barrymore give the performances of their respective careers, Maggie Jyllenhaal, Jake's real-life sister, is wonderful as Donnie's sister, and the rest of the cast is equally good.

However, Jake Gyllenhaal really shines in the title role, as a hesitant teen with family troubles and a tough time socializing who is 1) either caught in a wild time-travel loop where only he can save the world, or 2) a paranoid schitzophrenic.  His halting manner, his hesitant voice, his odd tics, and most of all, his incredibly expressive eyes manage to convey a very troubled teenager who you can still empathize with.  Because you so feel for this character, the ending is both disturbing and deeply sad.  It's a tour de force performance, particularly from an actor that was only 19-20 when the film was shot.

This is no mere intellectual exercise; many ""puzzle movies"" engage the mind but remain emotionally cold and detatched.  Donnie Darko is the rare film that manages the nearly impossible task of having a mind, a heart, and a soul, in roughly equal measures.  DO NOT MISS THIS, I wish I'd discovered it sooner.

The person who made this movie created a whole plot that maybe only he/she would understand.....I had to go on the internet and look up explanations to figure the movie out.  Basically, the hero of the movie is thrusted into an alternate universe where certain rules apply.  Thankfully the director's cut inserts the laws/rules of the alternate universe as text for you to read, which may clear things up a bit.  There's a lot to see in this movie, and a second viewing is helpful or by going to internet descussion sites.

Not to say that this cut gives it away, because that would be entirely untrue, but it shows very subtle ghosts of what could be thought bridges if you sit down with the film and enjoy it from all angles.

The way I got the most out of this version is first by watching the theatrical cut. Then, go through and watch the deleted scenes and put them in place mentally. Try to listen to what the dialogue is not only trying to say but what it avoids saying to convey the intention of the scene. Now, that's really a big part in looking at the whole movie in different lights. Watch the director's cut now and it will be easier for you to employ more thought-based observations as opposed to rudimentary dialogue parallels. Buuut if you're not into all that, just watch this film.

good, best movie ever, wow, and not be able to back it up one

life that resembles Kafka more closely than anything else.  Not

Kafka's level of talent, but the same vein of thought.  Donnie

is a teenager that causes lots of trouble for his family,

willingly or not.  He is saved from obliteration by a man in a

bunny suit, note: this is not real, this is the same kind of

representation that Gregor went through in the Metamorphosis,

and thus starts a chain reaction that will end the world.  But

Donnie is given an option to save the world (a metaphor for his

family and the girl he met recently, the most important parts

of his life, therefore his world) by going back in time.  Dying

essentially, much as Gregor had to die once the family moved on without him.

In short, the movie is about the strained relations that exist

between people, and how those relations can negatively impact

others, and how sometimes, it is better to leave, represented

in the movie by the ultimate leavetaking, death.",1141776000,,1577,4.414035087719299

 I saw the movie's theatrical version a year ago or so. I loved it, all of it. The acting is great, the story is fantastic, the script is clever and brilliant and the movie gets you to think, not only about it's own meaning, but about everything else. It's a movie that leaves its print on you.

 I couldn't wait to see the director's cut, most Director's cut's I had seen before where much better than the theatrical versions (like the butterfly effect for instance?. But with Donnie, I was terribly dissapointed. Many unnecesary changes had been made in the movie (like changing the music in the ""burn to the ground"" part, which was beautifull in the theatrical version), some strange scenes had been added which didn't suit the movie. Those extracts from ""the philosophy of time travel don't fit in the movie at all,  the opening eye they had introduced between scenes is just odd... In my opinion the theatrical version is much better, and I think that with the succes the director  must either have done this to sell more or he has just got carried away with his idea and not done it properly.

  The worst thing in the DVD, however, is not the  movie itself, but the extras, they are the worse extra features I have seen in a DVD ever. The ""documentary"" where they show you the filming of some scene and  show you the guys looking for the right places to film is boring and badly done, the one about the Donnie Darko fans is quite useless too, it doesnt bring anything, but its better than the others. The ""darkomentary"" about the number one fan is just too much for me to handle, the guy is a complete moron, and he shows it all the way through the ""darkomentary"". I can't understand why Richard kelly got that number one fan thing going on, but he must have chosen the worst one he got. Its not even funny, its just sad.

1671579,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is an extremely original and thought provoking film.  It's a wild ride through the teenage mind of Donnie Darko.

Donnie's ride begins when he is visited by a rather large and scary rabbit who predicts the world will end in a matter of days.  The same night his room is obliterated when an airplane engine comes crashing through the roof.  This sets in motion a chain of events that lead the already troubled youth to become obsessed with apocalyptic visions, time travel and the nature of reality.

Is he delusional or a visionary?  What is the nature of reality and time? How do we fit into the universe?  All of these things are part of the sometimes strange, sometimes funny world of the denizens of Darko's universe.",1141344000,,734,4.6434108527131785

1671581,5,B00005V3Z4,"It's hard to believe that this movie almost was not released in movie theatres, maybe it's labelling.

In the movie is a great part when Donnie Darko says ""life isn't that simple, you can't lump everything together in one category"" and that's exactly what the problem with movie. Well, a problem for some anyway.

It's a scifi story in that it deals with time-travel, but not the ""what will happen when"" kind. It's a very very dark psychological drama too. Often we say that people with a mental disorder live in a different world, but DD really does.

I don't want to say too much about the storyline, you really have to see it for yourself.

Great roles for Jake Gyllenhaal and his sister, Noah Wyle (from ER) and Drew Barrymore.

Bad review, I know, sorry about that. Too much going on in the movie. Warning: for some it can be really scary, nightmarish even.",1141084800,,862,4.535483870967742
1671582,5,B00005V3Z4,"My close friend had never seen this movie, but it was highly recommended to her, so my friend and I (also with a small group of friends) rented this movie one night. I'd heard of it before, (browsing Jake Gyllenhaal movies) and it seemed interesting but had never pursued it.

After we settled in to watch it, I was completely hooked. It took alot of processing to grasp the plot, but trust me, it was worth all of that thinking! The only downside was that after I viewed this film, for a few nights after, 6 foot tall demonic rabbits began to creep into my peripheral vision.

Jake Gyllenhaal was absolutely stunning in this film, I forgot it was him for most of this movie and he became Donnie Darko- the confused, insane, teenager who wants to get off with pretty much every girl he knows (and then some). His body language, haunting eyes, limp posture, crooked smile, all create Donnie's presence.

I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12 or so, (I'm 13). It's mainly rated R for

violence (not gory though)

some drug use (I fail to see the harm in this)

sexual references (come on, these are teenagers)

and profanity (and not just the mild ones)

Donnie Darko is a film that deals with all manner of existential issues. It does not spell out the answers because Richard Kelly wants each person to think about the film and draw his own conclusions. At least, I feel he does.

The best way to aproach this film is to realize that reality is bent creatively to express ideas that cannot be expressed any other way. Donnie Darko is a Christ figure whose sacrifice allows those he loves and even those he does not know to either redeem themselves or have a chance to live a life without tragedy dogging their footsteps. And, while one would think that as Donnie reverses time there would be no recollection on the part of those whose lives have been altered through his actions, the last scene is of the two people he loved the most waving in tentative recognition of who they are and what they know. And, as we see the small neighborhood boy who explains what has happened wave to Donnie's mother, who is to say this is not Donnie reincarnated in another, happier life?

This is a thought provoking movie that is not for everyone. It is beautiful and sad and gloriously uplifting all at the same time. It is a life experience, not just a video experience.",1140048000,,1444,4.400749063670412

if you really enjoy in depth characters who interact with each other very well and blend in you will love this. the only real weak points it has is that in some points it can drag but normally picks back up with something off the wall.

the visual effects are the last thing i'll cover the graphics are great and i don't want to give anything away but the graphics get you hooked they aren't that big in the movie but you'll fall in love with them when you see them nothing is cheesy and looks fake. this version also has a lot more comedy that will brighten the movie. so please i advise you watch this movie either version and you will love it.",1140048000,,1158,4.211711711711712

What a let-down.

The film starts off with promise as Donnie Darko wakes up in a forest with mild amnesia and bicycles home in a frenzy to discover that while he was asleep, a plane had crashed into his home. What's more, one of the plane's engines went straight through his bedroom, which would have killed Darko had he not been sleeping outside. Did Darko have some premonition of this event? It is never revealed.

Stupid scene after stupid scene follows, most of which are unconnected to the main plot, which I gather has something to do with time travel. In one scene Darko and his friends discuss whether smurfs have sex lives. In another Patrick Swayze's character (who plays one of those hyper motivational speakers) is arrested for possessing child porn. At some point in the film Darko begins having hallucinations of a man in a gray bunny suit who identifies himself as Frank. I found the scenes involving Frank to be weird and ridiculous and couldn't for the life of me discern how they were tied to the plot. Towards the film's end I began wondering if ""Donnie Darko"" was like Frank - a grotesque hallucination. Surely my friends and co-workers wouldn't lavish plaudits on such a pointless, weird and stupid movie. Maybe, I wondered, they made two Donnie Darko's and I rented the bad one? No such luck, alas.

You can't predict what's going to happen in the next moment. This movie uses a non traditional form of story telling (I would say similar to David Lynch's style) trying to reach the unconcious.

The reason I like this movie is because it has a point (I won't say what it is). And after my initial sadness of thinking of my own mortality, the movie actually made me feel better about myself and death. This is not just some weird movie that appeals to the wanna-bes of this world.",1138406400,5,633,4.410256410256411
1671593,4,B00005V3Z4,"I highly recommend this movie.

This video first came to my attention when someone on NPR provided an analysis of the movie comparing it to the Reagan Presidency.  That alone should show that there are multiple possible interpretations for this movie.  Of course, the 900 plus reviews on Amazon might be another clue as well.

As you watch the movie, several possibilities come to mind.  Donnie Darko is insane.  Donnie Darko is going to somehow save the world.  Donnie Darko's friends are pulling the most elaborate practical joke on him and this is facilitated by the psychotropic drugs that are proscribed for him. In the end, all of these are wrong.

""Donnie Darko"" is about self-determination. On one hand, it offers hope that we do have control over our destinies and we are not just machines that God has set in motion to follow His plan. One the other hand, it offers the idea that by choosing his own immolation, Donnie will have made the world a better place.

Of course, Donnie did this because he believes it will save the life of his girlfriend.  In the end, even that is unknowable.  Does she simply die at the hands of her estranged father vice being run over?  Do enough of the memories from the alternate future remain to discredit the child molester/motivational speaker that Donnie unmasks?  In the end, this movie is disturbing in that it not only has characters that are extremely likable yet bizarrely antisocial but its lack of answers on really any issues other than the possibility of time travel and free choice.

Many of the reviewers have painted this as an anti-""It's a Wonderful Life"".  Frank the giant rabbit is organizing and directing Donnie's life.  Frank Capra the director and Frank the giant rabbit.  Yet, in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" it was possible to know the result of one's choices.  In ""Donnie Darko"", one does not even know if choice is a possibility until the very end. The final results of those choices remain unfathomable.

This is an excellent story and needs to be watched at least twice to get all the subtle points.  For example, who is the overweight Asian girl and why does she have a crush on Donnie?  While the main story comes together at the end with a revealing series of scenes, it is far better than a ""gimmick"" movie that is of no interest once the viewer learns the ""real"" secret.",1137456000,6,2341,4.660975609756098

Jesus Christ, anyone?  Whatever.  It still makes for a good story.  I would personally like to attribute this movie with the whole '80s is cool' thing.  Because in my mind it started with all the 'cool kids' and we all know they liked this movie.  The 80s sucked.  And they still do.  The music was terrible, the politics were even worse.

Nobody really understood what was going on, but something about the film grabbed them.  Now with this director's cut, audiences all over will finally understand what the hell the movie's about.

Donnie Darko is my son's favorite film. so, I bought it and watched it, last night, with my sweet hubby Norman. He hates ""horror"" movies, this is not a horror movie.

My son is dark, mysterious, obsessed with death and things that go bump in the night.. As I watched this DVD, I could see why my son loves it. He is a Marine, off in Iraq right now. Bless his heart. So, to feel close to him, I watched this and his other fav - ""Napoleon Dynamite."" That one is another story.

Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect for this roll. Couldn't have been done by anyone else. He had the looks down pat. the head down and look up, look. The innocent smile. The evil smile. The fear. The horny kid at the therapist.. He was made for this roll! He was excellent.

The girlfriend, also very good. As were the mom, dad, sisters. all good, but, could have been done by most anyone. I was pleasantly surprised to see Drew Barrymore, and Noah Willey as teachers. Oh, and the shrill-voiced prude teacher - perfect.

oh, geepers - the small, but important roll played by Patrick Swayze - that was something!

Our dear Donnie... every mother's fear, to have a troubled son like this. As a mommy, I could relate. You want so bad for your kids to be happy, well adjusted, and SANE. But, Donnie is not any of those. He is troubled. He has visions and sees his friend Frank. Frank is a wee bit creepy, but, not scary really. and, in the end, we know where Frank came from.

The most interesting and different ending ever. Not a cranked out ""Hollywood"" happy ending with all loose ends tied up. Nope. Sorry. You walk away with more questions. I like that.

My Norman was confused. Not me. I ""got it"" and got it all. Which is funny, because he's the PHD scientist. Some men, well, they think too hard. You know what I mean? When you watch this, just let it flow, like a river, you can't control it, just experience it.

So, allow me a toast to my son, in Iraq. ""I watched your favorite movie, dear, and loved it! stay safe. come home soon. love mom.""",1135814400,43,2042,4.296875

1671607,4,B00005V3Z4,"I have never been a huge fan of ""Donnie Darko"" as a science fiction story, which is how it was intended by writer/director Richard Kelly. The vague storytelling masks the gaps in logic and the budgetary constraints that did not allow them to show things more convincingly (also Kelly needed more experience before he tackled a project of this scope). However, fans have embraced this failing as the film's strength and have used the open-ended structure to mold the thing into something that fits their own individual agendas.

By now most everyone knows that early in the film the world diverges into a tangent universe, a situation that must be remedied in 28 days or the normal universe will end. Donnie has been selected by some undisclosed guardian to bring the tangent and primary universes back into alignment. He is given some superhuman powers for this task but only a few clues about what must be done. Searching for answers (mostly about time travel) during the day and performing sleepwalking pranks by night (an inefficient way to bring about certain vaguely tangential events), he semi-cluelessly moves forward toward the deadline. At last he figures out that he must send an ""artifact"" (a jet engine) back from the tangent universe to the normal universe. He seemingly knows that doing so will result in his death in the normal universe but he selflessly performs the task and restores things to a stable balance.

This is not as silly and contrived as it sounds but it does have some major issues that must be ignored if one is to really embrace the film. It also lacks useful philosophical depth and is just a teen movie with some intriguing thoughts about time travel.

But ""Donnie Darko"" becomes extraordinary when viewed instead as an allegorical story about free will versus destiny. It is basically a twisted remake of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", with Donnie a 1988 version of George Bailey and Frank his guardian angel. Instead of being given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had not been born, Donnie is given the chance to see how his continued existence would alter events. For George Bailey the experience was full of positive revelations, for Donnie it is the opposite.

To go with this unintended interpretation you just dismiss the whole thing about tangent universes. Instead Donnie dies at the beginning of the story by a random event (a jet engine falls off a plane passing over his house)over which he has no control. Since he is not essential to the event, he is given a chance to experience an additional 28 days of life to see the effects of his remaining alive and then choose between the two alternate futures. But he is also given the ability to actually see the force fields that draw everyone toward their destinies and finds himself powerless to resist such manipulation. Ultimately he makes his first ""free choice"" and elects his original death.

""Heathers"" was a major influence on Kelly and ""Donnie Darko"" has that same sedated tone, with characters generally under-reacting to absurdly extreme developments. As in that film parents are not the problem, rather it is kids being incredibly (but believably) cruel to each other.

The cast is solid although avoiding Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze is normally a good idea. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent and it is nice that his actual sister Maggie plays his film sister. Unfortunately both Maggie and Jena Malone are wasted in unchallenging roles with minimal screen time.

1671609,4,B00005V3Z4,"After watching `Donnie Darko' for the first time, I was entirely confused.  What were they talking about with time travel, tangent universes, and worm holes?  I have no interest in science fiction and couldn't begin to de-tangle the intricacies of this film's plot.  But guess what.  That didn't really matter.  I still really enjoyed `Donnie Darko.'  (Incidentally, the plot - at least the *probable* plot - has been explained to me since my first viewing ... kudos to anyone who figures out what's going on for her/himself).  Anyway - my point is - you don't have to know precisely *why* a plane's engine crashes through Donnie Darko's bedroom ceiling, and you don't have to know *why* that creepy, giant bunny is lurking around the corner to like this movie.

What is likeable about this movie?  To begin with, as almost every other reviewer has pointed out, Jake Gyllenhaal does a phenomenal job with the role of Darko.  His character is extremely intelligent, cynical, slightly demented and ultimately charismatic - he reminded me a lot of Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye - - which is actually an odd coincidence, considering that, in `The Good Girl,' Gyllenhaal plays a character who renames himself Holden and identifies with Salinger's protagonist.  Anyway - just a thought.  While almost all of the characters in the movie are likewise enjoyable and are brought to life by talented actresses/actors (Patrick Swayze as a motivational speaker/pervert? - well done!), I have to agree with another reviewer: Drew Barrymore is atrocious as a high school English teacher.  She is entirely unconvincing and reminds me of a female Keanu Reeves (at his worst).  Anyway ...

I also like this movie because, while I did not exactly ""get"" what was happening, it is never boring.  The plot is definitely unique, dark and subtly humorous.  The scene with Darko, his uptight Health teacher (I think she was a Health teacher) and a ""Life Line"" is hilarious.  Moreover, I think that, in general, the relationships in this film are treated in a very nuanced manner and with a great deal of tenderness.  Darko and his older sister (played by Gylenhaall's real-life sister Maggie) demonstrate an especially endearing - albeit playfully hostile - dynamic.

Lastly, I think one of the greatest aspects of this film is its soundtrack.  There are several great 80s songs - all very nostalgic, moody, brooding, and sexy.  They fit in perfectly.

I definitely recommend giving `Donnie Darko' a shot.  It's unique, it'll probably leave you thinking (at least: 'what just happened?!?') and I think most people will enjoy it.",1134691200,4,2616,4.988452655889145
1671610,2,B00005V3Z4,"When talk of a director's cut for one of my favorite movies in recent history was buzzing around, I admit that I was quite excited.  Especially by the prospect of seeing Donnie Darko in a theater.  However, the theatrical release of the director's cut was short lived and only found its way into certain (two, maybe?) cities.  So like most everyone else, I had to rent this version.

Be warned that this version is inferior to the original theatrical realease of Donnie Darko.  All of the fun of piecing the movie together thru repeated viewings and trips to donniedarko.com was sucked out of this release.  Some of the music was changed (some new pieces added, some old ones taken away), some pages from the Philosophy of Time Travel were added in at differnt points of the film (here is where the fun sucking started) and something happened to the sound mix.  The original version had an aura of mystique around it; hard to explain, but as you watched you found yourself entirely focused on the dialogue.  This is not the case anymore with the director's cut.  It sounds as if there is too much noise going on.

In any case, don't spend your money on this product.  I'd recommend picking up the original version, which is a five star film.  After a few viewings, head on over to the website and see what you can see.",1134604800,14,1318,4.538135593220339
1671611,3,B00005V3Z4,"I liked the movie--not sure why.  I thought Drew Barrymore once again proved herself third-rate as an actress.  But she is nothing to the movie, so I'll forgive it.  If you want to see a movie that excels at psychological obscurity/clarity, rent or buy Jacob's ladder--and PAY ATTENTION!  That movie  will blow you away if you give it a chance.  Obviously, I know there are huge differences between the two films, but they're not apples and oranges.  Jacob's Ladder has affected many directors and writers, and you will see what I mean once you watch it--it is as underrated as Donnie is overrated.  You'll thank me--promise!

The way the film is pieced together is not nearly as effective as the original, nor were the director's choices in terms of soundtrack. Please, if you are going to buy this film for a Donnie Darko fanatic, buy them the studio release instead.

1671613,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko can be viewed as a brilliant reinterpretation of Frank Capra's classic film: It's a Wonderful Life, since its basic theme appears to be the effect each of our lives has on society. In Donnie Darko a young and highly intelligent teenager has found a way to move forward in time so that he can experience his future and decide if he should take actions to change it... As Donnie projects himself toward a propitious date another young man of approximately college age is traveling backward through time to connect with the inquisitive Donnie; Frank (Capra:) having already experienced a pivotal event which involved Donnie's future contacts the teenager and begins to manipulate the sensitive young man in ways that appear designed to resolve issues from Frank's past. One of these is exposing the true nature of a public icon who may have molested Frank when he was a little child. Although the creators of Donnie Darko may have based their story on the theories of quantum physics they seem to have also included Newton's Third Law of Motion: for every action there is an opposite but equal reaction. Donnie and Frank's travel's through the fabric of existence causes a catastrophic rift in the energy surrounding them. It is at the point that their world seems to becoming apart that Donnie must make the same decision the protagonist in It's a Wonderful Life is faced with: would the world be better off with him alive or dead?

In addition to the complex and thought provoking plot, the actors play their parts very well on a stage of superbly crafted backdrops that serve to portray an idyllic suburban milieu that is perhaps only a veneer of normality. This is one of those rare films that seems to touch the universal consciousness...",1134086400,4,1753,4.823920265780731
1671614,3,B00005V3Z4,I have seen Donnie Darko many times and I love the movie.  The Director's Cut is a confusing rendition of the original that is devoid of most of the open interpretation the movie once had.  I will not watch this version again.,1133913600,14,226,4.357142857142857
1671615,5,B00005V3Z4,"The first time I saw Donnie Darko almost 3 years ago, I, like a lot of other people, understand very little about what I had just watched. However despite that fact, I was intrigued and extremely drawn to this movie, even though I didn't quite understand what had just happened. Upon multiple viewings of the movie I have more or less come to my own conclusion or meaning about the plot, which like everyone says, will give you something new every time you watch it. That's the beauty of this film, because no two people are going to come to the same conclusion on what the movie is about. With brilliant direction (kudos Richard Kelly), an excellent (an extremely underrated I might add) cast of characters, and a confusing, yet beautiful story, ""Donnie Darko"" is not just another cult film. This is a movie that is timeless.

There are very, very few movies that have been able to capture my attention the way Donnie Darko has, and even fewer have prompted me to view the movie multiple times to actually find more and more out about it. However Donnie Darko is one of those films that the first time through, you may not necessarily understand what is going on. To briefly summarize the plot, Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal who gives a phenominal performance) is teenager who has had frequent psychological problems in his life recently, and feels alienated from his family and friends. One night Donnie is awakened by Frank, a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit, who instructs Donnie to follow him. Donnie does, and this ends up saving Donnie's life as a jet engine crashes through his roof that night. Frank informs Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 Minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie then feels like he must obey Frank who makes him do many questionable things, because Frank saved his life. This includes flooding his local high school and burning down the house of a perverted self help guru. Not only that but it appears that Donnie is slipping in and out of multiple realities, leaving you wondering what are hallucinations, and what is really happening. This ultimately leads Donnie into the research of time travel and tangent universes, which becomes one of the most important aspects of the movie. That should give you a basic idea what the movie focuses around. While this might not sound like the most award winning premise, Kelly definitely turns this into one of the must see movies of our generation.

There are so many themes and underlying messages running throughout this film, and only upon multiple viewings will you truly discover them all. Like I said one of the best things about this film is that everyone is going to draw something different from it. However Kelly has deliberately made the Donnie character one that everyone can relate to. I can honestly say as a teenager I felt almost exactly like Donnie does in the film, and that makes relating to this movie on different levels so easy. There's also a sense that this alienated teenager is in the end the real hero, despite being looked down upon by his peers and his community. The love story between Donnie and Gretchen is exactly what you would expect it to be like between two teenagers who don't necessarily understand what they are feeling at the time. Part of the charm of this movie is its overwhelming honesty and portrayal of things as they are in real life, not glamoured up for hollywood.

Whatever Kelly's intention was when he wrote the movie (which to this day has never been clearly explained), he has made a movie that has touched and connected with a broad audience of people worldwide. It is safe to say that ""Donnie Darko"" isn't just a cult film now, it's a worldwide phenomenon. I promise you will never think about things the same way as you do after viewing this film. I strongly encourage you to see this movie. It is definitely something that will stand out from anything you've ever seen. I still don't feel like I have done this movie justice with my review, but I don't really think any review is capable of doing that. To put it simply, you must see this movie. ""And when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because I know I have so much to look forward to....""",1133740800,4,4205,4.604
1671616,5,B00005V3Z4,"Wow, 886 reviews on this film, now soon to be 887! The sheer volume of existing commentary on this totally original, cutting edge movie are impressive enough, but even more amazing is the degree of depth and insight put into many of these reviews. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that 'Donnie Darko' is not only a cult classic, but a major cinematic phenomenon that has attracted an immense following. Considering the content of this film you might even go so far as to say it has established a ""congregation"" of its own.

So sit down, relax, strap yourself into your favorite chair and say a quick prayer in preparation for a hallucinatory journey through the brilliant but borderline schizophrenic mind of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a troubled teenager dealing with a constantly shifting world of multiple dimensions.

Jake Gyllenhaal is magnificent as the disturbed Donnie Darko. The subtle but dramatic changes in personality, body movements, gestures, voice and physical appearance displayed during his mental transition from one state of reality to the next are done to perfection. Add to Jakes' nuanced performance the unnerving visual of a human-sized demonic entity dressed in a very bad rabbit suit and you have the makings of an experience unlike anything you've ever seen.

A word of warning is necessary. Beware of possible side-effects after viewing this film. It you start hearing a low, modulated voice speaking to you in the darkness of your room make sure to have some rabbit food handy. You never know?",1133740800,2,1560,4.992307692307692
1671617,5,B00005V3Z4,"The first time I saw this movie a few years ago, I really didn't like it. I was left extremely confused; I felt there wasn't a point to the movie and it went nowhere, throwing random scenes and characters in for no apparent reason.

I've watched it around 5 more times since then, including just last night, and have grown to love it. It is such an intriguing film - almost impossible to not be completely captivated by.

Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a disturbed teenager (I use the term ""disturbed"" very, very lightly) who seems to not fit in with society and begins to see a man in a bunny suit (""Frank"") who claims that the world will end in less than a month. Throughout the month, Frank tells Donnie to commit various acts such as flooding the school and burning down one man's house.

What makes this movie difficult to understand is that everything isn't explained completely. Even at the end of the movie, you're still left puzzled, but definately not as much as throughout. Donnie was supposed to die at the beginning of the movie because of a jet-engine crashing into his bedroom that appeared from a worm-hole from one month in the future. Frank's claim that ""the world will end in less than a month"" makes it Donnie's 'mission' to stop that from happening. By the end of the movie, despite Frank's efforts, Donnie goes back in time and changes the path Frank took him on during the month, inevitably 'saving the world', however not in the sense that the world will explode or something equally as ludicrous. It's more like he's saving society from their own ignorant destruction of life in general. As you watch the movie, you'll begin to see how foolish and close-minded Donnie's peers and school teachers are, as they value all the wrong things in life.

I still don't understand every detail from the movie, but watching it multiple times really does help. I wouldn't say I am drawn to movies about time travel, but I have always liked all the ""Back to the Future"" movies and used to watch ""Quantum Leap"" on TV a lot. I enjoy movies that have deeper meanings, symbolism, hidden themes, and in ""Donnie Darko""'s case, movies that don't waste my time with unncessary dialogue and action.

If you liked ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"" and/or are attracted to the sounds of this deep - albeit twisted - film surrounding time travel, I would highly recommend this movie.",1133568000,5,2390,4.640661938534279
1671618,5,B00005V3Z4,"First of all, buy this ORIGINAL 2001 release version DVD.  Forget the director's cut - it's okay, but not what you'd expect.  The director's cut suffers from what Jack White (of the seminal music band, ""The White Stripes"") meant when he said, ""Art is knowing WHEN to stop.""  The director's cut simply doesn't, and you'll see why too if (as I did) you make the mistake of shelling out the extra green to acquire it.  Take my advice:  Don't.

Stick with the original.  You won't be disappointed.

Okay, why do I call this bizarre, brilliant flick ""the story of my life.""  Well, because on October 20, 1988 (to be exact), I had an experience MUCH like Donnie's, REALLY and TRULY, only in my case I tried to commit suicide.  So when I saw ""Donnie Darko,"" my first reaction was, ""oh my god, HOW did the director know?"" (about my life at that precise moment in my, much like Donnie's, ""emotional problems""-riddled history?).  So ... overcoming the intial ""shock/epiphany"" of seeing my own life played back for me in panoramic technicolor, I curled up, frightened but fascinated, beneath a snuggle blanket and watched further, transfixed by one of the most subtly original, germane, cohesive stories to reach celluloid actualization since ""Dawn of the Dead"" or, much more recently, ""Identity"" (with John Cusack); and I quickly became, not only a believer in time travel, but a living survivor of it (UNLIKE Donnie, but forgive me for (possibly) giving away TOO much here).  This story HAS to be experienced; and perhaps YOU, Constant Viewer, like I do, remember where YOU were - and what YOU were doing/feeling/going through - way back in October of 1988.  Whatever it was, I bet it was something you'll never forget.

Like this film - you'll never forget it; and, lessee ... I'm on about my, er ... 12th or 13th viewing of it now (the ORIGINAL, NOT the director's ""clutter"").  I put ""Donnie Darko"" in my Top 5 movies of all time.  For originality, for story, for great, natural, completely successful ""suspension of disbelief"" acting; for being, at once - a tragicomedy, a WILDLY-WEIRD (this is the understatement of the new millennium) dramedy, a fired-up, mind-frying sci/fi thriller, a uniquely-tender-hearted horror yarn, and WAY beyond, My Friends:  ""Donnie"" is a philosophical brain burster much in the same neogenre/league-of-its-own film-making; for counterparts in creative ""playfulness"" behind the motion-picture camera, I can only recommend the following ""warmup"" exercises:  see ""Pi,"" ""Primer,"" ""Adaptation,"" ""Happiness,"" ""Prince of Darkness,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Martin"" (a little-remembered but unforgettable piece by George A. Romero, who has a brilliant little cameo in this pic as a ""happy marshmallow man-child"" of a Catholic priest).  You'll get the idea FAST, of what you're in for with Donnie.

An all-star cast will blow you away and lends immense credulity to this quirkified, whacked-out, indie knockout punch; you'll be reeling when you see here:  Mary McDonnell, Noah Wiley, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore!  Watching Drew play the part of a high-school English teacher is definitely worth ""the price of emotion"" enough (interestingly, if NOT for Barrymore's bankroll (she's the executive producer of Darko's ""reel world,"" in REAL life); fact: ""Darko"" probably never would have lit up our darkened screens at all, without Barrymore's vision and deep enough pockets to realize such - Thank You, Thank You, Thank You, Drew!).  And getting Swayze to play the role of a pedophile HAD to have been a ""challenge,"" er ... to say the LEAST!  Swayze HAD to have been ""a total sport"" about what he was asked to portray; like the way John Malkovich was concerning HIS OWN ""journey through the looking portal.""

But enough said.  Darken your own personal viewing room now.  Slide ""Donnie"" into your DVD player.  And ""take the trip,"" safely and securely (yet be warned - your MIND and SPIRIT may NEVER be the same afterwards), as I have, and am living proof of, the reality, horror, and (as Kelly intended, and successfully realized), the HEALING benefits, not unlike ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but only MUCH DARKER implications of, ""time travel.""  Hurry though.  As Kelly remonstrates cinematically, ""time is precious.""  Indeed.  And, Frankly speaking (pun intended), time's running out.",1133481600,5,4300,5.089871611982882
1671619,5,B00005V3Z4,"Sure Donnie Darko is a mind bending movie of so many mixed messages, even with multiple viewings you still may not ""get"" it all, but thats what makes the film so masterful. Each time I watch it, I find even more brilliance in it, more to ponder, more to discuss. So, with that said, how do I review the screen's most complex and disturbing look inside the mind of a borderline schizo teen who is at the crux of possible worldwide destruction described by the poster bunny for rabbit population control while Donnie is on a discovery path to himself?

Well, I could start with the fact that so much more lies within the coal plated exterior edges of this true horriffic masterpiece than first meets the eye.

I could focus on the few comedic elements that lie on the outskirts of some of the most dramatically striking scenes ever devised in any movie, let alone one of an outsider teen on the brink of seeming madness, but really more sane and smart than most.

I could comment on the almost cardboard cutout representations of 80's suburbanite caramel coated goodness that Donnie is so far removed from and how that difference brilliantly skywrites the message of ""just because I am different doesn't mean I am crazy, you're all the nutso ones!""

Or I simply could leave you to your own conclusions. I think I will just do the latter....",1133481600,,1338,4.585774058577406
1671620,5,B00005V3Z4,"Possibly the finest debut film by a new comer ever. Richard Kelly delivers a brilliant film about a troubled teeneager named Donnie Darko.

Donnie Darko is a trouble maker who has problems at school, home, and his emotional problems. In the beggining of the director's cut we find donnie lying in the middle of a road with his bycicle laying right next to him, we then see our first look at donnie, but he doesn't get freaked out about where he is, he just simply smirks like it never happpened. We then get an idea of what sort of person Donnie is. In the original version, as he is riding his bike back home we hear a song by echo and the bunny men titled 'Killing Moon'; instead we hear 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS. I'm not necesarilly reviewing the DVD yet but just telling you some of the stuff they took out and some of the stuff they put in, so moving on, we get extra classroom scenes where donnie is reading poetry and the classroom getting new books due to the banning of a book by graham greene containing a short storie about boys who wage destruction on an old man's house.

In this director's cut, we also get small little things that make the movie more appealing, for example, when donnie is dreaming or waking up to find frank (the rabbit), we see a sweet visual of donnie's one eye with reflections and info on his eye, it's hard to explain, but I won't ruin anything else for you so I'll shut up about the extra footage onthe director's cut.

Now the review:

I've seen the original, so I reccomend you rent the original theatrical release version first to decide which one is worth more for your purchase. This film is about a troubled but brilliant young man named donnie darko. He is a trouble maker who has to see a psychiatrist due to recent brushes with destruction and various problems to why he does them. He is also a victim of a sleep walking problem to where he goes missing every now and then. One night he is told to wake up by mysterious voice, he then obeys the voice and follows it to where he tells him to go, he eventually ends up at a golf course where a giant bunny rabbit informs him that the world will end in the period of 28:06:42:12.

While donnie is at the course his troubles begin to thicken when a jet engine lands in his bedroom, no one knows why or where it came from. Donnie then begins to start obeying what frank tells him to do, because he saved his life. So then the movie really starts to kick off when donnie starts finding out about the mysteries of time travel, frank, and if the world will really end in 28 days.

The acting in this movie is surprisingly good, and has a brilliant cast of actors and actresses to pull off the brilliant characters of Richard Kelly's script. The directing and cinematography is awe inspiring with great directing and visuals.

And as for the soundtrack, the music is mezmirising and absolutely brilliant, music and original score. So to sum it all up, I Highly reccomend this extraordinary piece of film to anyone who knows and enjoys good cinema. Enjoy.",1133308800,,3048,4.3936170212765955
1671621,4,B00005V3Z4,"This is one of those movies that seems to come out with little fanfare or success and, after a while, the volume of the buzz rises until it becomes a ""cult"" film.

First of all, this really is an original film.  That's a plus in my book.  Nowadays originality is very scarce in Hollywood.

Secondly, this movie is seriously (and consciously) weird.  That's not necessarily good or bad, but it definitely helps with the cult status.

Without retelling the story, I'd just say that it was generally satisfying.  It's hard to catagorize, but, as the name implies, it's a sort of modern film noir - with a little science fiction & horror mixed in.  It was very unpredictable, but things came together at the end - sort of.

There are a few flaws.  I was mystified that Drew Barrymore was so badly miscast for the part of an intellectual teacher until I saw that she was an ""executive producer.""  Money talks.

Another problem, common among ambitious, unusual films, is that the part of the movie that takes place in the ""normal"" world wasn't very believable.  The dialog, especially between family members, didn't seem realistic.  Nobody seems to mind or hardly notice that Donnie is tremendously strange - he has lots of pals and gets a girlfriend without hardly trying.  Donnie and his buddies go to what appears to be a privileged private school, but, then, it doesn't.  The school bullies seem waaay over-the-top, especially considering the well-to-do suburban environment.  I could go on...

But, despite the flaws, this movie keeps you interested.  While the viewer is at first presented with the old question of how much of what happens in the film is real or just in the protagonist's mind, it goes well beyond that before it's done.  The ending, where the loose ends are tied up (or are they?) - accompanied by the perfect song - is particularly well done.",1132531200,5,1861,4.738317757009346

If you are offended by vulgar language, do not watch this movie, as it has a lot of it, which seemed quite unnecessary to tell the story. But if you can get past that fact and the fact that this movie may well leave you feeling like your life is meaningless, by all means go ahead. It is essentially a sci-fi tale about time travel, but it takes a while before the viewer can actually figure that out.

Secondly, they added the ""scene titles"" which literally try to explain what's going on so you don't have to use your brain.

The subplots are intoxicating and the overall feel of the film is that of paranoia, but it works wonderfully.  As you watch you never know what to expect, you never know whats going to happen, to whome it will happen and when it's going to take place.  The charactors are all played very well from the sister (real life sister Maggie) girlfriend (Malone) and even the [...] town hero (Swayze)...The story of time travel and predestination flow so well here that your almost lost as to what your really believing is real until the final moments of the film.  Everyone here does an amazing job, but the real star here is the script which is so involving and masterfully written that your drawn into the film after the first frame, involving Donnie lying in the middle of the road upon daybreak, and you won't lose interest until half way through the credits, and even then, the soundtrack is pretty good.  This movie is great and recomended to anyone who wants a good mind bending drama.",1127779200,3,1191,4.734299516908212

If you like to watch Jay Gylenthall play the pathetic self loathing egotistical adolescent you should also check out ""The Good Girl"" with Jennifer Anniston

It is very easy to see why this movie is popular among 15-25 year old white middle class suburban males who feel they are mentally unsuitable to live in this world yet believe they are intellectually gifted and ""special"".  This is an embarrassingly pretentious and corny film written by an egotistic and socially awkward adolescent that feels that he didn't ""fit in"" in highschool and probably scored high on the AP English exam.  On the plus side it is weird and original.  The best part about the new release of this DVD is the audio commentary track with Richard Kelley (director/writer) and Kevin Smith.  It is amusing to listen to Smith mockingly patronize the ""genius"" of Kelley and at the same time probably wondering how such a crappy film became so much more popular than all of his own films.",1127692800,10,1079,4.712765957446808

""Donnie Darko"" reflects profoundly on the state of our mainstream suburban culture in America. I might even go so far as to say that it is a companion piece to ""American Beauty"" as well as ""Fight Club"".

This movie is definitely a candidate for multiple viewings, as there is much to be discovered after the first view. The website also tells a lot about the underlying metaphysics of the story created by Richard Kelly, but I would argue that you ought to form your own interpretation and talk to others about theirs rather than accept some silly SF BS.",1127606400,3,723,4.640625
1671633,5,B00005V3Z4,"... it keeps going and going. Donnie Darko is one of those films that, even with a re-release, never really got out of its cult status because most people are too afraid to think. I'll get more on that later.

The main character in the movie, Donnie, is obviously borderline schizo. Or so it seems. But I won't spoil anything for you. Basically, he sees a vision of an oversized bunny which prophesizes that the world will end in a little under a month. Donnie gets to experience everything he's ever wanted to do during this time and still has some left to save the world.

As simple as that synopsis may sound, it can't do the film justice. There are plenty, and I mean PLENTY, of subplots that are pretty interesting. The characters are also worth a look because, although not every one of them experiences growth, the majority of them who do grows in an odd yet interesting way.

The direction and cinematography are pretty good, even if they do hint at past movies like E.T. and Silence of the Lambs. The effects are excellent for an independent film, and the simplistic, ambient score matches nicely with the movie's atmosphere.

The plot might be the determining factor whether this film appeals to you or not. As you may have heard, the whole film, beginning, middle, and ending, are open to discussion. Although Kelly did a good job of handing us the appetizer and main course of the meal, the bastard kept the dessert. But I think this helps with the longevity of the movie; it's easily one that begs to be talked about, scrutinized, and criticized.

Another determing factor might be its subtle preaching. One might not catch on to it early on but as the film progresses, it becomes more evident. Sometimes I think that the movie tries to address too many things at once, resulting in a, if you will, mental overload. But again, this can be cured with repeat viewings.

I hope Kelly didn't run out of ideas after this film. I truly believe that this movie is his welcome call to the artform, both scriptwise and direction-wise. This work is among my all-time favorites not because of what it is but what it tries to be, and that beats the many offerings Hollywood has given us recently, which never tries to be anything even though they can be something.

EDITED TO ADD: Director's Cut (Rating = 4 stars, since I can't place two reviews here.)

I've recently watched the two versions back to back and decided to compare the two.

Pros:
- The addition of a few pages of The Philosophy of Time Travel into the movie makes the plot easier to comprehend for first-time viewers.
- Almost all of the deleted scenes are placed back into the movie. As a result, it feels more complete and in some instances, adds more poignancy to the film, the best of which shows Donnie's relationship with the rest of his family.
- Some of the special and sound effects have been revamped, all for the better.

Cons:
- For someone who has seen the original version and have discussed it at length with others, the Director's Cut almost feels like it dumbs down the complexity of the former. I for one recommend seeing the first before the Cut. Formulate and research your theory first before Kelly does it for you =)
- I have a big, if not HUGE, problem with the changes in music. Echo & the Bunnymen's ""The Killing Moon"" is replace by INXS' ""Never Tear Us Apart"" during the beginning of the movie. While the latter is a good song itself, ""The Killing Moon"" was such an integral part of original version. It's instead relocated to a another scene where one needs to listen carefully in order to hear it. Some of the score have also been altered or moved around.

It's an all-around nice version of the film though. There are a few good things added or changed, but there are also bad. This altered version doesn't take away the major aspects that made the original version/story/whatever good though. Again, here's to hoping that Kelly will eventually squeeze more genre-bending, mind-blowing, odd spectacles in his career.",1127520000,4,4012,4.605042016806722

1671635,5,B00005V3Z4,"Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as delusional high school student Donnie Darko in talented director Richard Kelly's thought provoking and stunningly creative award winning flick, which he also wrote.

Donnie apparently a borderline schizophrenic who suffers from somnabulism has been having visions of a huge evil looking rabbit who has portended the end of the world in 28 days.  During a dream the rabbit named Frank summoned Donnie from his bed.  In a fortuitous twist of fate, inexplicably a jet engine crashes through the Darko house, specifically into Donnie's room.  Had he been there he surely would have perished.

This incident set off more frequent delusions where Frank coaxed Donnie into destructive and bizarre acts.  Psychotherapy conducted by a concerned Dr. Thurman played by Katharine Ross was having little beneficial effect.  Donnie began becoming increasingly seduced by the concept of time travel somewhat fueled by science teacher Professor Monnitoff played by Noah Wylie.  Wylie introduced him to a revolutionary book on the subject penned by an aged and haggard local woman known as Grandma Death played eerily by Patience Cleveland.

While this was happening Donnie became enamored with a high school girl Gretchen played by Jena Malone, whose influence would shape Donnie's future.

Kelly concludes this extremely unique flick in terrific fashion, requiring rumination in it's interpretation.

The musical score was haunting and enhanced the tenor of the flick especially in conjunction with the dream sequences.  The songs used throughout the film were also tastefully selected.  The acting requiring players to portray some very curious characters was very nicely done.  Kudos in particular should be given to Patrick Swayze as spiritualist Jim Cunningham and Beth Grant playing animated and motivated gym teacher Kitty Farmer.",1126742400,2,1855,5.508833922261484
1671636,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is indeed one amazing film. It's unclassifiable as a genre but it still manages to confuse you, make you laugh and think. It's not an easy movie to fully comprehend from one viewing alone -that's why i bought the director's cut. The film's audio and image are top-notch quality, and i like the little changes that have been made on both by director Richard Kelly. The second DVD (Extras) is completely unnecessary in my opinion as it doesn't add anything to the movie or help you understand the plot any better. The commentary by Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma etc.) is informative and entertaining -I just wish Kevin would talk less, it kind of feels like he's always on the edge trying to give his input. Nevertheless it is a reccommended buying, go for this if you buy it first time, for those who own the original 2001 DVD edition it's still worth buying for the aforementioned audio/video improvements.",1126569600,,947,4.745454545454545

It's one of those rare movies you can watch over and over again and find new things in it. A really well written and creative script teams with a great cast with wonderful performances. For me, it's a great movie. For others, just a weird experiment. But it's up to you, watch it and make your own conclussions.",1126051200,,514,3.951923076923077
1671639,5,B00005V3Z4,"The first time I saw this movie was at a friends house, and I tried to sleep through it since I didn't get much sleep the night before.  I couldn't get to sleep though - mostly because the TV was so loud - but also, I thought the movie was fairly interesting.

When I saw this movie available EVERYWHERE in London I couldn't resist buying it, and I got it for a slim price.  (I lucked out because everything else there is expensive as heck.)  I was disappointed to see that it wouldn't play on my Playstation 2 since it was a UK disc.  Fortunately, after some slight modifications, I could still watch it on the DVD player I had on my computer.

The first thing I noticed was that this movie had a lot more cussing in it than I remember.  I also noticed that it didn't show my favorite character Frank all that much.  Still, I think this movie is a great thing to see.  It's about a kid in high school with severe mental problems, so it's not very unusual.  This kid's name is Donnie Darko.

Donnie has hallucinations and personality disorders and darn near every mental disorder a person can have.  He goes to a shrink and takes lots of meds.  Does this help?  Of course not, why would anyone expect it to?  I'm sure it costs the parents a lot of money, but they seem more concerned for their wacko son than for saving up some dough.

Well, Donnie has this imaginary friend named Frank that tells him when the world is going to end; 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds.  Frank isn't a a Kool-Aid drinker though, he's just a guy in a bunny rabbit skull costume that looks really boss and evil.

So Donnie goes through school and cusses out teachers and picks up this gothic-type chick.  Naturally he doesn't get expelled or anything.  Under the influence of Frank, Donnie develops an interest in time travel and studies it.  His main book of reference is written by a weird old lady who does nothing but check a mailbox all day.  She must have been looking for a check or something.

In a short subplot, Donnie burns down the home of a child pornography peddler.  This happens right after my favorite scene in the movie where Frank takes off his mask.  The Frank unmasking scene is spooky, with really dark classical music playing in the background.  I love it.  Frank turns out to be pretty darn ugly.

The film has an excellent soundtrack including one of my favorite songs, ""Head Over Heels.""  The cinematography can't be any better.  It's very dark throughout but not so dark that you can't see.  Even when it's bright daylight outside, the movie manages to keep its dark feeling.

The movie is kind of written like a Star Trek episode with all of the time traveling business.  I'm not sure if it's 100% consistent, but with a vague and complicated subject like time travel, you can get away with inconsistency, since time travel is so darn neat.

If you're into weird stuff, you need to see this movie.  It's got a lot of imagination put into it, and I think everybody can appreciate that.",1125619200,3,2999,4.420475319926874

For a movie that cries out for in-depth analysis by its visionary creator, the choice to have writer/director Richard Kelly be ""helped"" in his commentary by friend Kevin Smith is epically misguided.  Self-centered Smith just won't shut up about his own movies, Mallrats, Dogma, and Clerks.  Some may say these are fine movies,  but I for one have no interest in how any scene in Donnie Darko is ""just like what I did in MY movie, Mallrats.""  Kevin Smith, your movies aren't even in the same league.  Richard Kelly can't seem to get a word in edgewise, and the result is an annoying and frustratingly unenlightening commentary.

1671650,5,B00005V3Z4,"Funny, sad, and mind-blowing, 'Donnie Darko' is, quite simply, an excellent movie. The plot is complex and engaging, with Jake Gyllenhaal as the protagonist, followed up by a cast that doesn't leave Jake holding up the movie.

  Depending on what version of the film you see, the plot can be simple, or very hard to understand.  I saw the original version on television and it was easy to comprehend.  However, I had a lot of questions about little plot strings that weren't tied up.  Just the other day I saw the director's cut. I spent the rest of the night explaining things to the people who watched it with me while simultaneously figuring it out myself.

  But, let me explain first. In the original version of the movie the plot line goes like this. Donnie Darko is introduced as the protagonist.  He smokes, sees a therapist, and is rude to his parents.  Then comes the fateful night of October 2nd.

  Donnie is asleep when he hears a voice that tells him to follow it. Donnie gets up and walks out of the house and onto a golf course where a human sized, demented bunny rabbit called Frank tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. At the same time as this encounter a jet engine falls through Donnie's room, which would have crushed him had he not gone out to the golf course. For the next 28 days Donnie goes on certain missions by the bidding of Frank, gets a girlfriend, and finds out about time travel.  I won't tell the ending for the sake of preserving it.

  In the director's cut there are a few differences.  The beginning is the same. However, this time the end of the world mentioned by Frank really comes into play.  It is explained (and this is explained only in the director's cut) that Donnie is in a tangent universe separate from the primary universe, and it will collapse after a few weeks, creating a black hole in the primary universe destroying all of existence.

  Donnie goes through the same adventures with a few differences here and there from the original version with the same ending result, only it is much clearer why he does what he does.

  I highly recommend this movie to those intelects who like to think about the plot, and to those who like dark comedy, and also to anyone and everyone, for this is truly not a film to be missed.",1124064000,84,2309,4.451073985680191

It is worth its fans though it is a very good and fascinating film with truly, as they say behind the scenes, a universal meaning. The whole plot though is something so amazing but mind- boggling that you just feel you need to talk to your friends or your parents about it right away after you watch it. This movie raised so many questions honestly and probably made a lot of people expand their thoughts just a little more for a little while about possibility and how limitless it truly is.
Why this movie is not five stars readers may wonder? The ending itself, though understandable and satisfying, may not be easily understood the first time you watch it. I know it didn't for me. I was a bit confused the first time I watched the ending, so it was lucky for me that I waited until it came out on DVD so I could go back to the ending once or twice and put the pieces together more slowly. Yet it only takes once or twice glance at the ending again to get it. The point is though the ending isn't exactly a sure thing for most when they watch it for the first time, so I guess that is why they lose one star. After looking back once or twice though in the last few moments of the film, it all eventually comes together into again like I said a satisfying and good ending.
Overall I liked this movie a lot, and I do think this year it is one of the best films I have seen. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I'm just terribly afraid of rabbits now... I don't want to explain too much of the film because it is just so exciting and also creepy, so I'll just leave you with an exciting mystery.

Have you ever slept in your bed when suddenly an engine from an airplane crashes through the roof? Have you been inclined to time travel, or to talk through things with some rabbit? Like James Stewart. Have you been frustrated in school, or with how things work out in general? The portrait Jake Gyllenhaal does here is extremely suited for the plot, exact and without ever over-playing his character. He becomes Donnie Darko. Mary McDonnell does the mother, as usual she's very reflective and precise as an actress. She's a success in her troublesome role. Many other roles are equally fascinating - Drew Barrymore, among others. Every character in this movie has something amazing going for them, and they certainly melt together beautifully in the overall context.

With Jimmy Stewart we have an angel helping him see what his community would have been like without him and this convinces him that it is a wonderful life thus saving him from suicide. With Donnie Darko we have the opposite scenario. Donnie uses quantum physics through the aid of his science teacher and a street wandering centenarian who has written the book on time travel. This enables him to see why everyone will be better off without him and he saves them from himself by using the portal to wipe away his life and the subsequent destruction it causes. The special effects and relationships are certainly different. The family argument at the dinner table is different. But especially different is the moral implication that life for everyone else would be better without Donnie. What a paradigm shift this is.

If you're buying the director's cut, then you've probably already seen this movie about 28 times. If you haven't, let me fill you in.

In 1988 suburban Middlesex, Donnie Darko lives with his loving family in an ordinary life. But one night he sleepwalks towards Frank where he recieves information about the world's end, and in the process dodges death when a jet engine falls on his room (you heard me right-a jet engine). Because Frank saved his life, Donnie now must do what Frank tells him to do. Given this time until the world ends, Donnie tries to make sense of what has happened to him, as well as connect with his family, fall for a girl, and question the search for God, and in the process discovers that he should've died when the jet engine fell on his room.

The main reason why Donnie Darko is already a cult classic at age 4 is because it doesn't clearly offer a solution, leaving the viewer in the dark as to figure out the pretzel-like remains. But that's also why people love it. I honestly loved it because it unknowlingly re-examins what it means to live; If the world were to really end in 28 days, what would YOU do?

With an impressive cast (Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze have supporting roles), lots of satirical humor, and many questions to ask, Donnie Darko remains a wonderful movie that dares to be original and will leave you thinking and wondering long after the credits end.

But the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is for the director's cut and the special features. In the Director's Cut Edition, the movie is clogged with excerps from 'The Philosophy of Time Travel', a fictional book prominatly featured in the film. It didn't even really achieve what it meant to-offer a clearer answer to the film's twisty plot. They belong in the special features department, like the original DVD did. And the sound and visual affects added in completly ruin it, such as the sci-fi like sound affects in the opening credits-they were NOT needed and were better without it; It seemed like Richard Kelly took too many notes from 'E.T.' while cutting the film. And the topper comes at the montage/letter to Roberta Sparrow, a powerful intro to the famously poignant 'Mad World' sequence. The director decided to add of all things FIREWORKS. WHY FIREWORKS? They are a total distraction to the beautiful montage and are not needed at all.

The special features are another story (actually, the same). The original DVD had an insightful commentary by star Jake Gyllenhaal and writer/director Richard Kelly (the much cluttered remaining cast and crew commentary could've been skipped), while this one features Richard Kelly and his friend Kevin Smith. This commentary doesn't say much about the actual movie, but rather sounds more like a conversation between two buddies over coffee and cigarettes. Vastly un-needed is the documentary about British people who loved the movie, as well as the short movie about the #1 Donnie Darko fan-it's more sad and disturbing (in the fact that someone actually loves any movie THAT MUCH) than funny. The least boring is the production diary with commentary by the cinematographer.

If you haven't seen this movie, I strongly advise you to rent the regular DVD, form an opinion, then, if and only if you really loved the original movie, shimmy on down to the video rental store (or wait a day for your Netflix DVD to come in the mail) and watch this. While it isn't entirely a must-skip, only huge followers of the original will truly appreciate this.",1123113600,7,3701,4.755451713395638
1671659,4,B00005V3Z4,"I finally checked this movie out, after hearing all the hype that's it's one of the best quirky off-beat movies of the decade.  It's hard to categorize this movie.  Sci-fi?  Teen angst/coming of age?  Horror?  It has elements of everything, and there's nothing to compare it to.

I'm not going to detail the plot, because that's been taken care of in the description and in many other reviews.  It's not an easy plot to follow, and the end is confusing.  I highly recommend that you watch this movie more than once, because it makes a lot more sense on repeated viewings.  If you really want to get into what the movie is about, check out the kind-of-cryptic website at donniedarko.com, which has a lot of background info.  In order to get into the time travel/parallel universe, you need to read some of the documents on the website.  You aren't going to figure it out just from watching the movie.  I also suggest doing a google search and seeking out some of the better fan sites, which have explanations of the different universes and how the plot works.

Jake Gyllenhall delivers an outstanding performance in this movie.  His character is off-beat, brilliant, disturbed, and handsome.  He's an outcast at school, but so funny that he gains respect of his peers when he has intelligent outbursts railing against the hypocrisy of education.  Another not-to-miss performance is Patrick Swayze as an annoying self-love self-help guru worshipped by the teachers at Donnie's school.

Watch this movie once to see what it is all about, and if you are at all intrigued, get ready for some repeated viewings and some research into the backstory.",1122422400,4,1642,4.827956989247312

This commentary is like that too, but Kevin Smith makes it MUCH less pretentious and clinical, much more organic. Aside from the commentary, the UK documentary and the #1 fan documentary are really interesting, the production diary less so.

So, i view this set as all bonus features to be enjoyed by fans. The actual director's cut version of the movie, i dunno. The original is one of the best movies made.

1671682,2,B00005V3Z4,"I saw Donnie Darko about a year after it came out.  I had heard people talking about it for several months, the name more than anything, so finally watched it.  It is a truely amazing film, somewhere between sci-fi and fantasy, but not so much as to put off someone who is not a fan of these generas.  So naturally when the director's cut came out i was very excited.  It's well known how big studios have a way of destroying the vision of artists by changing storylines around and elimnating unnessary things like a ""complex plot"" and ""character development"" in order to make movies more marketable.  Many director's cuts have been released after the theatrical versions and have shown the vision of the director, the artist, to be superior to that of the studio exec, the businessman.  Examples include Gilliam's Brazil, Scott's Blade Runner, Beson's The Professional, and of course, Jackson's Lord of the Rings, though i think many of the edits in the theartrical version had more to do with time constraints than content.  This, however, is not one of those instances.  Kelly changes songs in the movie, altering the mood, and not for the better.  He cut a few scenes down; one in particular is the confrontation between Drew Barrymore and the principal of the school, the cut actually stunted the character development of the principal.  Many of the scenes that where added where unnessary (most can be found in the deleted scenes section of the special features menu on the original DVD) and didn't push the film forward, and some just gave the film a repetitous feeling.  One scene is between Donnie and his father; Donnie says that people think he's crazy, and his dad says ""you're not crazy; i used to be crazy, but you're not crazy.""  Nothing more is said about this.  Kelly opens up a whole new dimension to the character of the father and then just leaves it.  It also raises further questions about if Donnie is privy to some alternate reality or if he's just suffering from some mental disorder that his father used to have.  The original didn't even raise this point leaving more up to the imagination.  He also added in graphically some radomly generated series of numbers and rotating pictures during Donnie's flashbacks which made it seem much more sci-fi than the original, which contained none of this.  One of the things that i liked so much about the original is that the story was very sci-fi, but the film itself didn't have any of the visual elements typical of sci-fi, thus making the film more enigmatic and harder to catagorize.

Basically, if you're hoping for another film that proves that the artist knows better, this isn't it.  The director's cut is less even and the mood is changed dramatically, and all of this done without adding much of anything to the story.  Buy the original, it's definetly worth the money, but rent this edition before you decide whether to spend the money on it.",1120780800,16,2922,4.725838264299803
1671683,5,B00005V3Z4,"Over the last two years, a handful of various friends have been urging me to see Donnie Darko. I asked them what it was about and they said, ""It's about this guy who sees a demon bunny.""

WRONG!

It's about so much more. Mental psychosis, time travel, and yes, a demon bunny. But mainly, the story deals with a teen who seems to remind you of a certain Holden Caufield - strange considering Jake Gyllenhaal and lookalike Tobey McGuire both mention Caufield in two films they were in - The Good Girl(Gyllenhaal) and Pleasantville (McGuire).

Donnie, the name of the character played by Jake G, is being stalked by a human-sized demonic bunny that tells him to do things. Donnie makes himself listen because the bunny, named Frank, saved his life from a plane engine that crashes into his room. But Frank wants Donnie to do more things, seemingly evil things.....

Okay, now that we've officially got the originality factor into play, let me just say that this screenplay, the acting and the mood compel you to watch more. I went from laying on the ground as I watched this film to sitting up on my dumpa at the end, bracing for what might happen next (well, not bracing, but close).

The musical score is amazingly fitting, and the acting - even from Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, is first rate. This is a film that will make just about anyone keep sitting and watching.

Warnings to those who care - LOTS of profanities in the beginning of the film. Not much violence throughout. A few sexual references while Donnie's in psycho therapy, and no nude scenes but there is one sexual scene that lasts maybe ten seconds but involves kissing on a bed - nothing more.

I've seen Bully, At Close Range and War of The Worlds in the last three days and this was hands down better than all of them.

One last parting shot - if you don't pay attention all the way through, you'll miss out. Yeah, it's one of those films. So don't watch this with a room full of your A.D.D. pals. And if you're one of those A.D.D. pals, good luck, man! You gonna need it!",1120176000,6,2047,4.46916890080429
1671684,5,B00005V3Z4,"I had not actually really heard about this movie and knew just a little about the plot, but I still decided to buy it. And, wow, that was a good choice. This is the most original movie EVER!! It has lots of dark humor (absolutely hilarious moments), drama, science-fiction, and horror. So, it basically just mixes every genre possible in a blender to make a highly orignal and awesome movie that will make you think a lot.
The movie also has great acting, notably by Jake Gylenhaal as Donnie and his dad was great also. Jena Malone also does a great job as Donnie's cute and sweet girlfriend. The movie also has stars Patrick Swayze (he was hilarious and great) and Drew Barrymore. The movie is about Donnie Darko, a troubled youngster who goes to a psychiatrist. He is visited by his imaginary rabbit reptilian, human sized friend called Frank. He talks to him, telling him to do things and about what will happen in the future. One very strange but amazing moment comes when the engine of a plane lands in Donnie's room. Donnie is bothered by some bullies at school and is very open to tell everyone what's on his mind (his teacher and a public speaker). But, Frank tells him to do bad things, which I won't give away but the greatest mystery is when Frank tells Donnie when the world is going to end. The voice of Frank is powerful and absolutely brilliant, but the actor that carries the movie is Jake Gylenhaal. His emotions, expressions, movemets, and powerful sentences are brilliant. Everything in this movie is brilliant and the ending still has me confused and shocked. That's why this is like Memento a movie that you need to rewatch. This movie is so original that you just have to be amazed and absolutely love it. This one will make you think and think over and over. And lastly, another compelling aspect of this movie is the awesome 80s pop music. It's fantastic and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. Believe me, this one's awesome and a must see.",1119744000,2,1972,4.542134831460674
1671685,5,B00005V3Z4,"I actually bought the Donnie Darko DVD for five dollars. It caught my eye because of the cast. The cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze, and Drew Barrymore who also produced the film.

This film is a psychological thriller. It is about a high school student (Gyllenhaal) who is very delusional. He has a strong opinion about society and isn't afraid to share it. Through out the movie he sees a psychiatrist who tries to help him with his oddness and attitude towards life.

Later Gyllenhaal is visited by a demonic rabbit, is it a real, is it a dream or is it just a message from the future? This demonic rabbit appears every now and then and influences Gyllenhaal's actions. His conference with the rabbit makes him become interested in time travel.

Towards the end of the movie the truth of certain individuals come about and the solution to the demonic rabbit is revealed.

I enjoyed this movie because it challenges the viewers mind. It bottles you up until the end in which you are ready to have an understanding of the movie.",1118793600,,1066,4.654255319148936
1671686,5,B00005V3Z4,"Even though I usually only write music reviews on amazon.com, I just felt obligated to say how awesome this movie is.  The acting is superb all around, as is the dialogue, which turns what could have been an over-the-top and ridiculous premise into something believable and somehow strangely familiar.  Set in the fictitious late 1980's suburbia of Middlesex, this film at once stuns you with its accurate portrayal of family and social life in such a locale, and it extends itself beyond the cliched boundaries of typical suburban teen dramadies (for example, Donnie's father is not a complete jerk).  This movie combines elements of science fiction, horror, drama, tragedy, suspense, and even comedy into one eclectic yet effective amalgam that grips you from beginning to end.  Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly believable as Donnie, a teen suffering from what seem to either be psychotic hallucinations or ominous visions of a six foot tall rabbit named Frank, who upon their first encounter informs him that the world will end in ""28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds"".  This meeting occurs late one night, when in some sadistically sardonic twist of fate, a jet engine plummets from the sky and lands right on Donnie's room.  Fortunately, he is not there at the time because Frank has drawn him outside, and thus ""saved"" him from what was sure to be an extremely unpleasant demise.  Because of this fact, Donnie feels indebted to his new ""friend,"" and follows any instructions Frank gives him.  This leads to no small amount of trouble in Middlesex, as Donnie becomes increasingly reckless and unstable, much to the dismay of his parents (skillfully played by Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne) and especially his gym teacher Mrs. Farmer, played with an effective amount of self-righteousness and obliviousness by Beth Grant.  The rest of the cast is spectacular as well, especially Noah Wyle as the cautiously helpful Prof. Monnitoff, Drew Barrymore as Donnie's sympathetic English teacher Mrs. Pomeroy, Katharine Ross as Donnie's caring psychiatrist Dr. Thurman, Patrick Swayze as oblivious self-help guru Jim Cunningham, and most of all Jena Malone as Donnie's troubled girlfriend Gretchen Ross, who becomes one of the only things keeping Donnie going.  As the movie progresses, Donnie begins to feel more and more isolated, his only sources of solace being Gretchen and a book given to him by Monnitoff called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" written by Roberta Sparrow, a local recluse whom Donnie and his friends lovingly refer to as ""Grandma Death"".  With the aid of both Monnitoff and Sparrow, Donnie believes he has discovered the secret of time travel.  All of these characters and plots converge on one fateful Halloween night, causing Donnie to finally lose it in one of the films most heartwrenching and chilling scenes.  In the end, Donnie makes an extremely sad, but somehow optimistic decision to, ah, well, you'll just have to see the movie.  Along with all the magnificent elements already defined, this movie features several other things for which I must commend it, the first of which is its soundtrack and score.  Utilizing a combination of popular songs from the 80's and a stellar, beautiful, and melancholy score of instrumental works by composer Michael Andrews, this film is appealing on more than one level, which is more than I can say for many movies.  Another thing which I must take the time to acknowledge is the extremely realistic and effective subplot involving a student named Cherita Chen (played very well by Jolene Purdy) who is teased by her classmates for being overweight and foreign.  This sad scenario is all too real in many schools, and is brought into the spotlight in this movie with a haunting and sorrowful authenticity.  Overall, director Richard Kelly has outdone himself to say the least (especially considering this is his first movie), and one can only hope that he continues to manufacture material of the same caliber as this.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, then by all means do so:  I can honestly say that it is one of the best films I have ever seen.  (NOTE TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT: I know there is some debate as to whether the entire movie was real or just Donnie's imagination, and I just have to weigh in on this matter:  The jet engine that crashes through Donnie's room obviously came from the plane his mother and sister were flying in when it ran into the wormhole that manifested when the end of the world was set to occur, so therefore he must have discovered the secret to time travel in order to allow himself to go back and alter the course of time and restart the entire thing.  Just my thoughts.)",1118620800,3,4730,4.877652933832709
1671687,3,B00005V3Z4,"Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but I felt the Director's Cut too long.  I also was disappointed that the song, ""Under the Milky Way"" by the Church was removed from this version.

1671688,5,B00005V3Z4,"Granted, it's a thought provoking movie, which is a bit of an oxymoron, if you think about it. I mean, movies are Entertainment, and the minute you have to think about what is supposed to entertain you, it stops being entertainment, and becomes work, which is what we go to movies to escape from!

Okay, I'm not saying this because I don't 'get it.' I'm the weirdo in my social circle. Tape deck: Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Coldplay, conscious hip-hop - the stuff that requires thinking.

Favorite movies: Fight Club, Vanilla Sky, Memento - the stuff that the average dude has to see 3-4 times to 'get.'

I respect your attempts at philosophy, Sunshine - no doubt you're a college man. But for God's Sakes, this isn't a teen movie made to challenge religion. The Matrix has more religious undertones than Donnie Darko! DD is an acid trip, in the most poignant sense of the word.

Bear in mind, I rated this movie five-stars, so I'm not belittling it. Still, so many of my friends have the tendency to overhype things. If it's just okay, it's good. If it's good, it's great. If it's great, it's a classic piece of art that dwarfs all things in its presences. You get the picture.

About the movie: Donnie Darko, like the last review said, is a challenging movie, with a scenario that's hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen. Even after all is said and done, it's still difficult to tell whether Donnie Darko has imagined the whole thing, or if he has somehow been able to turn back the hands of time.

Donnie's an iconoclast; he (forgive the tired cliche) marches to the beat of a different drum. He's a little darker than those his age (duh), but he's also a lot smarter, dabbling in obscure sciences, and often wrapped up in an obsession with the study of time travel.

This would make him a respectable fellow, if not for forte for theories about the apocalypse, as well as the fact that he sees a life-sized talking rabbit (we've all seen that in the trailer).

All of the performances, both from the veteran actors, of which there are a few, and the newcomers, of which there are also quite a few, are very well-delivered and believable. It's really surprising to me that this wasn't a big movie, propelling Jake to stardom (sure, he's popular, and he got to go out with Kirsten Dunst, but he's no A-Lister).

It's very surprising that this was the writer/director's first film, as every piece of dialogue, and every camera angle seems like it came from the hands of a pro.

In the end, I highly recommend this movie. It is a great film, a thing that young aspiring directors may look to in the future for inspiration. So, in conclusion, people, watch it, enjoy it, but please don't take it too seriously!",1118448000,2,2710,4.546201232032854

Donnie is a confused adolescent, perhaps mentally ill, who is either communing with a vision, freaking out, dreaming, or being manipulated.  The best thing is that all the connections are never really explained, so it is left to the viewer to interpret it.  That means it can be viewed over and over, which it will in our house because the acting is excellent and the cinematography is beautiful.

I guess). It's somehow like watching a long music-video, and to be honest the music is what appealed most to me personally. There's nothing wrong with the acting, but nothing about this movie (including its' story) managed to engage me. I liked ""The Butterfly Effect"" better I think, and ""Vanilla Sky"" absolutely. But the movie only is entertaining to a certain level, though I wasn't exactly bored -I've even seen it twice to see if it would change my opinion, and to find out if there had been something I had missed at first view -but my first impression wasn't changed.

Imagine a world that you aren't supposed to be in, then imagine receiving all of these clues that you don't understand telling you so, and all of the repercussions that your very existence can have.

Once you try to put that together throw in a scary looking giant rabbit, a child porn king, your little sister's dance competition, and a turbine jet engine falling out of the sky.

If you can even begin to stitch how these all fit together then you will begin to understand Donnie Darko as a film. If you can begin to understand the film you may begin to peel it back again layer by layer and see how much more the movie says about the human psyche and how we all interact and relate to one another and how everything we do has some rebound effect somewhere else.

It makes you think. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because you really do have to watch it so many times to understand everything that is going on, and in the end I don't think the director wants you to.

1671707,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is an allegory. Not only that, but it is one of the finest movies ever made. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance in the title role. His body language - the curving shoulders, freaky smiles and brooding eyes - reveals an instinctual knowing without the benefit of a complete revelation. His acting is truly outstanding. I'm not saying that anyone else's acting is particularly great or that the special effects are the bomb (they are quite good for a low budget film). What I am saying is that this movie is a multi-dimensional rollercoaster ride that you don't even realize that you are on until it's too late to get off. The closest thing I can relate it to is Twelve Monkeys. But Donnie Darko goes farther and deeper and asks more questions. It is haunting and humorous and even a little scary. If you are a person given to flights of philosophical fancy or theological speculation, (or even if you like reading Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku), you will love this movie. But be prepared! You will have to watch the movie over and over again, and each time you do the allegory becomes fuller and fuller as the revelation opens.

Now, my interpretation of the allegory may not be anyone else's. I would be quite interested in hearing other points of view. But here is my idea in a nutshell...

The wrinkle in time is this present world

Donnie Darko is the Christ figure (hence, his mother = Mary; father = Joseph)

Jim Cunnigham is the devil (Or is Frank the devil and Jim the Antichrist?)

Gretchen Ross is the Church

Kittie Farmer is Self-righteous churchianity (as opposed to The Two Teachers, below)

Roberta Sparrow/Grandma Death is the Bible (by way of her book The Philosophy of Time Travel)

The Two Teachers (Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore) represent conscientious but silenced clergy - the prophetic voice

The wrinkle in time in which the story takes place is the world as we know it. Donnie gives up his life so that his beloved might live, but in the process he changes everyone and everything. Even Jim Cunningham - the evil molester who, because of the death of Donnie may not even be found out - is reduced to tears, perhaps knowing that everything has changed. The world as a whole will never be the same again.

Okay, you philosophers and movie wizards... what does the fat man in the jogging suit represent? What about Frank? What is he really? Or the psychiatrist? Or Sparkle Magic? What does Donnie's older sister represent? Frank is her boyfriend! Frank also is the oracle that cause Donnie to act. Lots of stuff I just haven't figured out yet!!!!

First time writer/director Richard Kelly has created a real gem here. The film already has a hardy cult following and will become, I think, the theologian's and philosopher's Rocky Horror Picture Show.",1116979200,11,2797,4.699386503067485

This movie promises to be something big and intreguing, but it never tells us why. All we are left with is the green rabbit, ""cellar door,"" and perhaps a vague impression that Donnie doesnt think we're alone. So what?

Eventually it became evident that it was quit a popular movie among the more cultured people in my local society, so I became a little more interested in it and finally bought it at the local Best Buy for about $10, which was an excellent price condidering The Matrix is still about $10 and it's about 2 years older than Donnie.  I watched this movie for the first time with my family and was sort of nervous because I wasn't aware of the subject matter to come, but I was pleasantly surprised that everyone including me liked the movie, although my parents were somewhat confused with the meaning of it, I just liked it.  For the calibur of film that this is it's excellent.  By calibur I mean that it wasn't originally made for a large theatre release on a huge budget.  There isn't really anything I can say to you about the movie that gives it away other than the fact that it is extremely funny, creepy, and unsettling all at the same time.  The performances by the cast are true to life.  The film is supposed to take place in 1988, and I guess that the budget and time sort of crippled the feel of it, but when I looked closer I saw a little more 80's soul in it.  The DVD is great also, the commentary with Richard Kelly and Jake G. (will not attempt to spell) is very informative.  I learned several things that would be impossible to figure out by just watching it that make a little more sense now that I know them.  The deleted scenes range from very well done to very pointless (Donnie's rightfully deleted death shot).  The Mad World music video is only good because of the song, the actual video is prety much clips of the movie.  One thing I find odd is the website gallery.  It's just screenshots from [...] and they're very unclear so I don't see the justification in it being on the DVD.  Same thing with the production photos.

1671722,5,B00005V3Z4,"This is a nearly unclassifiable film.  You could call it noir occult with more than a dash of science fiction and wry social commentary thrown in for leavening.  I tend to thing of it as a Gnostic restatement of 'Back to the Future.'  But the truth is that it is in its own little world of creativity and spookiness.  What director Richard Kelly has done is taken the story of a mildly psychotic teenager caught in someone else's cycle of guilt and expiation and turned it into something that deserves cult film status if nothing else.

Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is our semi-psychotic hero.  His insanity sets him apart in the religious sense, making him liable to insights and visions which are crazy by our standards, but pierce one of reality's veils in an almost prophetic way.  When a jet motor comes out of nowhere to crash on his bedroom, from which he has been lured by an evil rabbit time becomes the crisis of Donnie's existence.  Mumbling old women whisper to him and a teacher passes him a secret text in a darkened classroom.  The book 'The Philosophy of Time' is Donnie's only guide in a building whirlwind of events.

Donnie is surrounded by a family almost as odd as he is, a psychiatrist determined to drug him into sanity, a kiddie porn maker who does motivational speaking on the side, and a love interest (Jena Malone) that lays the groundwork for a stunning conclusion.  Gyllenhaal's performance captures the inner discontinuities of a character whose world alternates clarity with hallucination, leaving us to wonder what is real and what is inadvertent juxtaposition.

As a film, Donnie Darko is as deep as you want to take it in a range between pure spookiness and metaphysics.  By the time I hit the closing credits I found it hard to believe that a modern director would take the risks that Kelly did with this film, and very glad that the risks were taken.  There is a lot of fine detail in the settings and scene action that only gradually sink in.  This was a much more carefully made film than it appears on first contact.

By all means see this for its creative adventurism if nothing else.  Stay to watch it a few times and you will find it eerily optimistic despite the tragic thrust of its central story.  In the end you may very well feel as happily perplexed as I did.",1114300800,6,2309,4.576642335766423
1671723,1,B00005V3Z4,"I saw this movie about a year ago because I thought it was going to be a comeback vehicle for Patrick Swayze who is my all time best actor. I celebrate the entire Patrick Swayze collection, my favorites including his portrayal of the post-apocolyptic warrior ""Nomad"" in Steel Dawn, his masterful footwork in ""Dirty Dancing"" and as a ghost in ""Ghost"".

As of late though, Patrick has been a little bit out of the mainstream, so I figured that Donnie Darko would be his equivolant of Travolta's comeback in Pulp Fiction. Boy was I wrong.

First things first, when I rent a movie that I hear involves Mr. Swayze, I automatically assume that he will be featured in the lead role. Patrick is a major player that shouldn't be pushed to such a small part in favor of the kid from Spiderman. Where as this kid just mumbled and drooped his way through the Donnie Darko part, Patrick Swayze would have provided much more life and charisma which was sorely lacking.

Now on to my second (and biggest) bone to pick with the movie. The role that Patrick was cast in seemed promising at first. That is until.....well, let's just say that I'm disgusted with the film industry for the vile direction they made his character go towards. I still haven't decided wether or not I'm mad at Swayze though, since I'm quite positive that had he known what was in store for his character he never would have signed up in the first place. He, like I probably just assumed that he would be playing Darko and that Spiderman would just be in the rabbit costume or whatever. Unfortunately, due to reasons still unclear, Patrick's career has not been revitalized, but instead sabotaged, possibly on purpose.

Anyways, on to the rest of the movie, summed up as Howard sees it (that's me). Basically the main character is a kid that is crazy and I guess he kind of repeats parts of his life or whatever. And there's a guy in a rabbit uniform after him (not like a sports mascot, much more creepy). I guess from what I gather it's kind of like the movie ""Groundhog's Day"" but without Chevy Chase. Oh yeah, and Drew Barymore is in it for like a minute, apparently trying to kill her momentum built up by actual good movies like Charly's Angels. I swear that she was probably only in it to pay off a drug debt or something.

Now as a Patrick Swayze lover, (no gay jokes please, I know what some of you are thinking and you need to grow up), to say that Donnie Darko is a dissappointment is an understatement. In retrospect I think the best part of the whole movie is when we get to see the wall-sized handpainted mural of Patrick Swayze. If such a thing exists outside of the movie world, I would do ANYTHING to obtain it. I have been searching for a way to get my hands the actual presentation featured in the movie to no avail. When I went on vacation to Universal Studios in Florida I even asked some of the workers but they said they didn't know. I have also written dozens of letters to various art galleries, film studios, video camera manufacturers, and even Patrick himself.

In conclusion, I am looking forward to buying this Director's cut of the movie just to see if they have fixed any of the problems with Swayze's character, and hopefully beefed up his part. Also the movie could use more action to make it better. That usually works. One way or the other I will at least have a reference of the enormous Patrick Swayze painting, so if worse comes to worst I can at least commission a local artist to recreate it, or even try to paint it myself if I have to. Please e-mail me if you know the wherabouts of this piece. I wonder if it is hanging in Mr. Swayze's estate, which I guess would make me pretty happy. Later.

These people can (...). I've seen films in which a nude man with an S and M mask and dog collar on, with his head in a toilet, discusses how going to houses of domination is the only thing that eases his destructive and homicidal urges... So don't tell me about what truly strange and original films are. I also got a high school diploma at 14, and started going to college at the age of 15.
So don't tell me about intelligence. That being said... The first cut of this movie was great. One of my favorite films. But this directors cut is total %$@!. There are almost no extra scenes, and pretty much so every scene they added could be seen on the special features of the original. This was more like Donnie darko with alternative editing techniques , and inferior ones at that. This directors cut just didn't feel as smooth as the first. This is just a scam to get everyone to buy 2 copys of the movie. If you already have a copy of the first don't bother with this, and if you don't have it, pick up a copy of the original. Like I said, Im a big Donnie darko fan, I liked it before it got popular (at least in the U.S), and Im sure I'll still like it once its popularity fades.

1671725,4,B00005V3Z4,"Coming in as someone who saw the movie once on VHS (the DVD was all sold out and I really wanted to watch this film), I feel the Directors Cut (DC) is a much better interpretation of what is going on. I wasn't able to watch all the extra features or listen to the commentary, so after watching the movie a few times, I had an idea of what it was about, but i still felt unsatisfied. Watching the DC, with the added ""pages"" of the book placed on the screen, I feel that more questions have been answered, although any answer is left up to each persons interpretation. I would say that if you've never seen Donnie Darko before, rent or buy the DC, then if you loved the movie, go and buy or rent the original (which i am going to do) and compare the two movies, and see which one makes more sense in the end.

In conclusion, a must have film, either way.

1671726,5,B00005V3Z4,"It is very difficult to find movies that are ""worthwhile"" these days.  This movie is incredible.  It seems to explain exactly what I am going thru in my life at present.  Although there are many different takes on what this movie is trying to get across, I believe there's a much more spiritual side to it that has not yet been brought to anyone's attention.  It seems Donnie learns that there is a higher intelligence.  He becomes more aware of his surroundings, which eventually leads to the various coincidences that begin happening in his life; Synchronicity.  This is true to our lives as well.  Once u begin to pay attention to ur senses (sight, sound, smell, feeling) at any given moment, coincidences will start happening more frequently.  This is because u have stored more memory of the past to compare with the present; something we rarely do.  We tend to live in the past and future, constantly reflecting on actions we could have made, or eagerly awaiting actions to come.

Donnie seems to be experiencing synchronicity once he meets Frank (the rabbit).  He is definitely in some kind of time warp during this period, but it is only for him to learn and understand the depth of existence. His major fear is dying alone. The whole process that takes place after the jet engine falls in his room is for him to conquer that fear.  Once his awareness has increased, supernatural events start unfolding. He is able to view other's intent of action before they themselves are even aware. He follows coincidences to see where they lead (Cellar Door, for instance). Things start to click together for him, and he begins to realize that there is something going on beyond the physical realm; something much more intelligent at play. He eventually comes to the realization that he no longer has anything to fear. There is a much greater plan that he and everyone in the world is part of.  This is why, when time loops back to the jet engine, he's sitting in bed with a smile on his face, laughing.  He has finally realized what life is all about.

His death creates awareness in the individuals he had interacted with during the time warp.  This is why at the ending, everyone wakes up with the realization of what they're doing in their life at that particular moment. Maybe now these people will finally realize the direction in life they were heading. Now that they are aware, they can make the choice to head on a different path.

Overall, this movie is genius.  I have yet to meet a person who does not enjoy it on some level.  To those who didn't like it; chances are they lacked in understanding.",1112745600,6,2606,4.626086956521739
1671727,4,B00005V3Z4,"The theatrical version of Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I liked it so much that I went to the world premiere of the director's cut.  Unfortunately what I saw there was a great movie turned into merely a good one.  I'm all for filmmakers going back and making their work available in the way they want it be seen before a studio messed with it (such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Legend), but I don't like it when filmmakers go back and change stuff that they didn't have a problem with in the first place (which is what happened here).  Richard Kelly said that he was happy with the theatrical cut and would only change the opening song to an INXS song that was in the script.  But he changed a lot more in the director's cut then that and makes the movie lose much of its mystery and charm.  Here are some of the major changes:

-Music changed: In the opening Echo and the Bunnymen has been changed to INXS.  Even if Richard had wanted to use INXS in the first place he was lucky to find Echo and the Bunnymen because that song works much better.  A lot of other songs are mixed around in the soundtrack now too and not for the better.

-Added visual effects: Shots of Donnie's eye filled with crazy imagery doesn't fit with the style of the movie and they look pretty cheesy.  Effects like these also ruin the ending of the movie.

-Pages of the book: Throughout the director's cut pages of the Philosophy of Time Travel will appear onscreen basically telling the audience what is happening.  The old version worked much better because you could decide for yourself what was going on.  Now the director is jamming an explanation down your throat.

-Added scenes: The only thing the director's cut does right is adding in about 20 minutes of deleted scenes that really flesh out the characters.  But they do make the movie seem overlong and not all of them add anything special.

-Audio changes: Some audio has been deleted from the theatrical version.  Not really any reason, but it's for the worse.  And an important scene with Drew Barrymore was cut in half.

Now onto the DVD.

-Commentary: Richard Kelly and filmmaker Kevin Smith (Clerks) talk about the changes in the director's cut and the movie's cult status.  A very good and entertaining commentary, this is the best extra on the set.  But the commentary with Richard and Jake Gyllenhaal is still the best of the Darko commentaries.

-Production Diary: Some behind the scenes footage.  Semi-interesting.

-Documentary on the cult of Donnie Darko: A documentary made in Europe that is sort of interesting, but the participants spend most of the time bashing Americans and how they can't understand a movie like this.

-#1 Fan: A short film made for a contest to find Donnie Darko's #1 fan.  The guy in this piece is really weird and kinda crazy.  But at the end you'll be laughing your head off.

-There are also storyboards and a trailer.

The director's cut of Donnie Darko isn't bad, it was just right the first time.  I'd say pick up this DVD to see a different vision of the movie and for the special features, but keep your old copy because it contains the better version of the movie and more special features.",1112659200,14,3208,4.534843205574913

If you've seen REAL movies of this ilk, like Jacobs Ladder or 12 Monkeys, you'll think of Donnie Darko as a teen rip off... how's that for a mental image?? This same story has also been used countless times on Serlings Twilight Zone (minus the terrible acting).

Nothing about this movie was really worth watching, the pacing, performances, dialogue... nothing. Even the much belly-whooed ""Rabbit"" lost it's charm after the second appearance. The two stars are for the lead (Darko was decent) and the 2 discs have a lot of info (sadly they are ABOUT this MOVIE). Barrymore consisted of nothing more than dead weight and Swayze was even worse.

1671729,3,B00005V3Z4,"a long list of teen movie & existential cliches.

Start with an update of Occurrence at Owl creek Bridge mixed with a 'Lathe of Heaven' twist living in a supended world beyond reality. Make Donnie a 'troubled kid' it gives him reason not to feel at home in the world. take from Rebel without a Cause, Blackboard Jungle, Breakfast Club, My So Called Life --- every  teen angst plot known to moviedom is dumped into this story, 'my parents don't understand me', over bearing teachers, bullies, hypocritical moralizers, the only 'cool' teacher fired by the school system, the girl fiend who has even more problems than you. Then some pseudo-science mumbo jumbo about worm holes and time travel, some pointless 'weirdness' to give it that arty profound aura and top it off with a 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' type ending that leaves the movie in limbo. Was it all a dream, was Donnie completely delusional, was it 'magic', did the director run out script and need a quick out? And why is Donnie so troubled, he seems to have a pretty good life on average, his bleak view is never explained or justified. This movie makes a great leap into the deep dark end of the pool of the human conscious, but run out air long before it returns to the surface.

1671730,5,B00005V3Z4,"I thought Donnie Darko was a great portrayal of how we long for so much more than we usually take the time to realize in life.  It shows that we can be in control of many aspects of life; many aspects that most people never even realize.  Most people would have been asleep to many of the details Donnie was able to perceive about people (such as the fakeness of Jim Cunningham and the sincerity within his English teacher).

I do not think this movie supports the usual existentialist claim that we create our own meaning in life.  The movie recognizes there is more than just becoming aware of and controlling as many aspects of life as you can.  Donnie chooses his own death in order to save his girlfriend not because it his simply the path he chooses, but because it is one of those moments that in the words of the movie ""reminds you beautiful the world can be.""  In the end, I think the movie instead affirms that there is a best way of living with the choices that we have.",1112140800,,981,4.304347826086956
1671731,5,B00005V3Z4,"Darko is a movie that will speak to an entire generation of youth and survive the test of time. We say this with a certainty because of the elements where it succeeds. It has a horror element but it is not horrible in the sense of visual or mental disgust but instead a quiet fear--that same fear that Aristotle says is so important to theater because the audience must feel as if it could happen to them just as easily as the characters. It has an element of science-fiction but its plot (despite a charming continual reference to Deus ex Machina) is not reliant upon some kind of techno-babble postulation or solution. It has a lifelike ensemble of characters--of truly gifted actors giving fine performances--but none of the characters are overtly mean-spirited or caricatures of real people but rather a set of people earnestly attempting to do what they feel is right. There is even a striking moment at the end of  a film where a criminal is shown weeping at his own sense of guilt and hatred towards himself. Finally, it is a film that speaks directly and unflinchingly at the confusion of teenagers but still gives them a sense of something to believe in and the necessity for personal achievement.

WHO SHOULD WATCH:

Current teenagers and adults who remember their teenage years probably all the way back to 1980 will find watching this film to be a moving experience. Kelly is deadly accurate in his many portrayals and the relevance to youth in this decade is still sharp. Aside from the coming-of-age elements of this movie, it shares some of the most similarities with some striking films involving romance and the chronic pathos of life. For example, the movie Happy Accidents starring Vincent D'Onofrio has thrilled many a romantic audience despite its speculative elements and those people would probably find a great deal of merit here and vice-versa. Also, more mainstream movies--decidedly ""unspeculative""--such as Magnolia and Quiz Show also have audiences who would appreciate Darko and vice-versa. These are all movies that speak to life in the most important ways and we should not ignore them.

WHO SHOULD AVOID:

Obviously, there's no cathartic rush of violence here. Movie-goers may be misled by the cover and title in to thinking it's some kind of R-rated Alice in Wonderland type romp which it most assuredly is not. For films of this excess--but still done well--look to Predator or perhaps A Clockwork Orange or other similar venues. Also, this is a confusing movie that leaves its audience with a heavy sense of ambiguity. This can be highly irritating to the movie-goer who wants to understand what is happening and yearns for a sense of closure. Indeed, this ambiguity disturbed Roger Ebert quite badly in his initial review.

The movie was very consistent with no gaps inbetween, yet very unique and questionable pertaining to the storyline.  Many people will have many different interpretations as to what this movie is all about, however I find this movie to focus primarily on time-travel.  Time-travel gives Donnie the opportunity to control future occurrences from happening.  A movie about manipulation of FATE.  Ok enough of my philosophical analysis.  The movie will leave you in question no doubt the fist time you view it, however this movie has an emotional replay value.  Meaning you need not to put this movie away in your library.  It will certainly be a movie in and out of your dvd player on a consistent basis, and with no surprise it without a doubt would spark a very interesting conversation with whomever you watched it with....(and please don't talk yourself like Donnie).",1111708800,,1046,5.034883720930233

The new digital effects, including the horrible superimposing of pages of ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"", are worthless and add nothing to the plot. I remember after watching the original movie how blown away I was by this film, but that did not mean I understood every aspect of it. It made me want to study the film more and even try to find ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"", which was included on the bonus features of the original DVD.

Suffice to say that it's a haunting, brilliantly cut film-noir with very interesting characters and superb acting by the entire cast.

The Director's Cut, however, lacks.  I firmly believe that director's cuts should add new footage, not change existing footage.  With 20 extra minutes, there's a new scene here and there, but the most obvious changes are in the way certain scenes play out.  The eyeball thing every time Donnie encounters Frank the rabbit doesn't quite seem to fit, and the time travel sequence at the end is just way to busy-looking to be enjoyed.  I much preferred the simplicity of the way that scene played out in the original.  A few tiny segments have been cut entirely, and that bothers me because in this movie, it's the little things that make it interesting.  The 5.1 surround sound has also been re-edited, and again, I prefer the original.  During the Sparkle Motion scene at the talent show, the sound quality of the Duran Duran song is terrible, but halfway through, it fixes itself.  The picture quality is far worse than the original cut.

All in all, I think the original is better.  The excerpts from the ""Philosophy of Time Travel"" book is a nice change though.  Rent this first before you buy.",1110672000,6,1389,4.681818181818182
1671741,5,B00005V3Z4,"The director's cut of Donnie Darko serves to further amplify a film which alternately puzzled and enthralled moviegoers.  Not much of a commercial success in the US, the film did very well overseas, and this is spotlighted in the documentary portion of the second disk, which interviews fans in the UK in 2004.  The actual film is fleshed out by an extra 20 minutes of footage, mostly explanatory passages that clear some of the ambiguity surrounding Roberta Sparrow and her book.  These extra scenes, however, do not detract from the sense of never knowing whether the film actually deals with time travel or the hallucinations of a schizophrenic main character.  This, coupled with the many genre-crossing elements of the file, are what make it a modern classic.  There are scenes which look like an update of The Breakfast Club, complete with 80's pop music (including a new track by INXS); science fiction, involving complicated theories of time travel which actually correspond with modern thought on complexity theory; spiritual allegory, with Donnie cast as a messianic figure sacrificing himself to save the world; and coming of age drama complete with first love and rebellion.  Through all of this, director Richard Kelly never speaks down to his audience, giving them nothing they can't figure out on their own.  At the time of the theatrical release, the website was a marvel, giving tantalizing clues to the origins of the story and the thoughts behind the characters.  The bonus materials touch on this only a little.  Perhaps the most interesting feature on the second disk is a ""Darkumentary"" film by a young man who explains why he is the film's #1 fan.  This film veers from a laughable portrait of the kind of person who attends Star Trek conventions to a slightly creepy painting of an obsessed fan who ambushes minor actors from the movie to ask them rambling questions about the film's philosophy. He even gets the director's phone number from the Internet, leaving long messages with questions about the fictitious book on time travel.

  The movie itself is a brilliant piece of work, and I think that the extra scenes are positive more than negative.  They add to the story, and don't detract from the sense of alienation and mystery.

1671743,4,B00005V3Z4,"I would like to start by saying that I am a great fan of the movie Donnie Darko. That being said, I may be guilty of some bias.

As I said in the title, this is truly a brilliant film. Its depth and originality provide something so rare in modern cinema that simply watching this movie makes one feel like one has tripped through the mud of popular movies and inadvertently kicked up a small piece of gold. There are countless ""Teen Angst"" movies, but few actually show the depth of the open-ended questions we all discover in our youth. The main character, aptly named Donnie Darko, faces not only these universal dilemmas but also his own schizophrenia. Donnie finds himself pondering one of mankind's oldest questions: What is the point of living if everyone dies alone? The storytelling never falls flat and the actors never try to over-act as seen in so many Academy Award-winning ""masterpieces"". The brilliance of this film could never be properly conveyed in words alone.

That being said, This poster has a serious complaint about this new cut. If it was possible for a new ""director's cut"" to surpass George Lucas's re-release of the original Star Wars Trilogy in its ability to leave a sour taste in one's mouth, it is this movie. This cut provides no new scenes that were not available as extras on the 2001 DVD release. What it does include is pointless ""scifi-esque"" effects such as a close-up of a human eyeball twitching. There is honestly no reason for this nonsense to be edited into such an excellent movie. Another bit of added information comes in the form of book pages being superimposed over a few scenes. This is also superfluous as the entire book from which these pages are taken was included in the extras of the 2001 release.

Many other films have had extended director's cut versions released where there were only a few seconds or a couple minutes of extra footage, which added nothing to the story. That is simply not the case with this particular DVD. In this instance, the director's cut answers many questions that a viewer of the theatrical release may have asked while watching the film. There are a ton of extra scenes, and they're not just ""fluff"" shots, but actually contribute a lot to the story. If you saw the original version and liked it, but didn't quite understand what was going on all the time, watch the director's cut, and it's very likely that you'll ""get it"" this time 'round.",1110240000,4,811,4.523809523809524
1671745,3,B00005V3Z4,"The basic plot revolves around Donnie, a teenage schizophrenic, with an imagined friend in a bunny suit named Frank. It is a very interesting concept and leaves viewers questioning.

Richard Kelly stated that his version would answer some of those questions and provide better understanding than the original release. Simply put, the Director's Cut does not meet this expectation.

I had already paid $20 for the first release, but because I loved it so much, I absolutely HAD to have this new and allegedly improved version as well. I regret this purchase because I really don't have money to waste. There are very few actual scenes added and none are of any great significance or change the meaning of the film. There was one scene regarding his medication that added a bit of a twist... but I don't even think it was in the final version of the movie, but listed as a deleted scene instead. One would have to watch the two versions back to back to catch all of the changes... that is how insignificant the added scenes are. Some of the things NEEDED to be cut - for example, the eye scenes and the pages from the book on time travel (you'll know what I'm referring to if you've seen this version). Those scenes just did not transition well into the movie. Instead of adding meaning, they were distractions. The eye seems completely unnecessary and the information from the book would have been much better if displayed as text on the bottom of the screen or in some other, less intrusive means. Another noticeable difference is one of the ending scenes... in the director's cut there are black lines/boxes over the images, which looks very amateur - as if it was done in photoshop and not done very well at that.

The bonus disc of special features is yet another disappointment. It's boring even to a fan of the movie. I fell asleep during it. I did not have that problem during the special features of the original 2001 release.

Buy the first release of Donnie Darko (which gets 5 stars from me). Don't bother with this version unless you have a free rental coupon and everything else is rented out. I resisted the urge to rate this version even lower than I did, because it would be good... if a better version hadn't already been released.

1671747,5,B00005V3Z4,"I watched this at home, and had to wait a few days until I could watch it again.  This movie makes you think, and slightly disturbed me.  I had to allow for 'processing time' before I could give it a second go.  Do not get up to go to the bathroom, try to talk to your friends about the movie while watching this movie or anything.  If you have a fear of large rabbits, don't watch this.  If you don't fear rabbits, you may afterward.

The basic story is about Donnie Darko, a sixteen-year-old boy diagnosed with schizophrenia.  He talks to a very large and very creepy rabbit named Frank that predicts the future.  That is what to tell people when you just want to give the short version of this story.  The long version requires a rabbit suit.  To really understand the story line, you have to watch the movie multiple times and listen to the commentary and all the extra stuff and the maybe, just maybe you might kind of understand what really happened.

Please do not let this deter you from watching.  The movie is well acted and the story is intriguing.  Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance I have seen from a young actor in a very long time.  He utilizes his posture, voice and eyes to convince you that he is Donnie Darko.  His mother, played by Mary McDonnell, is excellent.  In response to Donnie's despairing question ""How does it feel to have a freak for a son?""  she simply responds ""It feels wonderful.""  That is the most reassuring thing any parent could possibly say.  Donnie's older sister is portrayed by Jake's real-life older sister, adding to the plot-necessary sibling rivalry beautifuly.  This is Richard Kelly's directorial debut, and he has made his mark.  I fear that his next flim will not live up to the expectation left by Darko.

Every character in the film serves a secondary purpose.  Frank the rabbit is Donnie's unconcious mind.  The teachers that Donnie likes (played by Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle) serve as guides to help him understand time-travel, responsibilty, girls and that nothing is simple.  The one teacher that thinks Graham Greene was a star on Bonanza is a reminder of the failings that all human beings have.  Kelly couldn'tfind a company to release the movie because no one was sure how to bill it.  The back of the DVD box says a 'psyclogical thrill ride', but that falls short of what the movie really is.  Of course, 'a sci-fi dark romantic horror thriller comedy fantasy religious story about being sixteen and having an imaginary pshchic rabbit freind that scares and intrigues you and makes you go sleep golfing' is too wordy for the back of a box.

This film has been released twice to theatres (both times limited areas) and didn't do remarkably well either time.  On DVD, it has become a cult classic of sorts.  IMDB lists Donnie Darko as the fifth most requested sci-fi movie of all time.  Simply, this is not a theatre movie.  I don't know anyone who hasn't watched it at least twice, usually more times than that in search of answers.

Watch it, and then find a creepy rabbit to help explain it to you.",1109894400,7,3073,4.577981651376147

I will be grateful to that friend for the rest of my life because this movie is honestly the most amazing film I have ever seen in my life. Words cannot describe it. It was put together SO well, and Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is remarkable. It's extremely hard to understand. The first time I watched it I just sat there staring at the screen thinking... what just happened. But after watching it again, and looking up some info on the movie, it makes more sense. But I think the movie was put together perfectly. The mystery of it is what makes it so unforgettable. The soundtrack is amazing as well. Wouldn't change a thing... although the ""smurf"" scene was a little too raunchy for my taste. Still pretty funny though. :) That's another good thing about this movie. It's got drama, comedy, horror... everything.

But this is a teen movie like none you've ever seen before.  It has time travel, violence, craziness, love, and a slew of other ideas going on.  It's a very psychological movie, and is made all the better by my personal favorite actress, the beautiful Jena Malone.

1671750,4,B00005V3Z4,"To Fox's credit, and to cultists' delight, none of the extras on the extended version of ""Donnie Darko"" were ported over from the original 2003 DVD. The extended film and bonus features create an alternate home video experience -- totally in the spirit of ""Darko."" ""I'm just as proud of the first cut as of this one,"" director Richard Kelly says. He likens the new film to a remixed record. In the digital age, ""There can hopefully be two versions of a film that exist.""

Wise guy director Kevin Smith and Kelly keep each other amused on the commentary, with Smith occasionally playing the interviewer. (He'd be a talented journalist, it seems.) They set off on some entertaining tangents. More commentators should bring along their smart friends.

The director took deleted scenes from the first DVD's extras and returned them to the film. He added ""comic book"" visual elements like a giant eyeball. The audio was reimagined to heighten the supernatural vibe. A couple of songs were returned to their rightful positions, and an INXS tune now opens the film.

The new audio (Dolby Digital 5.1) proves a dramatic, subwoofer-smoking upgrade. Not so with the letterboxed images (2.35:1) -- reproduction is as soft and uninspiring as on the original disc.

The hourlong ""production diary"" is more a collection of on-location footage, with optional voice-over from director of photography Steven Poster (""Blade Runner""). ""Donnie is the embodiment of Jesus,"" a fan explains in the British docu ""They Made Me Do It: The Cult of Donnie Darko."" She's being interviewed by a man in a cheap bunny suit. The piece tells how ""Darko"" had its first successes in London.

The highly interactive donniedarko.com found the ""No. 1 fan"" via a home-movie contest. In his short film, the beefy zealot shows off his ""Darko""-infested bedroom and kisses Kelly, who is understandably alarmed.

There also are a good 8-minute storyboard-to-film segment and blazing trailer that makes you want to see it all again.",1109808000,4,1986,5.0212765957446805

1671755,1,B00005V3Z4,"Perhaps I went into this movie with unreasonably high expectations, after all everyone who has seen this movie has put it on a pedestal. The movie's fairly boring, mainly because the pacing is slow and the narrative is drawn out to an unnecessary degree (how many scenes of Donnie walking, of Donnie pouting, of Donnie sitting do you really need to see?). However this is not the source of my intense revulsion of this movie. I am a fairly intelligent individual, but I could not figure out the central storyline. I had my own conjectures of what was happening but I decided that perhaps, if I looked at the extras I might be able to understand what the director was getting at. One of the extras on this DVD is an excerpt from ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" book (from which Donnie draws his theories) and in three pages it outlined what was going on, what Frank (the bunny) was, the significance of the airplane engine, the concept of a ""tangent"" universe, why Donnie dreams of a water filled landscape, why everyone is trying to stop Donnie (even if they're not aware they're doing it), the black hole at the end, and well...everything. I was confused as to why the director chose to leave these explanations out and conceal the context for the story (SOME WOULD SAY THE CENTRAL CORE OF THE STORY THAT DRIVES EVERYTHING ELSE). I turned to the deleted scenes to see if any of these details had been cut from the movie intentionally and maybe, just maybe if there was a reason why they where cut. Here is where confusion turned to a personal hatred of the director. All of the deleted scenes added vital revelations (more conversations with Frank!, Donnie was taking placebos not actual medication! ect!) and at least a sense of what was going on with whole time travel aspect. What put me over the edge was hearing the director go on and on about this scene was cut because it revealed too much, that he preferred to leave it open to the viewer. I like some ambiguity in my movies, but I don't like a story that is forcibly divorced from context. Watching this movie is akin to reading a book with pages torn out; pages torn out by a pompous, conceited director who believes that a broken, shattered story is inherently better then a film with a complete narrative.  It is this attitude, this mental masturbation (smart people don't need context or explanations, only dumb people and philistines need narrative clarity) that turns this boring, muddled movie into a nexus of disgust and hatred. Do not watch this movie. But most of all do not support this self-important, vain, smug, arrogant, snobbish, haughty, ostentatious ass of a director by buying this movie.",1109548800,53,2667,4.662420382165605
1671756,5,B00005V3Z4,"Review of the Theatrical Release:

It was poorly advertised. It failed at the boxoffice. Nobody I know has ever heard it mentioned...Yet, Users of the Internet Movie Database (imdb.com) rank the movie among the 100 greatest films ever made. The film has gained what many would call a ""Cult Status"" among it's viewers. It seemed that this film barely shook the box office, or for that matter, the nation, when it came into theaters near the start of the decade. A recent Director's Cut was released, adding a near half hour to the film, which, provoked my interest even more. Well, I wouldn't even say that. Prior to the releasing of the Director's Cut, I had never heard of such a film. I never knew it existed, and as I read the summary, I knew I had to see it. So, I did. I didn't get to see the Director's Cut, I honestly didn't want to, I wanted to examine this film from when it was first released. I knew the premise, something about a giant rabbit and the end of the world. Sounds right up my alley.

So, I went into the film with high expectations. A movie about a giant rabbit and the end of the world? And it's one of IMDb's top 100 films? It has to be good, with a premise so out there, and to be appreciated to the extent it would be given that honor, of course I went in with very high expectations. The opening shot of the film already raises a question. Donnie atop a cliff, appearing to be thrown from his bike. He lifts himself up, then smiles at the mountain tops in front of him. Already, the audience is confused. The movie takes place in 1988 in Middlesex, Virginia. Our main character is a troubled 16-Year Old who's recently refused to take a number of medications. At the moment, I was already disappointed. Yay, clichs. However, in a matter of less than twenty minutes, I found myself liking Donnie Darko's character to a very large extent.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie is the growing tension in every scene. You know something is going to go very wrong, even if it takes awhile. To see the characters develop around this growing tension, is what caused everything to have some sort of meaning. As little things were shown on screen, very minimal, I knew they had to mean something. I would hope this movie would not have thought I was stupid enough to either ignore them. Though, they were not too obvious either. I just have an eye for these things. Early in the film, Donnie awakens, and appears to be sleepwalking. He walks outside into his yard, where a grotesque bunny is waiting for him in the yard. He informs Donnie that the world will end in less than a month, it's presented in such a disturbing way that, well, you think the world is really going to end like this being is saying.

That's exactly what the film is though, terrifying. Is it scary? No. It's on a whole other level of emotion, one which penetrates you, and scares you in an emotional way. As the film continues, an apocalyptic tone is thrown all over it, with atmosphere that I have yet to see in any film. Underlining this film about the end of the world, the social commentary is dead on. It's a universal film, one that speaks of the corruption seen in our everyday society. Never have I been so disgusted to watch a rather common dance done by grade children. Once again, that's another element of the film. It's disgusting...But in a good way. Does that even make sense? The film needs to be looked at as if it were a 3D-Model. It needs to be watched numerous times for us to find meaning in it, even if that meaning is different to every single person that watches it. Everyone will see a different film. If you're looking for a End-Times Sci-Fi Thriller that will entertain you, look elsewhere. This is a film for those who want to analyze it, want to think about what they're seeing. Not saying that it is not entertaining, it's amazingly entertaining.

The film counts down the days until it's conclusion. Each day, the sun in the scene seems to be ab it dimmer, until it's completely pitch black. Never have I seen such creativity and imagination in a film, nor have I ever been so amazed by a piece of cinema. Dare I say I prefer this film over EOE? Dare I say that this film is the most amazing I have ever come across? I think I do. After the credits rolled, I was stricken with a feeling of sadness. It felt like it was ten seconds long. This film needs to be explored, and most importantly of all, remembered.

Review of the Director's Cut:

I gave the original release five stars, and is quite possibly my favorite film, right up there with EOE.

The Packaging:

Very good, honestly. The slip cover is a white image with Donnie's front and back as an example from the Philosophy of Time Travel. It's very attractive, and it's one of the few DVD slip covers I actually keep on the DVD. When you take it off, you get an even nicer cover. A very cool shot of Donnie with his axe, smiling into the camera. One of my favorite shots from the film, and with the dissapointment of the very ugly cover of the 2001 release, it's a sigh of relief. The discs are the same covers as the slip covers, which actually look very nice.

Special Features:

Very good. You get a very insightful, and funny, commentary with Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith. That alone is worth the money, and I see myself watching it again in the future. There is a very entertaining documentary on ""The #1 Darko Fan"" which is either a very funny parody, or a very sad true story. I have not looked up to see which one it is...There's a theatrical trailer, which is the Director's Cut trailer. The original trailer, man, I hate it so much. No wonder it did horrible at the box office. With a tagline such as ""Dark, Darker, Darko"" how do you expect to get viewers? There's also a documentary from the UK on the cult of Darko, which both provides a very cool look at the fans and Frank in alot of odd situations, that make it somehow creepy. Frank in a phonebooth? I don't know why, but was really odd.

Movie Picture:

The movie never did look very well. Colors run together, in some places there's white spots and glitches, nothing too special. It doesn't look bad, I would just expect more from a DVD from this century. Not sure if it's the way the film was shot, or just a bad DVD job.

Sound:

Very good. There's more background noise, easily noticed in class scenes and outside shots. Frank's voice never sounded so good, and pretty much everything is heard better than before.

Movie Review:

On one hand, the cut scenes added alot to the film, and made it pace alot better. It added awhole lot to Donnie himself, as we learn more about him and the people around him. On another hand, some scenes completely ruin the power the movie once had. I mean, I never thought such little changes could ruin an entire scene. In Donnie's famous scene with Cunningham, even the short segment with Jim running back and fourth in fast foward with slides in the background made the scene alittle less powerful. Some lines were even taken out! One of my favorite lines in the film, Frank saying ""I'm so sorry..."" to Donnie in the theater was ripped out. That made me so angry. I mean, if you know the meaning of the film, it's such an emotional statement. ""I'm so sorry I have to put you through this. I'm so sorry you have to die. I'm so sorry I killed Gretchen.."" The scene is dumbed down. Also, if the scenes with the books had been completely taken out, the film would be just as good, if not better as the original cut. They're so poorly done, I mean, just absolutely horrible. They come up on screen with very bad animation, and they are either cut too short and you can't read everything, or they fade so much with the background you can't make out the words. They're distractions. They take away from the previous and next scenes. Instead of just throwing in a cheap (Photoshop looking) book segment, why not reveal it some other way? Perhaps have a closeup of the book itself being read by another? Or just leave it out compeltely. Half the fun of the first film was not knowing what was going on by the end. Now that's all gone. It seems like a mess....And what happened to the countdown scenes? Those really added to the film, and now the film loses a whole lot of it's suspense because of it.

The ""Mad World"" scene, which was my favorite scene in the entire film, is now ruined by an overlay of a chapter of the book. Ugh. It just makes me so angry that he would ruin such a beautiful scene just to put in information. The mood of the movie is gone, and so is the disturbing aspect the original cut had. However, I don't regret getting this. The special features and commentary are worth it alone, and me being such a fan, I will keep this no matter what I think of the new cut. The old one is only $10 anyway, I'll get it eventually. I just wish they would have put both cuts on the DVD, I mean, then I wouldn't be dissapointed at all...But oh well. You can't win them all. The film is still good, but not great. The first cut was near perfect, but now this one shows Kelly's first time glitches unlike before. Sometimes you shouldn't fix what isn't broken. In no way is Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut a bad film. It's a good film...But by comparison to the original cut, it just falls flat.

It's no longer a film that disturbs and intrigues you, but rather with a bad taste in your mouth. You felt as if you missed something, even if the film is longer. It's less constructed, and almost feels as if it's just a bunch of scenes thrown together with anything constant.

The Director's Cut gets Three and a Half stars, and the original gets five. I averaged it out to five, simply because I'll feel horrible otherwise.",1109462400,9,9721,4.378048780487805

For those who haven't seen it, this DVD will be a real treat.  Donnie Darko is possibly the greatest character based sci-fi flick ever.

That said . . .  To my fellow hard core fanatics you may want to save your twenty bucks.  The 20 minutes of extra footage can all befound within the deleted scenes of the original DVD.  For those of us who have watched the movie at great lengths to figure out all it's subtle points, having them spoon fed in this directors cut is a bit much.  Some scenes we wished were in the original, some we were okay to see go.  But the one UNFORGIVABLE act was the changing of ""The Killing Moon"" to ""Never tear us apart""!  That song and mad world captured the feel of the original Donnie Darko like no other song could.  I bought the DVD because I wanted to see the documentary about the cult of Donnie Darko, but after hearing the new opening theme the film just somehow felt tainted.

To all newbies, none of this will be a problem.  You will watch, and undoubtably love the movie.  But for the already hard core fans, just beware.",1109462400,6,1212,4.21304347826087

I do think that the director's cut leaves a little less to the imagination by giving peeks into the book involved in the movie, but it's not a major negative.  It's just that I thought that the original version had my brain twisted for a month after watching it over and over again. So there's some bias involved there.
If you want to watch a movie that will force you to think about philosophy, religion, science, etc., AND entertain you by being a mixture of sci-fi/comedy/teen angst/drama type of movie, then you should definitely check this one out.  I've suggested it to many friends, and most of them, after watching it a few times, have come to the same conclusions.

1671774,2,B00005V3Z4,"I love ""Donnie Darko"", but was rather disappointed with this overhyped Director's Cut.  The film is now overexplained and overcooked, traits that made the original theatrical / DVD release so mesmerizing (incidentally, the 20 minutes added are already on the original DVD).  The director's choice to replace the Echo & the Bunnymen ""Killing Moon"" song with INXS' ""Never Tear Us Apart"" ruined the beginning of the film for me.

Stick with the original.",1109376000,9,451,5.1506849315068495
1671775,4,B00005V3Z4,"I saw the Director's Version in theaters last year, after reading an article in the paper that the original theatrical film became a ""cult hit"" on dvd after disappearing in theaters in 2001.  I had never heard of the film before (all I remember was a film called ""Donnie Brasco"" with Johnny Depp and had no interest in seeing that one), which is a shame because this film had the poor sense of timing (no fault of Director Richard Kelly) to be released in the month following the 9/11 tragedy, even though it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival many months earlier.  Had it opened in July or August of 2001, it might have become an even bigger financial success, which it certainly deserves.

When I watched the original theatrical version before seeing the Director's version, I didn't know what to make of this film.  Its a strange film that doesn't follow any linear pattern or conventional storyline, but it grabs your attention nonetheless with the awesome visuals, superb acting by a first rate cast, and has many funny moments punctuated by memorable, quotable lines.  This film, more than most I've seen, leaves a lasting impression after a first viewing.  While many films are instantly forgettable, this one stands above others with its unique vision and overall message.

What I love about this version over the original one are the inclusion of previously deleted scenes that should never have been deleted in the first place (and it was the studio obsessed with keeping the running time under two hours that demanded cuts).  The added scenes fill in some of the holes of the story, in particular, the scene where the father gives Donnie some good advice about being true to himself in spite of what others might think.  Its a funny moment, and a memorable one between father and son.  I also loved the scene where Drew Barrymore tells Donnie that maybe he and the Bunny can read ""Watership Down"" together.  That's a funny line that should never have been cut from the theatrical release.

What makes this film most memorable for me, where the director more than earned his right to direct future films, is the awesome scene when Tears for Fears ""Head Over Heels"" plays and we see a shortened, film-within-a-film, as all the elements of the overall film flow quite well with the music.  Its far better than most music videos I've seen and if they ever gave an Academy Award for best scene in a motion picture, that scene deserves the Oscar.  I also love the haunting melody and images of people grieving when ""Mad World"" plays.  An appropriately brilliant song, as are most song selections for this film.  The Sparkle Motion dance sequence was another memorable scene in the film particularly the way Drew Barrymore moves her eyes and head to the rhythms of Duran Duran's ""Notorious"", while still maintaining the blank stare of complete boredom.  Its hard to pull of something like that, but Drew does it perfectly.  Another brilliantly shot scene is when Jake Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone walk down the stairs in perfect synchronicity with each other.  The only change I didn't like from the original is that I thought ""Under the Milky Way"" fit much better with that sequence and the house party scene than the Echo and the Bunnymen song...but that's the only change I didn't like.

All in all, this film must be seen to be believed, and its complex enough to keep you wanting to watch it over and over, but also engagin enough to pull you into its mystery on first viewing.  This film could be a metaphor for many things and is worthy of a film discussion group.  The images of many scenes are beautifully crafted, well acted, and perfectly touched with the right music.  Director Richard Kelly has every reason to be proud of this notable achievement.  I can't wait to see what he will do with his next film, whenever that comes out.

One of the special features has a documentary by the supposed #1 Donnie Darko fan, which I found to be quite disturbing, especially at the very end.  That Director Richard Kelly would allow such a documentary to be included on his director's version dvd says a lot about him as a person (a nice guy, in other words).  Fans who are wanting him to write a complete book on time travel to fill out this Donnie Darko project are asking too much.  Let the director move on to other projects, bringing his unique vision to the screen.  As great as this film may be...its still just a movie and the Time Travel book was only a prop that doesn't deserve more attention than it has already gotten.",1109376000,3,4540,4.668341708542713

Coronado, the guy who wrote the ""Chut up and listen"" review, didn't actually write an original review; he simply copied Roger Ebert's review of the director's cut...go to Roger Ebert's website and see for yourself.
Now, about the movie...I just bought it today.  I own the original and have watched it a lot, but this was like watching a completely different film.  I won't describe all the changes, but now the film plays out very differently; it is slower, more unsettling, and explains some things that didn't really make sense in the original.  The film still (wisely) doesn't explain itself completely, but watching this there were a couple different moments when I suddenly thought ""Oh, that's what was going on!""  If you are a fan of the original you'll almost certainly like this version more, but if you've never seen either versions you should probably see the original first...watching this is kind of like watching one of the LOTR extended versions; more information is given and allows for a greater appreciation of this film.  Now that I've seen Richard Kelly's original vision of Donnie Darko, I can't wait to see what he'll hit us with next!",1109289600,4,1251,4.827102803738318

1671778,5,B00005V3Z4,"This is one of the few movies that keeps you thinking about it days after watching it. The basic plot is enough to stimulate even the most genius of people. As far as the acting goes, you really don't get much better than this. What makes this movie leaps and bounds better than other movies of this sort is that the execution is flawless and it makes you think. From beginning to end this movie keeps your attention and keeps you guessing at what might happen next.

The story revolves around Donnie Darko, a teen that doesn't quite fit in. He has two sisters and parents that are making him see a shrink. It's with his shrink that some of his inner-most thoughts are spoken. It's also with his shrink where he tells of his encounters with the mysterious Frank. Gretchin, his girlfriend, does help to take his mind off of the strange happenings that are going on around him at times, but at night is when everything happens to him. Mrs. Sparrow, also known as ""Grandma Death,"" seems to be his guide through what he experiences throughout this film. Her book, The Philosophy Of Time Travel, becomes Donnie's bible through his troublesome 28 days.

As I stated earlier, the acting is second to none. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) couldn't have portrayed a troubled teen better. Every second he's on screen you just become engrossed with him, nobody could've done a better job. Jena Malone (Gretchin) is also believable. She too is a troubled teen with an extremely perilous past. Her and Jake's romance is, to say the least, acted out perfectly. Also along for the ride is Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze, and Mary McDonnell. All of which seem to have brought they're A game. Donnie's family, I feel, was casted perfectly. The way they interact and talk to each other is so true to real life it's scary. Part of the reason they mesh so amazingly is because Jake's real sister was cast as his sister in the film. Pure genius.

Overall this is without a doubt my favorite film of all time. However hard it is to understand you are rewarded greatly for paying attention. The ending, while I was a bit disappointed for them not including the extra bit, was amazing. A great end to a flawless film. I also really admired how they didn't just spell everything out for you, they let you fill in the blanks with what you think might've happened. The movie couldn't have been better.",1109116800,8,2378,4.60377358490566
1671779,3,B00005V3Z4,"For starters, I assume if you're looking into reviews for this directors cut, you've seen the movie proper before.  I don't feel the need to rehash what many other people have already said about the movie.  So if you want a more critical assesment of the film, I encourage you to check out some of those other reviews.  But if you haven't seen the movie before, in a nutshell, just know that it involves a fallen airplane engine, time travel, a creepy bunny named Frank and Patrick Swayze(who may in fact be scarier than the freakshow bunny costume on display).  The movie plays like David Lynch-lite, but unlike Lynch, this actually makes a little sense without racking your brain too hard(I can almost hear Lynch's fans curseing at me now).  The purpose of this cut, as Mr. Kelly says himself, is to try and make the movie closer to what he wanted it to be in theaters.

Does it work?  It's longer, that's for sure, but your enjoyment of this cut depends on what you think of the movie.  If you're like the poor s.o.b. who shows up in one of the special features on the disc( more on him later ), than this could could very well help you achieve nirvana(the state of mind, not the band, for you kids out there).  Aside from some of the deleted scenes found on the first dvd release being reinserted into the film, we have some new stuff not seen before.  An additional scene with grandma Death, lengthly looks inside the book and close ups of Donnie's eye, which are very annoyingly the brightest shots in the movie, are included.  I personally don't think the additional scenes added much to the overall picture, if anything, they seem to me to be padding out the running time.

The main selling point of this dvd, no doubt, is the commentary with Mr. Kelly and Kevin Smith.  This is a fun track, with Mr. Smith cracking jokes and busting Kelly's chops over the more pretentious qualities of the the movie.  Also included are a production diary(listen to it with the commentary or you'll be bored to tears), ""They Made Me Do It Too"" featurette(fans, mainly ones fron the U.K., sound off), a storyboard-to-screen featurette and the director's cut trailer.  And then, the sad-sack I mentioned earlier has his own featurette, ""#1 Fan: A Darkomentary"" .  This guy has his room plastered with Darko stuff, dresses like Donnie and even stalks James Duval.  He also catches up to Mr. Kelly at the comic-con(a comics related convention, for those who don't know) and confronts him with the worst thing that an obsessed fan can do.

So, bottom line, is this dvd worth owning?  People looking to this version for additional insights into the movie might be let down.  If you buy into the whole "" Cult of Donnie "" thing that kids at Hot Topic stores around the country slop up like so much goth-tinged gruel, then this may be your bag of meat.  The commentary did it for me, but you just might want to stick with the first edition.",1109116800,4,2923,4.540076335877862
1671780,4,B00005V3Z4,"The original Donnie Darko deserves 6 stars.  This reworking of the classic is definately worth the ride, even though it will disappoint most Darko disciples.  The additions and changes are extensive, and the mood and tenor of the original are modified significantly.  Some new visual insertions are somewhat disjointed, i.e., ocean waves appearing at seemingly inappropriate points.  New insights into ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" through the flashing of various pages from the book add some excitement, but inevitably appear out of place and contrived.  The Michael Andrews score and the classic 80s & 90s songs in the original provided at least half of the eerie and bizarre mood, leading up to the thrilling anticipation of the climax with ""Under the Milky Way"" and finally with Andrews' ""Mad World"".  The remixed music in the Director's Cut is the most muddled and disappointing feature of the redux.  The only music Richard Kelly should have changed is the depressing durge at the ending credits. Additionally deflating is the redone climax.  Although more flashy, it adds no depth or dimension to the inter-dimensional denouement.  The original Donnie Darko is a rich hypnotic fantasy for affectionatos to obsess over.  The remake should be viewed once, and treated as an event that never really occurred, although the memory lingers.",1109030400,,1343,5.233644859813084
1671781,1,B00005V3Z4,"As a devoted fan of the theatrical release, I was deeply disappointed with the Directors Cut. The new footage and assorted changes add nothing substantive or interesting and the attempt to ""explain all"" reveals that the director himself does not understand what made the original one of the great cult movies in recent years -- that incredible mind-blow at the end of the movie, with only a clue as to what you just witnessed. With all the hitting you over the head with the ""meaning behind the story"", the wonderment was completey ruined.

So, if you've never seen Donnie Darko before, do yourself a huge favor and steer clear of this version and get the theatical release. If you have seen it already, don't waste your money on it either, since you will be bummed out by what the director has done.",1108944000,15,800,4.633802816901408
1671792,1,B00005V3Z4,"Yes, I do compare this version of the brilliant film Donnie Darko to Star Wars.  And why would this be relevant?  Because it seems that the director of this film, drunken with the ravings of fans and critics, has decided to make a small buck and tinker with something that was sacred..and you don't just do that.  Alright Richard Kelly, your movie was a cult hit, it touched lives, and it almost seems that the carelessness and savagery you've displayed in destroying your film are indicative of a general lack of care for your fans.  To quote one of your great characters in the film:  ""I have serious doubts about your commitment to Sparkle Motion!""  And what is so bad about this ""director's cut""?

  Many things, and too many to list here, but I'll throw out a few that Darko fans are sure to remember.  The opening scene, with it's beautiful panorama and ghostly music has been altered to include the intrusion of chirping birds and new sound effects that take away the original impact of the scene, afterwhich the Echo and the Bunnymen song ""Killing Moon"" has been replaced by the much less enthusiastic INXS song ""Never Tear Us Apart"".  Speaking of music, Kelly has taken songs out of their original place throughout the film and completely rearranged them in a much less compelling way.  Remeber that great scene where Donnie is following a timepath with the Church's ""Under the Milky Way"" playing?  Gone.  Replaced by the ending of the ""Killing Moon"", which just does not work.  One wonders if Kelly didn't just take all of the bonus material on the original DVD and slap it in, including the Roberta Sparrow book, rearrange the music and add a few new sounds in the mix.  Is this what fans wanted?  Maybe we were happy with what we had?  The extra scenes are all on the original, along with the book, so why buy this?  Well if you are like me, then you got caught up in all the ""Donnie Darko is being re-released in a suped up form"" hysteria and went out and impulse bought it.  Well I wish I hadn't, and from one fan to another, trust me..this one is not worth your money.",1108944000,29,2083,4.504

1671795,2,B00005V3Z4,"'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' (2005) offers audiences a restructured vision of the extraordinary 2001 Richard Kelly film, which stands with 'Haxan' (1922), 'Freaks' (1932), 'I Walked With A Zombie' (1942), 'Beauty And The Beast' (1947), 'Curse of the Demon' (1958), 'Eyes Without A Face' (1960), 'The Innocents' (1961), 'Carnival of Souls' (1962), 'The Birds' (1963), 'Blue Velvet' (1985), and 'Faust' (1994) as one of the greatest fantastic films ever created.

Sadly, the revision, however more closely it may dovetail with Kelly's personal vision, considerably dilutes the film's drama and power on almost every level.

While the theatrical release was fueled by its own judicious editing, structural hard edges, glorious ambiguities, and evocation of the suburban weird, the so-called director's cut continually literalizes the plot while simultaneously altering the status of essential story elements.

In a grave error of judgement, the daimonic rabbit Frank, a dominant presence in and the very symbol of the theatrical release, is now overshadowed by Roberta Sparrow's previously obscure book, The Philosophy of Time Travel, which is brazenly promoted into the foreground. Additional superfluous scenes of the Darko family interacting (which were wisely included as outtakes only in the original DVD) undercut the film' pivotal forward momentum, while the deletion of some of the mean-spirited dialogue Donnie's peers direct towards one another weakens the satiric and parodic humor of the original.

Key characters, like the free thinking, anti-establishment teacher beautifully portrayed by Drew Barrymore, now seem to have briefly wandered in from another film entirely.

Awash in new CGI effects, the director's cut should make more logical sense, but simply does not. The film's last ten minutes, in which everything that has gone before coalesces into terrible meaning, should have been considered sacrosanct and left unaltered.

As a result of these changes and others, a clever, multi-faceted, fairly original, and genuinely tragic film has become a muddy, unfocused, and protracted exercise in the unthreatening and the banal.

So in a reversal of several well-documented Orson Welles projects, including 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942), and the plot of Woody Allen's 'Stardust Memories' (1980), 'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' is a concrete example in which the much-maligned Hollywood executive machine has actually strengthened a creative work through forcible tampering.

For the film's reputation to continue to flourish, it is essential that the theatrical version remain in circulation; the obvious choice here would have been to include the mediocre director's cut in addition to the theatrical release.

Bonus ""special features,"" such as ""They Made Me Do It--The Cult of Donnie Darko"" and ""Number One Fan--A Darkomentary,"" are third rate, futile studies in self-applause and package padding which further embarrass the project as a whole.",1108944000,7,2975,5.667415730337079
1671796,4,B00005V3Z4,"Watching this version made me realize what made the orignal so good: the subtelty, the things left to the imagination.

However, I find it hard to really compare it to the original. I think its best to look at these two versions as seperate movies best for different audiences, the director's cut more suitable for mainstream American audiences and the original for people that like what mainstream Americans call ""weird"" movies.

If you are a fan of the original movie, then you might think these are bad things...

  - like another reviewer points out, most of the subtelty is gone.  Things are brought up and made apparent in the director's cut.  The ambiguity made the film more powerful, for me.  This is why Hitchcock films were great.  This is why the chainsaw scene in Scarface was scary without actually seeing the action.  The viewer's mind is much more powerful than anything on the screen could ever be.  This might be a matter of opinion or one's taste though.

  - The addition of sound design is way to apparent.  Too much birds chirping, classroom noises, background chatter, etc.  This is especially bad in the first 40 minutes of the film.  It makes the film seem less real.  That stuff isn't supposed to take attention away from a film, and it does in this version.  This is probably the only really bad thing about the movie.

  - It would have been nice to have the choice of watching the original version OR the director's cut on the same disc.  That way people new to the film can see the differences. Nobody really wants to buy a movie twice.

If you liked the original version, you will probably appreciate the things that are revealed in the director's cut as new insights.  The time travel stuff is explained a bit more.  Whether thats good or bad is arguable.  I think that is the main aspect that makes it seem like another movie.  In the original it was more mysterious so you just looked at it like something you can't know anyway so you focused more on how this phenomenom effected the characters, rather trying to understand the phenomenom itself.

There is dialogue about Donnie being agnostic that I think was better left out.  Now there's going to be a million teenagers suddenly becoming agnostic because its cool.  In my opinion this isn't even really important to the story and seems like a distracting attempt to add depth to Donnie's state of mind.

Overall I think the differences make the director's cut a different movie altogether. Its not a better movie or a worse movie, just a different take on the story.  Now you have a movie about time travel itself, parallel universes meeting, a teenager's contemplation about god and dealing with the average troubles of being a teenager.  In the original all these things were presented vaguely enough that you were left to consider the characters and their interaction with each other more than the actual stuff they are going through.

If you already have the original, you might as well get the director's cut for the simple reason that you get a new way of looking at the story.

If you have never seen either version, I highly suggest both though I prefer the original because its a bit darker and ""weirder"".  If you don't like ""weird"" movies, then check out the director's cut.",1108857600,4,3271,4.665499124343257
1671797,3,B00005V3Z4,"My rating and the following refers specifically to the Director's Cut. I would rate the original theatrical release five stars.

This director's cut brought to mind William Faulkner's line about writers often having to ""kill their darlings"" in order to meet the demands of a work's wholeness and integrity. Evidently, Richard Kelly was forced to kill his darlings with the theatrical release, and the result was close to perfection, if not perfection itself. The film's emotional force was stunning; its mysteries challenging; its pace so good that hitting pause to get more popcorn was impossible to do; its soundtrack (to my mind) a tour de force. It worked terrifically as a film experience, being a beautiful ""whole"" work of art. Extras that included Roberta Sparrow's book were great ... who really wanted to read the book during the movie anyways? (Which we can now do in the DC.)

Which does not mean a director's cut had no hope of working. Or even, maybe, revisions to the soundtrack (although I really think that was touchy business better left untouched). There were some good scenes deleted from the original, mainly between family members, and they didn't seem major pace-cutters. Fortunately, we do get those scenes here, but we also get the overwhelming force of the director's enthusiasm ... and WAY too much embedded detail of his personal vision.

On the upside, there's a nifty freedom to that enthusiasm which translates well into the Darko world IF you are also enthusiastic and into ""playing"" with Darko. In other words, if you love Donnie Darko already, you may find this cut a lot of fun. The pacing's completely blown, and the ending comes across flat compared to the original. (Kelly gets too detailed and baroque at the end, thus the impact of the ""Mad World"" music montage--don't want to include spoilers--and last scene is severely undermined.) Yet it's great to have more Darko, however we have to get it. And I don't regret buying this.

But if you've never seen the original DVD release, I cannot recommend this DVD set to you over that one. You will probably wonder why a cult ever built up around this film ... what anyone saw in it. You'll be missing that visceral power and compelling wonder that makes movies great and leaves you wanting to see a movie again ... immediately, if possible.

Donnie Darko was a little miracle of a film that cast a huge shadow. The director's cut joins many other films that try for bigness and achieve little ... unless, of course, in Darko's case, you've already seen the light and are into shadow-play.",1108857600,104,2573,4.838636363636364

It was disappointing to say the least and I do not recommend buying it unless you are a die-hard fan of the film.  If you have not seen the film SEE THE ORIGINAL FIRST (at least twice)

After watching the director's cut, I have come to the realization that Richard Kelly was the victim of the rare ""hollywood first timer's luck syndrome"", where a writer's first big movie turns out to be spectacular, despite his or her best efforts.  Another past sufferer of this rare affliction was Bryan Singer (the writer/director of The Usual Suspects).

The theatrical release of Donnie Darko was a rare cinematic gem. Mysterious and thought-provoking because it left so much to be interpreted by the viewer.  All at once it was a film about love, sacrifice, God, time travel, insanity and the supernatural (at least to me it was.  Others feel differently and that is why the movie was so great).  After watching the director's cut of the film I realized that, had Mr. Kelly had his way, the film would have ended up as a simple scifi flick about multiple dimensions and time travel to save the world.

In the director's cut, much of the subtelty is gone.  We are allowed to see the pages of the time travel book, which explain what is about to happen in the next scenes in case (god forbid) the audience is puzzled.  Donnie and his psychiatrist blatantly discuss Atheism and the search for God. The perfect, sharp comedy of the Jim Cunningham school assembly scene now drags on and on. The final flashback scene becomes an industrial, robotic construct and loses all of its emotional impact because there is now a grid and computer text scrolling across the screen.

Most of these changes were in the original cut of the film but Mr. Kelly was forced to remove them because of time constraints. Now that he can have his way, the movie shows too much and is reduced to a simple story about a ""chosen one"" who must save the world.

The most disappointing feature of this DVD is the much anticipated, yet absolutely worthless commentary track for the film.  In it, writer/director Richard Kelly and his buddy ramble endlessley and joke with each other about topics completeley unrelated to what is going on on-screen.  I was so angry that I had to stop the commentary.  The first ten minutes of the commentary track are spent discussing whether or not the writer of The Breakfast Club liked to listen to music while he was writing.  Meanwhile, priceless scenes go by without any attention paid.

Donnie Darko, The Director's Cut is an opportunity wasted.

PS - The last straw for me in this director's cut was the changing of the dialogue in the scene where Drew Barrymore gets fired and the deletion of the perfect and classic ""Get off the stage Cherita"" line during the talent show.",1108598400,32,2964,4.645593869731801

I really enjoy the Theatrical Cut.  I think it leaves so much to the imagination that the impact of the film is felt greater.  At the San Diego Comic Con, Richard Kelly told the audience how the Director's Cut came about.  ""Donnie Darko"" never got it's fair shake when it was first released.  This was probably due to the film being released soon after 9-11, when people (quite understandably) were not in the mood to see a dark movie about plane parts falling from the sky and the end of a world.

When the film did surprisingly well on home DVD release, the studio allowed Kelly to add in a few things that he had always wanted to, in order to give them an excuse to release the movie theatrically again and give it another chance.  This was very good on the studio's part (unfortunately, they didn't market it very well on it's second release).  Anyway, now we have this new version.

I was set off by the new opening.  Don't worry, there are no big spoilers here.  The only difference in the new opening is the music.  Richard Kelly said that the opening was designed to go with ""Never Tear Us Apart"" by INXS, and I can see that; but it works SO WELL with Echo and the Bunnymen's ""Killing Moon"".  Now that INXS would finally sell them the rights for the new release, I can see why they used it.  It still seems odd, though, since I'm used to (and prefer) the other song.

After that initial startling change, I settled into this new version of the movie.  I did enjoy the further interaction between the members of Donnie's family.  I think that added a lot to the film.  I'm on the fence about the additions with the explanations of the book and time travel.  I think, sometimes, not knowing details can be better.  Sometimes the audience's imagination can be much more impressive than the film maker's.  Not completely understanding the Theatrical Cut when I first watched it is one of the things that I thoroughly enjoyed about it.

I'd write more, but I don't want to give the film away for those who haven't seen it.  Even though they are 90% the same, these two films feel like very different movies.  It's one of those rare films where I'm going to own both the Theatrical Cut and the Director's Cut.  I've done this with The Exorcist, Legend, Brazil, Army of Darkness, and maybe a few other movies where both versions have left me with very distinct feelings, and different things to think about.  If you have never seen ""Donnie Darko"", I think you might want to start with the Theatrical Cut.  After that, if you are confused or simply want more of this great movie, then watch the Director's Cut.",1108512000,6,2781,4.497005988023952
1671812,4,B00005V3Z4,"This review concerns the newly released Director's Cut of Donnie Darko.

 Fans take notice there is a new kid on the block, but it's not all peaches and roses.

 Many of the scenes have been changed.  Some have had material added.  The music has been changed and moved around.  A few of the original songs are gone from the original DVD, Under the Milky Way, and The Killing Moon are gone.

  They cut out some stuff too.  The scene with Sparkle Motion is indeed done to Notorious, which I read had originally been changed, it hasnt.  While the song Notorious is still there, the scene has changed in other ways.  No longer do you hear someone from the audience yell, ""get off the stage Cherita"" and ""you suck""  during here Autumn Swan dance.  Its weird now, b/c Cherita looks around as does others as if someone had just yelled offensive stuff but since the lines were removed, it just seems strange now.

 So many other changes... I don't want to bore you with that.  Let me get to my point here people.

  If you haven't seen Donnie Darko in any form, skip this one and watch the original DVD release without a doubt.

 For the majority of you who have seen or own Donnie Darko already, this DVD is nothing more than a appendix to the original.  It tells you more, answers more questions.  But to a large extent, these questions were better left unanswered.

 I love this film, but I am rather dissapointed with the Director's Cut.  The original DVD cut is much better, the music choices are better, and the pacing is much better. Enjoy the Director's Cut if you are a true fan, but watch the orignal DVD for the rest of your life.",1108512000,13,1634,4.410774410774411
1671813,4,B00005V3Z4,"""Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut"" takes the audience down the rabbit hole on a long, strange trip that alternately becomes, surreal, comic, dramatic and just plain scary. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) suffers from hallucinations and takes medication to help control his ""visions"". One night after taking his medication he has an encounter with a large, rancid, evil looking six foot tall rabbit who informs him that the world is going to end. ""Frank"" (as he calls his imaginary friend) takes him briefly into the future disappearing and reappearing throughout the film. Evidently only Donnie can stop it. The film moves from fantasy to reality with no clear indication as to whether or not Donnie's ""visions"" are real or if everything is in his imagination. Using a soundtrack made up of 80's staples (""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" by Joy Division, ""Head Over Heels"" by Tears For Fears, ""Never Tear Us Apart"" by INXS among many other titles), director/writer Richard Kelly creates a bizarre satire of suburbia and surreal science fiction drama. Kelly's original version of the film featured some different songs and was shorter (and features new sequences and optical effects not in the 2001 release) but also seemed more open to interpretation. The allegorical references sprinkled throughout the film along with the bizarre dream sequences made the original film both fascinating and plain weird.

This new director's cut makes the film less opaque and adds an element of the ""Twilight Zone"" to Kelly's rich, original vision. The director's cut isn't necessarily a better film just different. Visually stunning and with an outstanding cast, inscrutable script ""Donnie Darko"" was just different enough to not score with audiences post-9/11. That's tragic as this totally original film makes an impression whether you're watching the original version or the director's cut of the film.

 ""Donnie Darko"" lives up to its title with a number of unusually dark images. Fox has done an admirable job translating this film to DVD.  Unfortunately, Director Kelly and DP Hunter went for a muted, gauzy look with soft blacks and muddy image reproduction. There's nothing we can do about and Fox has done the best with what they were given. I did notice occasional analog flaws pop up on the print but aside from that it looks pretty good despite the limitations placed on the film by Kelly and Hunter. I'm surprised that Fox didn't use the extended branching approach here that they did with  the""Alien Quadrilogy"" boxed set but that could be simply because the film has been reshuffled too much to do so. The 5.1 and 2.0 mixes sound solid although the sound is a bit murky towards the conclusion with some distortion on this edition of the film.

 Fox wisely put all the extras on disc two of this set allowing the film to benefit from the extra disc space. We get a ""Donnie Darko Production Diary"" (with optional commentary by Director of Photography Steven Poster). . There's also a commentary track by Director of Photography Steven Poster in the Donnie Darko Production Diary which provides an interesting insider's perspective and lots of trivia about the production of the film. Featuring camcorder shot footage of the search for locations and behind-the-scenes footage of the production, it's an interesting glimpse into the process of pre-production. #1 Donnie Darko Fan is the result of an internet contest for the best short film about being a fan of this film. The winner's film is included and gives a glimpse into the odd world of fandom. We also get a storyboard to screen comparison for a key sequence from the film. They Made Me Do It features interviews with British fans of the film discussing what drew them to the film and how it changed their view of the world.

 A fascinating commentary track by Director Kelly who discusses his film with fellow Director Kevin Smith (""Clerks""). It's, at turns, informative, philosophical and very involving. Does it answer the big questions about this film? Not exactly but it wasn't designed to do that either.

Kelly's original vision has been revised somewhat in this ""Director's Edition"" of Donnie Darko. The meaning of Kelly's film is still, ultimately, open to debate and while the film may be a bit less ambiguous than the first theatrical cut, its also got its fair share of great moments as well.  The first disc comes with a terrific commentary track by Kelly and Director Kevin Smith. The second has all the extras including a documentary on the making of the movie, a glimpse at the fandom following this unusual cult film. We also get to see the film that won the contest for #1 Donnie Darko fan. While it's not something to crow about it is an interesting look at what levels the fans of this unusual and great little movie will go to. Be warned fans of the theatrical cut that this version runs longer, has different songs and may spoil some of your pet theories about the film's meaning.",1108425600,12,4944,4.908982035928144

1671815,5,B00005V3Z4,"It's too bad that Donnie Darko never received that theatrical run it deserved, because I can say without a doubt that it IS one of the ten best film of the last decade. Genre entertainment doesn't get better than this!

Donnie Darko is a very disturbed boy. He seems depressed, quite lost in his own life. Things happen around him, things he cannot explain, things he has no control over. His life just doesn't seem to make any sense. So when a very tragic incident occurs in his neighbourhood, his life will be changed forever.

The plot is so twisted, the story line so messed up that it's impossible to explain what the film is about in just a few words. What I can say is that Donnie Darko offers one of the best story's I've seen on the screen in a very long time. Great performances, a great supporting cast and a great storyline makes this one a winner in my book.

Now, with the new director's cut, we're offered more of this cult classic. Scenes are added and a new soundtrack, the one the director first wanted before money became an issue in postproduction, only inhence the great experience that Donnie Darko offers its viewers.

This is one movie any film lover should see. Donnie Darko will amaze you, will leave you breathless, and will make you want to see this one again. I've seen it six or seven times already, and I just can't wait to see it again. Donnie Darko truly is a modern classic.",1108425600,5,1408,4.424710424710424

Donnie Darko is a beautifully directed film, with a thick storyline that is compelling and completely unpredictable.  It's so different from any other film, there really is no way of classifying it.  This is an incredible film and strongly suggest it to all, although some parts may disturb younger viewers, but it is amazing.

I watch a lot of films, which means I now predict just about every second of each new, boringly predictable film.  This is completely different.

My personal favorite  character is Frank, the demonic spirit rabbit from the future. His creepy voice and sudden ghost-like appearances really make you shiver. Anyone who likes  Johnny The Homicidal Maniac would absolutely love this movie. It has the  same dark humor and twists.

Unfotunatle even though the movies entertaining. and the ending somewhat suprising, the movie failed to leave me with any lasting effects. I just wasn't really that interested in the ""depth"" alot of people seem to get out of this movie, since all just pointless depth for depths sake. It doesn't address anything important, just uses a tapestry of sci-fi, religious schitzophrenic psycological under tones to enhance a other wise normal love story with a pretty cliched, sacrifice ending.

1671820,5,B00005V3Z4,"Obviously I haven't seen the DVD yet -- but I did see the Director's Cut three times during the two weeks it played in Boston last September.  The restored footage does two things.  First, it enhances and fleshes out what was already a wonderful troubled-adolescence story.  Second, and more importantly, it moves the movie away from David Lynchian ambiguity and makes it, instead, what the director always intended: an airtight, completely explicable work of science fiction, one whose basic, essential storyline can be fully grasped on the first viewing (as evidenced by the half a dozen DD newbies I dragged with me, all of whom got it and all of whom loved it).  There is still, of course, an astonishing amount to be grasped on repeated viewings: the more I saw it, the more it moved me.

Donnie Darko would be a ***1/2, 9/10 movie if it had no sf element at all, if it were just a conventional story of a troubled teen.  Combine that with a mind-expanding, intricate sf story that says profound things about the nature of destiny and free will -- and you get what is almost certainly the greatest non-futuristic, non-eye candy work of sf cinema.",1106611200,5,1151,4.701492537313433

Though the director's cut makes the film slightly more easily explained, it in no way detracts from the sense of mystery.  Plenty of questions still remain.  The added scenes also explore more of the family relationships and add a greater degree of humanity and humor to the film.  Highly recommended, even if you already own the original cut.  This is definitive.  A job VERY well done.",1106438400,,456,4.6375
1671822,1,B00005V3Z4,"The first thing that occurs to me when I think of this movie is a quote from the Simpsons.  Moe has radically remodeled his bar, and it is now filled with assorted eurotrash, yuppies and pseudo-hipsters.  Homer and friends appear at the grand re-opening and are taken aback by the crowd and environment.  Looking up at a TV above the bar that is showing an image of an eyeball blinking and looking wildly around, they ask him what the hell it's for.  ""It's po-mo"" says Moe. This elicits no reply from the guys. ""You know, post-modern?"" Silence.  ""Weird for the sake of weird.""

That would be my phrase of choice to sum up Donnie Darko; or perhaps better put ""Ironic for the sake of Ironic"".  Why set your supposedly ""deeply affecting"" sci-fi, teen coming of age story in the 80's?  So you can set a SLOW MOTION montage (let me repeat that; SLOW MOTION MONTAGE) to Head Over Heels of course! Wait, WAIT!  Couldn't you also have a group of stony faced pre-teen girls in silver leotards perform an interprative dance to Notorious?  GENIUS I say!  Also that way you could have your attractive and (mostly) talented cast dress up in unflattering clothing as well.  Hell, you'd even have an excuse to use that lame Smurf discussion that's been sticking out like a sore thumb in all your other screenplays.  Cheap, CHEAP devices.  These are the kind of jokes that require no insight or thought on the part of their creator. They only provide a laugh of recognition, a self satisfied feeling that you are cool enough to know the non-sequitur or kitsch factor inherent in the scene you're watching.  Really now, it's basically a hyper-intellectuallized  version of MAD TV at that point.

Every single component of this movie simply SCREAMS at the audience ""I AM SO AMAZINGLY CLEVER!"" or, alternately ""I AM SO AMAZINGLY LAZY!""  It feels like the filmmakers just threw on screen some commonly accepted cinematic signifiers of profundity, social commentary, romance, or what have you, and called it a day. Having stilted line readings and a non-linear plot does not make a film profound.  Having a soundtrack that sounds like a VH1 list show does not make a film clever.  Ending a film with a major sacrifice on the part of one of the main characters is meaningless if you have not earned any sort of emotional investment from the audience.  There is a distinct coldness and distance between the audience and the characters in this movie, which wouldn't be a problem if the movie then didn't expect you to care about the budding of young love and the self sacrifice it compels young lovers towards.  Countless people have told me that this film has literally moved them to tears.  I genuinely don't understand how a movie with such an icy, cynical void at its center could do that.  I'm not saing that I sit around and watch Shakespeare in Love on an endless loop all day, but this movie claims it's one thing (love/coming of age story), but does everything in its power to convince you otherwise.  It lacks commitment to any one point, outlook or plot thread and ends up not accomplishing anything; that is, anything aside from annoying me to the core of my being.

Oh, and Drew Barrymore's performance was stunningly bad.",1106265600,24,3211,4.689285714285714
1671823,5,B00005V3Z4,"I had heard about this for a few years but didn't know what it was about and just happened to rent it while passing by it in the rental store a couple months ago. I was expecting a thriller like most other thrillers (people run around, evil bunny rabbit or something etc) but I was soooooo wrong. This movie wasn't what I was expecting, it was better. The whole movie feels like a dream and its great sountrack only inhances this. The 80s songs are great and go perfect with every scene without being cheesy or anything. The story is unique the movie is beautifly shot. I just cannot say enough good things about this movie. Acting-Great. Music-Awesome. Story-Brilliant. I could go on.

The movie though isn't for everyone. You'll either hate it or love it. But you at LEAST have to give it a chance and watch it TWICE before you decide. The first time I saw it, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew was that I couldn't stop thinking about it and wondering what the heck I just watched. So I watched it again, still didn't get it but I really liked alot better the second time. In my opinion, the movie just keeps getting better everytime you watch it. You notice new things, you make up new thoeries, and you understand it a little better each time. I finally had to buy the movie after I couldn't stop thinking about it and Ive watched it at least 12 times since Ive gotten it the day before Christmas and Im still not tired of it.

Im not usually one who would like a movie like this but just something about it that really grabs me and stuff that I cant stop watching it. When Im not watching it, Im thinking about it.

However, I have seen the actually movie when it was in theaters and I own the DVD of Donnie Darko. Some people don't think the Director's Cut adds much, but I think it adds a whole lot. It's a lot easier to understand than the original cut and it flows so much better with most of the deleted scenes from the Donnie Darko DVD included plus splices of the Philosophy of Time Travel and a few changed songs.

For those of you who know nothing about this movie I can't tell you anything about it =P It's a movie that you can't summarize other than saying that it's deep and awesome. It starts out with a boy being saved from an airplane engine falling into his room and killing him by a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit named ""Frank"" who tells him that the world will end in 28 days. See? It sounds hokey, but trust me, it's not. The cast is impressive with Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhall, James Duval, and Mary McDonnell. It's written and directed by newcomer Richard Kelly, who has also written the upcoming film Domino.

The dialogue in this film is smart and intriguing. The acting is spot-on, and you can't even tell that it was made low-budget. The Director's Cut gives you more of a feeling that every single scene matters, and it does. It has these beautiful scenes that were cut for the sake of having it under 2 hrs, but they add so much to the overall feeling of the plot including information about Donnie's medication, a scene about Watership Down, and some other scenes I'm not at liberty to spoil. If you're trying to figure out which one you should get, get this one! Some people argue that they don't like how he changed the songs, but it's his vision and he put in the songs that he couldn't afford to put in before, it really doesn't change the plot.",1104883200,7,2177,4.451127819548872

There's no way to do so, really; even with the most thorough, scene-by-scene, clear as mud analysis, you'll still be trying to figure it out for days after you first see it.

Secondly, please know what you're talking about before you open your mouth. This movie is not an attack on religion. It's quite the opposite. Anyone with any sort of an open mind can see this clearly; if you want proof, kindly refer to the deleted scenes of this DVD. The third one is an extended version of the first sequence between Donnie and Frank. Listen to the commentary on this. It clearly states that Donnie Darko is a movie about DIVINE INTERVENTION.

At worst, it's the greatest contribution the Emo sub-culture to date, out-stripping The Cure.

I've seen this movie a few hundred times now, and if you knew me you'd probably understand that it's not that strange of a boast at all for me to say it. I currently own three different versions of this and have sifted the contents and commentaries of all of them. The Original Theatrical Release, The Director's Cut (White Box) and the Region 2, UK Release (Black Box with hologram). So far, my favorite is the Original Theatrical release and for the following reasons.

1. Richard Kelly tells the viewer in both versions of the Director's Commentary that he could never get clearance or the money for the songs he wanted to do the film with originally and was `forced' to change some of the music after he toured the film with festival rights. Well ... in all honestly, it was probably for the better that he didn't have the money. I can't bear to watch the film start with the alternate music. Echo and The Bunnymen's `The Killing Moon' is a perfect and very haunting opus-like opening to the film that should have never been messed with in retrospect, regardless of whatever came before it. Tampering with it in such a way is like taking `As time goes by' out of Casablanca, which Michael Curtiz and Jack Warner would've done had Ingrid Bergman not cut her hair and been unavailable to do reshoots and pick-ups.

2. The fireworks at the end is superfluous and a bad choice of visual effects to have man-handled inappropriately into the film. It comes off as a thuggish way to treat the original, without doubt. The eyeball visual and the ocean waves are interesting and seem to fit the tone, but anything after that is just grasping at amateur theatrics.

3. While I do appreciate the additional scenes and the on-screen text of `The Philosophy of Time Travel', it does add to the film, but with the other two mentioned points and the shifting of key music, it negates whatever is gained by the on-screen text.

I remember when Donnie Darko was released and was being advertised with the ad campaign posters all over Hollywood. They were able to secure the large billboard on the corner of Fairfax and Hollywood Blvd and I remember thinking: `Wow, what an odd looking poster. What the hell is that all about?"" But I never saw a trailer once.

The ad campaign this film received was atrocious to say the least and it was no fault at all of the filmmakers or flower films, but a direct failure of 20th Century Fox executives who didn't really know what to do with this, even though teen horror was the biggest grossing money-makers in the business at the time. All they needed to do was just advertise it and let the masses decide to go see it. Typically though, almost every modern classic has been panned or mishandled and sometimes this just adds to the beauty and the lore that follows the film ever after.

Unfortunately, the film hit theatres in limited release (LA, NY) just a week and half before 9-11, and much like David Fincher's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Game/dp/B000069HZP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Game</a>, which was sunk by the death of Princess Diana, Donnie Darko suffered an equal fate and quietly slipped out of theatres robbing Kelly of the immediate notoriety he should have garnered and does deserve. To be fair though, Kelly does have a pretty unstable reputation as a filmmaker and a Howard Hughes ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hell-s-Angels/dp/B0002MHE1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hell's Angels</a>&nbsp;type of aura regarding his movies.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Southland-Tales/dp/B0011VIO3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Southland Tales</a>&nbsp;took much longer for Kelly to get out and into theatres than was ever needed, and he pretty much spent the 00's working on one film, where his peers put out 3,4 and 5 films, even with Tony Scott taking him under his wing. Work ethic is probably not the problem, but writing and post-production tinkering seems to be his Achilles heel.

Donnie Darko will surely be remembered as his masterpiece. For several years the film had successfully supplanted and pushed out midnight viewings of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rocky-Horror-Picture-Show/dp/B00004U8P9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>&nbsp;and their antic driven followers, for the much more morose Donnie Darko and the coffee-clatching style of discussion that often followed afterwards. Having attended both of those in my life, I do not elevate one over the other but enjoyed both equally.

Everything about the Theatrical Release of Donnie Darko is pure magic and the stuff of great filmmaking. Kelly's writing here leaves just enough for the viewers imagination without spoon-feeding and raises enough questions to cause a prolonged dilemma.

It's not just good for it's characters, cinematography, and dialogue (all of which were nicely portrayed in their simplicity), but it causes one to consider the human condition. It made me think about concepts such as predestination and fate and the possibility of altering such destinies. Sure, this film is science fiction, but such factors should not- do not hinder the lasting effect of the film. You can't help but ponder existence. It's a hair's breadth from impossible to watch this film and not feel something stir within you.

This is a film best viewed without the threat of interruption. If you don't watch it in full, I guarantee that you will miss something, and will therefore not be able to form your own conclusion to the tale. What was the ending's purpose, what were the significances of certain events, and what exactly the movie was about can only be answered when you've experienced a thorough viewing.",1103068800,,1083,4.912568306010929

At first watching it seemed very good, however after viewing only one more time I realized I was wrong. This movie has several plot holes, a horrible poorly executed ending, and very little interesting dialogue. Also, I noticed that some people who say they like the movie like it for its apparent ""theoretical"" significance, but don't be fooled. The people I know who have said this are actually just trying to sound smart which is obvious due to the fact that this movie is in no way theoretical. In fact, this film is liked mostly due to it's lame cliche moral having to do with the decisions we as humans make.

I got lost somewhere and could not quite wrap my brain around what happened. But, it all came together with the director's explaination and I found that to be unfortunate because this could have been a terrific movie. It just missed something and I am still trying to figure out what that was. My poor 15 year old daughter STILL doesn't get it.

Jim Cunningham, a motivational speaker, draws a deranged belief that all things come from the emotions of fear and love, the basic principles of Christianity.

People easily embrace the theories after they get used to them. This movie is great, and the soundtrack is awesome! I loved Harvey From Hell, ""Frank"" the demonic bunny rabbit. Again, SciFi nuts should check it out. I hope they do a sequel focusing more on Parallel Universes; I could do with seven or eight Donnies!",1101772800,4,544,4.797872340425532

I knew pretty much nothing about it when I saw it, other than there was a guy named Frank, and my friend really liked it.  I was blown away.  I have seen it countless times since, and spent a long time analyzing it.  This movie is the perfect mix of funny, touching, beautiful, and very meaningful.  It is not at all scary, unless you are frightened by bunnies.

If you like philosophical discussion, you will love this movie, but just because you don't does not mean you won't like it.  You'll probably love it anyway, and maybe you'll start to like philosophical discussion.

No matter what, this movie contains one of the funniest lines in the world: ""He asked me to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into my anus!""

From the relationships within the family, to Frank's prophecy of doom, this is the perfect movie.  The director's cut contains several sweet, funny, and informative scenes that were cut from the original.  It also contains some more explanation for those who don't enjoy being completely confused.  I myself found it fun to try and figure things out on my own, but i still enjoyed this version which in no way spelled it out.",1101686400,5,1191,4.668269230769231
1671838,3,B00005V3Z4,"I watched this movie and when it was over.... nothing. No deep thought provoking, earth-shattering wonder. It was just a movie.

A teenage boy with paranoid delusions can see into the future. He gets his prophecies from a dude in a psycho bunny suit who he ends up shooting. With special effects similar to The Deep or The Abyss, watery auras extend from people's chests and lead them through life. Drew Barrymore plays an English teacher who tries to do things her way and gets canned.

The world ends on A certain day as told by the rabbit, but time only stops for Darko because he does not leave his room. A piece of falling airplane falls through the roof and kills him. Of course that sets time back a month and everyone knows they have 30 days or so to live again.

All in all the flick was OK, but I wouldn't watch it again. Nor would I want to listen to Tears for Fears in the soundtrack.

Patrick Swayze plays a whacko who has a VHS set that helps people handle their fear. He later gets nabbed as a psycho with a child porn ring that is run from his house.",1100649600,4,1066,4.236453201970443
1671839,4,B00005V3Z4,"It actually is pretty hard to classify this movie as one thing or another... i suppose drama/sci-fi would probably be the best classification.  Don't be fooled by the movie cover, it's actually a lot better than you'd be led to believe... and I don't consider it to be a horror movie by any means, so disregard the little catch-phrase.

Just to answer many of those who do honestly believe that this movie ""sux"" or whatever, I can't tell you that you're opinion's invalid... but personally I really love this movie, and in my books its up there with the likes of fight club.  One of the defining attributes that makes this, what i consider to be, a ""good"" movie, is that the viewer isn't force-fed a cut-and-dry series of events.  There is some ambiguity in what goes on in the movie, and that is what I believe drives it in a direction that entices thought and discussion.  The non-sense about how this movie is anti-christian or whatever else is purely based upon that individual's interpretation that Frank was actually a divine messenger or likeness of, but that is by no means the only reasonable possibility.  In any case, the story deals too much with the theme of fate and chance to really be seen as a slug at christianity.  It does however do a good job at poking fun at the 80s and some school-experience jokes... i.e. ""if there is any vice-presidential candidate worthy of my vote, it has to be Dan Quayle"", and the love/fear exercise.

I gave this four stars because although it is very good, i think it could've been better... i have yet to see the director's cut and perhaps i would view that as a 5/5.  This movie is very well done, with well-composed music and an enjoyable story.

I obviously hated this movie,so of course all of the idiots who praise this garbage will say that I am close-minded (kind of ironic that all of these people who long for different points of view instantly bash the ones they don't agree with!)

Since so many are so very blind as to what this movie is,I'll go ahead and make it clear:Donnie Darko is just a total attack on religon esp. Christianity,right-wing politics and any form of morality that one might decide to uphold. All of this propoganda is coated with a science-fiction sub-plot of time travel,so as to not make it TOO apparent.

Oh yes,this movie is so very original! Make good people look evil
and evil people look good. Righteousness MUST be hypocrisy...
Gee Hollywood,you certainly haven't been beating that dead horse for the past 30 years. Wonder if you can ever create something new with YOUR closed mind?

And as far as this ""extrodinary"" storyline goes,let me just see if I get this straight.... God sends a man who was shot in a stupid looking bunny suit back in time to the man who shot him because he wanted him to kill himself instead of living life because death is better than living with a mental disorder...
I think you should lay off the funny leaves Beavis!

The dialouge in the movie also said that timetravel could be possibile if a large enough vessel was used that traveled faster than the speed of light AKA a spaceship. Uhm,an airplane can't travel faster than the speed of light;even when it's crashing into the earth. Yes,it wil travel very,very fast;but NOT fater than the speed of light. I wonder if the creator of this movie even understands how fast the speed of light is?

Anyway since the airplane crashing wouldn't travel faster than the speed of light,no wormhole would be created,and so that adorable little windbag Donnie Dorko could not travel back in time. Thus our story(or lack there of) is no more. Game over man!

All I know is that I wish I COULD GO BACK IN TIME to stop myself from watching this and do something else with the 3 hours of my life that I lost!!",1100563200,12,2169,4.520408163265306

He gets kudos for reading a couple of familiar and meaningful books but that is all.  It is just fantastic how many try to articulate supposed meanings into this film when not even its writer/director knew what the heck he was doing. There is more substance in the attempted interpretations than this film could ever have.  It is amazing how people let their imaginations run wild in trying to decifer reasons.  this is a good film to watch while reading your favorite book on a comfy couch..",1100044800,4,771,4.503597122302159
1671842,5,B00005V3Z4,"For those of you that have seen the original version of this film, the director's cut fills in some unanswered questions and nearly takes this film into a whole new genre.  After leaving this film last night at the theater, my wife and I had another two-hour discussion about this film.  One of the discussions that we had was if the director's cut perhaps moved this perfect film from the world of fantasy into the world of science fiction.  This is something to think about when you watch this edition.  The ending of this film (not to give anything away) opens the door to the possibility of the genre change.  Throughout the film there are hints towards this chance change, but it isn't until the end that it becomes clearer.  That is what impresses me about Richard Kelley's unbelievable film, it opens your mind to several new ideas and possibilities.  He does this by adding chapters from the book ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" to better guide us through the different phases that Darko encounters and experiences.  Also, Kelley adds the images of the human eye to several of the scenes to create a stronger connection between the tangent universe and reality.  This director's cut seemed more like a dream than the original, and I thoroughly welcomed this change.

There are a handful of other scenes that Kelley adds that helps enhance the world around Donnie.  We learn a bit more about his parents, his girlfriend, and his therapist.  There also seems to be more referencing to religion in this edition.  I was overjoyed to see this because I felt that was an aspect missing from the original.  There is a wonderful discussing in this film between Donnie and his therapist concerning the difference between an atheist and an agnostic.  This powerfully sealed the film for me.  It allowed a bit more insight in Donnie's character as to where he stands on the issue of God and the strange events that are happening around him.  It was as if the final piece of the puzzle was finally put into place.

Thankfully with these extra scenes and better sound we can witness Donnie Darko in it's purest form.  The way the director wanted it to be.  We finally were able to see the finished product, and for some it may not be the finale they desired, but for this film fanatic it was extra icing on the cake.  The additions of some new songs only help build the already haunting sound of this film.  Honestly, who can match the remake of the Tears for Fears song ""Mad, Mad World""?  It seemed like it was made explicitly for this film.  Finally, how can you challenge a film that releases the secret to time travel?  The truth is out there?  Not unless you have seen this film.  There are some cases when a director's cut will dramatically change the structure and sensation of the film.  This was not the case here.  Kelley changed nothing with his deeply developed characters or the overall story.  The only aspect that I feel did change (and possibly not for everyone) was the possible genre switch.  It will be up to you to see if this is true or not.

Donnie Darko continues to remain on my top eleven films ever list.  I do not see it dethroned anytime soon, especially with the release of this director's cut.  It is a cultural phenomenon and a thought provoking film that will leave impressions on your mind for years to come.  You will not see films like this in the recycled Hollywood riff that is currently being released, and I doubt we ever will, so go out and buy this film today.  It honestly is one of the greatest ever to escape the grasp of Hollywood.

You will never experience a film like this again in our lifetime.

The plot is complex, yet simple.  The acting is top notch, yet effortless.  The direction is slick, fast and fresh, yet subtle.  A lot is left to the imagination, yet a lot is spelled out clear.

1671844,4,B00005V3Z4,"You know, it is truly irritating to read the reviews from negative people who cannot back up their close-minded opinions with solid reasoning. I respect others opinions because we live in America where opinions can be said, but opinions are useless without reason.
Anyway, onto my review. A friend of mine suggested we watch this when invited over for a movie night. I said something in the context of... ""sure, whatever"", thinking this movie was going to be really stupid, because of the title (which I now think is good).
I had no idea what I was getting into - one of the BEST movies I have EVER seen.
If that's so you're probably wondering why I gave this only 4 stars. First reason is because I am very very stingy on writing movie reviews because like I said I am more of a music guy. Second reason is because as perfect in many aspects as this movie is, it still has its flaws, like ANYTHING ELSE.
Let's start off with the good. Plotline - yes, negative reviewers, usually the reason why you think this is a terrible film IS because you don't get it. Just because you can't comprehend something right off the bat and it is not handed to you on a silver platter doesn't mean its bad. It also doesn't mean it is bad when they leave a plot to open self-interpretation. It just means that you *GASP* may actually have to think for yourself for once.
I'm not sure I want to sum up the plotline - because I can't do that without putting my own opinion into the picture. What this movie does is subtly link every event that happens and every little detail that takes place and leaves you to interpret the meaning of it all. If you want opinion, here's what I got from it - SPOILERS - Set in 1988. Donnie Darko comes down with a severe schizophrenic disorder in which the character Frank the Rabbit represents the type of repressed human fear that dwells in us all - it just so happens that it surfaces and shows in Donnie. Excellent use of characterization. Then what happens is that Donnie starts to question the universe in which all human existence takes place... and starts to form a satirical opinion of the mechanized existence which he sees. He is then informed by Frank, who saved his life by preventing a jetliner engine that crashed through his roof from crushing him, that an apocalyptic event is coming soon because of a rip in the time-space continuum. What Donnie must now do is make a choice, a very important choice, determining the fate of humankind. I'll leave it there to not spoil the end.
This movie is right up my alley, anyway. The type of obscure, science-esque film that does not have a plot and/or meaning handed to you. The type of movie that you can't just sit back and switch your brain to the off position while watching. Then you throw the ideas of time travel, alternate existences, and tangent universes into the mix, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be gold to me!
Of course, this nowhere near even STARTS to tap into the intricate detail that this film presents to you, but to do that would require pages of writing. As for the graphical presentation of this movie, for a relatively low-budget film, it was top-notch. The special effects resembled those seen in high-budget hollywood sci-fi productions such as The Matrix. The camera angles and motion techniques used by the director were breathtaking, using wide, sweeping camera angles, a camera ""one-eighty"", a blue-masking effect overlaying the film, and subject transitions that some big-name directors would envy.
Talent - decent, but this is where some of the blank star is taken from. The only unconvincing role was Drew Barrymore, who I was never a huge fan of to start with, but her role is not very quintessential to the film besides the phrase ""cellar door"" (if you haven't seen the movie yet this won't make sense). Everyone else played the roles very convincingly except for one point, where Jake Gyllenhaal was with the character playing the psychiatrist and he was going into a panic mode - it was an abrupt transition and overly dramatic, making that a flaw in his acting. But I can live with that.
Soundtrack - one of the best ever. The music is used to great effect throughout the film to enhance the mood, a technique that is dying out in film productions nowadays. The Gary Jules cover of Tears for Fears' ""Mad World"" is better than the original, and at the moment it was used in the film, made me feel as though I've never felt before, if you know what I mean, and that feeling doesn't come easy for me when speaking of media or entertainment (I feel emotional usually with actual real people, I don't usually get way too emotional over media productions). Not only does this song chill you to the bone, but it actually describes the point of the film well, through the use of imagery.
All in all, it was one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to watch - I beg the negative people to give this film another chance - watch it with an open mind and try to think for yourself for once. Try to break out of the concrete thinking mindset, that I once used to be in. I'm 16 going on 17 and have already shattered it. Believe me when you realize that this movie is meant for open-ended interpretation and how it makes you feel when it forces you to think, you will realize what a great movie it is and the positive connotation of it.",1099699200,5,5346,4.4897330595482545

1671846,5,B00005V3Z4,"I had never heard of DONNIE DARKO before, and got it only because I clicked on several recommended lists by the hardy amazon compilers, and then liked the reviews I read.

At first, I did not know what to make of this film. The opening scene with Donnie awakening from sleep in the middle of an asphalt road on a misty mountain side, was beautiful, but confusing. Although his bike was lying on the side of the road, when he jumped upon it and began pedaling back home, I figured that he had not been in an accident ... so, was he a sleep walker? And, a bit later on, came the infuriating scene where he called his mom a ""bitch.""

Naturally my motherly porcupine hackles rose and I prepared myself to hate this film and write a scathing review.

And I will write a review (in my part of the world it's almost midnight now, the bewitching hour), but tomorrow.

For now, briefly: this is a good film. Intelligent, intuitive, creative. The teenage Donnie Darko (despite calling his mom a bitch, and of course he deserves a sound trashing for that, especially because his mom as well as his dad are good people) is a likeable character, and soon you find out that he does appreciate his parents, his sisters, even his small picturesque American town. However, he is tormented by hallucinations and is taken medication and undergoing therapy. The way I interpret it, Donnie is deeply sensitive, and a genius as well as a psychic. Yes, he's got too much brains, too much heart, and can see into the future as well. The six foot tall monstrous bunny is his sixth sense which he of course does not recognize as such, and I'll bet many of you will disagree with me. That's OK, though, DONNIE DARKO invites you to make your own assumptions and interpretations.

If you want to think, watch this movie. But do watch it sober, no booze or what-nots please during viewing! Its effect is psychedelic enough, and you don't want to miss the nuances.

I certainly liked the ending. Though completely unrelated, it reminded me of AMERICAN BEAUTY and Kevin Spacey. And of course there is always the possibility that if we want it strongly enough... we might turn back time to right wrongs... and give our loves ones a second chance ... even if it means to sacrifice ourselves....

Parents, this is a good film you could watch with your teens. Cheers!",1098921600,,2331,4.548926014319809
1671847,5,B00005V3Z4,"Like water in a desert. That's how I feel about this film. The director, actors and everyone else involved poured so much love (not to mention fear) into this little movie that it just shines.  It made me remember why I love film, right in my gut, plot complexity be damned.

For all those people who (like me) had heard of Donnie Darko and casually added it to their to-do list based on the buzz, see it as soon as you can. I thought it would be just another witty teen film, above average, but nothing special. This movie is so special it hurts.

I can't believe I missed this in the theatres. I'm still chewing on it a week after first seeing it. It's breathtakingly original and ambitious; I was awed that someone had the guts to even try to make a movie like this. It's not exactly philosophy, and it's not perfect, but it's enormously bighearted, earnest, clever, and moving.

How Richard Kelly hit the 1988 nail so perfectly on the head is just beyond me. I bet you'll find the movie especially compelling if you were born between 1968 and 1980 - approximately the window for the births of the three Darko children in the film.",1098576000,6,1134,4.411483253588517

1671849,2,B00005V3Z4,"There are probably hundreds of web pages out there trying to explain this movie, not to mention the FAQ, the official web site that tries so very hard to build an air of mystery, the legions of fans who love it, but can't quite explain what it's about.

Obviously, this movie is difficult to understand.

My own opinion is that the director didn't have a resolution to his story and didn't think he needed one. This is not good. There might perhaps be some stories where the end is well left to the viewer to puzzle out, but there has to be something intrinsic to the story to make such an end desirable. In other words, the story should provide material worth thinking about -- some reward to the audience for their time and effort. In my opinion, that happens when the puzzle is interesting, provocative or profound, as dictated by the content of the movie. It is much less interesting to ponder the question ""what was the director trying to say?"" Who cares. If he cared about the audience, he'd have told us.

It is hard to talk about this movie without presenting some spoilers. I don't want to do that, so I'll leave it to you to judge for yourself whether the puzzle posed by this movie is worth killing any neurons. I know there are people out there who like to exercise their mind for no good reason, but even a game of chess or a crossword puzzle has some resolution. The best you'll get from this movie is ""I think I kinda sorta know what the director had in mind.""

The acting is good. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) and Mary McDonnel (his mother) are convincing in their roles. Drew Barrymore (the English teacher) doesn't seem to serve a purpose, but I guess she deserved a role, being executive producer. She does, quite arbitrarily, put down a couple of words on her blackboard that just happen to be essential for the plot to proceed. Patrick Swayze is frighteningly realistic as an infomercial host. Noah Wylie is the physics teacher who spouts a bunch of nonsense about wormholes, trying to give the viewer some sort of semi-scientific justification for suspending credulity. Viewed another way, EVERYONE in the movie had a part in the story, if you can wrap your mind around the plot. But it is such a contrived plot that when you figure it out, it sort of feels like you've been conned. One gets the feeling director Richard Kelly knew this, when he had Jake Gyllenhaal say ""Deus ex machina"" at an inopportune moment -- a cheap plot device that became extinct with the Ancient Greeks -- of having a god descend by means of ropes and pulleys from above stage, to explain away a confused plot that was beyond the director's powers of remedy. The gods work in mysterious ways, everyone knows that. What? You dare question a God?

The movie is certainly very atmospheric, dark and gloomy in the best traditions. The editing is unconventional; but not weird enough to make you lose interest. You won't be bored -- you'll be too busy figuring out what's going on. But when it's over, you might be left with the feeling that Kelly was indulging his whims at your expense.",1098230400,22,3084,4.55956678700361

I don't know if it was the fact i was reading Slaughterhouse Five by vonnegut or if i just liked the style but this movie seriously rocked. The idea behind it was fairly good and for an indie movie it was fairly well done. The story line would have been better if it had been explained more (mabye a book or something would have been cool to follow up the movie...).

People who don't like this movie just don't get it , in my opinion. ive only met a handfull of people who don't like it but after questioning, we realized they didn't understand anything about the movie. I don't think theres much 'teen-angst' in it, sure theres a little more than ur normal teen but people, its a freaking movie, thats wut movies do!",1098144000,,859,4.39622641509434
1671851,4,B00005V3Z4,"First of all, you are probably wondering how such a great film could have flyed so long under the radar.  Unfortunately, 'Donnie Darko' is a victim of timing - the original release date was just 6 weeks after 9/11 and one of the majory plot points was eerily reminescent of another catastophe that happend immediately thereafter.

From the two separate commentary tracks, you learn that Drew Barrymore ""god-mothered"" the production of this first major film by writer and director, Richard Kelly, and because the budget was a measly $4 million, the project became a true labor of love incredible cast, which includes Jena Malone, Jake Gylennhal, and his sister Maggie (who would put in a tour de force a year later with 'Secretary'), Noel Wylie, Mary O'Donnell, and Patrick Swayze.  This odd combination of one part comedy, two parts sci-fi comic, and three parts drama, which one reviewer described as David Lynch meets John Hughes, works.  The plot is refreshingly subtle, refusing to hit you over the head like its Hollywood-ized counterpart, 'Butterfly Effect', which arrived almost two years later.

From the 20 revealing deleted/extended scenes, you realize that the film could have been much less secular and a better movie as a ""Director's Cut"".  Also, a physical version of 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' book (which explains much of the underlying world in this thriller) should have included in the package, as the pages on the DVD on illegible.

SPOILER BEGINNING:  The writing is fantastic for a first time director, but having viewed the DVD in its entirety, I do have a problem with one of the plot points:  we know Donnie is highly intelligent and sleepwalks, but the script never really reveals Donnie's ""super powers"" (aside from the implication in the facts surrounding the trashing of the school), and as such, the fact that he is ACTING telekinetically to pull down the jet engine into the portal (as indicated by the writer/director) is completely lost on the viewer.

SPOILER END.",1097971200,4,2003,5.006024096385542
1671852,5,B00005V3Z4,"'Donnie Darko' marks the excellent (and promising) directorial debut of Richard Kelly, a relatively un-heard-of director that has struck gold with this outstanding tale of belonging and exploring the complexities of time travel.

Set in 1988; disturbed teenager Donnie Darko begins to experience bizarre visions in which he is greeted by 'Frank', a mysterious entity dressed in an evil-looking bunny suit. 'Frank' instructs Donnie that only 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds remain until the tangent universe will collapse, and begins to ask him to carry out his increasingly destructive commands. An un-stable Donnie wilfully complies, uncovering some of the darkest secrets humanly imaginable about his, and the worlds, existence. But with a universal collapse nearing by the hour, is there a way Donnie can stop the inevitable and save the ones he loves?

Everything about 'Donnie Darko' was portrayed to the highest quality. The acting, direction, and special effects were outstanding, and not to forget the beautifully composed soundtrack featuring Gary Jules' heartfelt cover of 'Mad World'.

Rather than sticking to one genre, the movie instead explores many, easily succeeding with each. An unforgettable discussion about how Smurf's have sex is hilarious, as is Donnie's sister repeating the vulgarity she hears from her siblings at the dinner table. And the dramatic elements are not to be forgotten, but would be easily spoilt if I mentioned them here.

I highly recommend 'Donnie Darko'; one of the most generously original, and instantly memorable, movies to hit our screens in years. Utterly outstanding.",1097971200,,1629,5.4015748031496065
1671853,4,B00005V3Z4,"This is a directorial debut for Ricard Kelly who also wrote the screenplay for the movie. The movie was first shown at Sundance Film Festival where it was met with a lot of enthusiasm and good reviews. This is what prompted me add this movie to my collection.

Before watching the movie I tried not to read a lot about it's plot and in this case it was a good deccision. The story is about a troubled teenage boy who has vissions of a giant rabbit who predicts that the world will end in 28 days.

In some ways this movie reminds me of ""12 Monkeys"" as it deals with time travel and the parradoxes connected to it. But the plot and the movies 1980's surreal subburban setting are highly original. The production designer Alexander Hammond (""K-Pax"", ""Men in Black II"") did an excellent job of capturing various setting in which the story takes place. Surreal feel to the movie is greatly helped by the beautifull cinematography of Steven Poster (""Someone to watch over me"").

The movies cast is diverse. The lead role of Donnie Darko is extremly well performed by Jake Gyllenhaal, previously unknown actor to me. He does a nice job of playing an emotionally disturbed teenager and the best scenes are his confrontations with the rabbit. The rabbit is played by James Duval (""Gone in sixty seconds"").

In the roles of Donnies teachers among other we can see Noah Wyle (""E.R."") and Drew Barrymore and they did a good but not a memorable performances. Aslo, Patrick Swayze appears in the role of righteous self help guru.

But the real strong point of the movie is it's open and undefined ending which leaves you wandering and prompts you to think about it. Not everyone will like the movie but all will at least think about the massage it tries to tell. It is intentionally made this way and the director says so in the commentary. The story is intentionaly left to open interpretation by the viewer which is great.",1097625600,,1911,4.592375366568915

But movies like Donnie Darko possess images, and thoughts that stick with a viewer.  In fact, I have watched this movie about 3 times, and only now am I appreciating the mind-blowing story and symbolism this movie has.  Donnie Darko is, essentially, about a young boy's journey into adulthood, and how he percieves the fake world around him.  The movie can not be catagorized, it is everything a movie should be....and more.  The acting is superb, the storyline is enthralling, and it gives my brain some exercise, and in a world where a button does everything for us... my brain needs it!",1097366400,2,763,4.69172932330827
1671856,4,B00005V3Z4,"Having known next to nothing about this film, but constantly hearing mountains of praise being heaped upon this obscure ""Midnight Madness"" fare, I had the original intention of waiting for the DVD release of the ""Director's Cut"" (which, as of this writing, is in limited theatrical release here in the US but, curiously, is already out on the DVD market in the UK). But after more researching & reading of reviews (including some information stating that the scenes which got left on the cutting room floor were just as much the Director's idea as that of the studio execs), and taking into consideration the fact that Director Kelly was -VERY- happy with the finished result which became this original theatrical version along with his revelation that virtually every ""new"" scene which will be presented in the ""Director's Cut"" is what's avalable on this ""original release"" DVD in the ""deleted scenes"" section, I made the conscious decision to discontinue ALL plans to wait for the ""Director's Cut"" -- either in DVD format or in theatrical release which, as of this writing, has still not played at any Hawaii venues.

And so just a couple of days ago, with my recently shipped ""original theatrical release"" version of the DVD, I watched this movie for the very first time -- and let me say I was NOT disappointed in the very least!!! This remarkable little film lives up to all of its ubiquitous hype! (B+ easily!)

The biggest surprise of all? -- I *TOTALLY* agreed with the trimming away of those scenes which had been selected for deletion! -- All 20+ of them! I usually go into kneejerk hysterics whenever I review deleted scenes from other films and I wind up cursing film execs for putting directors under this kind of pressure to meet some totally arbitrary ""time constraints"" for a film's length, but amazingly I did not have that reaction this time around! Sure, there were a couple of little ""bit pieces"" I would have liked to have seen within the main body of the film, but even so they were still not really necessary.

And so ""Donnie Darko"" becomes only the SECOND ""Director's Cut"" of a film's re-release I would not endorse (the other being the D-Cut of the original ""ALIEN,"" which was totally unnecessary and broke the continuity it established with its sequel). Does that mean I think the new release of ""Donnie Darko"" is not worth seeing? I'm not saying that at all. But keep this in mind: If you have not yet seen this movie in its ""original release"" version, you'll be seeing in the ""Director's Cut"" what is, essentially, a ""different"" movie altogether -- because the added scenes will actually steer the story in a radically different direction leading to whole new different interpretations. It'll still be an amazing film to watch, no question about that; but it will also, in my personal opinion, actually present a WEAKER, not nearly as intense, and a less esoteric story.

So my suggestion is to purchase the ""original release"" version DVD and enjoy the movie for the story it presents in its final form, then ""IMAGINE"" the ""Director's Cut"" by reviewing the ""deleted scenes"" and accompanying commentaries.

Enjoy!",1097280000,4,3140,4.828996282527881

The Giant bunny man seriously had me scared and speculating throughout the movie and the fact that I truly couldn't make an easy prediction about how the storyline would unfold made it a big plus for me. You can do your own analysis, think out your own theory and it will be good in a sense. It's not so complex that it completely blows you away and leaves you dumbfounded, but has enough for an evening of plot analysis amongst friends.

I'm also happy I had no idea who Jake Gyllenhaal was, as in general, any often asked actor or actress that isn't less than brilliant still fails to come across as the character they portray. (I still see the 'moviestar' no matter what)

The expression that seems carved in Donnie's face is something worth alone to watch the movie for in my humble opinion.

As most people around here seem to be Americans, may I drop in some European films for you to view and form an opinion on? Most are worth it, and in general not 'regular'. Alas, personal taste differs ne. Have fun, hopefully ^_^

1671860,3,B00005V3Z4,"I honestly don't get why this film has received the amount of attention it has.  I liked it but I certainly did not find it great.  It seems to have impressed a large number of viewers (and critics), so perhaps I'm just missing something.  I do like films that require me to think, but unfortunately the thought required to enjoy this film didn't feel rewarding in the end.  Other reviewers here have referred to this film as a puzzle.  That's the way it seemed to me, too; unfortunately after the puzzle is put together (and I believe that there is more than one way to interpret this film), one is left with a feeling of ""so what?""  There isn't anything profound about this film; it doesn't shed any new light on ""the human condition"" as far as I can tell.  Perhaps this film appeals most to people who enjoy puzzles purely for the mental exercise.  I would like a little emotional payoff/insight in the end.

I read the most recent 50 or so reviews and did not see anyone comment on the age of the cast.  I must say that I was distracted by the casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as an alleged high school student.  Yes, he was only 20-21 when this was filmed, but he definitely looked to be in his twenties and not an adolescent.  Some of the other actors also looked too old to be playing their parts.  Jena Malone, on the other hand, whose looks match her age  (four years younger than Jake Gyllenhaal) only served to call attention to the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal looked more like a man and less like a teenager.  I thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was good (though I haven't seen him in anything else and some people are criticizing him by saying he essential comes across the same in every film), but he just wasn't believable as a high school student.  The casting wasn't as bad as, say, the film version of ""The Wiz"" (where a forties-ish Diana Ross tried to pretend to be a young teen), but I was definitely distracted by some of the choices made.",1095292800,13,1956,4.421787709497207

the story fascinated me because i am fascinated by the concepts of time travel and alternate realities and that is what this movie explores. in addition to those things the film delves deep into the minds and the lives of teenagers who have some problems dealing with society. it presented these teenagers in a relaistic way as opposed to most goofy teenage flicks that are totally unrelaistic. the interaction between brother and sister and child and parent is extremely realistic and i appreciate the seriousness and emotion that it took to write those scenes.  we need more of them.

i must also say that jena malone is hot but she looked younger than she really is in this movie. she needs to be in more films and, given her obvious talent, i am sure she will be.

i would recommend this movie to readers out there who happen to be reading this review that i wrote because, first of all, this is a very well made film especially considering that it was done by a first timer.  the vivid imagery is fairly mesemerizing and intrigues you to the point where you find yourself captivated with the imagery and then the characers and then the story.  it simply looks beautiful as hell.

the acting is alos excellent as jena and the rest do a fine job. jake is his usual self, which is good even though he seems to be the same in all his flicks but he is a perfect fit and plays Donnie well as hell. the parents are even good as is jakes/donnies sister - always good.

my only complaint is that i wished that it more fully explained the whole time travel aspect of the story but the way that the story was told left a lot to the imagination and that is a very good thing because it is fun to think and figure things out instead of being spoonfed everything by annoyingly pretentious hollywood directors.

Donnie Darko is a movie about the alienating and contradictory forces that act upon people in our modern world.

That said, many of the people giving this movie five-star ratings are not worth listening to either. Here's the deal:

Excellent plot, acting, cinematography, dialogue, and musical score.

1671867,2,B00005V3Z4,"Now before you write off my review as useless, I'll say this much: most people (especially western-culture teens) will like this film.  People apparently like it very much when a film ""messes with their heads"" (in the words of one avid reviewer), especially when it espouses ""trendy"" teen philosophies such as the stupidity of mentors (be they teachers or parents) and the meaninglessness of everything.  Classic ""teen angst"" things really.

What this film does is it presents us with an antisocial, depressed  teen nutcase who embodies all of the above philosophies, and then justifies his actions.

Donnie Darko, who comes from a VERY rich family judging by their house, commits one crime after another in the film, speaks dumb jokes to his ""friends"" and wipes out a whole branch of physics with a single sentence (""wouldn't it be possible to travel backwards through time by travelling faster than light?"").  The movie glorifies him through all of this, presenting him as some kind of messiah who is the only one who has seen the light.

Yes, I can see why so many people like this. Wouldn't it be nice if it were REALLY that way? If those stuffy scientists, teachers, and parents were really wrong about everything, despite all of their hard work and dedication? Wouldn't it be nice if all you had to do to know the Truth would be to have some hairbrained notion in your drug-hazed head about what is really right (yes, Donnie Darko is constantly on anti-depression drugs throughout this movie)?

This film will indeed ""mess with people's heads"", but it won't clear them, which in my mind is what trully great filmmaking should do.  Donnie Darko, with its false and depressing interpretation of the world, is flawed at its most fundamental level.

It's full of plot-holes as well. Here's one: how does a TORNADO make someone travel faster than light?

The only reason I gave this 2 stars is that the cinematography is rather good.

In closing, if you are the type of person who likes enlightening films, avoid this one like the plaque! There are far, far better films out there about life's mysteries that warrant viewing, like the 1972 Solaris, Come and See, The Passion of Joan of Arc, Au Hasard Balthazar (due out on dvd in 2005) and Wild Strawberries.

Frank didn't exist before

Donnie cheated death, so that's impossible, not to mention there's a reason why the movie opens up w/ Donnie waking up on the Carpathian Ridge.

1671873,3,B00005V3Z4,"DONNIE DARKO has gained audience appeal through its DVD release after lukewarm responses at the cinema in 2001.

The film focuses on a teenage boy with psychological problems, and is told through his eyes.  The boy receives messages from an evil rabbit whom is a figment of his imagination. A number of disturbing events occur, but by the end of the film, you are left wondering what is real and what isn't.

Donnie Darko has some merits including interesting performances from the entire cast, and an fairly engaging storyline (but it does drag at times).  Overall, the film is over-rated and only worth seeing to try and determine why it has a cult following.  I'm still figuring out its cult following. Obviously theatre audiences from 2001 agree with me.

DVD SUMMARY - includes many deleted and extended scenes.  Some of these are expected to be included in the impending Director's cut due for release shortly.  Apparently this new Director's cut will improve the film's meaning.  And make it more understandable.",1092700800,7,1019,4.947058823529412
1671874,4,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a movie that tests the limits of the alienated male teen in the suburbs convention so imaginatively that you hardly notice those patches where the script shows signs of strain. In some ways, he resembles the character Jim Stark portrayed so memorably by James Dean in 'Rebel W/O A Cause'. Just like the old Nick Ray picture, this one wins you over with inspired casting and great performances. Jake Glyllenhaal as Donnie is just brilliant. He looks a little bit like Tobey McGuire and naturally conveys some of McGuire's confused naivete. But Donnie isn't just bemused by typical teen rites of passage, he's delusional and suffering mightily from more than a touch of teen angst. It's like Tobey McGuire meets Kafka and it works.

  What I liked most about the movie were the scenes depicting Donnie with his family. Contrary to the stereotype of misunderstood teen movies, this kid's upper middle class nuke family comes off as very likeable. I've seen the actor who played Donnie's dad before in Election, where he plays an obtuse suburban dad, but in this movie the parents show their troubled son as much love as they're capable of. The mom seems just as confused by her son's troubles as he is. He's got an older and younger sister and though they're not as sensitive to Donnie's condition as one might wish, they're believable. They don't know exactly how to cope with the puzzle he presents. When the family gathers for meals or attend events like the little sister's talent show, you feel a genuine spark of family warmth. They are not the fallguys for Donnie's dementia. And the psychiatrist (played by Katherine Ross. Where have you been since that bike ride with Butch Cassidy  and the big move to Stepford?) seems helpful to the very bright Donnie. Maybe too helpful since any discussion with bright well disposed adults seems to further fuel Donnie's delusions.

  Part of his illness seems tobe that he's really trying to interpret what he encounters in life for it's true meaning. He might be delusional, but he hates lies and inaccuracy. There's a wonderful scene where he and his chums discuss the Smurfs and his buds spin all kinds of hardcore sexual theories based on this innocuous toon and Donnie cogently shuts them up. I'm not that up on the varieties of schizophrenia, but I'm willing to take on faith that this movie gets across what the disease might be like because it gets all kinds of little details about family life and the awfulness of school right. The main character becomes obsessed with a book by a centenarian who used to teach at the school he attends. The title: 'The Philosophy of Time Travel'. The only philosophical proposition held up for inspection by the characters in Donnie Darko is 'all men live and die alone' which Donnie discusses with his shrink. The emotional truth of this statement is borne out by the sad old woman who Donnie fixates on. It's she who tells the poor kid this hard to argue against homely truth. Anyway, we all travel through time, whether we want to or not - and then we don't. If ya ask me, this was a noble little movie",1092528000,6,3109,4.704044117647059
1671875,4,B00005V3Z4,"It's not immediately obvious what kind of movie this is, I'm still working on it. Part satirical social commentary, part psychological thriller, part time travel sci-fi movie, and part horror flick; like David Lynch masterpieces, it probably requires several viewings to uncover the many rich layers.

But that's the genre-defying beauty of Donnie Darko. It springs effortlessly across themes to create a gorgeously ominous atmosphere. The screenplay flirts with perceptions to inspire a dreamy curiosity without actually explaining the twisted universe of time travel that drives a teenager to the films startling climax.

Sure, like any other work of art, it has its issues. There are bits that are simply impossible to make sense of. For instance, a scene with a couple of men and Drew Barrymore, where they abruptly say ""Donnie Darko"" and then giggle. What was that about?

One could also say that the movie trips a little in the last quarter by tossing some random stylish punches in an effort to keep the audience interested. The result is somewhat confusing if not inconsistent. Who was Frank really? We are led to believe that he was a figment of imagination, but as it turns out, he was a real character. I am still trying to work this one out.

Regardless, whatever it is, whatever it resolves to and ""means"", I highly recommend this mosaic for its dynamics rather than its ""story"". How many movies can successfully pull off a six-foot bunny as a creepy character! One only wishes more directors would take delightful gambles like this.",1092441600,5,1546,4.98062015503876
1671876,4,B00005V3Z4,"'Donnie Darko' was brilliant. And you know what? I can't exactly say why. Maybe that is the wonder of this film: there is so much room for interpretation. Its own complexity only underscores one of its themes. What are these themes, you ask? There are many, and I went through a sort of cycle to understand what the film was trying to say:

First I thought it was a film conveying the decay of modern society through metaphor. Then I thought it was about the complexities of fear, and that those who try to pin down life problems too simply are lost in themselves because they choose not to face the truth that lies within the shadows. Lastly, I began to think it was simply a movie that wanted to say, ""There are those who may be able to control fate with time travel, but only a few. They are out there; and it is possible.""

Honestly, to me, it was all three rolled into one genius cult flick.

I'm a big fan of films that attempt to tackle so much, because 1) it makes me think and approach aspects of my own psyche and 2) it offers more interesting cinema than the normalcy of peaceful narrative. It's even better when the film manages to pull off every one of its goals, especially with engaging symbolism and beautifully crafted twists and turns. I can't even say I caught everything by the end of 'Darko.' But I understood everything I needed to understand. I believe that was what director Richard Kelly was attempting overall: to offer us a film that can be stretched so many ways that you can't help but make it personal.",1092355200,9,1532,4.406360424028269

1671882,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko had me intrigued within the first two minutes. The music, the tone, and Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliance completely swept me away. Writer/director Richard Kelly has created an altogether awesome movie that is thought-provoking, funny, and sad.

 This film is a psychological/sci-fi thriller about a teenager named Donnie Darko who is shown prophetic visions by a six-foot tall rabbit named Frank. Are you thinking Harvey? Think again. This is the scariest rabbit I've ever seen in my entire life. The film begins with a jet-engine crashing through the roof and into Donnie's room. Donnie's not sure what to make of this, and spends the rest of the film on a sort of spiritual journey of faith, love, life, and death.

 This movie left me with so many questions, but after trying to pick this movie apart so I could better understand it, I decided to just give up on it. Take this movie as it is, don't try to nitpick it because it will seriously make your head explode.

 Everything about this movie is great. Jake gives such a great performance, and he has yet to disappoint me. Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Jena Malone co-star to create a truly all-star cast. The music is probably my favorite part of the film. The original score evokes the sci-fi/futuristic feeling, but it's also extremely haunting. And the use of the song ""Mad World"" at the end of the film is the most effectively used song that I've ever seen in a movie.

 HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1091059200,3,1476,4.76078431372549
1671883,4,B00005V3Z4,"The young Richard Kelly, director of this film, graduated from USC Film School in 1997. This was his first feature film. He has spun a dark multi-layered vision, part dramatic comedy, part science fiction, part fantasy and allegory. The movie almost needs to be classified as three genres stirred gently. He set the world of the film as autumn 1988. It is, in part, a story of adolescent teenae angst, the familiar turf of a John Hughes project, but actually it is more like John Hughes meets David Lynch meets Steven Spielberg. Kelly has put several interesting twists into the high school yarn. It is like a hip FERRIS BEULLER'S DAY OFF.
Jake Gyllenhaal, from MIDNIGHT MILE & OCTOBER SKY, played Donnie Darko brilliantly. He was a young man smarter than his teachers, his parents, and his friends. An intrepid curious lad who could ask those questions very few wanted to answer. He is a kid who is being treated for mental illness, even though he may not have been clincially ill. He was outspoken, outrageous, and socially boorish...like most smart teenagers. Roger Ebert wrote,"" Donnie is appealingly smart yet sarcastic, more quixotic than eccentric, more curious than frightened.
The film's prologue is bang on target. A bright sunrise on dark foothills, suddenly interrupted in the frame by the insertion of the black silhousette of a young man's head. Donnie Darko, there on the hard ground near his bicycle, far from home. After he cycles home, his arrival is treated as familiar behavior; sleep sojourns, adventurous forays into the darkness. That very next night, we witness him roused from his slumber by someone calling his name. He slips outside and we meet the presence that has beckoned him...a medium longshot of someone in a rabbit suit...someone named Frank. But this rabbit, tall as HARVEY, is not a benign companion. Its face is twisted into a demonic death mask. With Darko away from the house, we see an accident happening. Something has fallen out of the night sky, and crashed directly into Donnie's bedroom; a 707 jet engine. If he had been there when the engine came acallin', he would have died instantly. Frank sends Donnie off to do devilish chores; flooding the school, and burning down a house.
Nothin is linear or logical in Darko's dreamlike world. His parents are too understanding. His new girlfriend, Jena Malone, is really too easy to get to know. Physical laws, like an axe being buried in a bronze statue, are tweaked and violated. The film can only approach some level of cohesiveness if one is able to conjure up a premise, a through line. For me, most of the characters presented are probably actually a part of Donnie's
""real"" life, but as they were mostly presented in the bulk of the narrative, they were peopling his ""dream"" life. One possible explication for the whiplash lunges from drama to comedy to satire to science fiction and fantasy, was that most of the film's narrative occurred from the time Donnie was awakened in his bed, either by Frank's voice, or the faint sound of the 707 engine whistling and plummeting down toward his bedroom. Time was compressed, like in THE INCIDENT AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE on the Twilight Zone, a sort of Alice through the Looking Glass dream squeezed into those precious elongated seconds.
This film poses more questions than it offers answers for. There are theories that we, as spiritual entities, can sustain more than one version of our ""Self"" in parallel dimensions similtaneously. Somehow, it seemed that Donnie called on one of his alternate selves to swing through those last few brief moments, those seconds that stretched out into 30 days. Perhaps time is relative, and does not exist on the other side. I think this movie requires several viewings to begin to be fully appreciated. It is an original vision, bizarre yet strangely familiar, and immediate with it's punch to the emotional gut. It is eccentric, yet appealing.",1089763200,12,3919,4.885885885885886

1671886,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is an intelligent but somewhat befuddled teenager who lives with his idyllic family in an upscale American suburban neighborhood, attends an exclusive private school...and has nighttime visions of a huge, demonic-looking rabbit named Frank who gives him information about the future.  Sometimes the nightmarish nocturnal hare puts Donnie into a sleep-like trance and sends him out to perform an act of vandalism or two, and it is during one of these somnambulistic excursions that a massive jet engine from a commercial airliner falls from the sky and demolishes Donnie's bedroom.  Because it appears that Frank has saved his life, Donnie tends to believe Frank's claim to be from the future feels that he must, for the time being, humor the late-night lagomorph.  In the mean time, amid several bizarre events suddenly taking place in his daytime life, Donnie's research into the scientific possibility of time travel leads him to a life-changing epiphany.
The ingredients that freshman writer/director Richard Kelly uses to whip up the plot and narrative for DONNIE DARKO (2001) are the familiar materials of everyday life, but he throws in a pinch or two of the bizarre and the absurd to create a subtly skewed and therefore disturbing atmosphere.  The characters are fresh but true-to-life and never formulaic, yet in many of them Kelly still manages to find springboards for satirical comments on diverse societal elements like the American school system, infomercials, spin doctors & public images, the entertainment industry, the popular perception of science, and more.  All of this coalesces into a fascinating and compelling examination of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality.
The film's entire cast is quite strong and handles the deep material with the appropriate degree of earnestness.  Star Jake Gyllenhaal is especially outstanding in the title role.  His Donnie Darko, though emotionally imbalanced, is both an intriguing and sympathetic character, one that engages the absurdities in life--particularly HIS life--with saturnine curiosity rather than fear, and he therefore establishes a perfect tone for the film. Of the supporting cast, Mary McDonnell gives a standout performance as Donnie's mother Rose Darko, as she emotes a genuine concern over the seeming psychological downslide of her son.  The cute and talented Jena Malone also does a wonderful job as Donnie's girlfriend, Gretchen, a young woman who is nearly as perplexed and yet intrigued by life's absurdities as Donnie himself.  In a refreshing departure from the usual hunk and heartthrob roles in which he is usually cast, Patrick Swayze delivers a darkly humorous interpretation of a smarmy self-help guru, and the beautiful Drew Barrymore--also one of the film's executive producers--offers a convincing yet low-key portrayal of an unconventional but popular high-school English teacher.
The DVD from Fox offers a very good (some filmic artifacts) digital transfer of DONNIE DARKO in anamorphic widescreen at the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The wonderful bonus features include two feature commentaries--one with writer/director Kelly and star Gyllenhaal, the other with various members of the cast and crew--a widescreen video of the film's haunting featured pop song MAD WORLD, deleted scenes, and other cool stuff.  Definitely worth the price of admission, and a disc that fans of more cerebral SF will want in their collections.",1089590400,2,3462,5.440298507462686

The first is that you will want to discuss the movie in detail with anyone who has seen it. And the second is that you will want to watch the movie again to try to answer questions you have come up with.  As far as the meaning of the movie, I would have to say that is up to you to decide.  I have seen this movie end to end probably 30 times, even once with the comentary on and each time I have come away with a different theory of what is going on.  Though I try to stay away from pop culture I am very excited to see this movie come back into the light.  Even if the movie is a bit to deep sounding for your tastes try it out.  I mean come on it has everything from anarchistic destruction of schools, to Patrick Swayze as a child molester, to political debates at dinner.

1671890,5,B00005V3Z4,"It just so happened that this is the first movie I saw after surviving the bloated, pretentious, and interminable, Magnolia; and, by comparison, Donnie Darko was like a breath of fresh air. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. In addition to the palpably dark and eerie atmosphere that pervades the whole movie, it is one of the more accurate depictions of ""teen angst"" ever committed to film; and, as a period piece, it also manages to be a very effective depiction of life in those crazy 1980's. This film is a great example of how the budget of a film can often be inversely proportionate to its quality, especially in ""Hollywood:"" it is better than most films with 30 times its budget. The special features on the DVD are very worthwhile (for once) as well. If you enjoy the movie, I recommend that you take the time to watch the extended and deleted scenes: there are a few, that you might even feel, could've been left in; although you may just admire Richard Kelly's efforts to keep the finished film at around two hours, as the editing never allowed this movie to ""drag"" (perhaps he felt, as do I, that beyond the two hour mark most films seem to collapse under their own weight). A second viewing of the movie with the audio commentary by Jake Gyllenhaal and Richard Kelly is also very worthwhile. Although the director considers this a sci-fi movie, it comes across as more of a supernatural/psychological thriller, and an intelligent one to boot. Also, as many people have commented, the casting and performances are inspired. The darkly ambient soundtrack is brilliant, as well (even without the pop songs that were too expensive to license for the OST album), and the creepy cover of Tears for Fears' Mad World is just amazing in the context of the film. Also, I'm not much of a Drew Barrymore fan, but praise should go to her for championing this project as an executive producer, and for providing an interesting portrayal of a progressive and idealistic young teacher trying to bring some enlightenment to a conservative private school.
I haven't seen a movie that was such a ""complete package"" (great script, directing, casting, acting, editing, lighting, soundtrack, sets; effective-but-not-overblown special fx, etc.) in a LONG time. One final note: if you have heard about the ""demonic bunny thing"" prior to seeing this movie, and are put off by it--as, initially, was I--you needn't worry: far from coming off as silly, the ""bunny"" just adds another dimension of creepiness to this movie.",1089072000,2,2525,4.793577981651376

I also like the effects, like how it showed those things coming out of them and how that was where they were supposed to go and how frank showed him that in the end (if he did break away from what was destined for him) that he was supposed to kill him.",1088035200,,635,3.9302325581395348
1671902,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is one of those movies you've always heard about but never saw.  Here's why:
Donnie Darko is about a young man in high school who sleepwalks at night, just in time to avoid a jet engine smashing through his bedroom.
Right around September 11, 2001.
So Donnie Darko, like the titular character of the same name, disappeared with nary a trace.  Fortunately, we now have a DVD version and there will be a new theatrical re-release of a director's cut of the film in July, 2004. Perhaps Donnie will still get his day.
Donnie Darko is about the Darko family.  They're an average family, with an older sister heading for college (Elizabeth, played by Jake's real life sister Maggie), a cute-as-a-button younger sister (Samantha, played by Daveigh Chase), a white-collar mom and dad (Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne), and then there's Donnie.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie as an alternately awkward, exhausted, strung out teenager who exhibits brief flashes of rage at the inanity of modern life.  Donnie also suffers from a troubled past, a past that requires him to see a therapist and take medication.
Donnie's life is a textbook troubled soul on the road to nowhere.  We could easily see him committing suicide, getting involved in drugs, getting some girl pregnant, maybe joining a gang, or even shooting up his school.  All's the pity, because Donnie is also extremely bright and has a piercing wit that embarrasses adults.
All that changes when Frank shows up.  Who's Frank, you ask?  Why, Frank's a deranged bunny rabbit.
That's a simplification, of course.  To be precise, Frank is a deranged being in a bunny rabbit suit.  The distinction matters.
In fact, in Donnie Darko, EVERYTHING matters.  Every word, every nuance, like an Edgar Allen Poe poem, has significance and meaning.  Ironically, the director and writer, Richard Kelly, feels the movie has only one interpretation as a science fiction story.  In spite of himself, Kelly has created a movie that alternately weeps at the desperate loneliness of so many humans living next to each other and exults in the sheer joy of existence.
Frank whispers suggestions to Donnie, things that, at least on the surface, seem like very bad things to do.  Donnie, in his sleepwalking, always performs these acts of vandalism.  And each time, Frank tells Donnie how much he has left before the world ends.  He starts the film with 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Screen shots remind us that the end of the world is coming in a manner similar to The Ring (which came out in 2002, one year after Donnie Darko).
Reality lurks in the background.  No one can explain where the jet engine came from.  Government agents shadow Donnie's every step.  In the mean time, town life goes on: Samantha's dance group gets discovered by an agent, a self-help guru (played by Patrick Swayze) spreads his mind-numbing spiritual pap, a book gets banned by the conservative elements for fear that it influences students to commit vandalism, bullies make fun of kids, teenagers do drugs and fool around...in other words, it's a microcosm of Everytown, USA.
All around him, Donnie's life slowly falls apart even as it starts to make sense.  Each person in his life is challenged by their mediocrity and must face whether to rise above or succumb to their fears.  The movie emphasizes the madness of putting ""Fear"" and ""Love as diametrically opposed elements, emphasizing that the world is never that simple and often involves a mixture of the two.  It also struggles with the issue of God's existence, of personal choice vs. destiny, of life and death, of madness vs. sanity, and more.
Drew Barrymore stars as an English teacher who attempts to open the student's minds. She's also executive producer.  Unfortunately, her character comes off as stilted and unbelievable.  Noah Wyle makes an appearance that's appropriately low key.
Kelly's camerawork is exceptionally mature for a new director.  He doesn't shy away from wide-angle scenes and takes on some breathtaking shots; the most memorable being one sweeping panoramic scene that manages to encompass all that is high school in the span of a few seconds.
At least as integral to the film is the 80s music that permeates it.  This movie is a love letter to the misbegotten youth of year 2000 twenty-somethings.  The music is always appropriate and conveys the slow tumble of Donnie's life very effectively.  The song ""Mad World"" sums up the essence of the film and its fundamental disagreement with what passes for our own mundane reality.
Donnie Darko has a lot in common with movies like Groundhog Day and Fight Club. The themes of personal choice, of growing beyond one's own selfish nature, of facing down one's demons in a universe that doesn't exist make for though-provoking cinema in the tradition of the silver screen. We don't get many films like this anymore.
As the movie comes to a close, Donnie must make a choice. It's not the choice that really matters, but that he was comfortable with his decision in the end.  Viewers who stick with the movie and pay close attention will not be disappointed.
Besides, Frank told you to see it.",1087862400,5,5155,4.885189437428243
1671903,5,B00005V3Z4,this movie is great. everyone is going insane about it. from the title u might think it is another one of those insane movies with the crazy crack heads clowning people around. O! but it is so much more. Donnie Darko is good!,1087862400,,225,4.255813953488372
1671904,5,B00005V3Z4,"This has to be my favourite film of all time, and I wouldn't be able to explain why, other than saying that it is truly beautiful. Every time I watch it I am astounded by the beauty of the story of love, family, life and time travel! I do not concentrate on the time travelling aspect of the film, but rather on Donnie's realisation that his mother loves him, the blossoming young love between Donnie and Gretchen and the controversial questions within the film about life and the existence of God. Some of the scenes are so perfectly shot, especially those with music played over them. One such scene is Donnie's bike ride to the 80's vibe of Echo and the Bunny Men. Every time I have watched this film I have cried at the final conclusion even though I know it is coming, because it is so heart wrenchingly beautiful. The acting by Jake Gyllenhaal in this film is mind boggling- he has the sickening devious smile working for him and the whole confused adolescent style to his acting. Also, he's not bad to look at!
My friends laughed when I told them about this film, and then when they watched it they realized how stunning it was. If I could give you one piece of valuable advice, it would be to watch Donnie Darko as soon as possible!",1087862400,,1240,4.395652173913043
1671905,4,B00005V3Z4,"I was skeptical of this movie after reading some short plot summaries. But I am glad I checked it out because it is a great movie. Don't be fooled by all the time travel/giant bunny talk; this isn't a big time science fiction film. Those are just occurring events in the plot, that's not what the movie itself is about. I would relate it closely to The Butterfly Effect in terms of the idea of the movie. If you could change things in your life in order to protect those around you, even if it meant maybe never having some of the beautiful memories, would you do it? Jake Gyllenhall does a great job at being creepy and yet sensitive and loving, like most teenagers. It's a haunting movie and may stick with you a while. The reason I only gave it four stars is that I thought the plot could have been a little tighter; the premise is great and the resulting movie is as well, but there were moments when a little more could have been added to really put this film over the top.",1087344000,,978,4.235294117647059
1671906,5,B00005V3Z4,"I would go with ""something"", but Superhero is a close second.
Just when you think you've seen every plotline under the sun, along comes the most brilliantly tweaked teen angst film in over a decade.  Donnie Darko is a highschooler living in upper middle class suburbia circa 1988.  He has all the usual problems with parents, siblings, teachers and friends that are standard elements of any story about teenagers, but just to top it off he's a bit of a paranoid schizophrenic as well.  One night he sleepwalks out the front door and down to the golf course at the command of a new imaginary friend ""Frank"".  A few minutes later a stray piece of a jetliner falls from out of nowhere and crashes right through the roof of his bedroom.  Donnie realizes that since Frank has saved his life, he is now bound to serve Frank's will.  Oh, and Frank also predicts the end of the world in 28 days.
I think that what makes this weirdness work is the lead actor, Jake Gyllenhall.  He was a relative unknown at the time this was made, and I think this allowed him to pull off a very believable performance as a basically decent guy who just happens to have this weird personal rabbit-alien thing telling him to do disturbing things.  Donnie is a kind of secret superhero.  You see this tall, solidly built teenager who is good looking enough to have been popular with the jock-and-cheerleader crowd, but who is too much of a free thinker to care about that sort of thing.  He stands up to bullies in an almost detached manner, hangs around with all kinds of kids and cares for his family.  He is charming in an off sort of way.  You would almost forget that he has a dark side at all if you didn't see this slow, twisted smile creeping across his face at key moments.
I would love to delve further into the meaning behind the plot, but that would make for a real spoiler.
It's been a long time since I've enjoyed such a quirky, cult-classic-to-be movie.  I loved the social caricatures, the creepy mood and the punctuations of raw emotion in Donnie Darko.  See this movie if you have an appreciation for unusual psychological thrillers, science fiction, a nostalgia for 80s culture and maybe a little bit of weirdness in your own mind.  You will come away thinking about Donnie's universe for many days afterward.

The movie isn't a horror film in any way at all, nor is it creepy (or at least I didn't think so).  It is simply brilliant Science Fiction.  Don't get me wrong, though... it's not boring like many science fiction movies.
It is hard to describe the plot without making the movie sound moronic or giving away too much, so I will not try.  All I can say about it is that if you love yourself, go see this movie.",1086393600,2,630,4.26890756302521

Although I would not consider it a horror movie, it can be a tad creepy at times.  When it's not being creepy, it is quite often hilarious.  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a smart movie that deals with a number of different issues (sometimes at the same time) and delves into a number of different movie genres.  I do not recommend this movie to someone who lacks the patience to watch movies more than once.
The acting in the movie is generally pretty good.  The big names (Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle) will attract many of the movie's viewers, but after watching the movie, few will doubt that it's the teens of the cast that really make it special.",1086048000,4,807,4.576388888888889

  This film takes you on a journey through troubled mind of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) who to some ""is Toby Mcguires Ungerdog"" which I find to be so far from the truth. Jake goes beyond the borders of Mcguire and takes you inside the mind and through a parallel of time travel and theory, all as a highschool student. With the help of a bizzare accident, and a strangely mangled Rabbit Companion only reffered to as...now would I give that away...
  With a classic soundtrack, lighting and vivid color, camera work (pay note to a particular scene as the camera lingers the highschool halls) and cast of Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, and Patrick Swayze in the mix this film does justice to an eventual classic cult.

1671910,5,B00005V3Z4,"This brilliant film didn't make much of a splash in the U.S. when it appeared in theaters. On DVD, though, it's getting the attention it deserves.
Which makes sense, really; it's not the sort of film you grok fully after one viewing. There's a lot going on here, and some of it isn't actually explained within the movie itself. (For the SF time travel/alternate universe skeleton on which the story is hung, you'll probably need to look online for excerpts from _The Philosophy of Time Travel_, a fictional book that figures prominently in the movie.)
The time travel bit is pretty well worked out, and this film would be a success purely as an SF film even if that's all it were. In its time-travel logic, it's not quite as tight as the first Terminator film, but it beats the heck out of _Timecop_.
But it's lots of other things too: a charming late-80s period piece (with lots of music -- including a gorgeous remake of Tears for Fears' 'Mad World' -- to satisfy anybody out there who happens to be nostalgic for the 1980s); a scorching satire of public education; a dark comedy about puberty, teen angst, and psychological disorders; a comeback vehicle for Katharine Ross and Patrick Swayze; and an extended parable the moral of which is that kids had better save themselves because adults are too screwed up to do the job. (First-time director Richard Kelly wrote the script.)
That's a lot of balls to keep in the air -- but, amazingly, the film succeeds in _every one_ of these aspects. Its success is due in no small measure to the mesmerizing performance of Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role; he carries the entire film on his shoulders. His real-life sister Maggie is also delightful as Elizabeth Darko, and the adult Darkos (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell) are a refreshing change of pace from the usual teen-film parents. Jena Malone, as Donnie's girlfriend Gretchen Ross, is well matched with Gyllenhaal (and this is the second time in five years that she's appeared in a movie with wormholes in it: she also played Jodie Foster's younger self in _Contact_).
The rest of the cast is good too -- especially Swayze, who camps it up as a smarmy self-help guru.
Oh, and there's the rabbit. If you're reading this page, you're surely aware that Donnie is visited by a human-sized bunny who persuades him to engage in odd behavior while he's sleepwalking. (You may be reminded of _Harvey_ at this point, but director Richard Kelly says he wasn't thinking of that film at all.)
If you haven't seen this movie yet, you may be thinking that a film in which a teenaged boy is visited by a giant rabbit cannot _possibly_ work. I guarantee you you'll be pleasantly surprised once you actually watch it; this one is every bit as good as you've heard it is. In its way it's every bit as mind-blowing as David Lynch's _Mulholland Dr._ -- but with a gentler, lighter touch, a fine sense of humor, and, in its way, a more hopeful message (though every bit as dark as Lynch).
It's being rereleased in theaters in an extended 'director's version', but the current DVD includes about twenty deleted scenes that will presumably constitute at least a lot of the additional footage. If you want to see what you've been missing, grab this one while it's still available; if a director's-cut CD is ever released, you can buy it too.

That is when the world will end,"" Frank tells Donnie. Donnie awakes on the golf course and walks home. It turns out a jet engine fell from the sky and smashed into his room. No one knows where it came from.
Donnie Darko has every movie genre rolled into one. It contains the sarcastic wit of a comedy, the thought-provoking elements of a psychological thriller, the scientific edge of a sci-fi film...
What made this film one of my favorites was the fact that I was pondering it weeks afterward. My friends and I would discuss several different possibilities for why the way it ended the way it ended. Though I never quite got it until I watched the commentary on the DVD with the director, Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, which is very humorous as well as informative to the aspect of the 4th dimension in the movie.
As for DVD extras, they are not disappointing. There are several quite relevant deleted scenes that include a scene in which Donnie's psychiatrist tells him that his pills to treat his schizophrenia are placebos as well as an alternate (more gory) alternate ending.

In the film, Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Donnie, an incredibly sharp teen who becomes fascinated with the ideas of time travel due to the visions he suffers from.  His schizophrenic visions add an intensity to the film that keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to piece together all that is happening.  The acting in this film is quite good, but it is the film's originality that will grab you and shake your spinal column.
The soundtrack is superb and the plotline is very engaging.  One can characterize this film has having some elements of tragedy under its belt as we watch Donnie, a character that we become sympathetic towards despite his mental instability, following the groove of fate to its inevitable conclusion.  The real question the film explores is the degree to which we should consider Donnie mentally unstable-perhaps he has tapped into truth that is beyond our grasp.

This is a movie that really improves with age. Every subsequent viewing only deepens your understanding of the movie and makes you appreciate the complexity of Kelly's narrative. There is a lot going on in this film and every time I've seen it, I've noticed something new or seen something that made me think about it in a different way.
I first noticed Jake Gyllenhaal in October Sky and was immediately captivated by his performance in that film. He has since produced a fascinating output and diverse body of work. His performance in this movie is nothing short of excellent. He starts off as a confused teenager but Gyllenhaal gradually shows that there is so much more to this character than meets the eye. Is he crazy? Is he some kind of mad prophet? A time traveler? A visionary? A mixed up kid? All of the above? It's quite a soulful, thoughtful performance that is also funny and heartbreakingly tragic.
The whole cast is top notch: from ER's Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore to the always reliably Jena Malone and a surprise turn from Patrick Swayze playing a slimy Infomercial guru. More importantly, Donnie's family is so well cast, including Mary McDonnel as his mom and Holmes Osborne as his dad and, of course, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Donnie's sister (and also Jake's real-life one). They really feel and act like a genuine family with all of the little behavioural nuances.
As for the DVD, well, if you had any questions as to what it all means, listen to Kelly's audio commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal. While he doesn't explain everything, he does examine a lot of the themes and does fill in some of the gaps. This is one of the best audio commentaries out there for that simple fact. Best of all, he points out all kinds of images that were buried in the background that you don't notice the first few times. For example, as Donnie rides his bike home at the beginning of the film, Frank drives by him in his car. Or, the bunny motif that pops up throughout the movie. It is these attentions to detail that really give this film an added complexity and I'm very appreciative of Kelly for drawing attention to them in his commentary track.
The cast commentary is more of a free-for-all but fun to listen to and the many deleted scenes are very interesting to watch and fill in a few more gaps. It should be interesting to see how many of these are put back into the Director's Cut.

1671921,4,B00005V3Z4,"One of the most surprising and memorable indie gems of the last years, ""Donnie Darko"" is a gripping and intriguing cult movie and a fine addition to the coming-of-age genre. Well, to define this movie`s genre is not easy, really, since it goes into sci-fi, teen drama, thriller, suspense and black comedy territory. But the most surprising element is that it actually suceeds at combining all that genres.
A powerful experience about growing up, the building of personality, communication, schizophrenia and the frontiers between sanity and madness, ""Donnie Darko"" is a superb achievement. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the confused, smart and offbeat Donnie, that spends most of his time going to school and talking to a giant rabbit.
Richard Kelly`s debut as a director is strong and convincing, providing captivating and absorbing cinematography with an unique mood and an ethereal, oniric and dream-like atmosphere (similar to some David Lynch, Atom Egoyan and even Tim Burton works). Delivering enough surrealistic and gothic details, Kelly truly creates a personal and identifiable style here. The haunting score also helps to keep things interesting, capturing the zeitgeist of the eighties and providing a nostalgic dark feeling (Gary Jules` song ""Mad World"", a cover of a Tears for Fears hit, is particularly deep and compelling).
""Donnie Darko"" is an amazing cinematic experience that wisely focuses alienation in suburbia, giving a peculiar portrait of teen depression and the coming of adulthood in an original way. This is what independent cinema does better, to offer innovative perspectives about old, been-done-to-death subjects. Richard Kelly`s directorial debut is one of the most interesting american movies of the last years that looks like nothing else. A real alien.

1671922,3,B00005V3Z4,"It's quirky.  It's weird.  It's memorable.  And it has a cool soundtrack.
Think ""American Beauty"" style satirical family commentary, throw in equal measures of teen angst, mental illness, time travel and one hilarious monologue on the sex life of the smurfs and you get the idea.  All the ingredients are there for a great film but while I would say the film is certainly Very Good, it never quite pulls all the threads together sufficiently to make it Great.
The film opens with our hero Donnie waking up in the middle of the road beside his bike.  We don't know if he was hit by a car or hit by lightening or quite what happened (which sets the tone for the whole movie and in particular the ending - we never quite know what happened).  But one thing is for sure, things started to get weird for Donnie from then on.  (Look out also for the fantastic opening track ""Killing Moon"" by Echo and the Bunnymen).
Donnie is a moody, troubled teen with a bit of pyromania in his past.  He takes medication for some type of mental illness, fights with his sister, uses bad language at the family dinner table and sleepwalks.  He also hears voices that tell him to come outside at night where he meets a rather sinister six foot bunny rabbit called Frank for the first time who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days.  Interested yet?  And it's just as well that Frank wanted to speak with Donnie because while they were chatting about the end of the world a jet engine falls from the sky and crashes into Donnie's bedroom.  You've gotta say that's original.
The whole mood of the film is fantastically dark and ominous and there are enough twists and turns to hold the interest right the way through.  I've found myself thinking about this movie for some time after having seen it and pondering its themes of second chances and sacrifice.
Where Donnie Darko lets itself down is that it never quite brings together the various threads laid by the large supporting cast.  There is just too much going on.  There's Donnie's girlfriend (is she/isn't she, my what a strange family she has), his father (distant and juvenile), mother (earnest and caring), school teachers (too many to mention other than to say that Drew Barrymore is badly miss-cast and Carter from ER knows more about time travel than he is letting on), a creepy motivational speaker who turns out to be a child molester (Patrick Swayze), Grandma Death (no idea how she was supposed to fit in), a shrink, Donnie's school friends and acquaintances - the list goes on and on.  I'm just not sure what all these characters had to do with the story.  And because there are so many of them, they don't get developed very well and the whole thing just doesn't tie together as neatly as it could.
I'd sum it up by calling it an interesting and thought provoking film with interesting themes and a gloriously dark atmosphere.
Rent it and see for yourself.",1082678400,6,2915,4.54302103250478
1671923,5,B00005V3Z4,"Part Greek tragedy, part teen-angst drama, part music video, part surrealist set-piece; Donnie Darko tells the story of a young man living, like a stranger, within his own family while dealing with very real demons of schizophrenia and self-imposed isolation and an (imagined?) demon in the form of a hellish looking 6' talking rabbit named Frank.  There is a seething undercurrent of rage, frustration, and teenage existential confusion throughout the movie, which is brilliantly woven together with supernatural and science fiction elements.  Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as the title character who's above-average intelligence and disconnected, fatalistic viewpoint and morbidly ironic sense of humor eerily portray the mindset many loners who find themselves on the fringe of high school society.  The ""Sparkle Motion"" dance sequence evokes memories  of Nirvana's ""Teen Spirit"" video with its slow-motion film style and backdrop of anarchic destruction intercut with a school talent show.  Notable performances given by Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and the star's real-life sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal (playing Donnie's sister, Elizabeth Darko). The moody score and dark 80's new wave soundtrack heighten the sense that this movie conveys visually and narratively; a sense of foreboding and of imminent disaster and that the protagonist is on a journey of discovery, but one that may lead to answers he may not be prepared to cope with; one which he is compelled, like a prophetic dream, to see through to the end.  The DVD has the added bonus of containing the music video for Gary Jules' brilliant and haunting cover of Tears for Fears' ""Mad World"" which, now three years after it's inclusion in Donnie Darko, is gaining much deserved radio play.",1082419200,,1751,5.372262773722627

Time travel is an interesting subject by itself and this movie uses it as the main theme.  It keeps you wondering what is going to happen all the way through the movie.
This movie shocks you at the and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout from the beginning to the end.  The ending is quick and is hard to figure out.  It is the kind of movie that you sit back and watch the end credits starring at the screen thinking about the ending...if you like those kinds of movies you should check it out!

Go watch something where things blow up since you have the attention span of a goldfish.
Donnie Darko is another time-warp movie. There's some
originality to the plot, but the overall idea is not too original, or particularly coherent. This is another example of a movie made by drug addicts who put their crazed minds on screen, to pollute the American general public. Stupid movie with terrible acting. Avoid. You won't get anything interesting; only to make the drug addict filmmakers and their souless studio executive backers richer so they could buy more illicit drugs.",1081555200,2,838,4.921985815602837

Decisions... had he done it before? because he never should have known what he knew - Why did the rabbit follow him (because he cheated death - did he, if the plane didn't exsist yet?
All so dramatic... and yet, I liked the characters. Even the annoying and crazy ones.
Love was the all important motivator in this movie, because despite it all, that was what kept the characters going and what most all their actions were based on when it was important (ie mom taking sister to dance contest, most all of Donnie's decisions) Nice message if you saw it. It's subjective though. The movie is.
The song Mad World so popular now - and so OVER PLAYED - I loved it in this movie. And the 80s references were fun. Overall, a good movie that probably deserves 3 1/2 stars.

1671929,5,B00005V3Z4,"'Donnie Darko' is without a doubt one of the best films I have ever seen. It is a brilliant mix of satire, dark humour and sci-fi, founded on Kelly's fantastic dialogue and direction.
The plot is based on a single question: Does everyone die alone? This chilling idea sets Donnie Darko on a quest to discover the existence of God and the idea of time travel. On his way he loses his fear of death and learns to love.  In the end it is these newfound ideas that force Donnie to make the choice between life and death.
The symbolic nature of the film is what makes it outstanding. There are ironic parallels with the Bible, 'Hamlet' and 'Catcher in the Rye', and Kelly uses these expertly for a director of such young years.
Most importantly, the story of 'Donnie Darko' is in many ways typical of any teenager.  A defiant but bright boy struggles in a world that he cannot understand and does not understand him, until finally he finds strength in the girl he loves.  In the end, Donnie goes against the rules of time and fate wtih consequences that will never be understood by the world.  Kelly cleverly transforms adolescent indulgence into the act of a saviour.  An underrated masterpiece.",1080950400,4,1191,4.572769953051643

That is just the beginning. This darkly comic and touching independent gem was worthy of nominations for director, screenplay, and actor.
I don't understand why some Amazon reviewers did not love it. This movie is rich with details that you miss upon first viewing it. It is a refreshing change from the typical box office no-brainer movies that are always replete with explosions, car chases, and predictable plots.
For sheer originality and quirkiness, Donnie Darko is highly recommended.",1080864000,6,668,5.027027027027027

1671942,4,B00005V3Z4,"""Donnie Darko"" is already one of the certifiable cult classics of the 2000s, joining perhaps ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" who already achieve such status in still a young decade. What sets this film apart from the others, however, is its sheer unclassifiable ness: family drama, horror, science fiction and humor are all mixed in this cinematic stew where ""Pretty in Pink""-meets-""Slaughterhouse-Five""-meets-""Catcher in the Rye."" The outcome is a highly original film that dives into fundamental questions of life itself, all of which makes great entertainment.
Set in the tightly-clinched sphincter of late-1980s Reagan America, we meet East Coast Catholic high schooler Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a troubled teen with emotional problems that worry his concerned and supportive family. Donnie's world isn't in good shape either: Dukakis is losing badly to George Bush; his fellow high schoolers and friends are brash and racist; his education filled with meaningless fear-and-love emotional studies. The neatly trimmed lawns, big homes and fine green trees of his hometown of Middlesex, Virginia disguise the brewing trouble that is lurking all around.
Donnie unexpectedly begins to sleep walk at night, leaving his house to wake up in the morning on hillside roads and golf courses. During one such walk, a disjointed voice lures him out of the house and onto a golf course, where Donnie discovers a guy in a demonic bunny suit named Frank telling him that the world will end in twenty-eight days.
This sparks a chain of events that not only puzzle Donnie, but virtually everyone around him, calumniating in a hallucinatory finale where the audience is asked to question what it means to be alive and ultimately what it means to be alone in a complicated and sometimes frightening universe.
With a strong cast that includes Patrick Swayze as an ultra-conservative emotional speaker, Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore as Donnie's progressive English and science teachers, Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's real-life sister) as Donnie's `80s-brat sister, and the always great Mary McDonnell as Donnie's confused but loving mother, ""Donnie Darko"" has a great depth of actors which brings these colorful characters to life. The also fabulous soundtrack includes a slew of `80s favorites, like Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears, the Church, and Joy Division. Its most talked about song, ""Mad World"" an excellent remake of the Tears for Fears classic by Gary Jules, is absolutely haunting when played near the film`s conclusion. Attesting to its power, it went to number one in the UK in December 2003, nearly two years after being released.
In all, ""Donnie Darko"" is a great movie to watch on Friday or Saturday night with all the lights turned off, and possibly a cup of coffee once it's ended to talk about it. Like a good wine, ""Donnie Darko"" has become more popular since its subdued release in 2001, and with time, has only gotten better.",1080518400,2,2956,5.147609147609147

Jake Gyllenhaal, in the title role, gives a magnificant performance that makes you forget that he did ""bubble boy""(and THATS saying something!)  The movie has its gentle moments, and its moments that grab you and never let go, but the entire experience itself is rivetting.
All of my friends who have seen the movie went right away to buy the movie for themselves- its that good.  The ending will keep you thinking for weeks, and it will take a couple of viewings to truely begin to comprehend it.  It ends up like ""American Beauty"" with time warps and wormholes.
Not only is the movie amazing, this DVD has great features.  There are multiple deleted scenes which are interesting to see, and the commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal and the director/writer Richard Kelly help shine light on some of the more obscure parts of the film.

It brings up so many issues and ideas that everyone develops their own beliefs and interpretations. I have had many discussions about religion, time travel, love and life because of this film.
Donnie- a typical teenager suffering from a mental illness is the focus of this sci fi thriller. I don't want to give anything away so that's basically all you can say. But just be open minded and enjoy the ride, after the film is over you're not even sure if you know what you were watching, or if it even happened.

Like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Empire Records"" (Damn the man, save the empire) Donnie Darko is another cult-classic film about or catering to Generation Y and Z--the generation who like to think, who speak fast and care more about others then themselves. (No offense, Generation X, its not your fault you were all products of the Me Me Me Eighties)
We're not sure *exactly* what the film is trying to say but all the themes are here--loneliness, being different, depression, dying, love, parents, future.
Donnie Darko escapes death when a demonic looking bunny tells him to get up and go out to a golf course, to prevent being crushed by a plane engine that falls out of nowhere...perhaps through a time travel barrier from the future...?
Things get just plain weird though, when he has imaginary dreams, the bunny tells him the world will end in 28 days (Perhaps not 'the world' but Donnie's world?) he sleepwalks and uncovers secrets of people in his town unintentionally (or intentionally...?) and people he loves get hurt.
Donnie is afraid of being alone. Especially of dying alone. But sometimes sacrifice is the only way to let the people you love live...and to never be alone.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character seamlessly, which, considering the complexity and ultimate weirdness of Donnie, is a tremendous accomplishment.  I loved the ending, and the way that all of the characters were a touch strange.  Drew Barrymore did an excellent job at creating a meaningfull, in not large, character.  The story line, and I mentioned, takes a severe twist at the end and is complicated throughout, but you'll love it the first time, even if some things are unclear until the next.",1078444800,,828,4.920863309352518

A giant bunny comes to a high school student throughout the movie and tells him to create certain acts of crime such as arson, vandalism, etc. Ya, I had that same look on my face. Seems a little odd, but this movie is definitely one that will get you thinking. With the dark themes and a rather odd sense of humor at times it just makes the movie all the more pleasing. It's a great movie to watch if you really want to get the wheels in your head turning.
The cast was wonderfully put together with familiar stars. The lead role of Donnie Darko is played by the handsome Jake Gyllenhaal (not a bad thing to look at ;) ).
I'd recommend this if you are looking to start a conversation with someone on what you think the main points of the movie are and what it means to you. And because it can get somewhat confusing at times I'd suggest that you clear your mind and be open to the journey that is awaiting you.

The film explores teen angst, religion, love, and science fiction, all in an unorthadox presentation that may leave you scratching your head, but nontheless inspired by its haunting brilliance.  The solution is there if you have the ingenuity to ponder it - I'll just say it has a lot to do with divine intervention to teach a lesson and finding resolution to the painful complications of teen life.

The film is set in the 80s, and director Richard Kelly does a superb job in giving it a distinct 80s aura.  You'll think you're watching a movie that was really made in the 80s.  Combining this style with the vivid and eerie soundtrack, Donnie Darko is sure to leave a lasting impression on you and will give you a lot to think about.  If it leaves you feeling frustrated, there are plenty of online resources to help you sort it out.  The filmmakers admit that with the editing job done to the movie, certain things do not make definitive sense.  Supposedly a newly-edited version is being released in theaters sometime soon.

What with the brilliant acting, witty and clever dialogue, intriguing plot and magnificant musical score it's hard to fathom how someone could dislike this film. At the heart of the film's brilliance is its open-ended plot. Unlike Memento and 12 Monkeys (and Mulholland Drive to a degree), the viewer is required to form his own conclusions as to the ultimate meaning the film imparts. It requires the viewer to think; it is indie at its absolute best.
It is not a mainstream film in any sense of the word. And it is, as others have said, a film that you will either love or hate. If you generally like films that have a discernable plot and comprehensible conclusion it is likely that you will dislike this film.
But with an open mind, multiple viewings and patience (of which some people obviously lack), you too shall fall in love with this film. It is, quite simply, brilliant.",1077148800,,1081,4.6947368421052635
1671979,4,B00005V3Z4,"There is a curious cinematic form that has emerged in the last few years, which is akin to the Moebius Strip.  In such films, past shades into future, cause and effect are interchangeable, and the film loops around neatly (and shockingly) to reveal that it is really a sort of closed alternate universe. Examples include Lost Highway, Memento, 12 Monkeys, and now Donnie Darko.
One of its charms (and frustrations) is that, like Vanilla Sky, you are never certain just what sort of film it is you are watching until the end.  It reveals itself slowly - layer by layer.
Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a likeable young man troubled by what is probably paranoid schizophrenia.  Refreshingly, his parents (played by Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnel), are not the usual teen flick dummies.  The family, while a bit dysfunctional, manages to remain cohesive and loving.  This is important.  The film would function as a sympathetic treatment of mental illness even if it did not have other goals in mind.
Darko has strange visions and visitations.  He sleepwalks, and finds himself waking up in odd places.  Most disturbing, he seems to hallucinate a guy named Frank in a macabre bunny suit, who tells him that the world will end in 28 days.  It does not take long to figure out that he's referring to Darko's world, not the world as a whole.
To enjoy this film, one needs to understand two things: the events, though strange, are leading to a definite, coherent conclusion; and - importantly - the audience is asked to participate in fitting the pieces of the puzzle together.  There is no character given the task of explaining it to the audience to make sure we get it.  That there is an answer, and that it's slyly revealed through seemingly inexplicable pieces doled out in the course of the story, is a testament to the skill of first-time writer-director Richard Kelly.
As plenty of other reviews here make clear, there are many people who lack the patience for this sort of thing.  If you are one of them, you have been warned. You will probably find Donnie Darko both perplexing and pointless. But if you enjoy puzzles, if you find yourself trying to second guess where films are going as you watch, then you will probably find this film enjoyable.
Although I didn't think Donnie Darko was very profound, I did find it moving.  Jake Gyllenhaal embodies his character completely, making him sympathetic even when his behavior borders on psychotic.  His is a brilliant, if malfunctioning mind, and Gyllenhaal's performance manages the neat trick of telling us that there is a decent human being struggling under the burden of his illness.  This basic decency leads him to decision at the end of the film that, while not very surprising, is nonetheless heroic in its own way.
The DVD is fairly good, with some interesting (if not particularly revealing) extras, and a couple of frustratingly disjointed commentary tracks.  In my opinion, actors and directors should strive to actually PREPARE what they are going to say, while still allowing for some spontaneity during the recording session.  If not, you get a lot of laughing and people talking over one another, as you do here.  It's good for a listen, but don't expect anything truly revealing.
I'm not sure how much further the Moebius film can be taken.  It may be exhausted with just a handful of striking examples.  But then, who could have foreseen such a striking, original film as Donnie Darko in the first place?",1076889600,6,3479,4.815126050420168

I've heard so many different interpretations upon having conversations with friends about this movie.  Just when I think every angle has been covered, someone else comes up with a new perspective.  One friend has even suggested that the whole story can come across possibly from Cherita Chen's point of view because of her silent affection for Donnie and the book in which his name graces the cover.
I'm not one for flashing back to the 80's, but this movie reminded me of the good music that came from those years. There is nothing like Echo and the Bunnymen's ""The Killing Moon"" to get me going.  Hell, every time I hear it now, I automatically think of the movie. Plus, the Bush and Dukakis presidential election debate clip along with the excellent use of Duran Duran's ""Notorious"" was an added bonus.
It's cliched to say this, but this is a movie for people who like to think instead of just soak up pointless plots.  It's not as complicated as some may make it out to be and if this is Kelly's first major project, I can't wait to see what else he's got up his creative sleeve.
Great performances.  Great music.  Great story.  ""Chut up"" and check it out.",1075939200,32,1351,4.508196721311475

1671986,2,B00005V3Z4,"During the first twenty minutes or so, I found DONNIE DARKO to be fairly interesting and even somewhat entertaining. The reptilian rabbit head was just plain bizarre and kind of creepy and enough to keep me interested for awhile. However, things didn't start to make any sense and crucial pieces and elements of the ""plot"" started disappearing left and right. By the time the film ended I was wondering to myself, ""What in the world was that all about."" Now after reading a few reviews here, I can see how the whole dream-thing fits in and the movie sort-of makes sense. However, if it was all a dream, then this movie is just one big cop-out. Had the movie been written and edited together better, then this would not be the case. But it is.

The writing is awful. Everything is all choppy and convuluted and doesn't make any sense. Of course, if it's all a dream, it does make sense. But, the thing about dreams is, nobody really likes watching other people's dreams. Dreams are difficult enough for the dreamer to understand, yet alone anyone outside in the ""real world"". Dreams are very personal and usually should be kept that way. That's why movies that are dreams on celluloid usually just don't cut it as cinema. A dream has to be restructured to make sense on the screen and if it isn't, it falls apart.

However, even if the film did make sense, it still wouldn't be all that great. The poor writing has already been mentioned, but the acting is even worse. Jake Gyllenhall does a decent job as Donnie Darko and the young lady who plays his girlfriend isn't too bad either. Outside of that, most of the actors in this movie seem less believable than a cartoon. Patrick Swayze is one of the big names who has a secondary role in the film. His character seems like somebody who has taken too much speed; I mean Chris Farley's Matt Foley was a better and more believable motivational speaker than this guy. Then there's the other big name of the film, Drew Berrymore. Drew is a brilliant young actress, but in this movie she sucks. She plays a teacher who is dismissed for teaching a graphic novel in class that the school board believes leads to school vandalism. You can tell that Drew just doesn't relate to the noble profession and good old American teachers because her performance is as stiff as a brick wall. One of those Fandango paper-bag puppets could pull off a more believable performance than she did.

The acting is pretty lame, the writing poor, and the plot makes no sense. The whole thing is supposed to be a dream, but comes off as being a cheap cop-out. Therefore, you will probably either love or hate this movie. I personally couldn't stand it after the first twenty minutes, but thought the reptilian rabbit head was creative enough to be worth a glance.",1075852800,,2783,4.573146292585171

  I read a lot of the reviews that didn't give high remarks for this film and i have to say that it was quit obvious that none of them didn't even try to get into the movie at all. I only offer my opinions and thoughts of this movie. Some of you out there were just to damn critical and wrote as if you were getting paid for your words.

1672008,5,B00005V3Z4,"So in this perfectly made indie film from a fear years ago we get nothing but wonderful acting from some pretty well known stars and a perfect script as well as some good affects for the film only being shot for like 4 million.
We have a sick and delusional teenage boy trying to live his life through all the horrors of the 80s and being a teenager.  If that wasn't hard enough he starts having delusions of a big demonic bunny rabbit damned Frank.  Frank tells his he must do certain tasks to save everyone, because the world is comming to an end.  So Donnie is set on this path where everything connects so perfectly.  Does he save the world at the end, who is frank really?  Do we have free will, or are we fated?
Yes, expect watching this more than once and plan on being open to many different interpretations.  This is one of those films where its fun to talk to someone about what you think it's really about and what's going on.
Highly recommend it!  And the soundtrack is awesome as well.",1075766400,,998,4.304812834224599

1672010,4,B00005V3Z4,"In Donnie Darko, I am vaguely reminded of the question put to the test in The Seventh Sign, where Demi Moore is asked, ""Would you die for him?""
She doesn't understand the question until the ending.  In a way, I compare Donnie's dream, or alternate reality, to this question:  ""Would you die for love?""
It also brings about another question, ""Is it better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all?""
Donnie is odd, Donnie is strange; but Donnie is a likeable kid despite his problems.  He is on medication for troubles he has had in the past, and is struggling to ""just be normal"".  He meets a girl named Gretchen, and they find their first love; and it will be a never-ending love.  Gretchen has problems of her own, with her mother having to hide from a violent ex-husband.
The movie starts with Donnie waking up in the middle of the street, in the hills above his home.  He brushes himself off and heads home only to discover that a plane engine fell out of the sky from nowhere and struck his room.  If Donnie did not suffer from somnambulism he would have been killed.
Donnie does have friends at school, but he also has imaginary companions whom he speaks with, and as he tells his therapist, they sometimes tell him to do things.  Enter Frank, the large psycho looking bunny who tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.
Basically, the movie follows Donnie for these 28 days, through school and therapy and home, bringing in some very interesting characters like Grandma Death, and of course Frank; along with great small roles by Drew Barrymore as the teacher and Patrick Swayze as the self-help guru who doesn't make any sense.  You will love the scene where Donnie attends one of his seminars.
It's rather hard to do a review of this movie without giving away any key information, and I urge you not to read any review that offers spoilers.  This is a movie that should be watched without knowing, so that all the emotions it provokes come from inside you and not some reviewer or friend.
The ending is very surprising, and left me with a question that will not spoil the movie for you;  did Donnie make the choice, or was the choice made for him?
Your view of this movie will definitely be your very own, but I can guarantee that whether you love it or hate it, you will not walk away unscathed.
It is both dark and enlightening, surreal and yet realistic, and definitely thought provoking.  If you have been trying to decide whether or not to rent it, my advise is just do it and judge it for yourself.

1672011,4,B00005V3Z4,"I saw this movie after it was recommended that if I enjoyed Mulholland Drive I would enjoy this one. I found this movie to be even more disturbing than Mulholland Drive, and just as difficult to figure out after the film had ended. At times the movie also reminded me of ""American Beauty"" with its portrait of suburban dysfunctional family life. I thoght Jake Gyllenhaal gave a very good performance but I found his character to be somewhat creepy as well of course as the circumstances and visions that he experiences. I thought his therapist was not so competent and I was surprised he didn't get as angry with her as he did with the other fanatical adults that he encountered. The movie was just a little too intense for me at times and was often painful to watch. The ending I found totally baffling as well as totally unexpected, but I guess if I watch it again I might possibly figure it out.

He happens to know that Armageddon is coming, as he was told by a 6 foot rabbit with the voice of Freddy Krueger.  As the days count down, Donnie rebels against the system and causes general chaos, all the while maintaining that the rabbit instructs him to commit these vandalistic acts, and that they will help to save the world.  On the night when Armageddon is supposed to occur, a series of events takes place and all the loose ends are tied up in a way that is both beautiful and utterly confusing.  It will require at least another two viewings for you to fully understand what happened, and even then you may not be sure.  An intellectual delight.",1073692800,2,958,4.8765432098765435
1672015,4,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a film about existence, death, and teenage angst. Donnie Darko is beautiful, and powerful, and funny all at the same time. Though the film isn't perfect, freshman writer/director Richard Kelley delivers enough great moments to make Donnie Darko a must-see.
I always say that I love seeing a film that shows me something new. Donnie Darko isn't a cliche teen horror film, and it's not a silly sci-fi rehash. I didn't know anything about the plot of Donnie Darko beforehand - and I'm glad I didn't. This film is deep and thoughtful; thoughtful in a way that stays with you intensely for several hours.
I must give a specific mention to the original music in Donnie Darko. All of the music is a perfect complement to the film's mood - somber, yet positive. Additionally, the theme song for the film is just stunning. Who would have thought a remake of the Tears For Fears song ""Mad World"" would work so well here?
Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job playing the disturbed lead character. His task is not an easy one. Gyllenhaal has to play a character that is simultaneously smart, scared, and drugged. Also very good is Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother. A lesser director might have painted Donnie's parents as mean or unsympathetic. The only bad performance was Drew Barrymore. Thankfully, she only has about six minutes of screen time. Other than Barrymore, almost all of the performances are very good.",1073606400,,1416,4.783673469387755

This movie drags you deeper and deeper into the main character's world even when both you and the character are not sure what's real.

I just overlooked it, and continued on my way through the site - though I did enjoy hearing the title track and cover of Tears For Fears' ""Mad World"" by Gary Jules. Last weekend, I came across the DVD in the under $10 bin at a local store, and figured it was worth a shot. The box said little about the plot, and I figured I needed to keep my opinion here relatively the same.
  Initially seeing Drew Barrymore (and her company, Flower Films) as one of the executive producers, I expected some pop, bubble gum, teen flick along the lines of her bookend Charlie's Angels with a Final Destination undertone. To my surprise this Richard Kelly script delivered a stark and sterile vision of life though often over-medicated American eyes. It places the 6'-tall rabbit of ""Harvey (1950)"" into the setting of darker ""Magnolia (1999)"" and its self help videos, with a dash of Alan Ball (American Beauty/Six Feet Under) into a blender, but comes out original and enjoyable.

1672020,5,B00005V3Z4,"Spoiler Warning.
The trick to understanding this movie is to realise that Donnie's alternate reality is a dream/premonition of a possible future that could happen if he chooses to get out of bed before the jet engine hits his room.
The alternate reality is a creation of Donnie subconscious mind and Frank is a physical representation of that subconscious mind, within that alternate reality.
Frank is the part of Donnie's mind that created the alternate reality.
Frank guides Donnie, who is one of the characters within that alternat reality down the correct path.
Frank knows everything that is going to happen, how long the alternate reality will exist for and every character within that alternate reality.
The time travel idea is another part of Donnie's subconscious mind, which gives Donnie a doorway out of the alternate reality and back to normal reality.
Frank and the time travel part of the film are not meant to be taken literally, they are just parts of Donnie's subconscious mind.
If you look at the film in this way it will begin to make sense.

He said it was really good and he was looking for it to come up again. He said we HAD to see it.  It eventually did come on again one late night, and he made my husband and daughter watch it with him.

Flipping around channels one early, early morning I chanced onto this movie.  I watched it, totally enthralled, and totally oblivious to the fact that it was 4 in the morning and I had to go to work in a little bit.  When it was over I got up and complained to my sleeping son that I was now hooked, late for work, and it was all his fault.

Donnie Darko is more than a film it's a puzzle; I've finally put together the pieces after re-watching the film several times. If you've never seen this film you may want to stop reading this spoiler because I'm about to reveal the truth about Donnie Darko.  I've read many reviews about this film from critics and various members of the general public and nobody has ever explained what the film is about, WHY? Because they don't know.  I DO! Donnie is the second coming of Jesus Christ...he died at the end of the film because of peoples sins (To give them another chance to live).  There are many clues in the film about this. The cinema is playing the last temptation of Christ, Donnie's Psychiatrist tells him that if the world were to end then there would only be him (God) and you (Donnie) left.  Donnie cries after hearing this.  Frank asks him ""Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?"" Because he's Jesus.  Donnie's teacher tells him that an act of god would be the only way wormholes could appear out of nowhere.  Donnie explains to his teacher that it would be possible to travel in time along god's path. Frank is a vision from the future guiding Donnie to save the world.  Donnie floods the school so that he can meet Gretchen, he falls in love with her and she dies. Everything comes together so perfectly so that Donnie will save the world and die for people's sins. The plane engine is a rip in the space-time continuum (I.e. there's no need for it to be there) God uses Donnie to repair the rip.  Donnie calls Patrick swayze satin.  God is using Donnie to save humanity and Donnie Darko is the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Ok!

1672031,5,B00005V3Z4,"Possibly one of the most original alternative films I've seen in the past years, Donnie Darko is a powerful mind stimulator.
A brilliant deep-cutting script combined with intimidating acting and careful directing is what you get here but the more thoughtful viewers will also be awarded with valuable and out of the mainstream questions.
A young teen diagnosed with bordeline schizophrenia starts having weird meetings with a human size rabbit who looks part alien, part reptile, part artificial, and who carries a message of doom for Donnie Darko (the boy, and yes, that's his name)..Donnie begins to take the message very seriously but simoultaneously he begins paying attention to the world around him and in him. He understands with the help of his ""friend"" that nothing you see and observe is accidental.
Predictably, he comes at odds with the people he tries to convey this message to (""the world will end in 28 days""), he discovers that most people out there live on the surface of reality and not only they wouldnt dare take a dive underneath but wouldnt even consider there's something constantly eluding their awareness. Probably because their awareness is, hmm, defective?
Donnie Darko, inspired by his visions ( or his deeper glimpse of reality) begins a personal trek of questioning, redifining and re-interpeting. The strange ""Grandma of Death"" (an old woman who years ago had written a book about time travel and spends her time ever since waiting for a ""message"" herself) becomes a focal point for Donnie. But Donnie tries also to squeeze as much information about the puzzle of reality from other people around him, most notably certain teachers, he attempts to piece things together and bond all these realities that appear before his eyes and mind together.
The film is, as others have noted too, incredibly hard to classify. Viewers with a particular liking in the ""alternative"" will adore it as it encompasses loads of hints and direct references not only to time travel, but to parallel universes, telepathy and astral projection to mention but a few. But if the ""paranormal"" spooks you it has strong dosages of the ""normal"" reality most people experience too even if that is portrayed as a dull and depressing one. Which is yet another asset of the movie: it is as frank and honest as it gets.
The young actor who plays Donnie Darko is utterly convincing allthough he has his show stolen by his mother who adds the necessary down-to-earthness to it all with her refreshing performance. But there is no actor involved in this film who goes unnoticed and I'd have to think hard to find a parallel in that respect.
Lastly, this is an emotional rollercoaster of a film, it goes from scary to sad to funny and thought provoking to intimidating and back to melancholy in an stunningly effortless way (kudos to the script writer).
An absolute must-see.",1071014400,7,2868,4.927685950413223

I saw it as the story of a trouble youth told in a way lashing out at society. For example, all of Donnie's acts of arson are done because Frank tells him to, but he only sees Frank when he's whacked out on his meds. (much like how ritilin is dished out to any and every ""trouble-maker"" in grade school.)
Interpret the ending as you see fit. Was it all just in Donnie's mind? Look at the jet engine being hauled away and notice the strange red swirl, almost as if it were dreamt up. Buy the DVD I guess, maybe the commentary can shed some light on the matter. (I think the matter would best be left up to individual interpretation. Movies like Donnie Darko force you to THINK. ... I guess I have to make my own mold"")

It is subtle, and haunting, with even the minor characters given depth by their portrayal. I would absolutely recommend it.
For me, one of my favourite parts of this movie was a minor subplot involving two characters. Drew Barrymore imbues her excellent portrayal of the high school English teacher trying hard to reach reluctant students with great compassion, especially in the byplay between her and the young Cherita Chen. It's a touching and evocative portrayal of the hidden compassion teachers can feel for particular students, of the general struggle of teachers today who care about their students. It's hard to describe it, but it's absolutely magnificent.
This movie is worth buying because it's worth watching more than once; there are complexities and nuances of the plot itself and of the minor characters that reveal themselves only on subsequent viewings.",1068163200,,1035,5.395061728395062
1672038,5,B00005V3Z4,"(Donnie Darko) Dir: Richard Kelly 2001
First of all I salute the director for his trend in thinking of our nature of reality and existence which really deserves the shedding of our thoughts.
Although the Eighties were relatively near era with none very signifying features to be represented by, the atmosphere of the movie is amazingly indicative, you really feel that this movie was shot in the eighties.
This movie has a very original plot, especially amongst those pillars of remakes and sequels we are compelled to watch every year, here we have a unique case in demonstrating ideas, to cover the plot with a quilt of pseudoscience as a metaphor of our direct perceptions.
Mr. Kelly is hiding his original overall concept about our reality, existence, death and after all the after life. But I forgive him for he was aware that the audience will reject that all the solutions will be resolved by a dream, which is becoming a relic plot device.
At the first place let us not to forget it is the Eighties, so the world obviously did not come to an end. So the other interpretation for the rabbit's warning must have one of the following probabilities:
1) If Mr. Darko is still sane enough, so it is his own world which is going to end.
2) Or the whole dream is a part of his delusions.
I choose the first probability:
And now, Let us return to the opening scene when Darko is awaken and standing up from his sleep on the road (this place might be his after life residence), he awakes with a satisfactory smile filling his face that is due to his rewarding dream, the dream in which he was alternately showed what is the effect of his prolonged existence on his beloved ones would be if he had not died.
Yes you began to catch Mr.'s Kelly concept which says that ""every dying individual is rewarded by a satisfactory dream before he die"" a dream in which the deceased one know that his time on earth is up for considerable reasons.
If you do not consider my explanation, let's revise the following tips which may support my assertion:
1) Darko main terror is the fear of death
2) Watch carefully for center of the falling jet engine it has a mark of a painting of a swirl just like the type of paintings we can only see in amusement parks, it is a hint that what we are seeing is a dream sequence.
2) There elements of dream pseudo-reality:
1) Fear is not antonym to Love as it has been taught in the
Lessons of spirituality.
2) Graham Greene's graphic novel is impossible to be part of the curriculum in the USA high schools during the eighties.
3) All the pseudoscience of time travel and ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" book are a dream resolutions (I personally had experienced those kind of dreams in which you can fix any problem with a very then convincing solutions and just after you wake up with the pride of victory you discover it was nonsense hokum, for example my testing days of I dreamt once while I was studying for math test of equations so nave that I was awaken very convinced of my invention, and seconds later as they vanish, I recognize they were the daughters of my dreaming mind)
4) Watch out for Mrs.' sparrow whispering quote is a reminiscent of his personal terror (fear of death) ""Every living creature on earth dies alone"".
5) The song mad world reveals it all
6) All the declination of his mental state and its consequences (sabotaging the school, the death of his girl friend, killing (Frank) the rabbit and the death of his mother and sister) are better is interpreted as part of his dream.
I admit very much this movie for it is a character study about the titular young man who is losing it for a not very clarified although intricate reasons.
If you like that movie I strongly recommend.

1672039,5,B00005V3Z4,"I can understand how someone who saw this movie in a theatre as a stand alone experience could find it confusing. Fortunately, the deleted scenes in the DVD kind of take you by the hand and clue you in to what actually happened to Donnie, and why.

Having said that, though I'm truly glad I watched them, my overwhelming impression of every deleted scene was that there was a good reason it was deleted, that the movie was better without it.

For instance, the scenes with Donnie carving pumpkins with his sister and her attempt to help him, and his heart-to-heart with his Dad, were very well-acted but lessened the sense of Donnie as being isolated, of having to deal with this hideous problem alone.

The scene with Elizabeth on the phone gives us way too great a clue toward one of the big surprises later in the film.

I'm very, very glad they cut the scene where the shrink tells Donnie his pills are just placebos. Again, that greatly lessens the sense of Donnie as being in a totally crappy situation, a big part of which was being forced to take anti-phychotic drugs. It also paints the doctor, a character we're supposed to like and respect, as being extremely deceitful and manipulative, to have lied about this, not only to Donnie but his very concerned parents. ""I think we should increase his medication,"" indeed. Nuke that one.

My good friend does the artwork and inking for most of my stories, and he is the one who recommended this DVD to me.
It truly is a comic book story.  Donnie Darko, a sixteen year old boy with emotional problems, is a superhero who must save the world, or so he is told by Frank, the 6-foot tall bunny rabbit.  Donnie, his family, his girlfriend Gretchen, and everyone around him can feel the subtle aura of something not quite right.  What only Donnie realizes is that the countdown has begun.

1672049,3,B00005V3Z4,"As it features Echo & The Bunnymen's single The Killing Moon within its first five minutes, and Joy Division's epochal Love Will Tear Us Apart within its last ten, Donnie Darko is the sort of film I have a natural weakness for. It plays like an 80's version of American Beauty. And while it's nicely ironic, well written and cleverly engineered - too cleverly engineered, really - I think it lets itself down badly in execution. An awful lot of signposts the movie needs to make it understandable are down, unclear, or just flat out missing.
As a result the film is largely incoherent. Many of the positive reviews praise it for a dark post modernism which I really don't think was intended. There's a fine line between post modernism and incoherence, of course.
A case in point: the episode where a jet engine falls out of the sky but which no-one reports as missing. Rather than being a wry satire of corporate responsibility and American victim culture, this is actually intended as plain old daft science fiction: it isn't reported as missing, because it has fallen through a wormhole in the space-time continuum from another universe. You don't discover this until much later in the film. But at least you do find out eventually: there are several aspects which are key to understanding what is going on that you can only discover by watching the director's commentary and having the incidents pointed out:
While I was busy soaking up Will Sergeant's jangling guitars in the chorus of the Killing Moon, Frank appears briefly in the first scene of the film, driving past the camera in a red Mustang, having dropped Donnie's sister off after a date. He is also mentioned briefly as having died thirty years ago driving to Donnie's father's school prom. These are important to the exposition (and understanding whether Frank is real, an apparition, or a figment of Donnie's deranged mind) but without the director's commentary you would (on a first viewing) be none the wiser. Similarly underemphasised is the fact that, as Donnie leaves the house on the night of the jet engine incident, he moves into a parallel universe. There is nothing at all in the script that, as far as I could see, gave any hint of that. Nor of the fact that Donnie's pills are only a placebo. The film toys with the question of whether or not Donnie is schizophrenic, but never answers it.
In general, Donnie Darko asks a lot more questions than it answers, and by the end of the show I was kicking around a further question: ""what on earth was that all about?""

This is as true for the movie as it is for the lead character. Jake G. has three basic looks he gives the camera--the puppy-dog, the creepy-as-hell snear, and the arrogant/confused/drunken teen. These he does well; but these do not a brilliant actor make. I wish him the best, though, and imagine he has better in him.
!Spoilers follow!
The rest of the characters are paper thin. There is no nuance--each one is a cardboard cut out. Except for the giant time-traveling killer rabbit. Now there's something you don't see every day! My hat's off to whoever thought that up.
I kept putting up with undeveloped and cliche characters and an oddly paced plot (that kept me interested, though) for some sort of payoff. And when it came, I was disappointed. A simple Christological metaphor does not a movie make--in this case, Donnie apparently dies so that an alternate time-stream can be inacted, one that does not involve the death of his family and girlfriend.
This movie is not 5 stars, nor 4, but is regretfully an average movie because of its flaws. Perhaps you can dig into it and watch it 5-6 times and become more accepting of the trite conversations, potty mouth humor, cardboard characters, and did I mention bad lighting, but that does not change the fact that they are there.

1672054,5,B00005V3Z4,"Hollywood's steady downfall into high-priced visual theatrics and recycled storylines with wittless characters has done nothing good except reestablish my faith in the underdog.  ""Donnie Darko"" in this case, is one of those underdogs - a completely morbid and fulfilling storyline, with dazzling presentation and a cast of amazing actors playing multi-layered characters.
The story revolves around the charismatic, wayward teenager, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal).  This troubled teen is the black sheep of his middle-class family, already having trouble with law for stealing a car and attending psycho-therapy sessions to handle his sleepwalking.  Only after a brief introduction into his life, does the movie immediately dive into the action - in a dream, Donnie is beckoned out of his house by an evil (almost satanic) looking man-sized bunny, Frank.  Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days - the 28th day being Halloween.  Back in reality, a jet-plane engine has fallen from the sky and crashed in Donnie's bedroom - Donnie survives because he had been sleepwalking.  Frank becomes a regular figure in Donnie's dreams and delusions - coercing him to commit random acts of vandalism and arson.  In the meantime, the world around Donnie Darko seems embedded with strange characters, mind-bending encounters and philosphical if not humorously poignant conversations.  Among these are are Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), the self-help guru, his highschool teachers: (Noah Wyle) - who is obsessed with the ideas of time travel - and (Drew Barrymore) who is disillusioned with the education system feeding into Jim Cunnigham , Grandma Death -a prophet of some sorts and Gretchen (Jena Malone), Donnie's new girlfriend and another troubled teen, who's mother is hiding out from an abusive ex-husband.  As doomsday approaches, Donnie's visits from Frank the evil bunny become more frequent, as he points out the relivance of time travel in his visits into Donnie's psyche.  Soon, Donnie realizes that many of his encounters with Frank, leave very real impacts on those around him.  (Spoiler:  For instance, Frank tells Donnie to burn down Jim Cunningham's house, that reveals a child pornography ring in his basement).
All events and characters lead Donnie down to his final day, where he realizes that certain events have to take place and some people must suffer in order for others to survive.
""Donnie Darko"" is magnificant in keeping one's interest, keeping its audience in suspense and sometimes in laughter.  Jake Gyllenhaal does a superb job of playing Donnie as a dark confused teenager in search of understanding and conscious, with the sexiness of Tobey Maguire but with a personality.  The dynamics of family make this story seem very real and close to home, as we are not only drawn to the supernatural, but to the plight of Donnie's mother, who is desperate to guide and understand her son.
The basic story, visual effects and music are simple and play well off each other.  However, the much greater story and concept is certainly hard to understand and up for interpretation.  With time travel being a major theme, one might need to watch through the movie two or three times to finally have an idea of what actually happened in what order.  The ending (no spoiler, sorry!) can leave one with the questions: what just happened?... What did he accomplish? But the movie has enough of an impact and plain entertainment value, that I doubt anyone will complain about watching it over again.
This movie is superb for a drinking games, Halloween parties or just sitting back and watching one stormy evening.  If you haven't seen it yet - you're missing out.  One day, film makers will try to imitate the magical properties that ""Donnie Darko"" has captured in about two hours.",1063929600,40,3798,5.106623586429725
1672055,5,B00005V3Z4,"NOTE (6-10-17): This review was originally written for the regular, theatrical version of DONNIE DARKO. Since then, I have seen it, as well as the DIRECTOR'S CUT of the film, many times. While both are fantastic, I would recommend watching the regular version first, as it is more mysterious, since the D-cut reveals certain aspects that I would, IMHO, have left hidden. Then, after seeing the original, I would watch the D-cut to fill in ""gaps"", and to add enjoyment to the experience. Of course, this is only a suggestion. DONNIE DARKO has quickly become one of my all time favorite movies. How can I describe it? It is strange, dark (of course), cool, mysterious, enigmatic, scary, funny, serious, sarcastic, bleak, yet hopeful, mystical, and even charming. Jake Gyllenhaal is Donnie, who is absolutely believable no matter what he says or does. Time travel? No problem! A seven-foot rabbit named Frank who predicts the end of the world in 28 days? No problem! Donnie's earnestness is mesmerizing. The rest of the cast is an incredible ensemble of big stars in small, crucial roles. Drew Barrymore (E.T., The Wedding Singer, Charlies Angels) plays the only teacher in Donnie's school who seems to realize that what's being passed off as an ""education"" is actually a long, dull course in mind-numbing mediocrity (hmmm... sounds like my highschool). Noah Wyle (ER) is the science teacher who has wild theoretical conversations with Donnie about time travel, then cuts him off competely when Donnie asks if God might be involved. Donnie's mom is played by Mary McDonnell (Dances With Wolves, Grand Canyon). She loves him while being frustrated and afraid of his condition. Katharine Ross (The Graduate, The Stepford Wives) is Donnie's psychiatrist, trying to probe his mind and help him. Patrick Swayze (Dirty Dancing) plays Jim Cunningham, tele-guru and local self-help author, who is exposed by Donnie (and Frank) for who / what he REALLY is. Jenna Malone is Donnie's new girlfriend Gretchen. She's got problems enough of her own. Together, this cast of characters orbits perfectly around Donnie's dark center of gravity. Do not expect the typical Hollywood bucket of swill here! Donnie Darko took actual thought to create. It's style and story are unique. I had never even heard of it due to a less than half-hearted ad campaign (I'm a TV addict, yet saw not one DD commercial). I just happened to see the DVD on the shelf and took a chance.

This is the thinking man's (or woman's) movie.  The story is absolutely amazing, a giant paradox with results that no one is sure of.  There are still different theories today, as to what exactly is happening in Donnie Darko.
As you watch it over and over you'll become completely engrossed in Donnie's world.  You never see the same movie twice, there's always something new to think about.  Everytime you watch it something new will pop into your head...this is a true cult classic, it will be around for years.
As my title says, you never know what exactly happens in Donnie Darko.  It truly is a paradoxial masterpiece.  28:06:42:12!",1063324800,2,925,4.42603550295858

1672059,4,B00005V3Z4,"I actually watched this movie on the recommendation of my 15 year old son.  Usually, his tastes are not always the most reliable (!!!), but he was right on the money this time.  This mysterious, funny, moving film has a terrific cast and a very challenging premise.  I won't get into the plot too much (that would be kinda hard to do), but let's just say it messes around a great deal with ideas of time travel.  But it feels like a social satire (a la Heathers) mixed with a moody horror movie (there's a very creep giant rabbit!!).
Jake Gylenhaal, as Donnie, is terrific.  He's been called a ""poor man's"" Tobey Maquire, but he's every bit Maguire's equal, he just hasn't played Spiderman yet.  He's one of these moody, sensitive, soft-spoken young actors, and those kinds of mannerisms can get a bit tiring, but Jake pulls it off with freshness.  His sister Maggie (who was SO terrific in SECRETARY) plays his sister here, and they have a very believable brother/sister, love/hate relationship.
Patrick Swayze has some fun with his clean image, and the scenes of him as a ""motivational speaker"" are truly hilarious.  Drew Barrymore plays an understanding school teacher, but, I must confess, she isn't very good.  Noah Wylie has a small part as another teacher, and he's passable.  Frankly, it is the teen cast that makes this thing sparkle.
It's a difficult movie, and you MUST watch it with your full attention.  But you'll be sure to discuss this for a long time afterwards.
Not for little kids, mostly because they'll never get what the heck is going on!!!",1062979200,33,1562,4.705882352941177
1672060,3,B00005V3Z4,"After reading some of the reviews, I realized that this movie wasn't as bad as I originally thought.  But still there are some things that need to be said. I believe the directors and writers of this movie intended for it to be complex, but rather than this, they made it an unorganized collection of clips and dialog just to fit into a two hour time limit.  This movie did have amazing if not the greatest inventive plotline I have ever seen, it tackled the most important issues in life and death.  Such as religion and/or non-religion, the human mind, family, and love. But Nothing was portrayed the way it was intended to be portrayed. Many characters including Drew Barrymore?s were underdeveloped, and when events took place in their lives, there was no impact to the viewer because of this.  The impact fulness of every event in this movie is dwindled down to a bead because of the lack of character development.  After watching The Virgin Suicides, I understand that it is the idea of some directors and writers to create a sort of third person view movie, as if a book.  This would have made an excellent book.  It makes the viewer focus more on the moral issues and imagery of the story rather than the characters.  However, it seems the producers wanted to impress completely different groups of audiences, one teenagers, the other, the oddballs of the world.  Due to the lack of structure to the movie, all of us oddballs were disappointed, especially with certain mediocre scenes of some characters (Donnie/sister/friends) using out of place profanity and sexual content, when this time could have been targeted to character development and relationships.  Due to this, I was unable to see the character Donnie as a rare and brilliant person, and rather just an average, mediocre teenager.  This is far from complex and brilliant scenes. The teenage crowd was unimpressed by this sloppy attempt at teenage relation.  Many of the deleted scenes were vital, and needed to be included in the movie in order for the viewer to feel and understand the whole concept of it. But the movie was inventive, and had some note worthy parts to it. Sadly, this was just the stories topics, original they were, but not done justice by the acting and character interaction.  The thing that gave it mystical complex beauty was the music, which sets the viewer off into a journey into the stars.  To anyone, I would suggest buying just the album, which is excellent, the score is the only thing that saved this movie from being mush, and providing it with a certain brilliance I was expecting.  The movie was certainly original, and honestly brilliant in some aspects.  But greatly flawed.",1062979200,2,2683,4.787418655097614
1672061,5,B00005V3Z4,"Director Richard Kelly tells us in the DVD extras that he felt like Donnie is a superhero that's been given a job to do. Watch it like it's a comic about an ordinary, not-so-mild-mannered schoolboy that's been given a mission from up high.  I liked the film a lot when I first saw it, but what makes this one special (like so many others) is the way you get something new each time you see it.

  There are so many great things to say about the plot that it's not worth it to write.  Suffice it to say that it's never boring, always original and will remind you of.......nothing.  There's no other movie like this.  It's some crazy blend of thriller, comedy, drama and sci-fi. Maybe that means Kelly has created a new category.  I certainly think that any movie that's hard to classify is a winner.
  The cast is superb. Each play their part to perfection; you sympathize with Donnie, hate the health teacher, love the two young teachers, fear Frank, and despise Jim Cunningham.  When bigshot actors like Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Mary McDonnell all play small parts, you know that they did this movie not for the money, but because they believed in this film.  They trusted the rookie director, and they were right to do so.
  Religion pervades the film, and with careful viewing, you can get a whole new perspective that hopefully will serve as an inspiration to both agnostics and believers.  It might remind you of another young man that willingly gave his life for the people and the world that he loved.  If you get the DVD, watch all the extras, and you'll get a lot more out of it.  Rent it, buy it, borrow it, but whatever you do, don't go without seeing this stunning achievement.",1062806400,,1699,4.518032786885246
1672062,5,B00005V3Z4,"The first time I saw Donnie Darko, my jaw was hanging on the floor as the credits began to roll.  I was literally staring at my TV, dumbfounded at the spectacle I had just witnessed.  The only other movies I've seen that have produced a similar effect were ""Requiem for a Dream,"" and, to a lesser extent, ""Mulholland Drive.""  If you liked those two movies, you'll like ""Donnie Darko,"" especially if you found ""Requiem"" too depressing and ""Mulholland"" too jumbled.  Granted, it's a downer, and it's convoluted, but not as much as the other two, thus sort of being an in between of those two movies.  First time writer and director (and hopefully not last time) Richard Kelly has created an unclassifiable movie, that truly defies description.  However, since I want to be an informative reviewer, I'll do my best.
""Donnie Darko"" is about many things.  On the grand scale, it's about choice, God, and inevitability.  On a smaller scale, it's about time paradoxes, disturbed minds, and coming of age (sort of).  I prefer to look at the movie on the former, but the well acted characters force me to treat the movie more personally, and involve the emotions as well as the intellect.
As far as direct plot is concerned, I'll simply give the set up, because there's no one thing that the movie is ""about.""  Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is about 17 or 18, in high school in the 80's, and mentally disturbed.  He's a morbid person, but perceptive, and both smart and wise.  He is awakened one night by a voice that calls him away from his bed and outside.  There he meets Frank, who is a guy in a demonic rabbit costume.  I suppose you could look at the film as what would happen if David Lynch directed ""Harvey.""  Anyway, Frank informs Donnie that the world will end in 28 days (later, hehe), 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.  Donnie wakes up on a golf course.  Meanwhile, during the night, a jet engine (that's right, a jet engine) from a plane crashes through the roof of Donnie's room.  The tricky part is that the rest of the plane is nowhere to be found, and no flights were scheduled for such a flight path that day.  Donnie now feels indebted to Frank for calling him out of bed, and thus saving his life.  So begins the story.  I can't tell anymore, because a) it's just too complicated, and b) I don't want to spoil it.
The writing is incredible.  Aside from the scattered main plot (which is drawn together beautifully), there are some excellent conversations and pieces of dialogue, my favorite being the discussion on the sexual habits of Smurfs.  It's scenes like that that keep the movie with a lighter side.  The backdrop of the 80's (1988, namely), which is very well done, provides an excellent setting, and provides an excellent soundtrack, which consists of original music and 80's tunes, with music by ""Tears for Fears"" being the standout.  The slow, mellancholly, cover of ""Mad World"" at the end is devastating, and fits the moment so perfectly it's almost as if the song were created specifically for this movie.
The acting is top notch.  Jake Gyllenhaal proves himself a fantastic actor at last, after skirting with glory in other movies, like ""October Sky.""  This is the movie he needed to recover from ""Bubble Boy.""  The supporting cast does their job, even with admittedly trivial characters, like his english teacher (Drew Barrymore).  His girlfriend (I don't know the actress) is a perfect match for him, and their relationship is heartbreaking in its content and in its context.  In other words, the perfect match of sad people is that much more sad.  Patrick Swayze is delicious in his role as a popular, but obviously phony, motivational speaker and writer.  Mrs. Farmer (again, I forget the name, but she's the lady who fell under the bus in ""Speed"") is an excellent uptight teacher, and gets one of my favorite lines: ""Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion!""
This paragraph will have a few spoilers, so read on to the conclusion if you haven't seen it yet.  The most recent time I viewed the movie (again), I picked up on the religious dimension of the film.  I noticed the placement of ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" each time before, but this time I actually took note of Donnie's religious parallel.  I understood in the moment right before the credits roll when Gretchen and Mrs. Darko have the strange connection that insinuates that they somehow ""know"" each other.  I picked up on that a little bit the first few times as a connection transending space-time from the universe in which Donnie wasn't killed...Anyway, the last time I realized what the real connection was: without Donnie's sacrifice, they'd both be dead.  For Donnie so loved the world that he gave himself to save Gretchen, his mother, his sister, Frank, and all the others on the plane...  This movie is smart, emotionally powerful, and unbelievably original.  Go see it.  Now.",1062374400,7,4898,4.723203769140165

1672064,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is the most ferociously independent movie i've ever seen.  It has more plot twists and suprises than most people are ready for but, for people who like to watch a movie that they actually have to put some effort in understanding and keeping up with Donnie darko is perfect.  You will not be able to get it all at first(It will probably take many viewings for you to understand everything). Everytime you will be interested and compeled.
  Donnie is a six-teen year old boy from suburban Virgina.  In addition to having anger problems(for which he is taking medication) he is continually seeing a demonic 6ft. reptile-like bunny.  Who tells him the world will end in one month.  That night a 2,000 lb. jet engine falls on his bed(which was empty do to The Bunny Frank leading him out his room and onto a public golf course).  Over the course of the next month he oberves the world around him and begins to question the universe's boundaries.  After the climax of the action where 3/4 of the films questions are answered Donnie has to make the descion of saving himself or mostly everyone else he knows.  I'm not going to give away the ending but Frank was right about the world ending in one month.
  Besides being an indie( which gives it atomatic respect from me) The movie has the best message of any movie ever made ( i would know since i've been through a great deal of them ).  There is no other movie that will leave you feeling like you have just been on such a journey, or that you will get more out of.",1061856000,3,1524,4.419354838709677
1672065,5,B00005V3Z4,"I had never been as blown away by a film as I was when I first saw 'Donnie Darko' a little under a year ago.
In fact, when I saw this at the cinema, I went back the next afternoon and saw it for a second time. It's that good. Like 'Fight Club', it's definitely the sort of film where a second viewing is really beneficial.
I went in knowing little to nothing about this film, and that's the best way to approach it. The less you know about 'Darko', the better your enjoyment of the film will be. This is the sort of film that doesn't treat it's audience like children. It doesn't provide a simple story, it doesn't offer up any easy answers. This is the sort of brave and innovative filmmaking that makes up for all the insipid 'paint-by-numbers' films that have become standard multiplex fare. It's this sort of film that restores your faith in cinema. Every performance here is no less than first class, every moment no less than totally engaging.
The DVD is wonderful, and the two commentaries - one with director Richard Kelly and star Jake Gyllenhaal, another with various other cast members including Drew Barrymore and (a very subdued) Jena Malone - are the highlights out of the multitude of bonus features on offer.  'Darko' fans will have great fun pouring over the other special features as well, including trailers, deleted scenes and 'The Philosophy of Time Travel.'

The only thing I could think about afterwords was that the writter of this movie wrote himself into a corner with the ""Frank"" character and did not have any idea how to explain Frank.
The other reviews of this title have made it sound like something an interlectual would love.  I currently have an IQ of 120 and I think you would have to be drunk or stoned to find this movie to be signifigant and full of meaning.  I would have given this movie only one star, but the untouted appearnce of Maggie Gyllenhall (Jake's real life sister), the star of ""Secretary"" is worth at least on additional star.",1061596800,,793,4.556338028169014

The ending was great, but it made me cry.  Donnie spends the entire movie (takes place during a 28 day period) trying to figure out if we all die alone.  While he does this, he falls in love, finds out how much his mother loves him and exposes town scandals.  Though the ending was clever, it made me sad to think that all of that never happened.  He goes back in time and the whole movie never happened and to top it off, he is killed.  While he listens to his hallucinations in the beginning of the movie and gets out of the house, he doesn't when he goes back in time and is killed by the time travel machine.  When the girl he fell in love with is asked if she knew him, she reply's that she didn't.  Though he does find that we don't die alone, it's still a little tragic.",1061510400,,913,4.055865921787709
1672068,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a wonderful movie. It really can't be placed in one single category, because that would be denying other aspects of the film. There is the psychological aspect (Donnie, a schizophrenic, sees a man in a giant rabbit costume named Frank who tells him to do things), and there's a family aspect (older sister fights with father about voting issues, younger sister is in a dance group, mother is constantly showing worry for Donnie). There's also a kind of relationship aspect with Donnie and the new girl at school, Gretchen, but its extent is lesser than the ones I've already mentioned (if you wanted a sappy romance, go get a Jennifer Lopez flick).
I'd really recommend the DVD version, because it has the Mad World music video (I cried the first time I heard it), it has deleted scenes, and if you can stand the ubertiny print, the Philosophy of Time Travel in the movie is available to read on the DVD; it helped me understand the whole jet engine thing.
Overall, it is a grand movie; don't pay attention to the bad reviews, because they either didn't understand it or didn't get the message concerning isolation from the rest of society. Or maybe I got it because I myself am thirteen and having a prolonged anti-social thing. Either way, it's a great movie that some people might just not get if they don't give it a chance.",1061078400,6,1344,4.604166666666667

If when you finish the film and you don't have a deep sense of the possibilities in the universe, the calling of self-sacrifice, and the beauty of both time and the aspects that make us human, watch it again.
When you watch it, try to focus not on the surface teen issues, but instead focus on the meaning of the experience of the film.  Make a commitment to trying to understand Darko's complex character, and what he struggles with in life, and how he reconciles those troubles with the gifts that he has been given (and his gifts are extraordinary indeed).  Oh, and remember that if you're confused through most of the movie, that's good.  That means that by the end, you should have a clear idea of what's going on.  If at any point you think you know what's going on, rethink, and rethink, and rethink again.
This is science-fiction, remember.  Although it may claim other things, it is a story about a young boy who we understand at the beginning does not have it all together, and he is fated for things much greater than he knows.  The movie is a riddle, so I leave you to solve the answer.  Don't leave without it.

The plot is ambiguous, but where the movie really shines is character development.  You will know each of the characters by the end of the film, even the character whose only words are 'Chut up!'  It's a very emotional film, touching on feelings of loneliness, love, compassion, and others.

From that point on, the viewer watches as the days count down and Donnie's world gets darker, stranger, and filled with more ""advice"" from Frank.

The film itself is aptly summarized in the rest of the glowing reviews. All I can add is that in 30 years, when Gyllenhaal's episode of Biography is in the works, this will probably be the film that's called out as the pivotal moment in his career.

Though it claims to have transcended all genres, this topic was fairly bordering postmodernistic thought (for eg, darko's nihilistic imaginary pal, Frank, the caricature of the determinist, Jim Cunningham, and the meaningless destruction of donnie's room by an unknown aeriel vessel emphasizing dissociation with rootedness), and so this movie immediately springs to one's mind, masterpieces like ""un chien andalou"", ""lost highway"" or ""trainspotting"". However, there is very little basis for comparison as the concept was treated in a very simplistic and linear fashion. Not even vaguely stunning or fascinating. The direction was original but the pace and stylization were mediocre and the concept of time warps and worm holes was treated too simplistically.
The characters didn't unfold many surprises either. The treatment of characters was like that in a Television serial with no mysterious aura around anyone else other than the protagonist and his imaginary pal, Frank. The picturization was not even vaguely aesthetically pleasing nor shocking.
Regarding performances, Jake Gylenhaal definitely stood out and did an above average job with his role. And so did Drew Barrymore lending some dignified charm to her role as a school teacher intent on breaking deep seated conformistic moulds.
On the whole, this movie deserves to be watched once (if you cant get a copy of any other intellectually stimulating masterpieces of lynch, kubrick, jodorovsky, etc).

Innovative directors (like Richard Kelly) are commitied to bringing art based movies to life. That is exactly what Donnie Darko penetrates...the risky chance of creating a new type of movie.
In the DVD itself, the director points out that this film, while having a structure and definate ending, is certainly open for personal interpretation. Similar to a conceptual painting, viewing this movie takes an incredible amount of intimate focus. The plot is not served on a silver plate like most movies. One must concentrate, evaluate, love, trust, and solve the many mysteries of the characters and goals. Truely unique, you slowly start to comprehend Donnie and his situation (i liked the comparisons to ""catcher in the rye""). The ambitious mix of genres is just a desperate way to try and define this conceptual drama. Those who rated it poorly did so because the film insulted their intelligence. And it will insult your intelligence, too.
I gave this film 4 stars simply because while it is undeniably original, it certainly wasn't a masterpiece. There are many issues that needed to be cleaned up (continuity, some acting (jake however was amazing), cutting VERY IMPORTANT SCENES). I hope to see this new generation of film making in the future.

I have to say that I think this one amazing, powerful little film.  While I did not get every clue as to what was going on, I understood enough to see how clever this movie and story is.
Basically this film is about a corruption in the timeline ... where an object from the future gets transported into the past ... and the need for reality to ""fix"" itself before everything collapses by manipulating characters directly and indirectly ... shaping reality so that the events that cause the tangental universe to occur actually happen ... plugging the hole, so to speak.
Now I realized, for the most part, what was going on ... but I have many friends who did/do not.  This is a very obscure movie ... where you have to figure out what is going on as the characters are doing so ... some clues are obvious ... others not.
Regardless, I would recommend reading the book ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" which can be found on [...] or at [...] ... additionally this second site has a synopsis that explains what is going on in this film.
Read this information and then watch the film again ... you will see that everything makes sense ... everything seen or said has a purpose (in terms of fixing the tangental universe) ...

A hodgepodge of genres, it leaves you unable to verbalize your feelings about the full spectrum of sensory stimulation that you just sat through...add the fact that it didn't even MAKE it to most theaters, and you begin to get very cynical about the way Hollywood makes movies these days.

1672082,5,B00005V3Z4,"There are so many good things to say about ""Donnie Darko"" that this review could be pages long. But, first of all and most important, this is a very original, thought-provoking and intense film.
The script is like something Neal Stephenson and Stephen King would write togheter: dark, multi-elemented, fantastic characters, it grabs the viewer and tranports him to Donnie's reality without effort. Maybe you won't turn the TV set off feeling very well after watching ""Donnie Darko"", but you also won't forget it easily. Donnie sticks to mind. Relating things like depressive behavior with time-travel made this movie one of the most incredible I've seen in the last decade.
Donnie is brilliantly played by one of the upcoming stars of the young generation of talented actors, Jake Gylenhaal. Donnie is a schyzophrenic, uncomprehended kid with lots of relationship problems. Sleepwalking, he does ""errands"" for a fantastic figure, a giant reptile-rabbit named Frank. These errands, always using violence and being supposedly pointless, are all part of a greater scheme conceived by Donnie and his immaginary pal, Frank. And this greater scheme is what is most interesting and original about ""Donnie Darko"". I don't want to give anything away, you'll have to watch it to understand.
All characters are well-developed, no matter how little their on-screen time. For example: Noah Wyle's character, one of Donnie's teachers, is always eating someting, because the actor decided his character was diabetic (!). This is the kind of acting I'm talking about. Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and, especially, Jena Malone, all of them created believable and coherent characters.
But the best thing of all in this amazing movie is the dialogue. It's intelligent, fast, funny. There are many, many memorable quotes, one better than the other. Log on to the Message Board pages about ""Donnie Darko"" at Imdb.com to see what I mean.
Watch it over and over again, pay attention to details, characters, situations and dialogues. Search the web for things related to ""Donnie Darko"". There's much more to it than it seems.

The small town feel adds to the movie's ambience and the Patrick Swayze scenes crack me up every time.  It doesn't really make any sense and you either like it because of it's ambivilence or you don't.
The acting is exceptional by everyone except Gyllenhal but he isn't bad enough to ruin the movie.  I listened to the commentary by the director and Gyllenhal and I swear that guy is the most self centered annoying twit of all time.  WHO WAS THE AD WIZARD THAT CAME UP WITH THAT ONE! no but seriously he came off like a fifteen year old punk who just got his first movie and thought he was GOD.  The music rocks to this movie with some nice 80's music but unfortunately they didn't have enough money to buy the publication rights so the soundtrack so they just put out an instrumental soundtrack.

I kept coming back to 'equilibrium' for the drama and the fantastic story line. 'Donnie Darko' had me waking up the next day thinking about it. Painfully wondering what I'd seen and what had happened. I suddenly found myself on a quest to understand this movie. It drew me in and I didn't even see it coming. It seemed like I was watching a normal movie, all the signs were there, but something hooked me in and I havent' been the same since. Seriously, be warned, this movie is addictive.

1672098,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is the type of movie that defies description, not only because of the melange of several different genres, but because of the feeling it leaves you once the end credits roll.  I saw this movie for the first time this past year at University and at the end of the movie I just sat there shaking my head, my jaw dropped to the floor.  I proceeded to rave about the film to my dorm-mates, and they would always ask me ""What's it about?""  My reply would always be ""I can't tell you.  Not because I don't want to give anything away, but because it is impossible to describe.""  Then after they watched it I would ask them what they thought, and the number one response was a look of amazement followed by ""You're right, I can't describe what I just saw.""  I should follow that up by saying every single person who I told to watch the movie loved it and raved about it to their friends, who in turn fell in love with the adventures of Donnie.
The cast is superb, the script is perfect, the score is beautifully haunting, and Richard Kelly displays an enormous talent in directing his first major film.  There are numerous moments where you just can't believe how good, or how touching, or how poignant, or how mysterious, or how perfect a scene is.  I can't physically tell you what happens plotwise, but I can tell you that you will be blown away as I was.
The DVD is very high quality for the price with very good picture quality, excellent sound, and great menus.  It is packed with special features, some are wonderful (the Mad World music video and the deleted scenes with director commentary,) some are unnecessary (a picture of the soundtrack.)  The commentaries for the feature are an excellent complement to the film.  One has director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhall providing wonderful insights, and the other has at least 7 cast and crew members (Kelly again, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne, Jena Malone, and several others) reminiscing in glowing terms on their experience.  The camaraderie that you feel between them is wonderful, and the movie is seen as a labor of love for each person.
This movie makes a wonderful addition to anyone's collection.  I have yet to convince someone to watch it and have them tell me they thought it was anything less than amazing.  You will feel the same way, no matter what your tastes.",1057449600,,2359,4.585714285714285

He's actually very good and wonderfully cast.
I know many people probably would try to sum up this film, but this is one of those great movies that's more fun to watch when you don't know a single thing about it.

1672100,4,B00005V3Z4,"I honestly don't know how to describe Donnie Darko.  After I got finished watching it I wasn't quite sure what it was that I just saw.  This movie defies classification. It is set in the late 80's during the Bush-Dukakis presidential race.  This fact is not so important other than it gives the movie a concrete sense of time.  This is the when.
The film follows teenaged Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Donnie is in therapy for his schizophrenia and the movie switches between what we see as the reality of the movie and his visions of some creature that looks like it has a mask of a disturbing rabbit.  This rabbit is man sized and it instructs Donnie to act and to do things.  Exactly what these things are would spoil some of the wonder of the movie.  In the reality, the film opens with the engine from a plane falling from the sky and crashing through Donnie's bedroom.
Donnie's family is fairly normal.  He argues with his sister (played by Jake's real life sister Maggie).  His parents try their best to provide for the family and to help Donnie with his therapy.  He is somewhat of an outcast at school but has his group of friends.  He meets a new girl at school (Jena Malone) and they begin a relationship that feels real despite the strangeness of their meeting.
The strength of this movie comes from Donnie's belief in his visions.  It provides motivation as well as tension throughout the movie.  As an added bonus this movie is so original that we don't quite know where the movie is going.  There is discussion of time travel and hints of what might really be going on.
As a whole, this is a fascinating movie.  It requires multiple viewings and since I have only seen it once, I'm not entirely sure of everything that happened in the movie.  It is a  little confusing, but definitely worth watching.",1057017600,4,1818,4.524539877300613

Not that the movie had any other connections to terrorist acts, but that was enough to stifle this well-made indie flick in its theatrical run.  But the DVD brings it to life in a very full way, and with LOADS of extras.
The story is twisting and would make David Lynch's head spin!  Donnie is just your average all-American teen who sees big evil bunny rabbits on golf courses telling him about a coming apocalypse.  He survives a plane engine hitting his house thanks to his visions.  He may or may not be schizophrenic, or touched in a special way.  He commits violent destructive crimes in his sleep, but they bring retribution somehow.  And he may or may not be seeing destiny forming in front of his family - I mean this literally in a physical sense.  Is he crazy?  Is he a savior?  Maybe both.
The cast is SUPERB!  Drew Barrymore who also produced, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wylie, Catharine Ross, and Beth Grant all make strong use of their characters.  The movie is bursting with eccentric well-constructed characters from Donnie's family to his friends.  There are no weak links here!
And technically the movie is beautiful.  Set in the mid 80s, the production design is dead on with just small touches here and there.  The music is affecting!  The camera work is sublime!  Even the special effects work incredibly well given the budget.  This is a labor of love for all involved and it shows.

As you watch Donnies estranged version of life unfolding, you become increasingly troubled by just how screwed up he probably is, the damage he's capable of doing, and the twisted way everything he says makes sense.
 Generally its a movie that will keep you thinking- shallow movie goers will probably think of it as too confusing or that its posing as something more than it is. The interesting thing about the story is that the more you look into it, the less you see these things, and the more you realize the paradox of the story. It will leave you with many a question. Most of all- as the tragically redone version of Mad World plays- you'll be asking ""Why?""
 Is Donnie a tragic hero? A messed up teen? Did any of it really happen to begin with? And what in the world is going on, anyway? Enjoy",1056240000,,911,4.449101796407185
1672110,5,B00005V3Z4,"""Donnie Darko"" is a dark and intrigueing film from first time writer/director Richard Kelly.  The film is about a troubled teenage boy, named Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal), that receives visits from a creature that looks like a giant rabbit.  This creature takes Donnie on sleepwalking experiences, and ends up making him do some things he most likely would not have done otherwise.  The creature also relays to Donnie that the world will end in 28 days or so. Donnie has a caring family, however they don't seem very protective at all.  The parents allow the children to curse without ever really getting mad at all.  Then one night, while Donnie is sleepwalking, a 747 jet engine falls through the roof of his bedroom.  The FBI investigates the incident, but finds no answer to where the engine came from.  Donnie also has a psychiatrist(Katherine Ross), who uses hypnosis on Donnie to understand his thoughts, and his actions.
The film then goes on an original, invilving path, that makes the viewer anxious to find out what will happen to it's characters.  Richard Kelly plays fair in allowing little clues here and the as to what will happen later in the film, though I highly doubt much of anyone will be able to figure out before hand what will happen.  Kelly shows talent here, and demonstrates that he can write one heck of a good screenplay.
The ending to ""Donnie Darko"" I will not say, but I would like to say that this is no where near a straight forward ending, and even repeated viewings may not solve the puzzle.
""Donnie Darko"" has a great young cast.  It features of course Jake Gyllenhaal, who shows some real talent here, and also shows that he is one of the stars of the future.  Also showing talent is Jake sister in real life, and in the film Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She has an odd, mysterious look to her, but shows she has an ability to act, and is leading lady material.  However, my favorite of the bunch is Jena Malone, who plays Donnie's girlfriend.  She has been in earlier films such as ""Stepmom"" and ""Cheaters"", but here she looks beautiful, and gives a beautiful performance.  ""Donnie Darko"" is a great film, and will have viewers talking, and watching again.",1056067200,,2186,4.68586387434555
1672111,5,B00005V3Z4,"to be honest, i first heard of this movie from a friend who had gone to see it. he completely hated it. i still don't know why.
donnie darko possibly is the most creative and original movie in existance. it is omitted from all genres and categories, through its severely warped and twisted storyline, mixed with it's intelligent depiction of issues. jake gyllenhaal plays donnie darko, a schizophrenic adolescant on the verge of insanity, due to his insane amount of questioning life. after being confronted by a huge bunny rabbit curiously named Frank, Donnie begins to hallucinate and drift between the realms of reality and.. well, fantasy. the most intriguing aspect of Donnie Darko is its enigmatic and ominous nature. Gone are the shallow teen flicks with bright colours and pretty faces - this movie is dark. very dark. after watching this movie, you will definitely say, ""ok, so what actually happened?"" this alien concept is fantastic - the audience is left confused, yet they are still entertained. the compelling storyline draws you to think for hours upon hours of what the movie was about. then you will watch it again. and again, and again. this movie sits you down, tells you to shut up and pay attention. the scary thing is, you do what you're told. another fantastic aspect is Kelly's portrayal of Donnie's environment. kelly successfully and effectively manages to convey modern-day life in america in the 80s, and in turn shows how Donnie's domestic situation helps to further create confusion for him. The movie follows donnie and how he deals with his new look on his life. Richard Kelly amazingly submerges the audience into a completely different world, and delves into the human psyche to convey how warped donnie really is. with credit to acting, gyllenhaal makes an undoubtedly memorable performance. it's also VERY chilling - you WILL shudder with disbelief and suspicion when Donnie asks Frank why he wears ""that stupid bunny suit"" only to receive the clear, but implicit statement - ""why do you wear that stupid human suit."" chilling indeed.
this movie WILL be remembered in years to come - mark these words. If Scarface can do it, Donnie Darko has all possibility. and after watching this movie - you will believe that anything is possible.",1055808000,2,2270,4.945026178010472
1672112,3,B00005V3Z4,"This movie is really tough to describe or classify to somebody who hasn't seen it. It's THAT original. I think of it as a deep movie for shallow people, a darkling ""Dead Poets Society"" run through with heaping doses of ""Rushmore""-ish satire and ""Catcher in the Rye"" bitterness and disillusionment. The title character is a deeply troubled suburban wonderboy going to a private school who is haunted by this spectral, demonic being in a bunny suit, who begins to become, as Vonnegut would say, ""unstuck in time"" (which I recall him saying was a metaphor for going insane). This seems definitely the case.
Stylistically, it is very interesting; the director has a great eye in places, putting together some enticing, effective scenes that are pretty to look at.
Thematically, though, it sort of implodes under the weight of its own pretensions. The beginning and the end loop together in a way that (in my opinion) ultimately blows down the house of cards set up in the first place. Donnie seems to dish things out without ever taking it, an adolescent fantasy if ever there was one. Without wanting to spoil it, a problem I had with the movie is that it seems to answer the teen angst retort of ""maybe everybody would be happier if I was DEAD!!"" That's as good a way of summing it up as any other.
The DVD is worthwhile, particularly because of the 20-some deleted/extended scenes one can watch with or without commentary. They offer additional perspective to the viewer that is absent in the movie. Is it worth your time? Sure, why not? Watch it. But it feels like more an exercise in style for its own sake than something offering any real substance.",1055289600,4,1651,4.696551724137931

I'm not sure it's quite as great as some of its biggest boosters claim it is, but it's definitely in the top 5% of the approximately 1,000 movies I've watched in my lifetime.
In an era of endless sequels and ""copycat"" movies, ""Donnie Darko"" is a true original: clever, thought-provoking, filled with surprises and delights and wry humor.  And while it is aimed primarily at younger viewers -- i.e. those under 25 or so -- it should be seen by anyone, of any age, who appreciates creative film-making.  Worth watching more than once -- and, as others have already said, you should definitely check out the website to get the most out of the movie.",1054512000,3,796,4.358108108108108

I went into this movie without any expectations.  I was told ""It's weird"" and even ""It's stupid"" but such 2 word reviews don't really tell me anything.
Anyway, here goes:
We start out with our anti-Hero, Donnie Darko, who is leading a bizarre night life. Every morning, he wakes up far away from his bed in his pajamas.  He also sees things.  Things like giant rabbits. Oh, and air planes fall on his house.  Also, time travel.
Yes. Weird.  Many little things set this apart from other movies. From it's wonderful characterization (Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance), to it's slow yet not-boring pace.  I left the theatre wondering what I just experienced. My mind attempted to make sense of everything, and I realized that is exactly the intention.
This movie wasn't pretentiously cerebral, dealing with esoteric concepts. This movie was about the struggle of an immensely intelligent kid who is more than a little crazy.  The philosophy comes in the form of his explorations and thought processes.  He sees the world so clearly, yet nobody else does.
A fascinating look at the mind of a dark young man.",1053993600,9,1221,4.893203883495145
1672115,3,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a troubled teenager living in 1988 suburbia.  Sure, there's lots of troubled teenagers in suburbia, so what's new?  Well, for one thing, Donnie keeps seeing manifestations of a guy named Frank dressed in a bunny suit telling him that the end is approaching.
No one really understands Donnie, so he rebels against just about everyone and everything except his therapist (Katherine Ross).  Extremely strange things begin to happen as Frank predicts Donnie's approaching rendezvous with destiny.
The film is unfortunately loaded with clichs:  the troubled teen, the idiot parents, the sympathetic science teacher, the class bullies, the new girl in town...it's everything we've seen before in dozens of other movies.  But `Donnie Darko' does have one thing going for it: it's as strange as a flock of flying pigs.  That weirdness almost makes the movie work, but the film ends leaving so many loose ends that are never tied up.  The extra features should have been a warning sign: when you've got 20 deleted and extended scenes, you've probably got a chopped up story.  Maybe the movie makes more sense with those scenes included, but after two hours, I didn't really want to spend any more time with Donnie Darko.",1053993600,3,1227,5.009852216748769

That is the feeling you are gonna get when you are done watching this terribly underrated movie. I am not someone who takes critics in total consideration but on the cover of the film one critic states ""IT'LL KNOCK YOU FLAT"" and that is exactly what happened to me and some of the people I have lent this film to. Now you are probably waiting for me to explain to you the story or anything else but it is too good. IT's a movie that is so weird but so captivating that it grabs you and shuts you up. You get lost and you just wonder what in God's name is goin on with Donnie and why are all these things happening to him. I have watched the film over 15 times now and I can honestly tell you I still do not have a definite answer for the reasons of Donnie's misfortunes. This movie also contains an all star cast but I don't think that will matter at all in the end because the story itself is one that you will have disect and look through backwards, upside down, and through many different opinions as possible. I will not be surprised if future film directors state that Donnie Darko was one of the reasons why they got into the film industry because movies that contains stories like these are only called one thing...ART!",1053388800,7,1375,4.172932330827067
1672117,4,B00005V3Z4,"This movie is a load of crap, but it's an entertaining and endearing load of crap - until the directors veer into the real story, of which we care not one whit about. The more I watch movies, the more I find that directors thinking that the story should lead when it shouldn't (and vice-versa), is a common fundamental fault.
It stars, obviously, Donnie Darko, a strange and smart disturbed young man who forgets to take his medication, with alarming results - an apparition makes him sleepwalk out of the house. That is fortunate, because an unexplained plane jet falls on the house, but being outside he is undamaged. Oh yeah, and the end of the world is near.
Donnie Darko is an interesting movie, in that it refuses obstinately to fit into the mold of ""disturbed teenager"" movies - it is almost cheerful and enthusiastic about finding comedy in the unlikeliest of places. Unfortunately, this energy is eventually set aside for plot and symbolism, which in the context does not make much sense, and we don't care.
At the end of his review, Roger Ebert comments :
""(...) somehow the control fades in the closing scenes, and our hands, which have been so full, close on emptiness. ''Donnie Darko'' is the one that got away. But it was fun trying to land it.""",1053216000,3,1259,4.625
1672118,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a rare mixture of suspense, comedy, horror, European cinema with a twist, and then some. Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal from Bubble Boy) is a bright student who's on therapy and visits his doctor who discovers Doonie's sleepwalking activities during a hypnosis session. He has a happy life and is not bitter about anything. One night hears the call of a 6-foot rabbit and goes on a sleepwalking stroll, while a jet engine falls through his room. The event changes his life, as the encounters with the strange rabbit are more frequent. The FAA doesn't know where the engine came from as no airline has reported one missing from their planes, and everything is a bit confusing for everyone. The movie has some interesting scenes like one where Patrick Swayze plays a local author and inspirational speaker who goes to Donnie's school to speak to the students, and Donnie asks him ""how much did they pay you to be here?"" followed by an awkward silence.
There are a few scenes where style takes over substance, one with what looks like a slow-mo steadycam continuous shot through halls and then out to the yard of the school to sound of Tears for Fears. Some say that mentally ill people tell it like it is because of their condition, but here we have a bright student-Donnie- who is a little, or a lot-depends how you see it- Schizophrenic and takes every chance to just blurt out his personal opinion-and one with which many of us agree- about the system.
Like the scene where his gym teacher asks him to read from a card with some sample life experience and draw an x between ""fear"" and ""love"" on the board to illustrate where his life's experiences fall with in the two. He tells the teacher ""it's not that simple...life's more complicated than that...one can't just categorize everything into two extremes..."" I won't tell you what Donnie told the teacher to do with her little cards but he ends up in the principal's office. Donnie sees some gel like extensions coming from their families bodies as if arrows that point towards the future, so he starts discussing time travel and wormholes with his science teacher, who stops taking about it when the ""G"" word enters their discussion: God. The teacher replies ""I can lose my job"". The movie is filled with these social observations. In school you can talk about the universe at length, but not about religion. The local celebrity (Sawyze), whom the gym teacher respects, is caught running a pornography ring from his basement. Drew Barry, the English teacher is let go because she doesn't fit in with the school's conservative values.
The movie keeps us interested, because there's a smooth flow of scenes, and it has scary moments, not based on violence and blood, but on suspense, mood, and wonder. Where did the rabbit come from, what's the meaning of the strange messages it tells Donnie?
Is it just an illusion? Then why did it save his life? Is Donnie a psychic? All these questions are answered but not like you'd expect. There are twists and turns like in any drunken pretzel. This is not your typical formula, and at the end we feel the movie works not because of it's ending, but because of the trip there.",1053043200,5,3187,4.692857142857143
1672119,5,B00005V3Z4,"The thunder rumbled away through the distant mountains, we left the young man lying in the middle of the road, and the first notes of Echo and the Bunnymen's ""Killing Moon"" rung out. I was spellbound for the next 113 minutes.
Set in the late 80's Donnie Darko is the story of a young man's alienation through mental illness and general teenage angst. Soon after a jet engine mysteriously crashes into Donnie's bedroom he starts receiving visits from a prophetic character in a strange rabbit costume named Frank. His subsequent interactions with Frank, teachers, friends, family, and his therapist weave a completely original and absorbing tale. Donnie's interest in time travel and anxiety about Frank's apocolyptic predictions move the story forward in a completely unpredictable way. There is a great deal of humour, especially with Donnie's disdain for the local self help guru.
The usual high school teen-drama characters present themselves but they are fleshed out with uncommon depth in this movie, Donnie's family are likeable and very functional, his teachers have lives outside school and his girlfriend has a multi-dimensional personality with troubles of her own.
A hypnotic and darkly beautiful original soundtrack is complemented by one of the best selections of eighties music I have heard in recent memory. Honestly the way this music is integrated with such meaning and purpose to the film's narative you'd think it was written for it. From ""Killing Moon"" in the opening scene, tracks from bands like Tears for Fears and Joy Division complement perfectly every time. In one scene where Donnie's halucinations get a little out of hand ""Under the Milky Way"" by Australian band the Church is used so well I got a rush of blood to the head, and the final scene uses a re-working of Tears for Fears ""Mad World"" to great tragic effect.
Some reviewers have been upset by what they see as a confusing ending, but I found the ending deeply moving and satisfying, as I did the movie as a whole.",1052697600,13,2001,4.958333333333333
1672120,5,B00005V3Z4,"I watched the VHS version, so I don't know if there are other clues in the DVD features that I missed, but the key to understanding this film lies in reading the ""Philosophy of Time Travel"" by Roberta Sparrow posted on the Donnie Darko website.  This fictional (i.e. made-up by the movies creators) book states the assumptions that the movie's plot works off of. Specifically, the details of the parallel universe, time travel and the role of people in the parallel universe are explained.  After watching the movie and going through the web site, I watched the movie again and everything made sense.  It went from being ""good but confusing"" to ""brilliant.""  What you come to realize is that everything in the movie, literally almost every conversation, is intimately but subtly linked to another and building to a final outcome.  If you walk away understanding the important role that Drew Barrymore has in the series of events (who at first watch seems insignificant) - which really is no more or no less important than any other character in the grand scheme of things - then it should all make sense.  All of the other themes such as teen alienation, pop culture, etc, provide commentary on the world while at the same time working to advance the plot.  An amazing movie.",1052697600,2,1275,4.7681818181818185
1672121,5,B00005V3Z4,"Being a huge fan of avante garde film and film noir, I really looked forward to seeing this movie. I was not disappointed, let me tell you! As everyone has said before me, it's a film that defies categorization or simple description. You'll find yourself thinking about this movie for at least a week after viewing it. It's about so many things - time travel, choices, the nature of the universe, reality . . . . it's just an amazing film.
The cast is superb, especially Jake Gyllenhall (sp?), who is now forever etched in my mind as Donnie Darko. He was so natural in this role, I completely forgot he was acting. He *was* Donnie Darko! Now I for sure can't see ""The Good Girl"" because I know I'll keep thinking, ""Why is Donnie Darko going out with Jennifer Aniston?"" (Plus I don't really like her anyway - but that's another story. ;-)
I thought Drew Barrymore did a great job as the teacher, and the initial classroom scene with her is really interesting - I wish I'd had teachers like her in high school! The reactions of all the characters were quite realistic too - there were no pat answers or ""movie magic wands"" to take away from the real, human drama taking place on the screen.
If you find this film confusing, WATCH IT AGAIN, THEN make up your mind whether you like it or not. Even if you love it the first time out (like I did), you will want to watch it again. Every time, you will see something you missed the last time. It's really an amazing film, and rates right next to ""Fight Club"" (specifically, Tyler's ""Middle children of history"" speech) for defining the angst and confusion of our generation.
One final note: You MUST rent the DVD, NOT the VHS. I'm not sure if it's true for all copies, but the VHS I rented was missing a pivotal scene (!) near the end. I would never have known except I was watching the VHS with a friend who'd seen it on DVD and she mentioned it. And believe me, the scene is essential to fully understanding the ending.

This movie is a masterpiece, and unlike just about EVERYTHING that comes out in the theaters these days, this kind of movie has never been done before.  Your common everyday meat head movie-goer isn't going to like it because its meaning is not instantly accessible.  Oh no!!  You actually have to THINK about this movie for awhile after you watch it to try to form an opinion on it!  Movies like this don't always go over well because the mass pop culture can be very stupid.  But believe me, to write this movie off because it is ""confusing"" is ignorant and closed minded.  Well, enough ... bashing.  What about the movie itself.
Casting was perfect.  Nothing but good performances.  The style in which this movie was filmed is just beyond description.  The more you watch the movie, and the more your mind lets you see things come together, the more amazing the filming becomes.  I can't say too much because I'll give things away.  (Yes, there actually is a plot and a meaning.  Just don't expect Vin ... Diesel to come on screen and tell you exactly what it is.)  And the icing on the cake is the music.  This movie was made to look and sound like it takes place in the 80's, but the whole eighties feel is very subtle.  Almost as if they went to the trouble of doing things to let you know it takes place in the late eighties, even though it doesn't really matter too much.
Anyway, I could go on and on.  See this movie.  It's one of a kind.  I actually suggest buying the DVD instead of renting it, because you will most likely need to see it more than once.

As a DVD I think it is great also.  They offer the video to Gary Jule's remake of Tears for Fears ""Mad and World""  and not only is it a great remake but a great video.  The deleted scenes are very good also, though I would watch it with the commentary first then without it because when the commentary is on you can't really hear the dialogue.  It also gives you a list of the actors and crews past works and gives you some ideas of other movies to see.  On the back of the DVD it compares the movie to Stir of Echoes and Final Destination.  It really isn't like either of those movies except for a topic or two related to Donnie Darko.  Even if you don't buy it, at least go out and rent it.",1052006400,2,1055,3.9061032863849765
1672128,4,B00005V3Z4,"It would be very hard for a person to walk away from Donnie Darko thinking that there was not at least some interest in the film. It is relevant to school life and throws in the typical issues such as censorship, the American obsession with self help philosophy and dealing with mental illness in the family. However these subplots alone do not sum up the meaning behind Donnie Darko. The film is haunting and keeps you feeling like there is something deeper to peer upon hidden in the plot. Even without understanding the movie you must at least walk away feeling something about the movie.
Donnie Darko is a confusing movie. After watching it for the first time I found that there was not one point in the movie that made it all fall in to place. Like other contemporary films eg. David Lynch films such as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive it leaves you feeling extremely frustrated. It makes you feel like you have missed the point and that there was an immense philosophical truth running through the movie that is only reserved for geniuses such as Stephen Hawking.
After reading different theories on the net about the meaning behind the film one is left to conclude this is yet another film that forces you to make your own conclusions about the meaning. This seems to be becoming an increasingly popular trend among modern films. I rated it 4 because I for one am becoming more and more frustrated with films whose directors feel they have the right to tease the audience (possibly because of free publicity generated by internet users posting theories about the meanings of movies). I'm not a genius and I hate the feeling that I have missed something when I watch a film, even if I watch it over and over again. Besides this I think it is a copout. A director should be able to imply enough meaning for a movie to make sense. Furthermore it can be done without spelling everything out and and it can be done without making everything obvious upon the first viewing.
Apparently the DVD extra features do provide more information about the storyline but still don't explicitly give away the meaning of the film.
I think the director was dealing with cliche philosophical problems such as time travel in new exciting ways which would make it a perfect film if it weren't for the frustrating lack of resolution one gets at the end of the film.",1051747200,15,2350,4.624401913875598

Everyone in the cast is perfect in their roles, and the music score is awesome too. The director was very detailed in his creation of the atmosphere and the world in which the characters live. His usage of certain eighties songs was also a huge plus. I love that this film takes place during the eighties. I thought that was pretty cool! Heres the storyline, that I'm sure you already know, but here it goes:
Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a teen suffering from schizophrenia. He sleepwalks, hallucinates, and has a very short temper. He is also seeing a psychiatrist, which he visits during the week to give her updates about how his life has been going, and the things that he has been seeing. His family is very supportive, although he and his sisters tend to fight quite often, but his parents try to communicate with him whenever they can and show him love. His home life isn't that bad, although sometimes, he feels totally alone in the world. Then one night, his life totally changes. He hears a voice calling for him, telling him to wake up. He gets out of bed, and walks towards the door as the voice continues to beckon him. He walks outside to see a man-sized, demonic looking rabbit standing out in the yard. The rabbit tells him that the world is going to end in twenty-eight days, six hours, fourty-two minutes, and twelve seconds. Then, out of nowhere, a plane engine falls out of the sky, and lands right on top of Donnie's house, right where his room would have been, and crashes right through it. No one knows how it got there. All they know is that had Donnie been in his room, he would have died. All of this is very strange, and from there on, the rabbit keeps coming back to Donnie. He shows him visions, makes him do things, and continuously warns him about the future and time travel. You may think I'm giving away too much, but really, I'm not. This is ONLY the beginning. There is so much to this film. It is simply amazing. You have to see it. Then you have to see it again, and again, and again. The ending is a big surprise. Everything in this film ties together perfectly.
A friend got me the DVD for Christmas last year, and it is excellent. It has so many awesome special features. Listen to the actor/director commentary. It explains things, and helps to tie up loose ends. Actually, there are no loose ends in this film. Everything is there for a specific purpose. This movie is so deep.

The story, in a nutshell, is about a troubled teen (Donnie) who has visions of a rabbit who tells him the world will end.
The film, written and directed by Richard Kelly, captures the high school angst that I remember so well.  Kelly is young, and some of the film's themes are executed a bit heavy-handedly, but  the heart of the film is constant.  The time travel aspect of Kelly's script was a bit confusing -- I admit, though, that DONNIE DARKO probably requires a few viewings as there are themes and story points that make more sense after repeated viewings.
DARKO's cast is really incredible.  What a potpourri of talent!  Mary McDonnell is soooooo good. Katharine Ross (THE GRADUATE, BUTCH CASSIDY) is a welcomed presence as Donnie's therapist.  Patrick Swayze (!) is great as a guru with a secret.  Drew Barrymore (who produced DARKO) stretches herself as a liberal teacher at Donnie's school. Of course, Jake Gyllenhaal, as Donnie, is really wonderful.  He's tortured and sensitive.

After a few months, I visited a friend I haven't seen a long time and he says: ""I have something to show you..."" He plugs in his PC and shows me the beginning of  Donnie Darko. I was struck in awe after an introductory bicycle scene and the decision was made. I made him stop the movie so I can enjoy it with the real 5.1 sound and picture. I ordered it at the amazon the very same day.
Upon writing this review, I thought to myself: ""Rather than telling you what the movie really is about, I'll tell the story of how I came to become a very satisfied owner of it."" So, I did that and hope to induce enough intrigue for someone to buy or not to buy the movie. But, in my humble opinion, everyone who considers himself or herself  movie-buff must have this film.
I almost forgot! The DVD is loaded with excellent extras, including a whopping 20 deleted or extended scenes with or without commentary, but believe me - after seeing the movie you won't be able to go through that unless your heart is made of stone or you're a Vulcan... Or simply if you're stupid and say: ""I don't get it."" But then, why bother with this? Go buy ""The Fast and The Furious"" instead and knock yourself out...",1050537600,2,1744,4.281818181818182

1672137,4,B00005V3Z4,"First , I LOVE bizzare films (see Welcome to WoopWoop, Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead).
Second, I couldn't believe the same Drew Barrymore who flashed her hotchamatata's to David Letterman would have the brilliance to produce this film!
This movie draws you in from scene one. You have no idea whether the `hero' is psycotic when he sees Frank The Giant Rabbit, or sees things we just don't. And Patrick Swayze as the charismatic Love/Hate guru was a stroke of genius. You hate him and his bible thumping followers...and then you find out his secret truth.
From the moment we know Donnie is `different', to the moment the jet engine crashes through his bedroom, to the final moment when HE discovers reality, WE don't know the reality.
Donnie sees things no one else can, and they have to do with time travel and different possibilites of the future. Personally, I loved the aged alzheimers woman who goes to her mailbox, sees nothing there, walks away, and turns in the middle of the dirt road, to see if something may have been placed in her mailbox while her back was turned (she is the secret to the film...). My only tsk tsk is they could have done more with her...
This is a film of teen angst, the futility of correcting a wrong space/time has decreed, and an EXCELLENT sci-fi-eerie-romance. Some high profile actors (Noah Wylie for one) took on this movie in minor roles( I LOVE that cameo mystique...). Dark irony rules here.
I'll tell you how good this film was....I watched this instead of CSI. I bought this DVD. My friends who saw it were awed and bought it. Do NOT miss it.",1050278400,2,1596,4.564459930313589

1672140,3,B00005V3Z4,"This is one of those few cases when I think the vast majority of reviews thus far are mistaken. I don't think this movie is nearly as good as these ""ravers"" say it is.
For starters, when you're watching a movie and you're continuously aware that your listening to a script, something's not right. The dialogue is mediocre at best, unfortunately preventing any characters from establish themselves as believable. Also, this ""political commentary"" that supposedly makes this an intelligent film consists only of fleeting references to 80's politics and culture. These additions do not culminate in a deep, philosophical statement, as one expects of films which utilize this element, and they certainly don't add to the plot.
Fortunately this movie is not entirely a lost cause. Several things make it just slightly more than bearable. First, the soundtrack is interesting. I like most of the 80's tunes throughout the film, and the ambient dronings contribute to the varying, though predominantly dark, atmosphere of the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal makes Donnie one of the few (almost) believable characters in the movie. Its a shame he didn't have a better script to further develop his character. Also, the concept of the plot is actually quite good. I can see how one could develop a very good story around it. Lastly, the scant attempts at humor are generally successful, and make the film roll by a bit faster.
Unfortunately, the movie's shortcomings ultimately lead to its failure as a legitimate competitor among other recent releases. The ideas are too scattered and unorganized, the script is terrible, and the characters are cartoonish. It's obvious this is a debut film. Nevertheless, it is worth seeing Donnie Darko for its thought-provoking plot ideas and entertainment value.",1050192000,23,1782,5.16955017301038
1672141,4,B00005V3Z4,"You have to love these reality/fantasy juxtapositions and this one works very well as time becomes the element which defines what you see while you eventually determine just what you did see. Jena Malone is an ideal love interest for this seemingly forsaken though somehow deeper than average character as he ambles through a series of experiences with a quietude that suggests something within him which is unusual at the very least. The roles are played well, the imagery is aesthetically stimulating and this too is a film for the ages.",1049846400,,539,4.934065934065934
1672142,5,B00005V3Z4,"Somehow I missed DD in the theaters. Maybe it was the way the film was promoted. Maybe I was out of the country.
This film has some incredible acting and superb writing. I am transfixed by the performances, particularly J. Gyllenhaal's. As one of the actors says on the commentary, it would have been an entirely different film with a different lead.
The inclusion of cut scenes on this DVD is a WONDERFUL asset that gives a lot of insight into what was going on, along with the director's commentary. J. Gyllenhaal also speaks on that commentary but is a little irritating at times, interrupting the director when I want to hear what he has to say.
This is essentially a scifi movie with insightful protrayal of our society. Highly recommended.",1049846400,,745,4.694656488549619
1672143,5,B00005V3Z4,"This is not a review of the movie, but rather of the DVD.  If you are getting this DVD because you think you might enjoy the movie you will, and if you saw the movie but aren't sure about spending some money on the DVD, well, you should.  If you liked the movie, you'll definitely want to get this DVD and the extras that it offers.  Basically, if you took the time to look into this DVD and read this review I think are someone who should buy the DVD.  However, the extras aren't all they are cracked up to be as is often the case in DVDs and I want everyone out there to know what to expect.
There are 20 deleted or extended included in this DVD, but each on has to be played separately (no 'Play All' feature) and you must select commentary on/off for each one of them.  This is not the best arrangement for a deleted/extended scenes section.  The actual content of this section is pretty decent with most of the scenes having the possibility of really having added something to the story and most could've made the film had the director not had to cut the film down to 2 hours from the original rough cut of about 2 and half hours it originally had.
There are two commentaries on the DVD, one with the Richard Kelly (writer/director) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) and another with Richard Kelly, two producers (Nancy Juvonen and Sean McKittrick) and several cast members: Holmes Osborne (Eddie, Donnie's Dad), Mary McDonnell (Rose, Donnie's Mom), Jimmy Duval (Frank), Beth Grant (Kitty Farmer, Donnie's Health Teacher), Drew Barrymore (Karen Pomeroy, Donnie's English Teacher), Katharine Ross (Dr. Thurman, Donnie's Therapist), and Jena Malone (Gretchen, Donnie's Girlfriend). First, the sound quality of the commentaries is below what one has to come to expect on commentaries.  You can hear the commentary track fine, but the track of the movie itself is all but silent during the time in which the cast or crew is speaking, almost shut off which is a turn to many people (but you can put on closed caption, although that can often distract you from the commentary if you are reading it), and it is back to full regular volume when their is no active commentary. My only complaint on the second commentary is that Drew Barrymore often `hogs' the commentary and was way to close to the microphone (which only accented her shrill voice on this commentary) during the recording of the commentary, she tried to hard to be `deep' in her comments way too often and it gets annoying at times.  Many of the tidbits and insights provided in both tracks are interesting and above par with many other movie commentaries, but by no means exceptional.  It is fun listening to what Kelly and the others have to say and then watching the movie looking for these things on your own, but don't only watch the film looking for hints that the director left for the audience and nothing else; this takes away too much from the film, so don't do that.
The theatrical trailer is above average and can be appreciated by both those that have already seen the film and those than haven't.  The several TV spots, all 30 seconds or less, are largely repetitious.
The cast & crew information section is above average listing all of the actors' other films through late 2002 (most DVDs list only some films and are not current beyond the movie on the DVD).  There is a total of nine crew bios (as opposed to a simple list of past work) including Richard Kelly, Sean McKittrick, Nancy Juvonen, Steve Poster (director of photography), Alexander Hammond (production designer), April Ferry (costume designer), Eric Strand (editor), Sam Bauer (editor), and Michael Andrews (composer).
The `Mad World' music video is OUTSTANDING, and I have seen it many, many times already.  It is quite addicting, and even if I close my eyes and just listen to it, it is still great.
The `Website Gallery' is very hard to see and is not anything special and does not add anything to the DVD.  What is shown is really a sampling of what the website has to offer, which is somewhat hard to navigate but during the cast and crew commentary they give you the three passwords for levels one, two and three if you listen closely.
The `Soundtrack' feature provides interesting linear notes, but is not an isolated soundtrack of the movie (which is really the score of the movie with the lone exception the `Mad World' Tears for Fears songs covered so eerily by Gary Jules for the movie).
The `Cunning Visions' section features the infomercials from in the movie with optional directors commentary).  There is also a `His Name is Frank' section that is a fun little feature of several place cards that are designed like those featured in the Cunning Visions `exercise' in Donnie's health class and shown during Jim Cunningham's assembly.  You can also look at the book covers used for Jim Cunningham's two books feature as background material during his assembly at the school.
`The Philosophy of Time Travel' book feature is disappointing showing only several pages (including the appendices featured in the film) and all the pages are hard to see.
The `Art Gallery section' is neat with a bunch of artwork that inspired works in the film and some of which was used directly in the film.  The production stills are plentiful and interesting.
The `Scene Selection' feature is as good as any other DVD with moving images as opposed to stills to mark each chapter, and there are a total of 28; good for a 2 hour movie.
Overall, I enjoyed this DVD especially the `Mad World' music video and the two commentaries as I personally enjoy the opportunity to see the entire movie a different way when I can and the commentary tracks give me this opportunity.",1049587200,19,5696,4.681

The characters and the actors who play them are wonderful.

Even mainstream audiences (i.e., my friends) have liked this (to their own amazement).
Unique, one-of-a-kind film will stay with you for days, as the questions it raises are plenty food for thought.  I didn't really get the ending explanation, but that just gives me a chance to go back and see it again (kinda the way Sixth Sense is different after the first viewing, when you know what's going on).  I found the audio commentary by the producer and main actor to be helpful toward the end...They do offer some explanations about some things you might not have picked up on that are significant.  After I watched this the first time, I went back over the last 15 minutes with the audio commentary on and was surprised to see how detailed the storyline was.  This also helped me to understand the ending better, but I'm still a tad confused, but in a good way (i.e., David Lynch movies).",1049241600,2,1142,4.737373737373737

EVERYTHING about this movie was pointless....the story, the writing, and the characters were all so 2 dimensional it was beyond a joke....
the guy who wrote this film must have seen either Jacobs ladder or 6th sense and thought ' hey , i can do this'.....
this film was just annoying, it went from scene to scene pointlessly, almost randomly.....as soon as i saw the beginning i knew it would be a 'twist in the end' type story.....
Jacobs Ladder is a masterpiece of cinema, and so is the 6th sense....
this on the other hand, is like giving a camera and a pen to a bunch of film students and asking them to create a clone of the films i mentioned.
its like creating art without the 'artist'.....

i have seen some poor movies in my time, but what amazes me the most here is the sheer contrast of the 'excellent reviews' and whats actually on offer..
did these people actually watch it ?
you know a film is poor when the makers just overlap dull scenes with almost full length pop songs !

1672152,5,B00005V3Z4,"As far as titles go Donnie Darko"" is about as unassuming as they get. Go figure then that the movie is one of the more original, thought provoking contributions to cinema in recent memory.
What makes this film so engrossing is the effective balance that is achieved between the more technical aspects of the film and the story itself. This balance cannot be overlooked as there have been innumerable movies over the years with interesting ideas but poor execution, as well as the inverse. The Thirteenth Floor and Cameron Crowe's Ope... Vanilla Sky come to mind.
Technically, this movie is wonderful. The lighting, the camera work, the pacing, etc all fit the movie perfectly. Also, the use of music is done quite well as it adds to the mood of the picture and does not distract. The script is also a triumph, which is noteworthy given that the film does tend to ebb and flow, 'changing' from 80's teen flick, to horror, to dark comedy, and back again. The casting is spot on as well. Patrick Swayze finally has a career-defining role and Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect in the title role.
And then there's the story. At first glance, the plot could come off as a jumble of ideas tossed together, I suppose. But, the way the pieces fit together (and they really do) and the shear originality of it all make it work. Amazingly, ""Donnie Darko"" is one of the few modern movies that cannot be directly compared to something else, which is noteworthy in this era of big budget remakes and explosionfests that are supposed to pass as legitimate cinema. Sure, certain aspects of the movie may seem familiar, but whole of the movie is original.
If you like movies that require thought, attention, at least a second viewing, and an open mind, ""Donnie Darko"" would get my highest recommendation. And even if you prefer movies that require less work, ignore this and go rent Con Air (again).",1048723200,45,1875,4.684848484848485
1672153,5,B00005V3Z4,"As I scour the endless number of reviews for this movie, most of them strike chords within me, the same chords that were ringing in my head as ""Mad World"" ended and Jena Malone waves at Mrs. Darko with that faint sense of recognition on her face.  This recognition was a bond born of a sacrifice by a man they barely knew; a sacrifice that saved them from certain death.
  This movie is quite simply man given a chance by God (Frank) to not only see that he in fact will not die alone and many people loved him for who he was but how one man's actions affect the whole world around him; he gives Donnie the opportunity to give back to those he ends up loving so dearly at the end.
  I believe Richard Adams didn't know the effects of this final product.  His ideas about time travel, Manipulated Living, etc. are wonderful but I believe such higher ideals are being explored here.  Fate vs choice, agnosticism vs faith, isolation vs community  This film is bathed in all of these elements.  Just like any Cameron Crowe movie, this one has no genre, no pigeonhole that so many of these reviewers need to satiate their desire for mediocrity in film.  These one star reviews are humorous at best, embarassing at worst.  Just admit you had no idea of the depth this movie was trying to open your eyes to.  I say watch it again  and then again  then again.  Try to remember the despair and angst your teenage years cast upon your soul.  This movie is not for the weak-minded, small-minded, or close minded.  But, if you are truly interested in watching one mans struggle with his own humanity as well as his foreknowledge of the future(think Kazantzakis'Last Temptation of Christ), as well as his struggle to eliminate isolation through a discovery of God, Donnie Darko is for you.

Donnie Darko did not keep my interest, however I did reluctantly watch the entire movie- only out of curiousity to see how much more stupid the movie could get.

Strangely, when it was all over I was markedly undecided about it, but she, who prefers historical realism like ""Gangs of New York""-type films, loved it.  We both compared it throughout to ""Heathers"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" in its surrealistic portrayal of high school life.  I watched it again with the first commentary track with the director and Jake Gyllenhaal, and all was made clear.  A lot of our assumptions turned out to be incorrect (which is also true of some other reviews on this board) but I love movies that can be interpreted in different ways and require multiple viewings to see all the clues and story nuances.  After listening to the commentary, now I can't get the movie out of my head and I talk about it all the time.
I agree with others that for a small budget, this film is shot beautifully.  The acting is superb, of course, with Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze (who all worked for pocket change, another testament to a great script), and especially newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal. The music is great too, adding great power to some scenes similar to the soundtrack in ""Rushmore"".  The extras on the DVD are pretty good, for such a small budget.  There are a huge number of (mostly forgettable with a few exceptions) deleted scenes, but the funniest bonus is the ""Cunning Visions"" infomercial with commentary.

If your idea of a good movie is something you can sit back and enjoy with a tub of popcorn, then Donnie Darko isn't for you. There is also little (really no) action in Donnie Darko. No car chases, fistfights, or major explosions. If you want a lighthearted comedy, action flick, or sappy drama, this movie will bore you to death.
But if you're in the mood to pay close attention and think about everything you're being shown, this is a great movie. Almost all of my friends who saw this immeadiately said ""I need to see this movie again"" because you really can't get it all on the first try.
The commentary on the DVD was interesting, but didn't really do much for me in terms of enhancing the storyline.",1047254400,3,1043,4.381443298969073
1672163,5,B00005V3Z4,"The movie's images have long stayed in my mind ever since viewing it over a week ago and I can feel as if it happened in real time. The whole movie was a non-stop ride wishing it to never end, the movements the words, the music everything was beautifully pieced together to create a beautiful film. Jake Gyllenhal is incredible as Donnie, it makes one believe as if his character is so real, as if he actually existed in our world and so watching it to the very end it really made me feel this love for him that I didn't want him to go as he did towards the end...you need to see this film to better get an idea as to why I am saying this. Even after the movie was over it made me question my own existence and where in time and space I stand in, much less this movie can lead everyone who sees it to question the whole point of destiny and existence in the universe we live in. I don't want to go and talk much about how I feel about this movie because its over the five star rating and I have to give it 10 stars, for the quality and the originality this movie has done that it deservers the justice of two great movies. The movie has so many wonderful moments that its hard to pick just one, but if I had to its got to be the last frame of Donnie and his facial expression that god if you really pay attention throughout the movie you finally put the last piece of the puzzle together and you understand that moment and why its the connector of the film from start to finish. I admit I see that scene and feel that there could be a final justice to this life on earth and maybe there could be something greater in the end. The 80s music is beyond any affection its like an addiction that you want to long for that simple time where music was so fun and original. Every frame of the movie is a masterpiece, a dark masterpiece, I recommend this movie be viewed by every physics class either high school or university it does not matter, this movie is beyond anything ever imaginable.",1046995200,3,1984,4.129198966408269
1672164,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a very difficult movie to characterise and assign to one or even two genres, which is also part of its appeal and fascination. It opens with the title character (Jake Gyllenhall) waking in his pyjamas, with his bike lying next to him, on a highway overlooking his hometown of Middlesex, set in an idyllic tree covered valley. Straightening up he looks out toward the rising sun on the horizon and with a knowing smile he re-mounts his bicycle and makes his way back home to the tune of Echo and The Bunnymens The Killing Moon in what is an excellent opening sequence. Right from these first few frames it was obvious that I was about to witness something very original and it had me hooked.
Donnie Darko is inspired (I would guess) by the weird combination of Philip K Dick, Wes Anderson, JD Salinger and the classic James Stewart movie Harvey. It announces the arrival of two great new talents in Writer/Director Richard Kelly and the young actor Jake Gyllenhall, in what is a hugely original, ingenious and entertaining movie. Set in 1988, around Halloween time, this movie has the conventional leafy-suburbia-plus-high-school setting, which alludes to the horror genre of Carrie and Halloween but it is no horror movie.  It also has specific elements that suggest that its a psychodrama about a young man with schizophrenia but this is not A Beautiful Mind. It also ponders the possibility of time travel but this is not science fiction. Stranger still, Donnie Darko is unusual in that (unlike most retro 1980s pictures such as The Wedding Singer) it actually has a very cool soundtrack drawn from the period of my youth, which includes contributions from the likes of Echo and The Bunnymen, Tears For Fears and Joy Division.
So, what is Donnie Darko about?  Well, without giving up too much of the plot, Donnie is continuously visited by a 6 foot tall rabbit named Frank, which unlike the Pooka in the classic Harvey is both visible to the audience and strangely satanic. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days six hours and forty two minutes but not to worry as everything is going to be all right. Guided by Frank he narrowly misses being killed when an engine from a 747 crashes through his house whilst he is lying sleeping on a local golf course and the plot thickens when it becomes apparent that the aviation authority has no record of any aircraft losing an engine. Donnie is of course undergoing therapy with a local shrink and hypnotherapist played by Katherine Ross (The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid) and the suggestion is of course that Donnie is hallucinating, for as his sister says he hasn't been taking his pills. One of Donnies recurring visions suggests that he can see the future before it happens and so he becomes obsessed with the possibility of time travel and a book written by a retired teacher, who is now a scary old recluse, The Philosophy of Time Travel. There are also many other sub-plots including Donnie being inspired by his English teacher (Drew Barrymore) and Graham Greenes short story The Destructors into some playful vandalism. In addition to this Donnies subversive thoughts and actions begin to undermine the stability of the local community that is strangely gripped by a slimy fundamentalist guru played by Patrick Swayze.
Much of this movie is darkly comic and there are some great scenes including a conversation between Donnie and his therapist, where she asks him what he thinks about at school. Like most teenage boys he inevitably replies having s*x before proceeding to unbutton his trousers about to m*sturbate. There is also a scene where at a PTA meeting Donnies mother challenges the local bigot by asking ""Do you even know who Graham Greene is?"" she confidently and proudly replies ""Oh please! I think we've all seen Bonanza"".
Personally I loved this movie but whether or not you enjoy this movie probably depends upon how far left of centre you like your movies. If you are not a fan of independent cinema or movies by the likes of Wes Anderson and David Lynch then you probably won't like this. However there is much to recommend in Donnie Darko, not least the cast, which includes, Noah Wyle (ER), Mary McDonnell (Dances With Wolves), Maggie Gyllenhaal (Confessions of A Dangerous Mind) and the previously mentioned Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Katherine Ross. Jake Gyllenhaals exquisite comic timing and laidback personality endows Donnie's existence with a dreamlike quality at odds with his teen angst and the suburban paranoia of his surroundings. Meanwhile writer/director Richard Kelly creates a wonderful sense of tension and keeps you guessing throughout the movie that even after the final titles have rolled you are still left to mull over what you have just witnessed.
Whilst critics may argue that Donnie Darko fails as a psychological study and/or horror movie, you cant help but feel they are missing the point, as it deliberately avoids easy classification to a specific genre and instead concentrates on being intelligent, ingenious and highly original.  Closing appropriately to a cover version of the old Tears For Fears song Mad World and the lyrics the dreams on which Im dying are the best Ive ever had, neatly ties up the previous two hours and what was for me a very satisfactory cinematic experience. Destined for cult status this undoubtedly deserves five stars!",1046649600,27,5410,4.891067538126362
1672165,3,B00005V3Z4,"""Donnie Darko"" is an indie movie, meaning that it's geared towards an audience that doesn't like to sit in front of their televisions like unmotivated stumps. Throughout the entire film Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a dangerously schizophrenic high school student who lives in a California suburb, finds himself losing his mind after his adventures guide him to places he doesn't understand but gains some pleasure in nonetheless. Through and through Donnie finds the world to be an  unforgiving mess that, through a series of lucky manouvers, has not rotated off of its axis. That is, until Donnie discovers how he can change the world.
Unfortunately, Donnie isn't the only one confused. The manner in which the [highly talented] cast were callously sprinkled throughout the film, the incessant thematic flip-flopping, and the erratic film style makes it look like the crew was trying too many things at once. It's understandable that films do [and should] pack in numerous ideas and themes--take Darren Aronofsky for instance--but these ideas and themes are also to have coherent direction. ""Donnie Darko"" seems to have that direction, but when you're travelling down the road a theme or idea abruptly stops so that another one may begin. The result is that the film is complete but not fulfilling.
Another problem is the fishy issue of time travel that the filmmakers didn't truly develop. Besides a brief and rather conjectural conversation Donnie has with his Physics teacher (played by Noah Wylie), I wasn't convinced that time travel really was a good idea for the film to run with. Unfortunately there are multiple ""conversation bursts"" as opposed to easy-flowing dialogue throughout the entire movie so hardly anything anyone says is very palpable. All of this serves as a glaring detriment to what could have been one of the more inspired movies of 2001.
But this isn't to disparage one from watching the film. I very much appreciated [what i could understand] the frame of the movie, which I would make into a question as opposed to a statement of somesort. ""Donnie Darko"" is, as a forewarning, *very* indecisive but still an enjoyable experience.",1046476800,6,2160,5.101694915254237

1672169,3,B00005V3Z4,"The air of creepy dread in ""Donnie Darko"" is pitched just right.  The movie plays with the conventions of teen comedy and teen horror movie without falling into the traps of either.  Jake Gyllenhaal generates real sympathy for a character that could have easily been just another Holden Caufield variant.  The tricky plot keeps you guessing.  The movie is also the first period piece whose period is the late 1980's, which has got to count for something.  ""Donnie Darko"" is totally worth watching once.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of watching it twice within the space of a few days, and the second viewing diminished the charm of the first.  Suddenly the teen angst was too heavy, and the loose ends I had found teasingly enigmatic seemed merely sloppy.  Then I made the even worse mistake of watching a few scenes with the commentary turned on.  Director Richard Kelly is a young guy with a dopey voice who clearly identifies with the put upon Donnie.  The gap between what he thought he was doing and what actually came across killed whatever mystery was left.
""Donnie Darko"" is Richard Kelly's first movie, and I'm eager to see what he does next.  He's got more visual panache and interesting ideas than most people out there.  If ""Donnie Darko"" doesn't hold together, it's mostly because he tried to put too much of a good thing into one package.  You can still get your money's worth out of this movie, but you have to know what to do with it: watch it once, and take it back to the video store.",1045872000,2,1507,4.599250936329588

I wish they had made an extended version DVD  with the extra scenes in it.  What I find the best in this movie is the ending.  It isn't hollywood but its not right out of left field either.  One of the smartest endings I've ever seen.  The whole movie is excellent and suggest that everyone gives it a go.

1672173,5,B00005V3Z4,"First of all, Jake Gyllenhaal is an outstanding actor, and I believe this was the first film I ever saw him in. I was totally entranced with the film even before the opening credits finished popping up on the screen. Jake plays Donnie Darko, a young man with a sleeping disorder that has him waking up in strange places (far away from his house, even). Usually, he is drawn out of the house at night by a gigantic bunny - actually, a guy in a bunny costume. Yes, it's really weird. But one night, the vision of the bunny man saves his life, as he is lured out of his bedroom not too long before a big piece of a plane comes crashing down on his bed - where he would have been at the time, if it weren't for his darn strange sleeping habits. This scene sets the stage for what is, I think, one of the strangest movies ever - and the most original.
The film also stars Jake's real-life sister Maggie, as Donnie's sister. Patrick Swayze turns in a humorous performance as one of those annoying motivational speakers. Drew Barrymore plays one of his teachers, and Jena Malone is good as Donnie's love interest. And while all of their performances are good, none of them are as good as Jake Gyllenhaal, who gives a haunting, mesmerizing performance that will stick in your mind. If you're going to watch this movie, I suggest doing it on DVD, because I found the audio commentary to be extremely helpful. The reason for this is that there is a lot in this movie I don't really get (the ending, if you ask me, is a weird one, and would love it if someone could please tell me their take on it), and especially the actor commentary was helpful; little things are actually pointed out that could be crucial to understanding the film, or at least it is cool to see how everything sort of all comes together in the end.
I don't think this film is for everyone, and a lot of people are going to probably start watching and decide it's too eccentric for them, and not even finish it. But I urge anyone to at least give it a chance, even if it is just for Jake's performance. I can't guarantee you won't be disappointed, but I can guarantee the film will stay with you for a while.",1045440000,4,2168,4.30317848410758
1672174,5,B00005V3Z4,"I missed this film in its theatrical release (apparently it received limited distribution), but since it requires at least two viewings, it's well-suited for DVD.  It's difficult to describe the story or even characterize it by genre, which shows how original the film is.  Simply put, it's about time travel, but it's about a lot more than that, too.
The acting is consistently outstanding, with a list of well-known names in the cast, along with less familiar ones.  Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance that is so convincing, you forget that he is acting;  he IS Donnie Darko. While the story is mainly told through his eyes, the other characters are surprisingly sympathetic as well.  This is not an easy feat for a script to accomplish, especially when the viewer must focus so much attention on every event. It would have been easy to create a one-dimensional hero and a bunch of villains, but writer/director Richard Kelly doesn't take the easy way out.
Instead, we get a highly intelligent and challenging film that engages us as much as it baffles us, that injects enough humor to keep us from stress-overload, and most importantly, makes us want to watch it again and again, even after we know what's going on.  In this sense, ""Donnie Darko"" succeeds where other films have fallen short:  for example, I enjoyed the complexities of ""Memento"", but I was not able to identify or even care very much about any of the characters.  The same was true of ""The Usual Suspects"".  Both are excellent films, but I viewed both from a distance, more analytically than emotionally.
I did not view ""Donnie Darko"" from a distance.  I was drawn into the world that it creates, and enjoyed it enough to return more than once.  A brilliant first film from Richard Kelly, who has set a very high standard for himself.
The DVD does full justice to this fine movie.  The video and audio are excellent, and the extra features are quite thorough.  I particularly enjoyed the commentary by Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, which I listened to the second time I watched the film.  They do a great job of helping the viewer to connect the dots.  They also include just enough of the usual ""behind the scenes"" banter to keep the commentary from becoming too academic.
This DVD would definitely be included in any ""desert island"" list that I would ever compile. Strongly recommended!",1045440000,351,2374,4.798525798525799

I didn't know why this movie was always out whenever I came by, but my curiosity began to swell with every week that passed.  Finally one day, it was in, and I rented it.  I wasn't expecting much, since I had heard nothing about it, so I sat down and prepared myself for a visit to the land of mediocre.
I've never been so wrong.
This movie sucked me in from the very first frame...  The caliber of acting, script, direction, soundtrack, editing, casting, wardrobe... Everything!  The storyline is killer! I just love when you expect nothing and get it all!  This movie is my personal pick for best all around rental of last year.
As soon as I finished viewing the movie, I went to the bathroom, went to the kitchen and made a snack, put on my night clothes, and watched it AGAIN!  Donnie Darko is the kind of movie that you can realize something new every time you see it.  It truly is a BRILLIANT piece of cinema. I of course bought the DVD the very next day (thank you Amazon.com!), and have watched it a good 15 times since.  I've lent my copy to other friends, who have immediately gone out and gotten their own copy, and thanked me for hooking them up with such a fantastic movie.
This movie isn't a ""must rent""  It's a ""must own"".

1672176,4,B00005V3Z4,"This was an enjoyable view, nearly wrapped up neatly at the end.  Similar to Night Schylaman's more popular film, 'Sixth Sense', it explores Time Theories in a unique fashion.
Donnie Darko is a teen with 'mental problems', (actually, likely more a product of the attempted 'cures'), who begins to see a man dressed in a rabbit suit with a human skull mask for a head.  The rabbit sends him off on adventures of vaguely then increasing destructive behavior.  The first and most destructive mission was a trip to sleep at the golf course where the rabbit informs him that the world would end in less than a month, on Oct. 31th.  While he was gone, a jet engine falls through the roof into his bedroom, thus his absence saves his life.
Donnie becomes interested in Time Travel, partially through the rabbit's goadings, and begins to 'see' people's paths as they walk through space and time.

Jake Gyllenhaal gives a mesmirising performance as the title character (yes, that is his real name), a teenager blessed with intelligence and a vivid imagination; but who is seen by his peers and teachers as a bit strange. Things get more bizzare when Donnie's bedroom is destoyed by an airplane engine, his delusions make him believe this is a sign that the world will end in 28 days. Over this period while he is waiting, Donnie's behaviour starts getting more eccentric... and he's stopped taking his medication.
That's about as much as I will say about DONNIE DARKO, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The recipient of numerous awards, the movie is a triumph for all involved, especially Drew Barrymore who co-produced the film through her company Flower Films, who also has a small part as a teacher.

Jake is an admittedly troubled teen in psycho-therapy who is called upon to save the world.  The way that Richard Kelly renders this comic book plot however, is incredibly complex.  Like the plot, the meaning of the movie cannot be discerned even after repeated viewings.

1672185,5,B00005V3Z4,"Rarely are movies which are released today so intricate and so well meshed. Richard Kelly was able to pull off both of these in his first try, with Donnie Darko. Donnie Darko is the tale of a teenager of the title's namesake (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is also a somnabulist. He is from an upperclass family which doesn't have your normal table topics for dinner. Coupled with the fact that Donnie sees a psychiatrist and takes psychiatric medication is fertile territory to make for such a vibrant character. Every character (even the janitor!) in the film springs to life with some kind of nuanced magic of which Richard Kelly is the only practitioner.
The intricacy is nothing to be overlooked; as the story touches on philosophy, time travel, the end of the world and subtexts. You see unusual things: hypnosis, detached jet engines, two-bit horror movies, dirty voyeurs and a geriatric woman who can't stay off the road. All the while resonating of the late 80's and all the while seeming completely possible.
If you think soundtracks are something more than just an annoyance, then you will love the artists they picked for the as well as well as the original score. The climax of the movie features a song by Gary Jules, called ""Mad World"", which really adds to an already amazing movie.
The way the film was edited and cut turns the 112 minute runtime into somehting of a blur. You won't notice you've been sitting for that long and you will want to see it again when it's over. The all-star cast is helpful for convincing people to see it, but I'm convinced, with the way Kelly handled less accomplished actors, that he could have just as easily pulled it off with no recognizable faces.",1044748800,,1691,4.696969696969697

Donnie Darko is an over-sensitive teenager, brilliant in many ways, who is convinced the world will come to an end on a certain day in the near future. His 'imaginary' friend, a hypnotic and somewhat demonic rabbit, commands Donnie to do certain things, (the famous schizophenic voice) also informing the boy of future events. The screenplay by director and writer, Richard Kelly, is indeed flawless, which manages to connect seemingly disconnected people and events in the boy's life in a very believable and compelling way.
The cast is an unusual ensemble that one would not expect to see in an offbeat film - Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell and Drew Barrymore; all gave great performances, and especially Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead, whose haunting expression, particularly his eyes during his strange visions, was quite remarkable.

The visuals are surreal in the most breathtaking and mind-bending way.  I barely took a breath from the film's beginning to it's rapturous end.
In particular, the scenes in the school were most beautifully handled.  No campy, Buffy-esque Romanticism of teenage coolness, or ""Heathers""-type pretentious morbidity.

1672196,4,B00005V3Z4,"To oversimplify the film, Donnie Darko is about a boy who may have paranoid schizophrenia who is saved from being crushed by an airplane engine which crashes into his bedroom by an imaginary friend that resembles a guy in a demon bunny costume. This new ""friend"" begins manipulating his actions which creates a chain reaction inevitably leading to the end events. Throughout the film Donnie finds himself confronting such issues as predestination vs free will and the existence of God. The story takes place in the late 1980s, apparently so the viewer will have some expectation of what won't happen in Donnie's future.
The time travel plot provides moments of interest, but is ultimately weak and pointless.  I cannot give a full critique without spoiling the ending, but this storyline completely contradicts the point the film is trying to make (see below for more details). However, where the film excels is as a character study of Donnie himself and his interactions with several other interesting characters. Some of the other characters are a bit one dimensional, but that is the point. Such shallow people do exist in real life and never look at the world with the amount of depth or imagination that Donnie does, and seeing the two extremes come into conflict is priceless. This is one of the funniest satires of suburban life I have seen since American Beauty.
If Richard Kelly were more confident to stick to straightforward storytelling and directing (the shifts in camera speed for example are just annoying and campy) and left out the superficial gloss and unnecessary time travel storyline, this film would be a true masterpiece. He does appear to have the potential to create surreal masterpieces like David Lynch, but he first has to figure out how how to avoid completely contradicting himself. It will be interesting to see which way he goes in the future; if he'll make the next American Beauty or the next Mulholland Dr. Maybe he'll surprise us and make a more successfull hybrid.
SPOILER: The film is supposed to divine intervention leading to Donnie's self-sacrifice. However, the tragedies at the end of the film are solely caused by this intervention.  For example, Donnie would not have flooded the school or burnt down the kiddie porn house or visited Grandma Death's house without the encouragement of the bunny, so his mother would not be on the plane, his teacher wouldn't have been fired, his girlfriend would not have been killed,  nor would the guy in the bunny suit have even died if not for his own intervention!  So the whole film lacks even any internal logic (something essential to any surreal film), Donnie's ""self-sacrifice"" is just plain stupidity, and the emotional impact of most of the events in the film is completely undermined.",1044576000,4,2775,4.948497854077253

The bunny rabbit turns out to be some mask, not a real demon or anything, and the horror elements are very poorly handled.

Most of all, I found this movie to be BORING.  But like a lot of boring, overrated films (such as IN THE BEDROOM or BREAKING THE WAVES or, dare I say it, SPIDERMAN) this movie has managed to trick a lot of people into thinking it has worth.

1672212,4,B00005V3Z4,"Growing up is difficult, especially for Donnie Darko. Set in Middlesex, New Jersey in October 1988, this film revolves around a pubescent boy who wakes up one night to find himself hearing a voice (belonging to a giant bunny rabbit) which guides him out of his house. Having slept on a golf course he returns the next morning only to discover that a 747 jet engine has crashed directly into his room. He has, in effect cheated death. Donnie realises that he has 28 days 6hours 42 minutes and 12 seconds before something terribly important will happen and the only guide he seems to have is this imaginary friend, the rabbit.
Sound like its going to get confusing? Trust me it does, right up until you see the end credits at which point you will no doubt ask yourself what the hell just happened, and find very little in the way of answers. If you do, however manage to work this film out, you will undoubtedly understand why this is the cult film of the year.
So what is this film about? Well, that's surprisingly hard to answer; script writer & director Richard Kelly himself has said that it can be pretentious and condescending to an audience to say that his film is about a certain subject. You might say that it was about fear and love, although Donnie would argue that nothing is ever that simple. I think it is about a whole host of things, not least love, time-travel, divine intervention and of course, growing up.
For those that do not know, this film was actually due to be released in October 2001, but because of the terrorist attacks in New York and the potentially inflammatory subject matter of the first 10 minutes of this film, it became `aviationally challenged' and when it finally did reach US cinemas, following the air crash in the Queens district, it predictably failed miserably. When it became available on US DVD though, it did very well, owing its success both to film critics & word of mouth publicity from great numbers of avid fans.
Darko was made on a budget of around $4 million, but still Kelly managed to pull together one of the hottest upcoming casts seen in a film for a long time. Heard of Jake Gyllenhaal? His acting as Donnie is first rate & you can expect to see a whole lot more of him over the years. Drew Barrymore plays a somewhat unique teacher and her talent & above all reputation & influence is clearly just what this film needed. As an executive producer she is said to have provided much of the required foreign investment, as well as smoothing out a potentially disastrous legal battle between themselves & the creators of Smirfs, regarding comments over their possible sexual preferences. The most unexpected performance though is that brought by Patrick Swayze as the very dodgy self-help guru Jim Cunningham (not entirely dissimilar to Mr Jack Russell who recently spoke to the L6), best known for his book ""Cunning visions of love"". This film really kills Swayze's image, whatever it might have been, which makes this film all the more refreshing to watch.
Donnie Darko is a film which I strongly recommend watching, if only because its innovation & style mean that in the future many references will be made to it. The only area of this film that is possibly up for criticism is the ending, which many will find too irritatingly open-ended & plain difficult to work out. It is a film that will stay in the back of your mind for as long as it takes you to piece the puzzle together, but its well worth the wait.

1672233,4,B00005V3Z4,"""Donnie Darko,"" with a DVD chock full of interesting extras, is a surprisingly good, creepy little period movie. (Of course, the movie's set in 1988, and its soundtrack, featuring a lot of Tears for Fears music is killer.)
In the film itself, Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the great new young actors, gives a performance that stays both vulnerable and frightening as the title character, a disturbed boy seeing a psychologist because he sleepwalks, remains disdainful of his parents (who consider him ""changed"" even before the freaky events of the plot happen) and visualizes, at times, a giant bunny rabbit named Frank who tells him the end of his world is coming in less than a month.
Around the time he begins seeing Frank, Donnie's house is hit with a piece of airplane fuselage, which destroys his bedroom. The wreckage is unidentified, for no plane at the time reported losing any of its equipment.
At Donnie's school, the staff and students have become involved with an inspirational speaker's new program involving a narrow scope of emotional honesty. Donnie, seeing all as hypocrites, is encouraged to rebel violently by Frank, but Donnie also begins to piece together clues regarding hidden secrets, an uncertain future and, strangely, time travel that hint that Frank may not be all that he seems.
All of this leads to an ending that, more or less, makes sense and remains haunting, though it takes multiple viewings to quite ""get"" the film and Donnie's choices at its end.
Jena Malone, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Katharine Ross, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore, who also served as a producer on the film, are on hand to give key performances.

1672237,4,B00005V3Z4,"This movie was a very pleasant surprise.
When this was initially released in theaters, I didn't quite know what to make of the trailers.  It appeared to be a movie about some kid haunted by a scary-looking giant bunny, sort of a demented ""Harvey"" as though directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  I was intrigued.  Unfortunately, I never got around to going to see it in a theater, so when I saw it at my local video store, I snatched it up, having very little idea of what to expect.
What I saw was a solidly entertaining, thought-provoking, unique and thoroughly original sci-fi time travel tale with very real and believable human conflict (rare for a science fiction flick).  Jake Gyllenhaal (playing the film's title character)-an unusually gifted actor for his age who consistently demonstrates a sense of truthfulness about his work (unlike so many other young actors of his generation, who seem mostly to be more concerned with looking cool and hip than with honing their craft)-gives a great performance, and is sure to have a wonderful future ahead of him.  Virtually the entire cast is an impressive veteran ensemble, all of whom deliver wonderful performances:  Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell as Gyllenhaal's parents, alternately worried and amused by their son's eccentric behavior; Katharine Ross (yes THAT Katharine Ross, of such `60s classics as ""The Graduate"" and ""Butch and Sundance,"" who has unfortunately been all too absent from films since that time) as Gyllenhaal's concerned psychiatrist; Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore (also the film's executive producer) are perfect as two young liberally minded high school teachers, embattled by a hypersensitive school bureaucracy; and Rachel Winfree gives a flawless performance as a neurotic high school teacher who tries so desperately to teach her students the difference between ""love"" and ""fear"" on the ""lifeline.""  Jena Malone as Gyllenhaal's love interest gives a very sensitive and well-crafted performance; she forces nothing, and like Gyllenhaal, she should also have quite a career ahead of her.
The most ingenious stroke of casting in this movie, however, is perennial `80s ""Dirty Dancing"" icon Patrick Swayze as a cheeseball motivational speaker (a la ""Up With People"").  Definitely his finest performance since ""Road House"" (har, har).
But the greatest kudos must go to writer-director Richard Kelly (not to be confused with ""Ally McBeal"" creator Richard E. Kelly).  It is not easy to craft a sci-fi tale that actually has a believable and compelling element of genuine human drama (George Lucas' stunted and awkward dialogue in his most recent ""Star Wars"" epic and the forced, saccharine emotions of M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" spring to mind), but Kelly manages to pull it off.  This movie is also part satire, too, offering relevant social commentary without being preachy or obvious.
This movie will surely go on to become a cult classic.",1042502400,30,2913,5.1918976545842215
1672238,5,B00005V3Z4,"Ok the director made a flaw when he mentioned cellardoor. I loved his mentioning it but his mistake came when he went on to assume that it was edgar allen poe that made the comment, in all actuality it was JRR Tolkien who made this comment. Tolkien was the great linguist who actually created his own languages. Poe was a poet. So if you read this then now you know. So the movie is great. It made me think. I generally like doing such activities. You got this kid who sees the future with his powers and ""unconsciously knows"" he's going to die. He wants to change the way things will be and uses his powers to do so by keeping himself from dying the fateful nite. He does this by creating an alternate course of time where he is not in his bed when a jet engine crashes on top of it. So he's always sneaking out of his room at nite on the off beat chance that nite is the fateful nite. Then you have this old lady who also has these powers and writes a book on it and she wants things set right and put back in order, and she does this unconsciously as well by causing Frank to accidently kill Gretchen by unconsciously always being in the middle of the road. I guess Lady Death ""unconsciously knows"" this will help Donnie make everything right. The kid sees that he has to change things back to how everything was supposed to be (where he dies)and makes the jet engine of his mom's airplane fall into a portal which he creates for the engine to go back in time and fall on himself 28 days from the 30th. How the jet engine ever initially falls is beyond me but according to time theory if you have an 8 ball go through a portal to the past then that 8 ball will always have gone into the portal and always come out at the other end of the portal. The thing is when it comes out in the past what changes will it make? Even if say the 8 ball runs into itself somewhere down the line that in itself may have caused the 8 ball to have gone through the time portal initially, but there is no disputing the fact that the 8 ball will have to go into the time portal and come out no matter what you try to do to stop it. The 8 ball initially always came out before the possibility of it going in is conceived. Therefore predestination exist if time travel exist. It's a law of time. If time travel itself is possible. And seeing that he actually does force the jet engine to fall on his previous self in the alternate future then this would bring an end to his alternate universe/the world. So the bunny was right all along, the world did end. The touching ending is what made it all the worthwhile. The end has the director saying that Donnie is smiling because Donnie thinks it was all just a dream. But to me Donnie was smiling because he was no longer afraid to die alone. Which if the director didn't think about seeing it that way then his ...missed a good ending call. Also from a deleted scene you have Donnie and Gretchen playing some 80s racecar game and he describes the visions he has and says they are like dreams but they are crystal clear and right when they are over just like when you wake up from a dream it all slips away little by little really quick. Well at the end you see everyone and they are all waking up from the ""dream"" that Donnie made, his alternate universe. And eventually they all start to forget about it. And that's why Gretchen hesitates at the end but still says that she never knew Donnie. Because to her it was all just a dream that's slipping out of hers and everyone else's memory. If you didn't know, the deleted scenes have a lot of Donnie and Gretchen together as bf/gf. And another scene that was deleted that was not even in the deleted scenes section show him and Gretchen dropping off the roberta sparrow letter. And I feel that the love story here is awesome even though they downplayed it with editing. But yeah there you go. Great ending. Loved it. All time classic movie. If i'm wrong about certain things then I don't care.",1042329600,13,3971,4.226315789473684
1672239,5,B00005V3Z4,"Ok, I was wasting time in a chat room. Suddenly someone asked if anyone had seen this movie, ""Donnie Darko."" Several others began to speak, but only vaguely. However, I was drawn, without knowing ANY specifics beyond the title and the mood of the movie.
I found it that evening on a pay channel (does that seem a bit like destiny, my path in life?); and I watched, mouth agape, as the scenes unfolded in an intricate web of events all centering around the main character, Donnie, who was saved from death by his new imaginary friend, Frank: a six-foot tall bizarre-looking rabbit.
Frank instructs Donnie to do things, things that disrupt and tear at the lives of the people of his town and school. And as I was appalled by Donnie's obedience, I couldn't help but to understand how we all feel led at times, as if it were out of our control.
The movie is a study in irony at every turn; and as the story comes full circle, you see that redemption is the ultimate irony here. And Donnie Darko willingly and joyously bought it for everyone.
Few movies have left me quiet for so long, alone with my thoughts of life/death, action/consequence... Now ""Donnie Darko.""",1042243200,,1160,4.555023923444976
1672240,4,B00005V3Z4,"I liked this movie.  Sad, thoughtful, touching.  It communicates emotional resonance in each glimpse it gives us of the faces of any of its characters.  Hints about what it's about?  What more do you need than The Last Temptation of Christ?
I found it deeply moving, a filmic poem as alien to rational thought as is the best work by W.S. Merwin, Wallace Stevens, or even Keats.
I guess maybe this review isn't very helpful, but this isn't a popcorn picture.  Rather, it's for one who wants to feel, to be reminded of the immediacy of life, and to believe that one really could change his fate--which is, after all, that each of us will die alone.",1042156800,,646,4.487179487179487
1672261,5,B00005V3Z4,"Between the thousands of High-School comedy flicks and Teen slasher films lies a very rare, untapped viewing genre which few moviegoers even consider, let alone bother watching. While the previously mentioned genres deal with basic teen preoccupations such as losing virginity, asserting popularity and curiosity (the perils of opening the cellar door (sic) to find out what that strange noise is), these films have little more to say than 'Hey, we're kids, and we're having a blast'. There is a sense of 'normality' and 'healthiness' that these films choose to base themselves on, usually allowing the odd 'fat kid' or 'freak' a look in for added laughs or to help drive the plot. Donnie Darko is definitely not one of these films
Donnie Darko is one of those rare gems that combine a subtle Lynch-esque dark humour with a nihilistic view of the trivialities of society, and what is considered 'normal' behaviour. Unlike the 'American Pie/Scream' banalities, we see
the central character relinquish grip on the world around him, but in his own mind, establishing his own beliefs and opinions, with the assistance of Frank, a very unusual and sinister sidekick.
The components that introduce us to the world of Donnie Darko - a misplaced Jet engine, an apocalyptic prophecy made by a man in a macabre bunny suit, and the complexities of Time travel are as strange as the overall atmosphere that pervades this film. The viewer cannot help feeling that as the central character's sanity unhinges, that it is in fact the rest of the world that is going crazy.
The acting is amazing, and the plot is superbly driven. The movie succeeds in walking a fine line between many genres, without ever being dominated by one - the film could have turned into comic farce, horror, sci-fi or love story, but chooses to remain uncategorized. The dialogue is blatantly written to make you acknowledge philosophical questions from the Zen-like to the ridiculous. It is a very accessable film, despite all the bizzarre inclusions and enigmatic prose. Similarly, while there is a heavy element of despair and worthlessness, it is not a film that will make you suicidal. However, it is certainly not a film to watch if all you want is a brainless teenage romp. If you want that, go hire out something by National Lampoon.
Despite criticisms that the end was a let-down, I honestly thought that it was a good strong ending that answered many of the film's plot points, but left the more important loose ends free for the viewer to interpret, and in keeping with the rest of the movie, was bitter-sweet and thought-provoking.
Particular highlights are the first time Donnie sees evidence of time travel, the conversation that he has with Frank in the cinema, the disturbingly realistic twist of the Jim Cunningham character, and the voyeuristic peek into many of the characters alone while a melancholy cover of 'Mad World' is played.
Donnie Darko is up there with films like 'Heathers', 'Virgin Suicides', 'Memento', 'Cruel Intentions' and any other film that actually dares to challenge the viewer to look beneath the surface.",1042070400,19,3105,4.961612284069098

I think that there are alot of people, young people, out there that are somewhat like one of the many characters in the movie. I never knew why I thought so much about life, I often thought I was strange, and then I saw ""Donnie Darko"" and I noticed that I am not the only one that sometimes thinks ""too much"" about things(although of course his thoughts consumed him). I think that also alot of people are like Chanita,a round, plump,but adorable young asian girl who is picked on. Also people are like Gretchen,a teenage girl with a good heart but hurts of her own. I think that this film was wonderfully directed,not perfect, but great. I believe that Jake Gyllenhaal is an adorable and talented actor, sometimes I watch this movie to see his work. I recommend Donnie Darko for those who are dreamers. Those who are not just walking on the earth without a thought or observation about our world. If you do not have a capacity to think and do not have huge capacity for imagination then I do not recommend this because the point of the movie and the intellect of the movie will not be absorbed the way I personally think(opinion) it should be and was intended to be.",1042070400,6,1273,4.421276595744681

1672264,4,B00005V3Z4,"Flying in and out of theaters before anyone really even heard of it, Donnie Darko is one of those little gems that most people will never see. It's a strange, genre bending film with a knock-out ending that will lead to hours of discussion long after the final credits roll.
Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager who in-between zoning out at school and regular trips to his shrink, starts being visited by a demonic rabbit named Frank. Darko is told the world is going to end, and is given orders as this story becomes more and more absurd. Is everything what it seems? What does everything mean? And when the climax is reached, just when you think you're going to get some answers, plot twists the size of Jupiter knock you down for the count and confuse you even more. After two viewings I'm still trying to figure it out. But that is what makes this film so much fun. There are many puzzle pieces throughout the film, some obvious and some you never notice until repeat viewings. And the movie is so much fun to watch that each viewing is an intense, exciting experience.
A number of pieces come together to make this movie work. The cinematography is excellent. From the opening [picture] of Darko lying on the hill top road to the final image, each [scene] is disturbing, eerie and above all, beautiful. And the accompanying soundtrack fits these scenes perfectly. Most impressive is a hard hitting montage at the end to a haunting cover of a Tears for Fears song. The editing in a number of scenes is equally impressive. For example, in the first scene at Darko's school, the camera flies around switching from slow motion to fast forward, introducing all the supporting characters as they cross each other's paths. The results will have you rewinding the scene and many others over and over out of their sheer beauty. Helping the film in its disturbed nature is Gyllenhaal's characterization of Darko, sending down-right scary smirks and haunting glares all throughout the film.
Despite all these successes, though, Donnie Dark does have some significant problems. Much of the A-list supporting cast, such as Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze and Noah Wylie, while superb in their roles, aren't given enough to do. Barrymore and Wylie especially needed more time to establish their relationship and characterizations. Also, while the film is supposed to be abstract and mind bending, it sometimes goes a little too far without offering just a little bit of explanation. Mostly just some added character motivation here and there would make a little more sense out of it.
While some absurdity works and some doesn't, in the end the good in this film far outweigh its problems, and Donnie Darko shows great promise for newcomer Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it. After all, any film that inspires hours of thought and discussion long after it ends succeeds on all accounts. You'll want to own this one for repeat viewings.",1041811200,9,2947,4.8376237623762375

1672266,5,B00005V3Z4,"I can't. There is no way for me to really express just how amazing, how thought-provoking and compulsively WATCHABLE this movie is.  I've watched it three times, and know I will watch it again at least three more times.  The story is incredible, and the concepts which are fully fleshed-out (but still left for the viewer to discover) are fascinating.
Having been a film fanatic for the past 25 years (since I was 8), and being a HUGE fan of offbeat cinema, I expected to be let-down by this movie.
Quite the opposite.
It's one of those films where, once you've seen it, you begin planning when you can watch it again, and whom you can drag-along for the ride.
The genius of this film is that all of the elements are IN the picture, but it's up to the audience to piece it together, and once they DO it still leaves lots of room for alternate theories.  It's the kind of film that raises as many questions as it answers, and NOT in a frustrating way. The film can be re-watched many times and it's not like the previous veiwings will ruin the effect; rather, they enhance it. Knowing what follows makes the film all the deeper, the messages all the more relevant, and the different trains-of-thought about ""what it all means"" all the more captivating.
I can't recommend this film enough.  The only movie of late that knocked me off my feet this way was MULHOLLAND DRIVE.
BTW, the DVD is great. The image is a bit soft (source materials?), but the audio (5.1) is AMAZING, and the bonus features are plentiful (the deleted scenes are over 1/2 an hour long, and they're NOT just throwaways).
Very, very recommended.",1041552000,7,1612,4.529209621993127

Excellent setting the movie in 1988 it gives the film a completely different feel. Jake Gyllenhaal is also great as Donnie Darko and the character kind of reminded me of Haulden Caulfield in the catcher in the rye, the kind of kid that you'd want to sit down with and talk to for ages.  The entire cast is actually very good, I loved the whole family and Beth Grant is perfect as the intolerable gym teacher: Kitty farmer, Patrick Swayze is also a very funny choice giving the movie an even better 80'feel.  All in all it is just a very gripping, mysterious movie and the fact that it was filmed in only 28 days, the duration of the story it self is amazing. The words from one of the last songs in the movie stuck in my head and are still there: I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, the dreams in which I am dying are the best I have ever had.

1672268,5,B00005V3Z4,"Jake Gyllenhaal, star of the godforsaken film Bubble Boy, gives the performance of his young career here as title character Donnie Darko.  In 1988, young Donnie is a borderline schizo who sees a grotesque man size reptilian/rabbit which he follows and obeys.  One night when Donnie goes off sleepwalking, the rabbit (who is called Frank) tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.  The next morning as Donnie stumbles home, we see his home has been decimated by a jet plane engine.  It is here where Donnie begins to wonder if all this really is all in his head, or if he isn't crazy and is meant for something more.  As the film rolls along he meets and falls in love with the new girl (Jena Malone), and becomes obsessed with the theories of time travel.  Patrick Swayze is here as a self help guru who may or may not be who he says he is, and nearly steals the show with his great performance.  Mary McDonnel is great as well as Donnie's mother, and Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore (she also was an executive producer of the film) play husband and wife teachers.  Writer/director Richard Kelly has crafted an unbelieveably moving film that scares, shocks, and plays with the mind of the viewer while having a sense of dark humor to it all.  All in all, those craving a different kind of thriller should definitely give this a look.

It's is very abnormal for such a big budget movie. It has a very convoluted message, and very psychedelic visuals. Not the typical nerd with a computer stuff at all.

Blank eyes like boiled eggs, chipped teeth, ambigious threatening expression.  That director/screen-writer has a FIERCE imagination.
  This is truly a movie for repeated viewings, so the DVD is certainly a perfectly reasonable investment!  One must listen to the 2 commentaries to grapple with the odd doings in Donnie's life.  And the deleted scenes are lovely.  Drew Barrymore and Watership Down fans are bound to be delighted.  The commentary for the infomercial  (which is used by Patrick Swayze's sadly clueless self-help guru)  is daft and hilarious.

I am sure I am not the only one that felt this way. After having co-workers recommend this movie to me a couple of times I decided to rent it. By reading the description I was expecting a horror movie or a slasher film. That is very far from the truth. I would almost call this a comedy. But it's not really that funny. It is a movie that does not fit into one category or even two for that matter.
The darkness of this movie and its lead character are overplayed at times. His psychological problems are not the first to be seen on the big screen. But his visions and hallucinations may be. The more scientific the movie gets the more it gets away from what I thought its intended purpose was. It seems by end of the movie you are forced to ask questions and there are some loose ends.
The soundtrack is fantastic. Every song rings true of the eighties and is selected for a reason. Every song played in the movie is perfectly placed. I do believe this film could take place at any time in the last 30 years but the eighties seem to work. But other than the soundtrack and 1988 references like Mike Dukakis and Joe Gibbs you wouldn't know when it was set.",1039737600,2,1287,4.257142857142857

I give it credit for being original, but i can't help but wonder from beginning to end, ""when is this gonna end?""  My girlfriend totally hated this movie.

1672277,5,B00005V3Z4,"It took a trip to the U.K. to discover the merits of this mesmerizing, deeply personal film. Although released in the United States in 2001, ""Donnie Darko"" never came to a cinema near me, and thanks to a relatively silent press, I didn't even know what it was when it came out on video.
Then in October 2002 I was in Northern England and began seeing reviews of the film. (It was hailed unanimously.) But what sealed my fate was hearing the hauntingly beautiful ""Mad World"" by Gary Jules. As soon as I got back home, I rushed to the video store to rent the film. Within two days I had watched it twice and before I returned it, saw it another time. I have since purchased the DVD and watched the extras and listened to the commentary.
I love the film because every time I watch it, I notice something new, which causes me to engage in a whole new set of mental Olympics. This is thought-provoking, genre blending filmmaking that helps me forget all the dross that, more often than not, Hollywood inundates us with. And it proves true visionaries still exist. But what's more, ""Darko"" paints a more realistic portrait of the '80s. Although many '80s films focused on insider trading and drug use, few tackled the political situation as created by Reagan and Bush. Many of us living during the ""finger on the button"" '80s lived with a real sense of doom, which was very reminescent of the ""World is Coming to An End"" rhetoric spouted by Frank.
Furthermore, ""Darko"" creates a more realistic portrait of teen angst. Then, and now, everything couldn't be put in a box and topped with a bow, as John Hughes wanted us to believe. Life is more complicated than that. Teens experience dark moments that can't be cured by a wild party and buxom babes.
Richard Kelly's script goes beyond your typical Hollywood fare. It represents something archetypal and deeply symbolic. This is a stunning freshman effort. What's more the music immediately struck a chord with me as I loved Tears for Fears' superior album ""The Hurting."" ""Killing Moon"" also has been my favorite Echo & the Bunnymen song.
""Donnie Darko"" is, without a doubt, the most important film to come out of 2001, and will exert an influence for years to come.",1039305600,4,2207,4.6183206106870225

I am a bit frightened by how much I loved this film. I don't rent movies very frequently, and heard about this movie on a listserv. I vaguely remember when it came out, but it seems like there was other stuff going on around that time ...
Set in 1988, an obvious adoration for Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" is apparent throughout Donnie Darko, from the eerily similar skin-crawling mood to the obvious hat-tip when Donnie takes his girlfriend to see ""Evil Dead"" at the movies.
Donnie is forced to endure one ordeal after another by Frank, a demonic man-sized rabbit that torments him and controls his life. Frank saves Donnie's life early in the film by appearing to him in a vision, leading him out of his house, and warning him of the end of the world, which will happen in approximately 6 days. Shortly thereafter, Frank compels Donnie to commit a series of destructive crimes, including vandalism and arson. The repurcussions of these evil acts eventually completely destroy Donnie's sanity.
I have read others say they were confused by the ending, but I think the ending makes perfect sense. Sometimes there are worse fates than death.
The deleted scenes of ""Watership Down"" add a literary level to the movie, but the movie does just as well without them.

While never quite as successful as its bigger budget cousins - darkly offbeat films such as ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Magnolia"" or the work of David Lynch - it's nevertheless a highly original and ambitious first feature which manages to impress. As does Jake Gyllenhaal, turning in a wonderfully unnerving performance as the troubled Donnie, his innocent looks making his behaviour even more chilling.  This is clearly a low-budget film, but for many audiences the grubby sound mix, poor lighting and (in places) very clunky writing will all be part of the charm.  If not, the 28-day countdown to cosmic doom will keep even the most jaded (or confused) viewers engaged.  Moreover, the late-80's fashions and songs make this film a particularly amusing 'wormhole' for the over-25's.  Dark, provocative and thoroughly entertaining.",1037750400,4,976,5.352941176470588

But nicely done, keeping your interest and making you wonder where things are going and what will happen next. Jake Gyllenhaal is cute and pensive; he could be mistaken as a brother to Toby Maguire. Watch the DVD extras; the deleted scene commentaries shed some light on a few things.

Despite being extremely confusing, it absolutely rivets you to your seat with suspense and slowly reveals the truth. Insignificant events turn out to have meaning. You don't know if Donnie is crazy or not. What is real, what is not? Do things really happen by chance? Are things really how they appear?
Just like the previous reviewer, I watched this movie three times in the same night. There are clues carefully placed throughout the movie alluding to what's coming. I guess the reason I never considered buying it was the title and the box. The box looks like a Friday 13th/Freddie movies and doesnt accurately reflect the depth of this movie. And the marketing, I never heard of the darn thing.  One of the deleted scenes on the DVD I felt should have been included in the movie. Since Donnie's hallucinations are increasing in severity and frequency, his shrink doubles his dosage. The scene left out is where the shrink tells Donnie he's been taking placebo's all along! That would have freaked me out, and I'm sorry the director chose to delete that scene. Missing this movie is like missing the Sixth Sense.",1036800000,4,1239,4.816901408450704
1672289,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko (Richard Kelly, 2001)
All hail the coming of Richard Kelly. If the rest of his films are as good as Donnie Darko, America has found its first truly great director since John Huston.
The title character (Jake Gyllenhaal, who easily deserved last year&#146;s Best Actor award for this role) plays a paranoid schizophrenic high school students whose best friend is a six-foot-tall mutant-looking rabbit named Frank (James Duval [Go/The Doom Generation]). No, no one but Donnie is capable of seeing Frank. Frank makes Donnie do very bad things.
When not under Frank&#146;s powers of suggestion, Donnie is your typical high school student. Along the way, he acquires a girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone, of Life as a House fame), goes to class, feuds with his teachers, has deep and meaningful discussions about the sex lives of the Smurfs, gets bullied by the school bad boys, tries to make life easier for an exchange student, and hangs out with his similarly-outcast friends. When midnight comes, however, Frank pops up, and Donnie becomes&#133; someone else. The first time we see Frank, he tells Donnie the world will end in twenty-four days and some change. And things go downhill from there.
Add to this mess Donnie&#146;s English (Drew Barrymore) and Science (Noah Wyle) teachers, whom he likes; the insane Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant [Speed]), whom he hates (she seems to be some kind of psychology teacher with a twisted agenda); his psychiatrist (the redoubtable Katherine Ross); a motivational speaker who seems to have fooled everyone but Donnie (Patrick Swayze); and, of course, his family, who think he&#146;s absolutely insane. It&#146;s a thick, tasty stew of teen angst, mental illness, and the sheer beauty of growing up different than everyone else. Like life, it&#146;s both funny and sad by turns, and sometimes cruel; Donnie wins a few battles, loses a few. The only real difference between Donnie and most high school outcasts is that, well, he&#146;s got this friend, see&#133;
All of this makes Donnie Darko a good film. What makes it a great film is all the thought that went into the script and the direction; the underlying meanings, the visual clues, the attention to detail. Kelly makes M. Night Shayamalan directing The Sixth Sense look like an ogre with a mallet; this is the most symbolically-laden film since Begotten, at least, and possibly going all the way back to the original Cape Fear.
Donnie Darko earned itself a place on the all-time 100-best list immediately. **** ",1036800000,6,2515,5.0602409638554215
1672290,5,B00005V3Z4,"Some films are impossible to categorize. Donnie Darko can be seen as horror, science fiction, drama or social satire but in truth it is just art. This is the sort of entertainment that is best experienced in a relaxed state of half dreaming. The plot defies analysis and the bizarre situations that arise are strangely suited to the audience's mood. After my first viewing, I didn't know what I had seen but I knew I liked it. In fact, it took several sessions to reach a solid hypothesis as to the narrative cause and effect.
Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character, a troubling but not troubled young man who lives in a different world to the rest of us. His average family offers him all the support they can but even Donnie's psychiatrist struggles to understand his situation. The prescription of antischizophrenic drugs seems to do little to blunt his visions, nor do they stop his nocturnal missions. I particularly like the way the soundtrack was gently used to separate the normal from the abnormal. The film's mournful version of ""Mad World"", (originally made famous by Tears for Fears), was one of the musical highlights.
One of Donnie's most interesting qualities is that he has no fear of the common-place terrors that exist for the rest of us. He tells his teachers where to shove it, asks the beautiful Gretchen to go steady after only a day, speaks out against the school's guest brain-washer and even copes calmly with murderous bullies. He is however, afraid that the world will end in 28 days and is concerned about dying alone, but then who isn't.
The story is interwoven with several mysteries, only some of which are even partially explained in the film. One of the most important of these occurs while Donnie is out one night on the local golf-course, talking to a six foot rabbit named Frank. I don't know if this is an allusion to the James Stewart film, ""Harvey,"" but it is certainly not played for laughs, as Frank is quite sinister. Sometime during this meeting Donnie's bedroom is demolished by a falling jet engine. No one knows where it came from and no airline claims their lost property, but one thing is certain, if Donnie hadn't been AWOL, he'd be very dead.
Life quickly resumes. The family's notoriety fades and school life once again regains its position of central torment in Donnie's life. His beautiful and sensitive English teacher, along with his grounded and caring science teacher, (Barrymore & Wylie), fail to offset the damage done by the stressed and misguided gym teacher, Kitty Farmer. She is a disciple of Jim Cunningham, (Swayze), a motivational speaker who reaks of charm and paternalistic love; so much so that Donnie, and the audience, just can't buy into his simple solutions.
The film's cast is huge but of an impressive quality, for an ostensibly independent production. All the major characters seemed to go beyond what is expected and create three dimensional beings with quirks, fears and emotions that are subtly alluded to. I particularly enjoyed Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie. When he is in the sway of one of his visions, the cast of his eye is more disturbing than any million dollar special effect. Beth Grant, playing the Gym teacher, is also outstanding. Her new-age zealotry is the perfect representation of what is truly dangerous in our politically correct society.
Along with a great cast, the script is amazing. Not just in its creativity but that it ever managed to get funding. Chock full of unlikely theories, small but convoluted set pieces and thought provoking dialogue, it made the film entertaining, even after several viewings. Small touches bring Donnie's world home to us; like the discussion of the sexual mores of Smurfs, Ms Pomeroy forcing the new girl to sit next to the guy she likes best and an old lady suffering a life-threatening obsession with checking her perpetually empty mailbox.
In the end though, it is the greater plot devices that twist our minds like some drug induced mobius loop. Is Donnie some sort of psychotic super-hero? Did everyone remember an alternative future, at the end? Were Grandma Death's theories on time-travel true? If you like pat answers in your entertainment, then you'll be frustrated with Donnie Darko. If however, like me, you like to solve puzzles, you may be prepared to dive into the depths of Donnie's world. Come on in; the water's dark.",1036281600,,4378,4.869973190348525

It's a great modern fairy tale/fable and it's obvious that a lot of love and heart went into the creation of the this story. Sure, there's interesting ideas and theories(albeit it confusing and little rushed) being thrown out in this movie that can allows you hours to speculate about the film's conclusion and multiple meanings. But the commentary on the human condition is what attracted me the most. In one therapy session, the psychiatrist mentions to Donnie that if the sky did open up one day and the world ended, all that would be left would be Donnie's memories, the choices he made, and the people he had touched. That line really sets you up to understand the ending(perhaps emotionally if not logically), and the haunting version of Tears For Fears ""Mad World"" just really emphasized that point. The sequence where that song is playing is just cinematically beautiful. Kelly is a natural storyteller and I'm excited to see what he comes up with next.ps(the whole smurf discussion is worth the video rental price alone!).",1033776000,,1186,4.847290640394089
1672301,4,B00005V3Z4,"Theatrical trailer: ""The Only way to unwind the future is to follow the path."" -- The path of a 'border-line, adolescent, sleep-walking schizophrenic' named Donnie Darko living in a parallel universe -- or is it a total delusion? -- guided by the six-foot rabbit Frank. -- Frank who turns out to be much more than just the strangeness he appears to be: Something (his energy, essence, vibrations, importance) the other characters in the movie tune into without totally understanding the entire gestalt; plus: It is difficult to see, but it seems that all of these characters are a part of the whole: Many mentors guiding Donnie along the path, and psychotic-appearing acts that he commits with reasons that seem to be connected with setting things right, to rescue: Donnie Darko -- the chosen one, the savior of the world.
When I first watched this movie, I found myself caught in between liking and hating it. I loved the character Donnie Darko: Although he was suppose to be mentally disturbed, I found him to be very perceptive, witty, intelligent, and one of the most sane people in the entire movie, challenging those who failed to see things the way they really are -- which causes him to be trapped in extremely-painful isolation. I loved many of the other characters as well: His girlfriend, his two sisters, his father and mother and many others, the teacher Drew Barrymore plays, Patrick Swayze's character, and the old woman who keeps walking back and forth to the mailbox to check for mail that is never there, almost getting hit by cars passing by -- although I found myself very disappointed, at first, that as strong a part as she seemed to play, she wasn't explained or used as fully as I hoped for; I found myself thinking of the movie 'Somewhere in Time', where Christopher Reeve -- playing a playwright in the 1980's -- is approached by an old woman --played by Jane Seymour -- who pleads for him to come back in time to her in the world of 1912 where she lives; but nothing like that appears to happen.
I only found myself wading through a very slow movie that tempted me-several times-to jump to the end to find out where all of this was leading, but I avoided the temptation, watching with irritation with the slow pace, and fascination for the eerie use of sound and special effects drawing me deeper in...until...I got to the end, and everything was suppose to wrap up neatly ...but it didn't: ""Oh, yuck!"" I found myself vocalizing to an almost empty room, except for me.
But after watching the commentary with the writer/director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Donnie, and the deleted and extended scenes, it made more sense to me, and the old woman fit more into what I hoped for -- although very subtly -- and the ending was more satisfying, and some of my impressions were confirmed.
And now I can say I like the movie. -- But even more so: The DVD as a whole; DVD is the way to go with this one; not VHS, for you need the deleted and extended scenes -- which the director cut because he needed to make a two and one half hour movie into a two hour one -- and the commentary to best understand and appreciate the movie, an understanding and appreciation you will not get by the VHS alone: You can either buy the movie so you can have time to go through at least once, watch all of the twenty scenes (with commentary and without), watch -- especially -- all the way through with the director's commentary, the commentary with the cast (if you so choose, but not necessary, for there is very little information that isn't all ready covered by the director in a much more straightforward manner), and check out the other features as well; or, if you would rather avoid the expense, you can rent it (all by itself) at a place that allows you to have it for five days, and: ENJOY!",1033776000,,3817,4.557496360989811

Indeed.  And by the movie's end, we're left to question whether or not Donnie really is such a savior.  At least I did.  In fact, I did a lot of questioning at the end of this picture.  Not the good kind, either--born of wonder and amazement, but the bad kind: spawn of frustration and delirium.
The year is 1988, and Donnie Darko is a dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager growing up in a typical dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager environment.  He deals with bullies at school, falls for the pretty new girl, fights with his caring, concerned family at home, and desperately tries to understand the life he's been given.  Oh, and as our story opens, he begins to receive regular visits from a nightmarish overgrown bunny rabbit from the future named Frank.
Frank reveals that the world is about to end and the only person that can prevent it is Donnie.  Thus begins his quest to unravel a mystery that includes a 100 year old woman named Grandma Death, a new age spiritual evangelist who preaches about love vs. fear, a mysterious book called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"", and two young school teachers who seem perfunctory at first but then take particular interest in Donnie.
I love movies that toy with my mind, confusing the hell out of me while promising understanding and sometimes, by the movie's end, delivering revelation.  ""Jacob's Ladder"" ranks among my favorite films of all time.  And even when ""The Ninth Gate"" failed to deliver a satisfactory ending, it worked for me nonetheless because I so enjoyed the journey.
But ""Donnie Darko"" seems to think 1 out of 3 is enough.  It's not.  With every dark scene, every social satire, every equitable performance, this movie promises greatness.  But that's all.  The ending is simply another enigmatic scene.  I wish I could say that the sum of its parts makes up for it, but it doesn't.  There are moments where you brace yourself and smile and think: okay, here it comes, here's where it all falls into place!

1672307,4,B00005V3Z4,"I've watched ""Donnie Darko"" three times now in the last five days, and still can't say definitively if I like it.  I appreciate the heck out it, am impressed by the imagination and creativity of the filmmakers, and admire the fact that what they put on screen belies their $4 million budget.  Most of all, I enjoy the heightened sense of awareness I get every time it finishes.  It's a feeling that lets me know, without question, that I've been affected by what I just saw.  But when I think about the film rationally, as opposed to emotionally, it crumbles under the weight of its own conceit.
Set in October of 1988, the story follows young Donnie Darko, a seemingly unbalanced teenager who is prone to sleepwalking.  On one such night journey he meets a new friend, a 6-foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.  Upon returning home the next morning, he finds that an unaccounted-for airplane engine has crash-landed on his house, crushing the room where he should have been asleep in bed.  It's the kind of setup that keeps the audience on its toes for the rest of the film.  Where did the engine come from?  Who is Frank?  What do the fates, which obviously want him alive, have in store for Donnie Darko?
The problem is that writer/director Richard Kelly has some ideas for answers to these questions, but he either: 1) Didn't have the budget to realize them; 2) Didn't want to give them away too early; or 3) Didn't want to give them away at all, preferring for the audience to fill in the gaps on their own.  I don't have a problem when most filmmakers choose path #3.  The audience should act as a participant in determining the meaning of the film.  But they can't do it alone, in a vacuum.  Kelly provides clues all along, but they are so hidden and so obscure, that even the most discerning viewer probably wouldn't be able to find them on first (or second, or third pass).  It becomes even more frustrating when the ending, supposedly constructed to tie up all loose ends (or at least all loose ends that the writer has bothered tying up), bends and breaks the audience's ability to suspend disbelief.  There's one final thread that I still can't logically rationalize, even though I know what was supposed to happen.
Donnie rails against ignore-the-grey-area thinking, claiming that life is more complex than that.  I wish Kelly would have heeded his own advice, for he does a lousy job presenting complex characters.  Most everyone here is either good or evil, black or white.  He loves the beatific Darko family, the progressive young teachers at school, and Gretchen (Jena Malone), Donnie's new girlfriend.  He hates, and is unsympathetic to, Kitty, the little girl dance troupe that she exploits for her own ego, and the infomercial pitchman whose theories she buys into wholeheartedly.  No scene holds a more pointed example of Kelly's inability to hide his hand, than an emergency PTA meeting.  Called because someone has flooded the school and put an axe in the head of its mascot, it is inevitably interrupted by Kitty, who has discovered that an English teacher (Drew Barrymore) is teaching Graham Greene's short story ""The Destructors"".  ""Do you even know who Graham Green is?"" asks a concerned mother.  ""I think we've all seen 'Bonanza',"" comes the arrogant yet ignorant reply.  Kelly didn't even have enough confidence in his good guys -- and by association, their quest -- to give them credible bad guys to rail against.  Instead he offers villains whose actions are one step above twirling their moustaches menacingly and tying damsels in distress to railroad tracks.
In Kelly's defense, ""Donnie Darko"" was his first film.  And to his credit, there is a lot here that is either very accomplished or shows potential.  I did say that every time I watch the film it affects me in a poignant way, and now I'll tell you why.
First of all, it looks great.  Kelly and crew, low budget or no low budget, have made a film that you can stand alongside any big budget blockbuster of the day, and it wouldn't look out of place.  They even manage a skillful recreation of the living water effect first seen in James Cameron's ""The Abyss"".  His camera work is ambitious or simple when necessary.  In a film called ""Donnie Darko"", one would expect that light (or the lack thereof) would be an important player.  Kelly and cinematographer Stephen B. Poster use clean suburban sunshine in the daytime, and extreme darkness at night.  The latter is often punctuated by blinding flashes of light, most notably the brilliant beam that presciently spews from Frank's left eye.
Kelly does fine detailed work making sure the authenticity of the time period is maintained.  From the clothes, to the conversations, to, most importantly, the music, everything fits the era to a T.  He manages to get fine use out of not one but two Tears for Fears songs: ""Head Over Heels"" adds power to an effective tracking shot showing the treacherous ecosystem that is Donnie's school; a cover of ""Mad World"" adds melancholy, without adding melodrama, to the affective denouement (like I said, emotionally the film works, but it can't stand up to reason).
Overall, I'll give Richard Kelly the benefit of the doubt, and deign to recommend his film.  Like I said, it offered me enough of a visceral rush that I've seen it multiple times, and look forward to seeing many times more.  For all potential audience members, remember this: ""Donnie Darko"" will not make much sense, at least until you've done some further research into the hidden meanings of the film.  Appreciate it as an emotional experience first, and its pleasures will fulfill you.
I guess I liked it after all.",1030924800,24,5747,4.737688442211056
1672308,5,B00005V3Z4,"""Donnie Darko"" is a movie unlike any movie I have ever seen.  It is Richard Kelly's first film, and with this being his first, we can expect great things from him in the future.
Donnie is a kid who has delusions of a large demonic bunny rabbit named Frank who tlaks to Donnie about time travel, the end of the world and soon Donnie realizes that what Frank is saying is all ture and something must be done by him to save the world.  The movie is brilliant in that it displays this idea, but in a way that is very inventive.
Kelly uses great storytelling and symbolism to get the stroy across and then uses new camera techniques to add efect.  The film is shockig and excitingly original and it shouldn't be missed.
Be warned, it is a movie that involves thinking, but it is worth it.
Jake Gyllenhaal makes a surprise turn as Donnie.  He does a great job.  Jena Malone is wonderful as his girlfriend and Patrick Swayze is very funny as a self help guru not mich unlike Tappy Tibbons from Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream.""
This film is wonderful and has to be seen beucase Kelly has made a film that is impossible to describe using words, is has to be seen to be understood.  It is an awesome film.",1030320000,,1204,4.3053097345132745

1672310,5,B00005V3Z4,"When the old Tears for Fears hit ""Head Over Heels"" kicks in, early on in the movie, you're taken quite by surprise. Not because it's another case of trying to show a bit of retro cool by referencing the 80's but because it fits in so well. The fact that the scene is in slow motion should be naff but in fact it is close to the best placement of a song in a movie in ages.

Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie that will leave you with a smile on your face, despite its bittersweet ending. While being startingly original, it does reference other movies (Harvey, The Sixth Sense) but doesn't seem like a second rate copy or a ""re-imagining"" for that matter (take note Mr Burton). It certainly deserves a wider audience than it got on release in the cinema with a groundbreaking performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and a wonderfully understated performance from Drew Barrymore.

Richard Kelly can join such young directors as Spike Jonze and Paul Thomas Anderson who buck the trend of what is wrong with so much in American cinema, namely cliched and rehashed pap for the masses. It's important that we cherish movies like these as they have become so rare - a true classic!!",1030147200,4,1166,4.521327014218009

1672312,5,B00005V3Z4,"Any form of media that makes you think has succeeded in what it set out to do. Donnie Darko is a film that succeeds on every conceivable level. The script is original and entirely unpredictable. There isn't a single bit of action or dialogue, not one frame that can be anticipated. The characters, too, are refreshingly well-conceived and highly unique. And it's a treat to see actors we know well (Drew Barrymore, who also produced, and Noah Wyle) stretch well beyond our usual expectations. There is great humor in this film as well as great sorrow. And, ultimately, it's impossible to say if the entire scenario takes place within the dreams of a brilliant but possibly schizophrenic young man or if, as he so desperately wishes, he has, through physics, managed to reverse time.
Jake Gyllenhaal gives a stunning performance as Donnie. Even his body language--incurving shoulders, questioning eyes, uncertain smiles--reveal a vast, searching intelligence. Mary McDonnell gives yet another in a roster of thoughtful portrayals--this time as the despairing mother of brilliant and troubled Donnie, simultaneously loving and hating him for being emotionally beyond her reach. And Jena Mallone is just wonderful, one of the truest, most authentic young actors around today.
This is filmmaking at its best--an adventure for the mind--not to be missed.

Donnie Darko is a mixture of social commentary, satire, science fiction type themes and dark drama; but it is all mixed together in a very well paced and clever manner. The acting is very good as well, even Drew Barrymore's performance as the weird teacher (now THAT is truly amazing). A truly DIFFERENT but great film.",1026518400,2,487,4.545454545454546

Why do you ask its like 'Harvey'? Well, Donnie see's an imaginary bunny named Frank, but Frank isn't an average bunny. Infact he is Donnie's sister's boyfriend in a costume.
 Anyways, the story starts out showing Donnie Darko (Who is played by the wonderful actor Jake Gyllenhaal), laying on top of a hill (Which is called 'Carpathian Ridge'). Apparently Donnie, who is sixteen years old, sleep walks, and has gotten into trouble before, but really wants to be a good kid. He goes back home and that night, he is awoken by 'Frank', who tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Donnie is skeptical about this warning, but believes it, cause when he comes home, he sees that a jet engine crashes in his room, which would have killed him if Frank hadn't come. He believes and does everything Frank tells him to do. Next Gretchen a new girl at school, is Donnie's love interest, soon they hook-up. Meanwhile, Donnie who goes to a therapist named Doctor Therma learns about Frank and hypnotises Donnie to tell him things about Frank. Dr. Therma starts to wonder whats wrong with Donnie and ups his medication. Then Donnie finds out that Roberta Sparrow who is an old lady who lives alone and checks the mail box obsessively, wrote a book called 'The Philosophy of Time Travel', Donnie studies it and understands what is happening to him.
IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, STOP HERE.
 An inspiration speaker named Jim Cunningham who believes that there are only two things in life, Fear and Love is called 'the anti-christ' by Donnie at an assembly at school. And Donnie burns down his house to reveal that Jim is a children's pornographer. Donnie's little sister, Samantha is in a dance squad called Sparkle Motion who make it to Los Angeles for a competition, but their leader Kitty cannot take them for she is fighting for Jim's right, so she asks Mrs. Darko to take them for her, Mrs. Darko says yes, and leaves Donnie and his sister Elizabeth home alone for a weekend. They have a party, and soon Donnie's days are up, Frank tells him to go to the Cellar Door by Roberta Sparrow's house which was mentioned to Donnie by his teacher, and Gretchen gets run over by Frank, and Donnie shoots him, and take Gretchen back home, that night Donnie goes to bed, thinking its all a dream, and is killed that night, by the recurring jet engine.

Donnie Darko takes on all three and does it admirably. Richard Kelly's first screenplay and directorial debut challenges everything you think you know about time travel and sets it in a wonderful 80's family setting. I loved his family and even though we never know why Donnie's seeing a psychiatrist, we see a slice of his life at home, at school, and in his dreams that alter his and our own ideas about realities.

I was afraid it was just going to be weird for weirdness sake (which it is) but it is also weird to be funny, and the movie is hilarious.  The director has seen way too many movies and is obviously Mr. Film Student, the movie uses just about every technical technique that anyone has ever thought of at some point or another during the narrative.  Normally that bothers me, but this movie is so out there that it works.  All the social/political references really helped ground the period in it's time (the 80's), instead of just fashion and hairstyle as most movies do.  Jenna Malone is a really good young actress (hot too).  The rabbit is hilarious.  Best Patrick Swayze performance ever!  Still can't decide whether the director actually took the thematic material seriously and had a point to it, or whether it was just a big joke.

The story is confusing and comples  and requires repeat viewings a visit to the website and the commentary track to understand. To some that may seem like overkill, ""shouldn't the movie explain itself?"". But personally I love the way it works out. You have to really explore and think about this film before you truly understand what has happeend by the time it ends. Visually the film is stunning. Filmed with very subtle camera moves and bright, yet wet looking colors it creates a perfect atmosphere. Everything looks normal, but it carries a slightly eerie feel to it. As far as acting goes, Gyllenhaal is fantastic as the lead. He shows little emotion when normal, however when he goes into his trances he gets this strange glazed look on his face. Great acting. The rest of the cast is very good as well, although I'll never be a big fan of Drew Barrymore. The movie seems very real. The family acts lie kany normal family would. It doesn't feel forced or faked. The teenagers seem like ttenagers, they aren't exaggerations of teenage stereotypes. The film is very reminiscent of the real world. Overall this is a very intellectual film. THer is no straightout comedy or action, but the film is funny at times and is often exciting. It would be very hard to find a catagory to fit Donnie darko. Many people will find it confusing and dull, many others will think that it tries to hard to be an intellectual film. However if you enjoy having to think about your movies, or jsut strange movies in general, Donnie Darko is a great pick. Probobly not the best choice for the casual FilmGoer who is just in it for a good time. This movie has a very independent film feel to it, without getting too pretentuous or bogged down in drawn out dialogue. Darko is excellence in cinema.",1025654400,3,1871,4.6017964071856285

The death was an accident, and the guy who was driving the car has come from another dimension in the future to try to make Donnie see what will happen if he doesn't figure out how to go into the past and change it.
Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely fabulous, hysterically funny and touching in his more depressing moments. I'm still a little fuzzy on the Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore characters. Did they know what was going on or were they just really overacting?  I'd put money on the latter.

1672329,5,B00005V3Z4,"I really enjoyed Donnie Darko. The movie intersects different people's lives and emotions in a very thought-provoking manner. It doesn't make in fun of paranoid schizophrenia, a disorder in which Donnie suffers from, but shows the depths of his degripping from reality and how it affects the people he loves, such as his family, his girlfriend, his friends, and his community/school. His intelligence also plays a key factor in how amazing and yet ironic Donnie is portrayed. The actors, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, etc, brilliantly showcased the anguish, pain, remote happiness that these characters dealt with. In most films,you never see the main character who has extraordinary intelligence, yet struggle with the same mind that gives them that same intelligence, plus the fact that he tries to find out more about what is making him have these visions of Frank, the demonic rabbit, is enduring. The concept of the end of the world/time travel is an amazing and original idea that I think, has never been captured so brilliantly in a film before. No one really talks about what would happen if we could go back in time and change what we did or said, or how we'd feel if the world suddenly ended. The fact that Donnie tried to find an explanation and then sacrifices his own life to give better ones to his girlfriend, family, etc. is touching. With the subject of the end of the world, it's wonderfuly projected how the people involved took time to give us Donnie's thoughts on what he thought about the world ending, how it made him feel, his conflictions w/ God, philosophy and simple everday life. Someone who isn't very interested in religion, philosophy, or science fiction,like myself, would have looked at this movie and been like, ""This looks like crap"", but I was fortunate enough to see the movie and see something different...original than what I have seen in movies today. A very warm, disturbing, yet original film that has inspired me not to take for granted the mental health I have, the family I have, the life I live.

1672330,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko was a great movie. I was stunned by the concept and execution when I first watched it on VHS. Then I got the DVD and had my brain blown.
First off, let me just say that the DVD is packed with features: two commentary tracks, dozens of deleted scenes, the full website (which has crucial epilogue stories, and is only accessible online with difficult trivia paswords), full copy from the book that plays such a vital role in the story and so SO much more. The Donnie Darko DVD is how DVDs should be: filled with features, all of which enhance the film.
So, first things first: the director's commentary is AMAZING. If you had any questions after watching the movie (which most everyone did), the Richard Kelly addresses most of them...with humor and charisma. Jake Glyndenhall is also part of the director's commentary, and he's very funny. I especially loved his joke about ""FOUR MILLION DOLLARS! We only had FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!"" His groundskeeper Willy impression was pretty spot-on, too.
The other commentary isn't quite as good...mostly just cast and crew chatting over the film, and Producer Drew Barrymore rambling about whatever.
The deleted scenes provide some incredibly important story components, addressing Donnie's medication, who Frank is, and so much more. I couldn't BELIEVE that some of these scenes were cut. Some of them are just such integral aspects of the storyline....and I think you can feel their absence in the film. Richard Kelly provides commentary for these, too, explaining why he had to cut each scene.
Reading ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" book that's referenced in the film is a great advantage towards understanding the story, as well. It's a little hard to read all the text on your screen...but well worth the squinting. It's clear that Richard Kelly put a LOT of work into this story, and it's nice to see all that work in one place.
Perhaps my favorite part of the DVD were the ""Cunning Visions"" infomercials. You have to turn the commentary on to appreciate the sheer comedic genious of these things. So so funny. I also recommend reading the website stories before watching the infomercials. It'll all make sense that way. Regardless: ""I'M NOT AFRAID ANYMORE!"" HA!
In sum, this DVD enhances and explains this wonderful movie, actually improving on the original film. Highly recommended, especially to those who just didn't quite understand what happened in the movie. If you liked the movie the first time around, you'll be as floored as I was with this DVD, and understand why I think this is probably the best DVD I've ever seen.

With writer / director Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko, I found a treat close to home. With cameos from Drew Barrymore, Noel Wyle and Patrick Swayze this movie carries you into the past, pre school shootings and unexplainable violence from today's youth. Set in 1988 (a year after I graduated high school), Donnie Darko uses the music of the times and the down-home settings to drive the point home. Quoted by Drew Barrymore (unfortunately deleted from the film), ""Kids today are lost because the parents don't know how to reach them,"" Or close to that. Our hero, Donnie, descends into madness when he comes full circle in the month of October to learn of the future events through his imaginary friend, a dark twisted rendition of Harvey with Jimmy Stuart, called Frank ""the rabbit"". Frank explains, through visuals with excellent special FX that the path we lead in this life is predetermined by a source that is expelled from your body. Confusing? Good! To appreciate the subtle use of language and visuals Donnie Darko isn't a ""horror"" movie, you could border it with Sci-Fi, you have to see the film! I recommend this to anyone that wants a taste of nostalgia from the late 80's without the trite clichs always seen in movies. This was a more real look into the times, as close as ""The Virgin Suicides."" If you like dark, subtle plotted tales, this is your movie!

I just finished watching Donnie Darko for the first time. Once I finish this very short review, I will be watching it a second time.
Without a doubt, Donnie Darko is one of the best Generation X films (not that this film should be categorized in any way shape or form. Perhaps I should delete this line. Bah! I'll keep it.) ever made.
The film is poignant, witty, and absurd. Unlike other phantasmagoric/surreal films, the absurdity actually comes together quite nicely at the conclusion. At the end of the film I wasn't left scratching my head wondering if maybe the director was just shooting way over my head (which sometimes [not always] happens to me with Lynch films).
To me, Donnie Darko represents everything that American Beauty should have been. And I think American Beauty was a great film. It's just that Donnie Darko enters uncharted territory in the examination of the dysfunctional family territory. ""Because if the world ends, it'll just be you and him.""

1672335,5,B00005V3Z4,"Like many people who write reviews, I tend toward slight grade inflation. Every once in a while, I have to go back and down-grade a bunch of films I reviewed, because a great film comes along and shows me what is really possible given a talented cast and great script in the hands of a good director. This is such a film. The first two acts set up our expectations - a nervous young man with a troubled past and a lot of barely concealed anger is abused in various ways by both kids and adults. He tries to stay in control, but some darkness within makes him stop taking his anti-psychotic medication even as he tries vainly to fight off visions of ""the end of the world"", brought to him by the ghost of Bad Times Yet to Come in the form of a satanic-looking rabbit. Family and frinds just watch as our hero starts circling the bowl. When will he crack ? Then the bomb goes off and this film rockets to my ""must buy"" list. Not only did I not get a Columbine-style ""gun battle"" that the marketing for this film seemed to promise, I found I was in the middle of a supernatural thriller. I will not say much, except that subplots and strange phenomena abound, which are resolved in one of the best third acts I can recall. I waited in vain for the payoff we usually get with supernatural thrillers in which the ""unspeakable evil"" shows up and is actually quite speakable, if not outright lame. What I got was worthy of M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense""). This remarkable achievement came not through trickery (hiding the Bad Thing) or cheats (making the Bad Thing invincible), but through not letting the the plot swallow the characters. Instead, the characters are drawn so well that when the Bad Thing reveals itself, (note: the Bad Thing is actually worse than anything we could have expected - it is classic in scope and scale) the characters act accordingly and the emotional payoff just rocks. The resolution of the film was so strong that while I watched it, I was taken in, but when I think back about the events early in the film in context of what I know comes later, I get serious chills. The DVD contains several fully-realized scenes and extensions of scenes in the film, some of which I wish were in the film or at least watchable as part of the main narrative. The commentary, what I heard of it (Blockbuster, two days on a new release is NOT enough!), was insightful, as well it might be given how much was going on in this film.

The intricately-woven themes resonated deeply for me -- a lost and confused youth, seeking meaning and spirituality in a world where the sane are called crazy, and ultimately discovering for himself that the force called God manifests itself in unexpected ways.
The special features on the DVD are a MUST - watch every deleted scene both with and without commentary. They will give you a fuller, more textured vision of the film's purpose. They also show the greater level at which Drew Barrymore's character should have interacted with Donnie; I think it's really sad that so much of the real meat of their relationship was cut out. Watch for the restaurant scene with Donnie's parents - it's short, but hysterical.

I believe that this film will leave the viewer with an intense but reasonable mix of being creeped out, confused, angered, and depressed.  After a couple viewings of this film, thoughts of the main character(s) linger in your mind in a way that may actually make you want to cry.  The plot and storyline are stitched together perfectly with just enough said, just enough implied, and just enough left to be pondered.

*minor spoilers* What do you get, when your stuck inside the mind-inside the dreams-of Stephen King right as he falls alsleep whilst reading Alice in WonderLand?
Answer:....Donnie Darko
When in the middle of the night a jet engine falls from the sky, crashing into the bedroom of Donald Darko, Donnie has only a six foot rabbit named Frank to thank for saving his life. Frank then kindly informs Donnie that the world will end in twenty-eight days. Over the course of the next month-with armegeddon inevitable- Donnie follows the bunny (a'la Alice style) through a wormhole into a tangent universe where he sleepwalks and reeks havoc on the schools water mane; falls in love; has many more creepy encounters with Frank the bunny; theorizes the true nature and existence of Smurfette; exposes a kiddie porn publishing ring; and uncovers the principles of Time Travel.
Without getting bogged down in details of the synopsis, Donnie Darko simply put is: pure feat in filmaking. Never before has a film noir been able to capture and convey such raw beauty. Never before has such a dark and grim premise been so cleverly told,
through painingly-pretty blue skies, descriptive and creative random blurbs of literature, genuine and concise dialogue, and an ending that brings us back to the beginning, which we quickly learn is the beginning...of the end.

One of the highlights for me was the use of music, including an awesome and refreshing alternative to the cliche' part of a movie where we meet all the characters, and a group of characters meet for the first time- exchanging dry, predictable, formal dialogue. Instead the creators chose to pan from afar, mute-out all sound, and play-from very beginning to end- the appropriately symbolic song, ""Everybody wants to Rule the World."" Throughout Donnie Darko the device of music is carefully and purposely implented to create a genuine feel of the late eighties era. The soundtrack is so deftly used, it sort-of becomes its own living character.
It is a rare feat when a movie remains even from opening scene to the closing credits. Donnie Darko accomplishes this rarely reached goal though consistently superb cinematography, descriptive prose delivered by colourful characters, dashes of humour, splashes of romance and a huge cerebral heaping of the Philosophy of Time Travel- coupled with the fear of knowing ""that every living being on this planet...dies alone.""

Well, what can I say about this movie?  I went into this film knowing nothing more than a couple of my friends liked it and it starred the kid from ""Bubble Boy.""  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I found it gripping, intriguing and all the other words you can find in the thesaurus that mean the same.
Richard Kelly is the man to thank for this.  He is the first time director and writer behind ""Darko.""  You just got to love those rookies that come out with a movie that makes you anxious to see the next one.  The script is intelligent, very well thought out and terribly cryptic.  Now, about the characters...
Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal, ""October Sky"") is an odd little lead.  Not quite sure whether to embrace him and try to empathize or just distance yourself and try to find someone else to connect with.  Then there's the girl, the ""love interest.""  Gretchen (played by Jena Malone).  We hardly know what this girl is all about, despite the information we're given.  I'm not sure if it's a script thing or an acting thing or if that's the way it's supposed to be.  We have the parents (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell) that I would have loved to have seen more of.  The rest of the characters seemed pretty damn two-dimensional, which actually is fine by me.  This isn't a PT Anderson epic, after all.  However, I do believe that Mr. Kelly is capable of producing such an epic were he to try.
The film deals greatly with the subject of time travel.  Basically I'm saying get ready to open your mind a little bit and start thinking.  This isn't a ""Back to the Future"" type of film.  You'll be quizzed on the material later.
So, to recap:  I loved the movie.  I loved watching the ending and being forced to think about things.  I loved learning about a new director who obviously cares about film and puts thought into his projects.  I'm curious as to what he could do with something he didn't write.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see.  As for now, I'm going to go to sleep and hope the darkness and depression that can come from this movie doesn't consume me or give me nightmares.

1672353,5,B00005V3Z4,"I love this movie. Let me just get that out of the way first. I thought the casting was brilliant, thus the acting was perfect.
Jake Gyllenhaal has been compared to countless, great, young actors. He shouldn't have been. He is in a class by himself. I feel the same way about Jena Malone. She will survive the transition between child star and adult actress with no problem. The rest of the cast was equally inspired. Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osbourne, Kathrine Ross and Jake's real life sister Maggie are all exceptional.
I think a lot of the criticism of this movie comes from people's need for a neat, tidy ending. This movie doesn't have one. It's totally up to the viewer to decide what they think happened. I have watched this movie several times and each time my conclusion is different. It depends on your mood I guess. I love that it isn't spelled out for me. I don't need to be spoon fed. I can think for myself, and this movie definitly allowed me to. I listened to the commentary and even the writer/ director doesn't really know how to explain it (that's aweome).
It's a commentary on a lot of things: society, values, sanity, love. Take your pick, or add your own.
This is a pensive film. It's not American Pie. Take some time with it. Watch it 2 or 3 times. It's worth it.
And just as a side note: This movie has some of the greatest dialogue in movie history (ie. the conversation about the Smurfs is priceless).",1022716800,,1453,4.466165413533835
1672354,5,B00005V3Z4,"How to describe ""Donnie Darko,"" the dark psychological drama written and directed by Richard Kelly? After seeing it I thought of the film as a sort of ""Ordinary People"" meets ""Being John Malkovich,"" with a touch of ""Pi"" and ""American Beauty"" thrown in. But ultimately that equation is unfair; ""Donnie"" is, in the end, a true original.
The film takes place in 1988. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the title character: a troubled, sleepwalking teenager who has recurring, frightening visions. Donnie is a quest to understand the forces that are affecting his life and sanity.
Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance helps to hold the film together. He is a quirky, offbeat leading man; at times frightening, at times appealingly vulnerable. Gyllenhaal's work is superbly complemented by that of an eclectic ensemble cast which includes Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore, and Noah Wyle. I was particularly impressed by Patrick Swayze's turn as a creepy, oily motivational speaker.
""Donnie"" defies genre classification. It blends together elements of serious family drama, 80s period piece, horror, satire, and science fiction. In a sense, it is a deconstruction of the whole 80s teen movie genre. The script makes intriguing use of 80s pop culture.
""Donnie"" has scenes of weirdness and absurdity, and is often punctuated by bizarre dialogue and strange, frightening imagery. And there are some really moving scenes that tap into the universal experience of human loneliness and the need for love.

In my opinion, if a film brings you close to tears in laughter as well as in sympathy, it should rank among the highest in your collection.
Jena Malone (Gretchen) gives a smouldering angst-ridden performance alongside Jake Gyllenhaal .. who was also seen in Bubble Boy, which I do not recommend.  I've never seen Drew Barrymore act better.  Even the small roles were developed and meticulously acted, such as Cherita, and Donnie's sister.  All of them had motives and yearnings, which I long to see more in Hollywood.

On the one hand this is a fabulously made flick. The screenwriting is sensational with some bitingly original insults, which for reasons of censorship I can't cite here, and the dialogue throughout is amazing. The characters are fantistically developed, the high schoolers take you back to your high school years and the adults show you what adulthood is all about--that we don't necessarily have things figured out any more than kids do. The audio track is flawless, sound effects fit into the puzzle just as they should, the soundtrack is fabulous (despite the fact that Donnie's little sister dances to a song (Notorius) that wasn't released until 1992). And as for the lighting. Obviously Kelly has done some Gaffer or Director of Photography work before because he has an astute sense of what angles, what shadows to employ. You could almost get the characters' emotions without actors by paying attention to how faces are lit. Or the camera angles and movements they're shot in. With that said, with one exception--Drew Barrymore, who is horribly miscast here--the acting is bitingly true. Jake Gylenhaal debuted to the limelight with October Sky very well. He follows that performance up with an even more accurate performance here. Jena Malone continues to show that she will someday soon be a massive star, despite her ripe young age of 16 and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Donnie's mother, who when she's on it, steals the screen) fit their characters flawlessly.
So you wonder: with all these great things said, what can possibly be wrong with this film? two things. First Drew Barrymore, who I usually love and who produced the flick, thus having the ability to pick her role, fails as a hard-nosed, but well intentioned young teacher. And secondly, and much more importantly, it never seems that Kelly has a clear vision of what he wants his debut film to be. At times it seems he wants it to be a teen, high school flick, at times a commentary on pretentiousness or gullability, at times a look into the effects of mental illness on those that suffer the malady and on the family and friends of the mentally ill, at times it feels as though it's going to be a coming of age story, at times it looks into sexual perversions, at times it a psychological analysis of different characters, at times it tries to surprise you with interesting twists and then just to convolude itself as much as humanly possibly, it's a science fiction movie about time travel. Each of these themes are fabulous film fodder, but they can't be clumped into one hour and a fifty minute movie. A combination of a few of them, sure. Or a deep investigation of one or two of them, even better. But ultimately Donnie Darko is too amibitious (something you can rarely say about films today) and can't possibly do all of the things it seems to do want to accomplish. This, on one hand, is a strength. I'd rather have a film be ambitious and scale many genres; it inspires more thought and emotion that way. But sometimes, as a writer or filmmaker, you have to narrow your scope and pick what's most important. It feels as though Kelly never did that. And if he did, I'd loathe seeing the original first couple drafts of this script.",1020643200,3,3440,4.706467661691542
1672364,5,B00005V3Z4,"When I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in October Sky (one of my favorites) I said, ""That guy will be headlining the movies if he keeps going like he's going."" Luckily others agreed, and now we have Donnie Darko.
First off, Donnie Darko belongs in a category by itself like a large number of movies released in recent years. Horror? Not quite. Thriller? Nope, no Jodie Foster in sight. So, we have the new category that I have dubbed ""Stumper"" or ""Figure-it-outer."" Other movies in this category range from ""Magnolia"" to ""Pulp Fiction"" and even ""Unbreakable"".
Donnie is disturbed. So disturbed in fact, he's stupified. (Cheap Joke). He has been seeing a psychologist due to his emotional instability. Also, he is seeing a six foot rabbit. His family life is so-so, and the bindings in his family seem to be slipping daily. Like Sixth Sense, at the end of the movie, there is a shocker, and no matter what your thinking while your watching, throw it out. Thats not going to be it. But I can tell you that you will be thinking about Donnie Darko for days after you see it. It's a great movie, and requires puzzle-piecing. I just have one question: Did the world end in 88? Oh, really?
While you watching Darko, keep your eyes open for clues and remember the plot points to help yourself place the conclusion when its over. Also keep your eyes and ears out for some great book and movie references. And yes, they were watching Evil Dead in the theater. Groovy baby.",1020038400,2,1456,4.582375478927203
1672365,4,B00005V3Z4,"I loved so much about this move that I've have givein it 5 stars...IF I understood the ending. Call me stupid - but I didn't. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the ride because the plot (basically a story of a boy who is either disturbed or spiritually in tune with time travel and the future)is so engaging. Jake Gyllenhall is dead on perfect as the teenager whose grasp of reality seems to be slipping and who occasionally sees a very spooky looking giant rabbit. The kid is seeing a psychiatrist because his parents are worried not only about his visions but about his past troubles (burning down an abandoned house, etc).
 What sets this movie apart from other spooky movies is the way the film shows the dark side of high school life. Patrick Swayze, no longer a regular in films, is good as the leader of a cult movement which is more than it appears...and so is its leader. Drew Barrymore is a teacher who wants her students to question their lives and who isn't afraid to confront the principal if she thinks he is wrong. Each character in this film is fresh, original and interesting to watch.
 And yet...I confess...the ending left me a bit puzzled and feeling left out of the loop. So if you understand it, please, please explain it to me.",1019865600,,1254,4.495614035087719
1672366,5,B00005V3Z4,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I was thinking that it looked terrible. I mean, how many teen flicks does the world need? Also, Patrick Swayze's ugly mug popped up and I almost lost it! There was no way I was going to see this. However, after some time had passed and the film went to video/DVD whatever the hell people use these days, a friend of mine had rented it and was raving about how good it was. He told me that I would like it, then I said, ""Is that the movie with strange looking bunny rabbit thing"" and he responded with ""yeah that's it, but you just have to see the film to beleive it, the trailer does not do it justice."" So, I found myself at the video store renting Donnie Darko, somehow I was inexplicably drawn to it... Anyhow, I watched it and I was in awe. What a freakin' great film this is!! I was so into it that the next day I went home and watched it again from start to finish, I picked up a lot of the little nuances the second time around, could not figure out the fat jogger man in red outfit though, still working on that. Very funny, very moving, very thought provoking, interesting themes and ideas are generated in this film. Easily the best indie film of 2001. Oh, and as for ol' Patrick Swayze, don't worry he is not the main focus of this movie, plus he receives a splendid demise in the end. This film demands to be watched twice. So much better than all the other [stuff] out there.",1019779200,7,1431,4.151079136690647
1672367,4,B00005V3Z4,"""Donnie Darko"" is precisely the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic. No one saw in the theater, but once people like you and me get their hands on it in the video store, we make damn sure all our friends see it.
The coolest thing about ""Donnie Darko"" is that it's a bonafide independent sci-fi film. This movie has some impressive visuals and visual effects, and it was all made on a $4.5 million budget. Of course, when Drew Barrymore is your executive producer, I bet you get some deals and steals here and there...but it's still amazing that this film cost so little to make.
Jake Gyllenhall is wonderful as the title character; somehow, the kid who stooped to the all-time low of ""Bubble Boy"" is able to carry a mind-bending genre film with a large cast of good actors.
The film itself is at once hysterical and depressing; realistic and surreal; frustrating and accommodating. It's certainly an original work from a first time director, and a film that will certainly leave you with more questions than answers. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Any movie that requires you to think about it well after the credits roll is doing something right. ""Donnie Darko"" and Spielberg's ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" have more than a little in common -- both deal with issues that are bigger than us, both have an ending that can be thought of as both happy and sad, and both still haunt me to this day.

1672368,5,B00005V3Z4,"While watching this movie, you begin to ask your self ""when the hell will this movie pick-up"" This film hides its great sophistication. Its not till the movie ends that you realize just how wonderful this movie is.
The story is about a delusional teen Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal) who sees a six foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank. Donnie is saved for some reason by Frank and is forced to do his bidding. Donnie goes through the film affecting charectars one way or another which all ties together in the end. The ending is one of the best film endings ever and is well worth whatching over and over.
Jake Gyllenhaal gives a spectacular preformance he keeps his charectar restrained and makes you believe this guy is insane. The rest of the cast does an excellent Job.

1672370,4,B00005V3Z4,"I rented 'Donnie Darko' and watched it once, last night, alone, with the lights off.  In the movie's favor, I have to say that it did give me that creepy feeling I was looking for; it did keep me entertained; it did make me think twice.  If you're a fan of strange films with dark and uncertain content, then I certainly recommend you check out 'Donnie Darko' - it's worth seeing.
But part of the appeal of a strange and uncertain film is that it will come together in the end, explaining much of the strangeness in the film with a clever and satisfying twist.  Donnie Darko lacks any such satisfying conclusion, and that's why I can't say it's great.
The link between Donnie's visions and reality is the mystery of the film, and this mystery is really never solved, nor is it left for you to solve.  It's just... there.  Based on this,  I get the impression that the filmmakers themselves were uncertain about the plot.  There are a number of very interesting ideas in this movie, but while each stands fairly well on it's own, they fail to come together in a meaningful way.
The strengths of 'Donnie Darko' are its characters (the Darko family is great!) and its strange dark vision (you've got to see this bunny).  These alone make the movie well worth watching.
The lack of an equally strong conclusion is disappointing, but it doesn't mean you should miss seeing this movie.  Check it out.",1019606400,,1394,4.544

There were the obvious ones like the Smurfs and the not so obvious, like how at the end, on their bikes, the kids look just like the kids in ET. The music was amazing and haunting. The ambiguity of the ending was a big risk, but I think it paid off. This is one you need to watch over and over again to analyze and think about. The DVD extras shed some more light on the storyline and the music video is a nice bonus. It's impossible to read the book in the extras on a 19"" screen, but luckily you can get it on the official website. The book puts a whole new twist on the movie.",1019520000,,679,3.927536231884058

With a very dark American Beauty feel for pacing and convincing performances from sympathetic characters this film didn't make nearly enough of a splash for its major release. Hopefully, it will find its more deserved recognition as a sleeper cult film.
The subject matter of the decay of middle america, the concepts of mental illness, the stigma of life in parichial towns and the layers effects of time travel and fate carry a beautiful love story and themes of metaphysical growth and triumph.
I can't give this film enough praise. There isn't a bad element. Visually appealing, cerebrally stimulating, emotionally moving, well performed and scripted. Watch it. You'll thank yourself.",1019520000,2,810,5.488
1672373,4,B00005V3Z4,"Richard Kelly's remarkably assured directorial debut, ""Donnie Darko"", could be earmarked as the teen movie version of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" with a surreal sci-fi edge. Unfortunately, despite having the likes of Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Katharine Ross, Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze in a to-die-for ensemble cast and probably the best poster of 2001 (not to mention a seriously deranged web-site), it fell by the wayside at the box office. Many blame its sort-of unintentional mirroring of September 11 for its lack of drawing power; others claim a misleading ad campaign was to blame (ignore the ""classic psychological thriller"" plaudit on the DVD sleeve); many found its similarities to Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"" and the aforementioned ""Magnolia"" too much to stand. However, there is still a lot of enjoyment to be had with watching ""Donnie"", thanks in large part to an admirably tender tone often missing in today's movies.
Kelly's script, unfortunately, does bear quite a few likenesses to Paul Thomas Anderson's three-hour opus, not least in Donnie and his psychologist, Dr. Thurman's, discussions about God, an unerringly supernatural ring to all of the preceedings and Swayze's role as a motivational speaker with some rather humiliating dark secrets (and, unfortunately, Swayze doesn't match Tom Cruise's Frank TJ Mackey for audience enrapturement). That said, ""Donnie"" trades in some David Lynch-style moments to keep the audience happy, not least in Donnie's eerie messanger, Frank, the six-foot-tall bunny rabbit. And Kelly's direction is a lot less harsh on his protagonists than Anderson's was, giving the film a more involving emotional centre than Anderson's polarising epic.
Though it doesn't match ""Magnolia's"" scale budget-wise, Kelly belies the film's average budget ($5 million) much like Darren Aronofsky did with ""Requiem For A Dream"". The film is effortlessly secured in the '80s with a very decent pop soundtrack (though lack of money prevented the filmmakers from releasing a 'various artists' soundtrack) and is very well shot by director of photography Steven Poster (particularly highlighted in Donnie's scenes with Frank in his bathroom). Kelly also manages to worm in some decent digital effects, from the ""Abyss""-style 'time spears' to the apocalyptic sky effects.
And, having gained a hell of a cast for his first feature, Kelly duly delivers on the acting front also, particularly in his lead Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal epitomises the film's sweet, moral centre as well as the thick paranoia set throughout, and emerges alongside ""Ghost World's"" Thora Birch's Enid as 2001's most beguiling teen hero. He is ably supported by the rest of the ensemble, particularly Beth Grant as gym teacher Kitty Farmer, Jena Malone as his girlfriend Gretchen and, especially, Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne as his worried parents. The character Cherita Chen, however, stole my heart shamelessly.
A lot's been made about ""Donnie's"" juggling of genres, switching quite quickly from domestic drama to black comedy to teen romance to apocalyptic sci-fi in leaps and bounds. There is no denying, though, that Kelly is a talent to watch in the future, considering the remarkable debut he's made here. The DVD, meanwhile, is crammed full of supplemental material, including two audio commentaries (one of which done by the producers and near enough the whole cast) and extensive deleted scenes featuring more substantial acting work, particularly from Drew Barrymore and Holmes Osborne.

I did watch this movie again, because this movie is a ""make you think"" movie, but you can even enjoy it without completely grasping the meaning.

1672375,4,B00005V3Z4,"This is a flawed movie that has enough moments of brilliance in it to carry you through the rest. All of the actors are fantastic in their roles (although some of the charicatures in the film remain just that, despite the good acting). Especiialy Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is brilliant -- taking up the role of a schizophrenic Holden Caulfield-type character perfectly. The story is intriguing. The directing and cinematography, brilliant.
This is a movie with great emotional punch, but which fails to come together logically in the end. It's a time-travel story with holes in it, and although the holes in logic are filled with touching, emotional moments, the holes in logic are still present.
Still, despite the logic-problems, I give it four stars because it has so many moments in it that I can personally relate to. I think anyone who remembers the confusion, ackwardness and frustration of being an adolescent should see this movie, because, truth is, Jake Gyllenhaal brings Donnie Darko to life in the moments when he seems most sane -- when he seems like a kid too smart for his own good, unsure how to deal with a world that isn't the way he would have made it, if he were in charge.
If you watch this movie and you remember those ackward adolescent moments you experienced when growing up, you'll find something in Donnie's character to which you can relate. And something in the story that touches you, in one way or other.",1019260800,,1435,4.767068273092369

Especially, I after I buy it.  Donnie Darko is the story of a teen coming face-to-face with his dark reality.  A strange bunny man visits him during his delusions with talks of time travel and mischievous acts.  Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze have minor roles in comparison to Jake Gyllenhaal's part, but all the characters have important roles.

Any way I digress,  the movie was stunning, not only visually, but conceptually.  It had a ""david lynch"" type feel to it, but easier to follow.

I won't reveal all the details of that irony for those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing it and pondering it for themselves.  What I will say is that the irony and the ""things are not as they appear"" and the ""what appears good may in actuality be a force of evil and vice versa"" themes of this film are both something that all humanity can relate to.  Sparkle Motion's talent performance is truly, on reflection and in retrospect, a celebratory moment.  The film expresses these truths in very original, thought provoking, humorous, and emotive ways.

I have not felt so in awe after a movie since Fight Club. It is just so beautiful. The camera shots, the scenery, everything is so beautiful. The mood is set so well. There is a certain ""ambience"" which the director/writer Richard Kelly (27 - 28 years old) is able to create which alternately gets you laughing, thinking, or just sends chills up and down your spine. The plot is mind blowing, really really mind blowing. So much information to process, so many mysteries, so many thoughts it is hard to say anything but ""Wow"".

1672383,5,B00005V3Z4,"This is absolutely one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen. Focusing on troubled teenager Donnie Darko, this movie is set in the month of Oct. 1988, amid the political backdrop of the Bush/Dukakis election.
Late one October night, Donnie has a dream about a six foot tall, nightmarish bunny named Frank, who tells Donnie that the world is going to end on Oct. 30. He returns home to find a jet engine lodged into his bedroom, an engine that no-one can trace.
The next day at school, Donnie encounters Gretchen, a beautiful girl with a troubled past. She and Donnie become friends.
Meanwhile, the school is preparing for a visit by a New Age philosopher named Jim Cunningham (brilliantly played by Patrick Swayze) who tells people that he can eliminate their fear.
Madness or prophecy? That's the question we are forced to ask ourselves at each turn, every time that Donnie has a vision of Frank.
Donnie confronts Jim Cunningham at a school assembly, seeing past the man's empty promises. Donnie tells Jim that he is ""the AntiChrist"".
All the while, Donnie is obsessed with the idea of time travel, fueled by a book written by a woman he knows, a woman who has told him that all creatures on this Earth will die alone.
Haunted by strange visions, Donnie is aware of the ever-approaching deadline for the end of the world, falling more and more in love with Gretchen.
I can't say much more without spoiling the ending of the film, but I will say this. Donnie Darko is a romantic suspense film about sacrifice and redemption.
And the DVD itself is full of extras, with twenty deleted scenes, a mock infomercial about Jim Cunningham and his philosophy, cast bios, a beautiful music video, and pages from the book The Philosophy of Time Travel.

I happened upon it, and read the reviews and decided to give it a shot. I am glad I did. It's eerie, creepy, beautiful, thought-provoking, stunning, striking, enchanting. I want to see more movies like this. The DVD is great and has lots of extras, including deleted scenes I would put this as a darker ""American Beauty"" with a twist of ""12 Monkeys"" and a dash of ""Harvey.""

1672391,2,B00005V3Z4,"The loss of words I'm left with after watching ""Donnie Darko"" is not one born of fascination or perplexed wonderment, but one of sheer disappointment over being cheated out of two hours of my life for a story that does everything but shove its originality down the audience's throats. A cross between science fiction, horror, and comedy, the possesses but a few fleeting moments where these elements take flight, but never once do any of them connect in a noticeable pattern.
The beginning of the film is exquisite, a terrific combination of character introductions and seething dread. We're introduced to Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a teenage boy plagued by schizophrenia and severe depression, that which causes him to converse with a abnormally large, surprisingly spooky rabbit named Frank (later revealed to be played, fittingly enough, by Gregg Araki alumnus James Duval). Such moments provide a terrific amount of underlying dread, that which perhaps causes one's expectations to elevate.
We also meet the Darko family: Donnie's parents, Eddie and Rose (Holmes Osborne, Mary McDonnell), and his two sisters, all of whom look upon Donnie as look upon Donnie as the bad seed, though hope for better days ahead. His parents are understanding of his mental state, providing him with therapy and medication; they provide him with all that he needs in hopes of reinstating his mental health.
Then one night, things get worse. After Donnie's first meeting with Frank, a freak accident involving a dismembered plane engine results in shaken nerves, though no one is hurt. Donnie, however, is told by his new imaginary friend that there is a window of 28 days, after which the world as he knows it will come to an end. He meets a girl, falls in love, all the while performing strange and sometimes shocking acts at Frank's request.
Interesting beginning, and certainly enticing enough to wet one's appetite for more. But the movie's main course turns out to be a less-than-satisfactory concoction of science fiction and the psychological, throwing things like time travel and premonitions into its already-crowded blender of potential ideas. Despite my increasing frustrations with the material's lack of coherence, I found myself strangely entranced by it, blinded by my hope that something would eventually tie things together. In the end, there is an explanation for everything, albeit a very inconsistent and ludicrously disjointed one that only furthers one's discontentment for such a wasted opportunity.
The film has a good cast in its favor, though one has to wonder how hard it is for Gyllenhaal to stare dismally into space and look continuously glum and despondent. McDonnell and Osborne play convincingly caring parents, while young Jena Malone is quite the attraction as Donnie's newly acquired girlfriend. The movie features Drew Barrymore as an English teacher who's fed up with abiding by the curriculum, and Patrick Swayze as a fear-fearing fanatic blinded by his fanaticism to his own hypocrisy.
In the beginning, I got the feeling that too much was going on; after it was over, I felt as if nothing of any significance had occurred. My main question concerning a film like ""Donnie Darko"" is this: what is this movie trying to say? What is this story really about? Do the filmmakers hope that their bleak portrayal of such cultural elements as censorship and religious fanaticism will mask their inept efforts at creating a coherent storyline that makes no sense in its conclusion?",1018224000,5,3501,5.133099824868651

Ultimately, this is an esoteric piece that will make you want to re-watch it the second it's over to try and figure it out -  la ""Sixth Sense"".  That said, it's a wonderful coming-of-age story (the likes of Salinger's ""...Rye"") of a cynical adolescent, Donnie Darko.  Donnie is a sort of a comic book high school hero, who tells everybody where to get off in such an intelligent way, that even his parents have to congratulate him on being expelled from school.
The twist that will ""knock you flat"" (as Jan Stuart of Newsday put it) is almost superfluous in light of what the rest of the film has to say for itself.  This is almost two films in one:  a highly spiritual film about time and space; destiny versus free choice - and one that is very earth-bound about having the courage to be your own person, and about questioning everything before excepting blindly.  The two themes are magnificently bound together in a visually stunning, and breathtakingly acted film.  Keep an eye out for Jake Gyllenhaal - he's right up there with Toby Maguire.

I felt there were characters in this movie which did not pertain to the main story line and added little to the plot. It took me three days to watch this film.

There were many moments in the film were I found myself going, ""Whoa,"" and I had to pause it to let my brain catch up.  As the plot deepens, you can see all of these elements and subplots coming together, and it is sometimes enough to widen your eyes and make you shiver as you see another piece of the puzzle snap into place. The film's culmination will stay with you for a long time.  It is probably one of the best films I've ever seen about time travel (and one of the best in general), and it treats the concept with intelligence and skill.

What a unique, powerful film!  This film is ultra-cool, without trying to be so.  There are elements of horror, but Donnie Darko is so much more.  There are scenes where I, a child of the 80's, laughed out loud in appreciation of references to that time.  There were times when I actually felt chills.  There were times when I was sure I knew where the film was going, only to find out I was dead wrong.  There were so many interesting subplots that were intentionally left wide open that my wife and I spent several hours talking about them before we even touched the main plot (which was left to interpretation as well).
In conclusion, this may be one of those films that you need to watch only when you are in the mood for it, but it is a film that has does not fit in any genre out there right now.  It is as unique as another great film, Memento.  And the DVD is jam-packed with cool extras.

1672398,4,B00005V3Z4,"Let me first get this part out of the way.  This movie has moments of absolute cinematic brilliance.  But, I wouldn't leave it at that.  Calling this a great film would lead to a lot of disappointment because it has some serious flaws, not the least of which are plot contrivances that simply don't work.  It is as if the writers wanted to squeeze too many ideas into a single film, and then couldn't intelligently wrap up the many loose ends.  The film's ideas are oftentimes terrific, but they pull the viewer in too many different directions and end with a far more ""conventional"" and unsatisfying conclusion for all the effective build-up.
What I liked most about the film was its ability to depict a nuanced view of psychosis.  It is perhaps the best cinematic portrayal of a schizophrenic mind that I've ever seen, and in some ways reminded me of Polanski's ""Repulsion.""  Unfortunately, rather than playing to this strength, the movie then attempts to ""explain"" the psychotic state through a somewhat silly ""Carlos Castaneda"" explanation of secret knowledge, emanations from the solar plexus, time travel, and extradimensional physics.  The lovely ambiguities of the first three-quarters of the film melt away into time-looping conventionality, with a lot of inexplicable throwaway issues.  (The burning down of the ""positive thinking"" guru's house is a good example.  We're never given any clues as to why the future is informing the present about his involvement in a child pornagraphy ring--and directing him to burn the house down.  Kept more ambiguous, the event would have had far greater and more interesting significance.)
With the exception of Drew Barrymore, the performances are top knotch.  Barrymore comes across as a not very bright person overacting and just catching a superficial layer of her character--a character that seems to be a bit of a throwaway in any event.  I think Jake Gyllenhaal is someone to watch.
Get this DVD, and think of it as a first draft by an extremely talented novelist.  Lots to savor and enjoy, even if it is a bit messy.",1017878400,6,2071,4.9479768786127165
1672399,5,B00005V3Z4,"This is without a doubt the best film I saw this past year. Now, that might not seem like great praise in such a weak year, however it was meant to be. This film is hard to describe, because there is so much going on. Part drama, part science fiction, part romance, part horror and part comedy. A very ambitious project and you cannot help but respect that.
The story centers around a very intelligent high school student named Donnie Darko. Donnie has what is described as ""intimidating intelligence"" and borderline schizophrenia. One night, Donny is summoned outside by a demonic rabbit. Later that night, an engine drops off of a jet and lands in Donnie's room. Had Donny been there, he would have been dead. Was he destined to die that night? The rabbit continues to visit Donny and give him instructions. Donny senses that his life is taking on dramatic changes. Donny starts to question fate and freewill. Was he destined to die that night or is there no such thing as fate? Is the rabbit real? Is he in fact going mad? Will the world end, like the rabbit tells him it will? I think that by trying to describe this film, I will confuse you, so I will stop. However, I will conclude by saying that this film ranks right up there with the best film debuts ever. The writing is intelligent and the direction expert. The film will challenge you to expand your mind and will stay with you for a long time. I think the film was marketed rather poorly. This is not ""Final Destination,"" but more like ""Memento."" It also has a great soundtrack!

Like many of the reviewers here I am baffled by the films weak release in the theaters. I do think it was marketed ineffectively.  The trailer was limp, the posters lackluster, the release limited, before a lively buzz could get started it was gone from the theaters etc...

I'm sure this film was made on a small budget, but there isn't anything small about the aspirations of the director, writer, and the cast and production staff.  This is a high quality film with a dynamite script.
Part ""The World According to Garp,"" part ""Evil Dead,"" and part ""American Beauty"" this film is really indescribable in the best sense of the word.
Donnie is a troubled boy who needs to be medicated...Only when Donnie is medicated he sees and hears a demonic version of ""Harvey"" the rabbit.  Donnie's life becomes a series of strange encounters that he is witness to/or is he responsible for?  Donnie starts to fear the latter of the two.
""Darko"" makes me think that I caught a conversation in the middle without knowing the beginning or end.  I don't like a steady diet of films of this nature, but I was apparently in the mood for this one and I found it very satisfying as it left me wanting to rewatch the film and see if I'd really understood it.",1017705600,2,1119,4.391304347826087
1672402,4,B00005V3Z4,"I have read several reviews that said that ""Donnie Darko' is difficult to classify; indeed, it is composed of an exotic blend of sci-fi, horror, teen angst, and comedy, all seasoned with bits of physics and philosopy, While not a perfectly realized film, it is the kind of movie that many people, myself included, wish there were more of. These are ones that pose challenging or interesting questions, then ususally leave it up to the viewer to come up with answers. Often, there are no real answers, of course, but the thought process is definately stimulated. I appreciate that. I suppose that ""Donnie Darko' is best recommended to people who do not like pat answers.
This is the story of a boy who is suffering from some major mental problems. He hallucinates, often seeing a hideous, man-sized bunny rabbit which commands him to commit all sorts of anti-social acts. He thinks he can see a sort of time travel path leading people on to whatever is next in store for them. He believes the world is about to end. Is Donnie insane, or has he stumbled upon some truith about existence? Is he a victim of the American upper-middle class lifestyle, one which truly does have some 'Alice Through the Looking-glass' elements to it, or is he more highly evolved than those around him? Did the world, in fact, end, as Donnie foresaw? An Edgar Allen Poe quote came to mind near the film's end: ""Perchance everything we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.'
What I can't describe here are the visuals, which are fascinating. Perhaps it was just my imagination, but it seemed as if every scene had a slight dream-like quality to it, implying that everything I was seeing could be either a memory or a fantasy about some future event.
Richard Kelly has the right stuff to become a major new force in movies. I have been convinced of Jake Gyllenhall's tremendous acting skills since 'October Sky', another highly recommended movie.
NOTE: I gave 'Danny Darko' four stars. My real rating is 4 1/2. I had a problem with the path and development of one character [Roberta Sparrow], and this prevented my giving it 5 stars.",1017532800,7,2113,4.6675603217158175

He's being visited by a 6ft rabbit with a reptilian feel to the face, and he's finding out about time travel as well as going through the motions of highschool in 1988 (great soundtrack by the way).  Along the way we meet a self help guru who well... isn't Tony Roberts by any means, a bible thumping teacher, his psychiatrist, his parents who are the coolest parents, and his two sisters as well as his new girlfriend who just moved into the neighborhood.

Rich parents, a beautiful home, an exclusive private school where the students openly do cocaine in the halls, Drew Barrymore as an English professor and a $200 an hour analyst. In the movies, such a privileged, complacent milieu is bound to weather some unsettling moments, and Donnie soon meets up with a mysterious benefactor -- a six-foot tall man in a bunny costume with a skull face named ""Frank."" Frank comes to Donnie in a dream state, and saves him from a freak accident. Such a favor can't go unpaid, and soon ""Frank"" has Donnie running errands -- and the mystery deepens.
Surrealistic and dream-like, ""Donnie Darko"" weaves in a lot of elements that intentionally don't all add up. Time travel, teen angst, apocalyptic visions, madness, budding sexuality and eye-popping special effects find their way into this tantalizing rabbit stew. Set in 1988, the soundtrack offers sing-along favorites such as Tears for Fears ""Head Over Heels"" and ""Mad World"" along with hairstyles that will make many older audience members cringe in recognition. In addition, Patrick Swayze plays a motivational speaker who spouts mixture of Reagan conservatism and Nietzchean ruthlessness. Like most everybody else in the movie, he harbors a very, very dark secret.
""Donnie Darko"" wears a lot pop culture references on its sleeve. Even the least astute will pick up on the references to ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Harvey"" this cursory summary mentions. Eagle-eyed viewers will spot the sly nods to Swayze's ""Footloose"" and have a good chuckle over the very unlikely double feature of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead playing with Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" playing at a near-empty theater!

While some reviewers have complained that Darko borrows elements from other movies, I don't think this movie is merely a sum of it's parts and I think it's ridiculous to accuse it of doing something that all fiction has been guilty of since hunters told stories around camp-fires. There are few stories, and it's the way they are told that make them stand out.
While watching DD, I was constantly reminded of another movie I saw earlier this year...I find it difficult to believe that Ghost World was nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay while Donnie Darko was completely snubbed in every category. I loved Donnie Darko for all the same reasons I hated Ghost World. While Ghost World seems to celebrate apathy and selfishness (to me anyway), Donnie Darko rages against it.
What's most striking to me about Darko is that on the surface it's dark, twisted, disturbing and even a little depressing, but beneath the surface it really does celebrate life. I described it to one friend as ""12 Monkeys"" meets ""It's a Wonderful LIfe"" with an evil bunny rabbit. Ok, maybe that's stretching things a bit, but while most people will fail to see anything other than another dark, sci-fi, time travel movie, the open minded viewer will be deeply rewarded... Donnie eventually discovers the beauty and joy of life against inhuman odds. Life is finite, fleeting and precious, and Donnie represents those fortunate few who discover this in time to appreciate it even in complete defiance to the horrors he witnesses. It's easy to be positive when life is a bowl of cherries, but to delve into the darkness and emerge with hope takes real courage.",1017014400,,1784,4.795454545454546

Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is given a four week head's up of the impending doom for Earth. His imaginary friend Frank lets him know, he's the 6 feet tall terrifying monster bunny in the mirror that no one but Donnie can see.  Even though he's heavily medicated, in therapy, and risking the wrath of his family, Donnie takes Frank the Bunny's advice unconditionally.  He feels he owes it to Frank, he saved his life after all.  His first piece of advice proved dead on, to leave his home in the middle of the night, which prevents Donnie from of all things, being smooshed by a giant jet engine which falls mysteriously to earth and crashes into his bedroom.

""Donnie Darko"" certainly may not be the feel good movie of the year nor was it a blockbuster hit.  It is now my favorite movie.
Why?  Well, first off, it is unique and I am so tired of the usual romantic comedy or the formulatic action/adventure that has come out in the past year.  2001 had so many movies come out of it that i just did not care for.  This film is one of the select few that really moved me and made me think and was also very intensly entertaining.  If you are of the group of people that just wants to have some silly laughs or want something light and airy, this isn't a movie for you.  I do often like to laugh, and did find myself laughing a few times at this movie, but it is so original>  It's a beautiful story that is told through Donnie's mind.
Secondly, the acting is brilliant.  Jake Gyllenhaal, also of the moronic ""Bubble Boy"", is utterly amazing and so in tune to his character, Donnie Darko.  It's as if the character was written for him.  The expressions he makes often appear a bit creepy, but he isn't supposed to be competely sane.  Donnie is, however, a good person, and Jake makes him seem so real and true.  I pay a great deal of attention to what the characters say and do in movies, and I think that Donnie Darko is one of the greatest characters ever written.  Sure he may have some emotional problems, but he is a nice guy who in some respect is willing to do anything for someone he loves.  The film itself is set in October 1988, and Donnie, who is on medication for emotional problems, has this very frightening and menacing looking bunny rabbitt called Frank come to him into a dream.
Frank makes Donnie do things, things that maybe in Donnie's mind may seem like the right thing to do but aren't; however, he feels there is some justification in doing them.  While he may feel this way, his school(except for one teacher, played by Drew Barrymore), and the self-help preaching Jim Cunningham, played by Patrick Swayze do not.
Talk about the 80's!! Swayze hasn't been in much since those days.
Drew Barrymore is the worst thing about this movie.  Is her character supposed to be acted so badly? I have never particularly liked her as an actress.  She was born into an acting family, and I think it is the name that has gotten her into films.  She is the executive producer of Donnie Darko, and I think that they just gave her a role in this because of that reason.  She plays Donnie's English teacher, and while her acting is pretty bad, the character is one that Donnie actually appreciates and to some extent admires.
Mary McDonnell, who's most celebrated work is in Passion Fish, plays Mrs. Rose Darko.  She is very good in this and convincing as the mother who feels as if she hasn't done a good job as mother to Donnie.
Katharine Ross plays the therapist that Donnie goes to.  She takes the role seriously, and plays it very well yet subdued.
No real other names stick out for me in the acting category, but all of the actors and actresses are all very good in this.  They all work very well together.
My other reason this is a favorite of mine is that it is set in the 1980's, which is my generation.  I was in junior high and high school then and this brings back great memories for me.
I think they could have made more use of 80's music in the film.  The only song I recognized is Tears for Fears, ""Head over Heels"".
The main reason I call this favorite is because of it's originality and it's message.  I paid very close attention to Donnie and what he says throughout the film, and I found the message to be a bit complex and hard to understand what was going on until the end.  That is all I will say.
One really must take this movie with a complete open mind.  I really can't classify this film into one genre, it is a bit science fiction with it's subplot about time travel, but there is so much to this movie it's just hard to classify for those who contemplate watching it.  If you are up for something completely different and go into it with a mind wide open, I think you will be very pleasantly surprised.
This is a sad, demented at times, powerful, and thought provoking film that was so overlooked while in theaters.  It never came anywhere near me on the big screen, only in Cambridge.
I rented the dvd, which was so amazingly well done.  I watched a lot of the extras, for fans of the film, it is worth buying with all the extra goodies such as deleted scenes with audio commentary.  I, myself, like to watch with the commentary on after viewing the movie as it brings me into a deeper understanding of what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish.",1016755200,,5151,4.353556485355648
1672413,5,B00005V3Z4,"Donnie Darko is a film that will have you thinking about it weeks after you first saw it. This film is incredible in the way it makes you doubt. I still don't know if Donnie was mentally ill or the world was acually falling apart around him. I would recomend to see the DVD of this film because there are loads of deleted scenes that will further explain the characters, not to mention the two commentaries included which also might answer some questions. But expect one thing about this film; you most likely will NEVER be able to find solid answers to all the questions you will have after watching it. It was made to be open to interpretation.
One thing that really suprised me about this film was it's special effects, for an independant film the effects are the best I've seen so far. I would recommend this movie to people who like dark strange films like Heathers, Being John Malkovich, Magnolia, American Beauty, ect...
I am looking foward to the next film Richard Kelly makes.",1016755200,,985,4.570621468926554

7955915,3,B00005V3Z4,"I hate to give this only 3 stars, because Donnie Darko is my favorite movie, but I give it 3 stars because I got nowhere near close to what I expected. I thought I ordered the special edition reissue with both cuts of the film (theatrical and director's cuts) and additional artwork, including a poster. I only payed 22 bucks I believe, so I thought it was a steal for such a great movie with those kind of extras. What I actually got, though, is what seems like the standard release on Blu Ray, with deleted scenes with commentary, a documentary, a short film by Richard Kelly from 1996, and 2 audio commentaries over the movie. Really I'm disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is cool, but I just expected a lot more. I'll probably just end up keeping this (in fact I definitely am) and ordering the director's cut separately. So yeah, I recommend the movie, definitely. But try to get it from Walmart or Target or somewhere that sells it cheaper, and where you can see what you're actually buying.",1524441600,,1001,4.5054945054945055

Aside from some entertaining shock value, mostly in crude remarks from a teenager, it wasn't all that good with a stupid wake-up ending showing it actually had nowhere to go. The sound quality sucked, so I started watching it over with captions turned on, and they mostly fell below screen level and were unreadable, so I turned it off deciding it was too stupid and pointless to watch again, even it the sound was slightly better by choosing Surround Sound.",1524096000,,526,4.855555555555555
