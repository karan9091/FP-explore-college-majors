516683,4,6302801117,"It's been said that nobody deliberately sets out to make a bad movie. Based on a novel of the same name and with character names like Dove Linkhorn and Kitty Twist, ""Walk on the Wild Side"" kind've makes me wonder. Set in the ""early thirties"", it tells of Texan Dove (Laurence Harvey) on the road to New Orleans to find his lost love, sculptress Hallie (Capucine). He hooks up with been-around runaway Kitty Twist (Jane Fonda). They meet good-hearted cafe owner Teresina (Anne Baxter---with a not very convincing Mexican accent) and Dove discovers Kitty is a thief so he ditches her. Teresina gives Dove work and helps him with a newspaper ad to locate Hallie. After a suspicious phone call (that sounds like Kitty) tips Dove off to Hallie's whereabouts, he finally finds her. She's living off brothel owner/vice queen Jo Courtney (Barbara Stanwyck) and works in Jo's ""Doll House"" in the French Quarter. But good ole boy that he is, he doesn't catch on. Kitty turns up as a new ""doll"" and things begin to unravel leading to scandal and tragedy. The performances are rather good even if Capucine seems a bit too classy and patrician to be a fallen woman. The dialogue is ripe and I loved one line a drunken street preacher shouts at Capucine, ""You hip-slingin' daughter of Satan!"" I can't really call this a bad movie. I enjoyed it despite the obvious plot contrivances and recommend it to those who enjoy somewhat trashy but interesting melodramas. The title sequences by Saul Bass are cool and Brook Benton sings the title song performed in the ""Doll House"". For some, this will be a good DVD find.",1076889600,16,1598,4.710714285714285

516687,5,6302801117,"Last evening, I skipped the traditional televised holiday fare and watched Edward Dmytryk's ""Walk On The Wild Side"" (Columbia Pictures, 1962).  Let's just say that the next time you're having friends over for melba toast and you're looking for the perfect over-the-top extravaganza to project on to the living room wall, this should be the featured attraction.  Barbara Stanwyck is the lesbian owner of a New Orleans brothel known as ""The Doll House.""  Glamorous Capucine (a 60's version of Garbo)is the most popular call girl since Holly Golightly and coveted by both her butch madame and a drifter named Dove (not kidding) played by the inscrutable Laurence Harvey.  Add a youthful Jane Fonda (in her bulimic period) and a miscast Anne Baxter as a Mexican diner owner (cascading dark wig, inauthentic accent and all) and you've got one mesmerically curious flick.  Oh, did I forget to mention that the entire thing kicks off with a title sequence in which two felines (one black, one white) engage in a vicious catfight punctuated by Elmer Bernstein's pulsating jazz score?

Despite Mr. Harvey's and Ms. Baxter's seriously contrived ""accents"" (texan and mexican respectively), the movie is very watchable.

Laurence Harvey, gifted, elegant, articulate  (Hebraic and English/Luithanian) is miscast a bit and asked to play a Texas  farmer of high morals seeking lost love in a den of iniquity, the Big Easy,  encounters beauty after beauty who adore and want him whom he spurns for  his lost love!

It begins with a black cat walking along a floor. [Symbolism?] Then two cats fight. There is a lone highway in Texas in the early thirties, a man tries to get a ride. Night falls, he meets a woman who is hungry. They hop a freight train to travel, then jump off before it reaches the station. They are going to New Orleans. They talk about their life. Then they go to a diner for food. [No fly paper in use?] After the woman pulls a trick to burglarize the owner. Dove Linkhorn returns a stolen item and is offered a job. Time passes. Hally goes to the defense of a co-worker. Oliver is needed for the business. The story plods on. Dove gets a telephone call telling him where to find Hally (the Quarter). Has too much changed over three years? Hally is advised against her dreams of marriage to that dirt farmer!

But she meets Dove again at a furnished apartment. Disappointed, Dove creates a disturbance back at work. Hally continues at her work. Dove goes to that house and meets Kitty. Later Kitty is questioned. Dove returns to meet Hally and meets her in her room for business. Jo, the business owner, will try to stop Hally from leaving. Jo talks to her crippled husband. When Dove returns they threaten him with criminal prosecution! Jo offers a deal to Hally. But Dove refuses the deal, is assaulted and dragged away. Kitty calls a Doctor for him. Hally is notified. Kitty starts a fight with another girl, and Hally runs out. Hally refuses to go back to Jo. Oliver finds Dove sick in bed. There is a fight, Oliver fires a shot and hits Hally! The newspaper says Doll House Crowd Convicted. And the story ends.

The book must have been better than the movie. This is a good example of a movie that wastes the viewers time. It must have been a failure because of the characters and story, too unbelievable.

She's a thief, a con artist and ends up being a prostitute in this one.  Barbara Stanwyck is especially fascinating in this movie.  She's the madame running a bordello.  She seems to have a very special relationship with Capucine, the most popular hooker in her bordello.  Are they lovers?  Were they once lovers?

516727,5,6302801117,"Critic Bosley Crowther panned director Edward Dmytryk's ""Walk on the Wild Side"" unmercifully upon its release in 1962. I loved the film when I first saw it many years ago.  It has stayed on my mind, but I only saw it again today, when it was presented on full screen at the American Film Institute.  The AFI has honored Fonda with its 2014 ""Lifetime Achievement Award"" and is holding a retrospective of her movies at its lovely Washington, D.C. area theater.  ""Walk on the Wild Side"" was Fonda's first major screen role.  She received a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer.  Fonda plays a spitfire young prostitute, Kitty Twist.

Bosley Crowther's strictures on this ""Lurid, Tawdry, and Sleazy Melodrama"" have not changed my feelings about this raw film, which combines the work of two famous American writers. The film was loosely based on a novel by Nelson Algren.  The American novelist John Fante, the author of ""Ask the Dust"" wrote the screenplay with participation by Edward Morris and Ben Hecht. The movie captures the shady, violent low world of the French Quarter of New Orleans during the Depression.

The movie is best-known for its opening sequence with a menacing black cat and his fight with another stray as the credits roll and the film's theme song plays. Sam Bass directed this sequence and a follow-up at the conclusion of the film.  Brook Benton sings the title song. The musical score of the film captures the feel of a New Orleans bawdy house where much of the action takes place.

The film tells the story of a young Texas farmer, Dove Linkhorn, (Laurence Harvey) who hitches and hops trains to New Orleans in search of his long-lost love Hallie Gerard (Cappucine). In the course of his trip, he meets-up with another wanderer, Kitty Twist (Jane Fonda) seeking the opportunity for fortune in New Orleans. Dove resists Kitty's advances during the course of their travel together.  Eventually, Kitty winds up working for the Doll House, an establishment in which, as it happens, Hallie Gerard has become the most coveted attraction. Barbara Stanwix plays the sinister madam, Jo Courtney, who wants to have a relationship with Hallie. This was one of the first explicit portrayals of lesbianism in American film.

The film centers upon Dove's and Hallie's effort to rekindle their relationship after many years and after Hallie's life has so changed in character. She had dreams of becoming an artist and still tries to do sculpture in her spare time.  Dove is ardent and forbearing while Hallie tries to warn him off.  The movie builds to a violent denouement featuring three of the Doll House's vicious henchmen, including Jo's crippled husband.

I was moved to see ""Walk on the Wild Side"" again after many years. Whatever some may think, I love the film. It still has a sense of toughness and sleaze combined with a feeling of love and vulnerability. It depicts almost hopelessly lost, unredeemed individuals in an underside of American life.  I would eagerly watch the film again.

516729,3,6302801117,"Don't walk - run the other way. This long, tedious film is nothing more than a laborious trashy soap opera. How did Laurence Harvey ever get a leading role? It's about a drifter who falls in love with an exotic beauty (France's Capucine - real name Germaine Lefebvre  -  later committed suicide) whom he is devastated to discover later is a prostitute. Harvey and Capucine are both ludicrous, unsexy and wooden, with no chemistry together. There are two reasons to watch this turgid melodrama  -  Barbara Stanwyck huskily and hilariously playing the lesbian madam of the brothel (and in love with Capucine) and Anne Baxter as a Mexican saloon owner. Jane Fonda plays a down on her luck drifter who drifts into Babs's harem. She's pretty. Pretty unconvincing. This was made by stolid, heavy handed Hollywood director Edward Dmytryck in 1962.

516740,2,6302801117,"Maybe I'm dense, but I really have no idea what this film is about. Academy Award Winner Anne Baxter , who was Frank LLoyd Wright's Grandaughter is here, cast as a Latina! Couldn't they get Rita Moreno?

French actress/model Capucine plays a call girl. She looks like a young Joan Crawford without the talent and she can't overcome her European accent.

Lawrence Harvey is a young cowboy. The English actor was always obviously Gay, so how could he be expected to portray a man obsessed with a woman?

A gorgeous young Jane Fonda plays a two-bit tramp and she's the best thing in this movie. No offense intended.

Barbara Stanwyck plays - get this - a Lesbian Madame obsessed with one of the girls in her stable (Capucine). I think this role is what gave Stanwyck the undeserved reputation as a closeted Lesbian.

Joanna Moore plays a prostitute with a child-like mentality, another good performance.

If what I have been saying makes no sense to you, neither will this movie. Any references to Lesbianism or prostitution or sex in general have been excised from the script which left me scratching my head in puzzlement. The best thing about this movie is Brook Benton's rendition of the Title Song. Other reviewers have suggested that the movie is miscast (true) and that it strays too far from the book on which it was based. There was a book? I guess I'll have to read it.

516748,3,6302801117,"what to say, what to say?

saul bass' work on the main title sequence is among his finest--easily!  it is singularly striking and dramatic but it is also a little misleading if a viewer were to think that the cat is symbolic of the film's main character, dove linkhorn.

linkhorn, as played by laurence harvey, is actually quite the gentle man.  not at all what is expected to follow his wonderful performances in 'room at the top' and 'summer and smoke' as the model sexy anti-hero.  harvey, in his own unique way, reminds me of jude law.  he's easy on the eye yet complex at the same time.  he was definitely not the decorous callow leading man type of his time.

linkhorn is on a trek from texas to find his lady love hallie gerard (capucine). on the way, he encounters kitty twist (jane fonda), a teenage vagrant and together they make the last leg of the trek to new orleans. this is the film's most lively sequence.  fonda is magical as kitty. though she had debuted in her godfather's film version of 'tall story' two years before this film, kitty is pretty much her debut.  words just can't express how fully invested she is in her performance--not to mention that she is incredibly sexy in her clingy costumes--especially in the scenes where she must deal with being rebuffed by harvey.

fonda and harvey are matched by barbara stanwyck as jo courtney, the cold and ruthless madam of the dollhouse where kitty and hallie work as bar girls.  stanwyck's character is one of the least sympathetic women i've ever seen.  she thinks nothing of any man in her path--they're pawns and nothing more--and if they get in her way, she will destroy them as easily as pulling from a cigarette. even worse, if they do her bidding, which runs the gamut from spying for her to beating up the unfaithful bar girls, she is contemptuous of them.  it is hard to feel sorry for her as she pines for hallie but i did--almost.

but part of the reason why it is hard to feel for stanwyck's jo is because hallie, as played by capucine, is an unrealized woman.  she is beautiful in a hawklike way and it stands a marked contrast to the piquant facial features of harvey, fonda and stanwyck. and she is trying to infuse this woman with something because hallie is complicated.  but she is confused and that is a real shame.  because she has her moments, particularly her death scene.  it is very starkly played.

the lack of clarity in capucine's performance comes from the fact that the film was released in 1962. if the film could have flatly stated she, kitty and precious were whores, she would be more understandable. (fonda and the vixenish joanna moore don't have this problem)  had it been pre-code or mpaa, produced charles feldman and director edward dimitryk would not have been so ambiguous about the dollhouse or hallie's place there. clarity, not implication, would have been the order with these people, where they live and what they do. then, as much as i like anne baxter, a latina actress could have played teresina and no one would have cared. and maybe, period detail would have been more concise and clearly said 1930s, not the early 1960s mish-mish period films tended to be at that time.

this is a film to see if you like fonda, harvey, stanwyck or saul bass.  and this is a film to hear if you like elmer bernstein. they will keep you involved.",1242518400,,3351,4.566889632107023
516749,5,6302801117,"It was a rainy night at the Paramount Theater in Provo Utah 47 years ago when I first saw this flick. Back then, aside from the dynamite Elmer Bernstein score, I found it vague and mostly unfathomable. But I'm older and hopefully wiser now, and life has taught me some lessons. WALK ON THE WILD SIDE is razor sharp and focused. The black-cat-on-the-prowl opening and closing credit sequences are electrifying. And the Bernstein score (with interspersed vocals by Brook Benton) is - to THESE ears - even more powerful and affecting dynamite now than that which exploded into my consciousness years past, as in ""somewhere in the used-to-be"".",1241913600,4,639,4.925925925925926
516750,2,6302801117,"First of all, just to clear the boards, this really can't be considered an adaptation of Nelson Algren's novel. Although it flirts with some taboo subjects, things never get beyond mere flirtation. And, given Kennedy-era year it was made, it's impossible to expect a faithful depiction of the text from that time and place.

Laurence Harvey's lovesick Dove Linkhorn arrives in New Orleans searching for the gal that stole his heart. Complications arrive in that the ""gal"" is a) now a popular and highly-paid prostitute in a brothel called The Doll House and b) she's played by Capucine, who is absolutely captivitating in her beauty and refinement but, as such, also mindbogglingly miscast. It's difficult to imagine her Hallie and Harvey's Linkhorn ever sharing a passing conversation, much less a small-town romance.

For his part, Harvey -- whose strange intensity usually gives me the willies and/or leaves me cold -- manages to make for an interesting Texas drifter even though he constantly seems to be playing a character far younger than his age. He projects an oddly likeable nobility through, especially during a confrontation with a storefront preacher.

Barbara Stanwyk gets props for playing an out-of-the-closet lesbian -- which is the movie's prime claim to fame -- but her portrayal is a bit of a Model-T. Nowadays, her attempts to control and possess Hallie seems to have more to do with grouchiness than the desire that dare not speak its name.

A very young Jane Fonda stands out in the juicy role of Kitty, a hitch hiker Dove falls in with. Even as she morphs from Depression-era scamp to full-bosomed harlot to call-girl-in-training, she still seems the realest thing onscreen.

After giving a nod to the great black-and-white cinematography, and the style and compositions of the shots, I have to point out that ""Walk"" has some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a major motion picture that's otherwise confident and assured. Takes go on forever, past the point of monotony; there are lots of strange and unnecessary cuts and cut-aways, and it all feels about an hour longer than it should be.

When the big denouement comes -- involving two men who struggle with a gun that shoots the wrong person, and summarized by a quickie epilogue (delivered by way of a windblown newspaper headline) -- there's a suspicion that the film has walked *up to* the wild side, but hasn't fully crossed that crucial border.",1184716800,5,2432,4.948529411764706
516751,4,6302801117,I first saw this film many years ago on TV & always remembered the soundtrack and the nobility of the hero's quest. Its an excellent and bizarre Southern melodrama with  great performances by a very young Jane Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck. The music and credit sequences are outstanding by any standards.

516752,4,6302801117,"When Hollywood attempted to loosen the strictures of the Hays code in the 50s and 60s it often turned to the Southern Gothic as a way for testing permissibility because everything they hinted at could easily be chalked up to Southern decadence; this 1962 Edward Dymytryk melodrama is based on a Nelson Algren novel, but it plays like something by Tennessee Williams. A handsome Texas ""dirt farmer"" searches New Orleans high and low during the Depression for his lost sweetheart from back in the Lone Star state, unaware that she has become the kept woman for the mistress of the toniest and most corrupt bordello in the French Quarter; he is aided in his quest by a runaway juvenile and a Mexican-American caf&eacute; owner, both of whom yearn for him but realize the nobility of his quest. Columbia cast almost every one of these characters wildly against both type and nationality, with Laurence Harvey as the Texan, Capucine as his sweetheart, Barbara Stanwyck (honking Brooklyn accent and all) as the New Orleans madam, and Anne Baxter as the Mexican-American; everyone seems to be taking their parts very seriously, but only Baxter succeeds with her accent (she and Jane Fonda, as the wayward juvenile, seem to be the only two having any fun at all). The film is worth seeing if only for its beautiful camerawork, particularly in the bordello, and for its famous score by Elmer Bernstein and credit sequence by Saul Bass.",1182556800,7,1426,4.872427983539095
516753,5,6302801117,"I'd rate this 4.2 stars but gave it 5 above to encourage buyers to support DVD manufacturing of smaller, more obscure titles.  Consumers need more rarities to continue to surface :)
 Interesting film with a young Jane Fonda very effective in a supporting role, she's terrific as the immoral, thieving temptress from Hell.  I disagree with a previous Amazon review; Fonda's Southern accent works just fine in the context of the film. Certainly, she was young enough here to portray a just-about-legal sociopath. The film could have used even more of Fonda than the screen-time she has, in my opinion.
 Anne Baxter is very interesting and takes chances outside of the comfort zone which many film stars tend to cling to; not all of her choices necessarily work, but she's victorious, overall, and creates a memorable, likeable characterization. Hers, too, is a supporting role, though somewhat larger than Fonda's.
 In yet another striking supporting performance in the film, Barbara Stanwyck was years ahead of her time (as is the film) in portraying a lesbian character; she's believable- complex, dangerous, sad, lonely, corrupt, all-the-while dealing with unrequited love as the proprietor of a New Orleans brothel.  Ultimately, the film chooses to characterize her as a hardened, ""bad"" woman due to her sexuality, likely the 'Hayes Code' wouldn't allow 1962 American cimema to show a 'good' lesbian.
The male lead, Laurence Harvey, is sympathetic and the 'hero' of the piece, searching in New Orleans for a lost-love he hopes to find, with Capucine the object of his affection in her not-bad/not-great portrayal of an indifferent woman who is 'kept' by Stanwyck.
Stunningly memorable opening credits with an incredible black cat lurking about, with director Edward Dmytryk actually getting the cat to give a conscious performance (!) taking a 'walk on the wild wide'. Okay, that sounds loopy, but the cat definitely appears aware of being photographed and filmed. An artful, great opening sequence, judge for yourselves :)
 Buy it before it goes out of print. A great looking, stylized 'seedy movie' with a lot to appreciate along with its imperfections.
For those who like their DVD collections to be electic, this one's a keeper. The movie-poster-quality photo of Jane Fonda on the dvd cover also is on the disc itself, minus the cat-eyes behind her.
You won't easily find this movie in stores or in the used bins, thank you Amazon! I bought it 13 months ago, then re-watched it this week, and I look forward to revisiting it again in the future.
A final note of possible interest is that actress Joanna Moore, who the following year would give birth to Tatum O'Neal, has a small role in which she has her moments.  You can see more than a bit of the late actress in Tatum's current television work, in both looks and performance, she seems to be more-so her mother's, than Ryan's daughter.",1170547200,6,2895,4.979296066252588
516754,1,6302801117,"What were they thinking???  This is one of the most poorly cast movies in the history of Hollywood.  Laurence Harvey is supposed to be a Texan, but he doesn't look like a cowboy/farmer and can't do the accent.  Jane Fonda is supposed to be a 16 year old Texan, but she doesn't look 16 and can't do the accent either.  Anne Baxter is supposed to be a Mexican -- yeah, right.  And we're supposed to believe that Barbara Stanwyck, with her New York accent, runs a New Orleans Cat House?  Puh-leeez!!!  There's not one genuine southern accent in the entire film.  The story is totally uninvolving, the characters are unbelievable and, except for Baxter, unsympathetic.  The direction is all over the place, and the art direction fails to evoke the 1930s.  Don't waste your time or money on this misbegotten abortion.",1142467200,8,812,4.695035460992908
516755,4,6302801117,"Elmer Bernstein's beautiful Jazz theme and Saul Bass' sensuously lyric opening credits set the tone for this tale of Dove Linkhorn and his search for his lost love Hallie Gerard through the tough underbelly of 1930's New Orleans. These opening shots of a back cat prowling through an alley are justifiably considered one of the best credit sequences ever filmed. Cinematically sublime and well worth the viewing.

  What follows is a high melodrama set in a brothel called the Doll House, where Dove, Hallie, Kitty and Madame Jo Courtney meet their various tragic ends. As directed by once black listed director Edward Dmytryk ""Walk on the Wild Side"" is a full-blown old style drama that is chock full of finely tuned old style performances.

  Cast against character Laurence Harvey as Dove tackles his roll as a love sick Texas cowboy with more than his usual cool approach. He manages a plausible Texas accent and turns Dove into a man of fire and misguided passion. He makes it believable that he is the kind of guy that the women he meets with the exception of Barbara Stanwyck find it hard to resist. This is no mean feat for the thin aristocratic British actor.

  French beauty Capucine seems almost too refined at first to play Hallie the artistic and wounded object of Dove's affection. But as the film progresses she delivers just the right blend of tragedy and pathos of a girl lost in the world of prostitution.

  The accomplished Anne Baxter makes her presence known as Teresina Vidaverri the Mexican caf owner who helps Dove and along the way also falls for him. Miscast in an age when Hollywood had most major roles of Latinos played by non-Latinos she is tough, tender and manages to be believable in the role.

  Jane Fonda appears as the spurned bad girl Kitty. She walks the wild side with abandon and shows her range as an actress in this, one of her early rolls. Sexy, slinky and utterly rotten her Kitty is pure fun as in her desperation for Dove's affections carries the turn of events for him and Hallie to damnation and loss.

  When Barbara Stanwyck comes on the screen she steals the picture out from under all concerned as Jo the lesbian Madame who looses her cool over her unrequited passion for Hallie. It is a classic Stanwyck performance full of all the power and history of this great American star. In her speech to Hallie about what love is she shines as she reveals her own tragic past. This was the first American film to show a lesbian on the screen and Stanwyck presents us with a real woman full of strengths and flaws that is much more than one would expect from a gay character in mainstream Hollywood of 1962.

  Joseph MacDonald captures all the heat and steam of New Orleans with his shimmering black and white cinematography. The out of time early 60's costumes by Charles La Maire are stunning in their range from rags to high class call girl glamour. Bernstein's wonderful score is one of his best and adds the right touch of jazzy glitz to the drama.

  ""Walk on the Wild Side"" is one hell of a ride and well worth the admission price to the Doll House.",1123372800,55,3104,4.5916515426497275
516756,4,6302801117,"I think Quentin Terintino should remake this tale of desperate behavior in the depression era. Jane Fonda---at the peak of her youthful beauty--plays an alleycat that hitches a ride from Texas to New Orleans with good-guy ""Dove"" but is unable to seduce him. Dove, you see, is on a quest to find Hallie, his lost love who is rumored to be in the city.

When Jane and Dove fall off the back of their haywagon outside the city, they first stop at a roadside diner  run by none other than Anne Baxter as a Mexicana hash-slinger, whom Janes rips off with her ""your chili almost killed me and I'm going to sue you unless this meal is free"" scam. Jane grabs Anne's rosary on the way out just for good measure!

Unbeknownst to Dove, Hallie has gone wayward and become a prostitute under the watchful (and jealous) tutelage of Barbara Stanwyk as the butch Madame ""Jo"".  (Indeed, one of the funniest lines of dialogue is when  a john refers to Stanwyk as ""that Joe guy""!)  When Dove finally finds Hallie working at the brothel, the fireworks really begin, as Jane and Anne pursue Dove , while Dove and Stanwyk pursue Hallie. (yes, by this point, Jane has been picked up for vagrancy, ""rescued"" by Jo and is working at the brothel as well). Think ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"", only in depression era New Orleans, and with prostitutes and lesbians!

Stanwyk is predictably vivid as the bisexual and ultimately psychotic madame bored with her legless husband (don't ask) and  obsessed with Hallie. Supermodel Capucine plays Halle with a Garbo-esque world-weariness so metropolitan, exotic and frigid that it's hard to figure what she could ever have had in common with farm-boy Dove in the first place. This pairing really stretches the limits of believability; they make about as much sense together as, say, Marlene Dietrich and Andy Griffith! But the weirdness of their pairing doesn't hurt ""Wild Side"" one bit. The movie is already so bizarre that further strangeness cannot possibly hinder it!

In fact, this sordid and pulpy melodrama manages to be both depressing and great fun!  it's stylish too- with the jazzy soundtrack and cool opening montage featuring a black cat (Jane?) slinking along city streets. The cover artwork is a bit misleading however. Jane Fonda plays only a secondary role in this, and the deceptively ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" look she sports in the photo is not emblematic of this film's atmosphere at all. It's in slightly grimy black and white and for most of the picture, Jane has a slightly bedraggled look about her. She is only ""dolled up"" for one scene.

A pulp-fictiony, ""cautionary"" tale about  obsession and all its guises-- Sex, Love & Loneliness . Tenessee Williams Lite. Quentin, are you reading this?",1121558400,6,2728,4.830472103004292
516757,2,6302801117,"Tawdry trash, of the finest sort, rife with revolting characters and dreadful performances. Adapted from the same novel by noted Texas writer Nelson Algren, who, like Jim Thompson, wrote about the human underbelly. The screenplay, however, with multiple rewrites, including drafts by Clifford Odets and Ben Hecht, goes terribly awry. That, coupled with the fact that the movie suffers from deplorable casting, makes WWS a turgid and lurid (these are not necessarily *bad* qualities in a movie) drama along the lines of some ill-advised Tennessee Williams indulgence. With Laurence Harvey (nominated by one anonymous viewer as #1 Lithuanian-American actor of all time!) as Dove Linkhorn, a drifter searching for his lost love, a sculptor/prostitute named Hallie, played by the 100% beautiful and 100% talent-free Capucine. Also stars Jane Fonda, as Kitty Twist, an amoral, mentally-deficient thief and prostitute, the magnificent Barbara Stanwyck as Jo Carter, the glamorous but tough and domineering (of course) lesbian brothelkeeper at the ""Dollhouse"" where Kitty and Hallie work, and, mysteriously, the usually capable Anne Baxter stars as a Mexican woman who offers her *chicharonnes* to complete strangers. Please - this is 1962! Rita Moreno and Chita Rivera must have been out of town that weekend.

  It is the early-30's in New Orleans, and the plot becomes complicated when Hallie, who, in Capucine's incompetent hands displays that particularly unpleasant early-60s European cinematic ennui, is reunited with Dove, and tries to leave the Dollhouse. Madam Jo, a part that Stanwyck sinks her teeth into as only *she* can, siccs her goons, led by her legless husband who drags himself around on a rolling cart, on Dove and Hallie, and things turn ugly and Hallie dies of an accidental gunshot wound. Also typical of early-60s filmmaking is the complete disregard for period-appropriate hair, makeup and costuming. If the titles hadn't told us this was the early-30s, we would have had no clue. The title song, which has a sleazy sound that is perfectly suited to this film, garnered an Oscar nomination. Other attention focused on this movie was no doubt based upon its one-time shocking content. Now, it is a very amusing, outdated, convoluted morality tale, whose lesson is a mystery.",1106352000,7,2292,5.308539944903581

516759,4,6302801117,"""A Walk on the Wild Side"" is a well made, intriguing soap opera set in sultry, steamy New Orleans. When the audience sees the opening credit sequence in which a sensuous black cat is photographed in closeup as it prowls along sidewalks and alleys of the Big Easy, viewers are hooked. This startling and ingenious introduction as well as the juicy end credit sequence were conceived by the brilliantly inventive graphic artist Saul Bass.
The rather sordid plot revolves around a good-looking Texas drifter named Dove, superbly underplayed by Laurence Harvey, who hitchhikes his way to New Orleans in search of his long lost love, Hallie.  Hallie is portrayed by the elegant and ravishing Capucine. (Capucine bears an uncanny resemblance to both Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn. No wonder everyone was crazy about her!) Enroute to the Big Easy, Dove encounters a runaway juvenile delinquent, Kitty, performed with sass and vigor by Jane Fonda.  She tags along with Dove until he leaves her behind after he discovers that she is a thief and a liar.
Following an anonymous tip, Dove locates Hallie who is living and working in a high-class brothel.  At first he does not realize that she has followed a primrose path.  When he does find out, he is understandably shocked.  Eventually he forgives her and proposes marriage.  Complications and tragedy follow.
The cast of "" A Walk on the Wild Side"" are uniformly excellent.  Barbara Stanwyck is especially memorable.  She gives a fearless, ferocious performance as the calculating, possessive lesbian madam, Jo, who is hopelessly infatuated with Hallie. Other palatable ingredients in this movie: the solid direction by Edward Dmytryk; the crisp, evocative black and white photography of Joe MacDonald; and the bold, brash jazz score composed by the great Elmer Bernstein.

7831874,2,6302801117,"This film got a lot of great reviews on Amazon, so I'm wondering if I would've have liked it better if I hadn't read the book first. The cast is great, the movie ""looks"" great, and it has most of the characters from the novel but I had to stop watching about halfway through. The chronology of the film completely rearranges events and by extension changes too much of the character's roles in the story to make it watchable for me.

For example, the film starts with an event that takes place well into the novel's narrative and thereby eliminates the whole backstory of why the main character (Dove Linkhorn) is on the road. Then it compounds that mistake by creating another backstory.

Then formative parts of the novel were just dropped. The book went into great detail about how much Dove lived and traveled barefoot, so much so that you could feel the pain from his running barefoot and hopping trains through gravel rail yards. The movie starts with him walking along in a pair of boots. The transition from barefoot drifter to wanna-be pimp in yellow shoes was a key element in the novel and completely missed by the film. It was one of the things that defined the character.

It only becomes more mangled from there, and the film has main characters and plot lines that were never in the novel.

This isn't the first time a book has been seriously twisted by a film adaptation, but this is Nelson Algren's Walk on the Wild Side. It's iconic, it's a classic - it should be mangle-proof.

It might be a good film, but I can't be objective. If you're looking for a faithful or even approximate visual representation of the novel, this ain't it.",1513123200,2,1651,4.545454545454546
7831875,3,6302801117,"Review of Walk on the Wild Side
Hot Toasty Rag, October 17, 2017

If you told me there was a movie in which Laurence Harvey was good and kind and Jane Fonda was the bad girl, I wouldnt believe you. But, from the first scene of Walk on the Wild Side, its clear Larry is a nice guy and Jane is up to no good. Who would have thought?

Laurence Harvey is hitchhiking from Texas to New Orleans, and along the way he meets fellow drifter Jane Fonda. Hes generous and idealistic; she lies, cheats, and steals. While Janes goal is to have a good time and get ahead, Larry wants to find his beautiful and pure former lover Capucine and live happily ever after. What will happen when they reach Louisiana?

Thats just the beginning of the plot, so if you're interested in finding out more, youll just have to rent this dark drama. Only a few years after the demise of the Hays Code, theres an enormous amount of taboo subjects included in John Fante and Edmund Morriss script, including homosexuality, gritty violence, prostitution, and interracial romance. Although this is hardly a feel-good movie, its very exciting to watch, especially when you keep in mind the time of its release. Not only is the script stimulating, but the acting is very good, especially since so much of the cast is in against-type roles. Jane Fonda is well-known now for playing in very likable roles, but in her second movie, shes a giant pill. Even though shes incredibly beautiful and has a stunning figure, I cant imagine anyone watching this film and rooting for her. Laurence Harvey is surprisingly convincing in his innocent character, and Capucine channels Joan Crawford in her conflicted performance. Barbara Stanwyck takes on a bold role, and in every scene she sizzles with simmering tension. And finally, rounding out the cast is Anne Baxter. She plays a Mexican proprietress of a gas station and diner, and for the first twenty minutes she was onscreen, I didn't even recognize her.

Director Edward Dmytryk chose a fantastic opening to his film: the camera follows a black cat stalking from the clean sidewalk through garbage-ridden streets. The cat walks in time to Elmer Bernsteins haunting and fitting theme, and it perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film. I love Elmer Bernstein, and thankfully his title songwith lyrics by Mack Davidwas nominated for an Oscar that year.
