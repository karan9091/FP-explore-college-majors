3054756,2,B0010X740U,"This is a slick film coming from an interesting place, Iceland, filled with sorta cute people (of both genders) and some interesting family dynamics, and the main plot circles around a sports star.  This film had lots of potential.

In a nutshell, the central figure, an Icelandic soccer (""football"") star, Ottar, decides to come out as gay in order to be on the ""front page"" of a magazine.  This leads to problems, as the Icelandic people are evidently quite homophobic, and Ottar is sent packing, his family is enraged/horrified, his son ostracized, and his wife/girlfriend/son's mother is driven further into her liquor-induced semi-coma.

Fortunately, there is another soccer team which is more accepting, and Ottar decides to give it a try on a new team, essentially forming a team of gay and gay-friendly men who become quite successful, mostly because nobody else will play them.

This film fails, mostly, because of a flaw in the story.  You never get the chance to know or like Ottar beyond the plain facts that he is an attractive, spoiled, self-centered egotistic dummy who does whatever he wants without really thinking his actions or their consequences through.  As such, it's hard to generate much emotional investment in his welfare or the conflicts in the story.  The supporting characters are equally shallow, and you are left with little to watch.

Beyond this flaw, the story wanders all over the place, the resolution is still-born, the dialog is filled with witty banter like ""shut up,"" and the sum of the parts is unspectacular.

Ironically, there is a trailer for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guys-Balls/dp/B000GBEWI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guys & Balls</a>,"" on this DVD, which is a German film with a very similar plot, done with much more style and grace (and humor) which is far more worth your time.  I'd skip ""Out"" and enjoy ""Guys and Balls"" instead.",1206403200,30,1925,5.237785016286645
3054757,2,B0010X740U,"This is an identical plot to the German movie Guys and Balls but their like stops there. As one is fun, energetic, spontaneous, and likable, the other is not. They are both made by the same production company.

Eleven Men Out is a very depressing, serious, and awkward movie where the acting is barely passable. And I did not like that the main character's son gets caught in the middle of his father coming out and his mother being a slut and a drunk.

This is an Icelandic movie. Basically the plot is based on a famous local football player playing for the first and most popular team in Iceland. He announces in the beginning of the movie that he is gay just to get a story and a picture in the local magazine. Then he joins a third rate all gay team.

The rest of the movie is the tribulations of him adjusting to his new life and team. His father is a psychiatrist and a member of the board of his former team. At first his former team chastises him but toward the end this team tries to get him back. There is a game at the end of the movie between the gay team and this straight team. The gay team fails miserably (unlike Guys and Balls.) Also there is a father and son portrayed in Guys and Balls, healthy relationship, unlike this movie.

I liked the movie for his cultural information, otherwise I disliked the movie for everything else.",1205625600,8,1348,4.316205533596838
3054758,3,B0010X740U,"You may want to see the special features about gay, American athletes before watching the film.  See, the US has ""Personal Best"" and ""Breaking the Waves"" about athletes in individual sports, but this Icelandic film breaks new ground by focusing on team sports.  Still, there is a wide golf between professional sports in the US and intramural stuff.  I guess ""leagues"" are more popular in Europe and having a league player come out won't translate as much here.  There are whole gay sports leagues in the US, whereas few athletes, of any sexual orientation, will ever make the professionals and get nationwide attention.
That being said, this film does touch upon so many important point.  If one player comes out, how will his straight teammates respond?  How will the opponents respond?  Does having one out player make a team ""gay""?  Will it attract more openly gay players?  Will straight fans disappear and will gay fans mitigate that loss?
As needed as this film is, it also felt rushed in so many areas.  The athlete comes out for a dumb reason at the start of the film and does not calculate things in his head the way any reasonable, closeted person would do.  He gets introduced to another gay athlete one second, and BOOM!, they are getting down with each other the next.  The main character's son walks in on his father getting busy and any reasonable parent would have locked the door or their Spidey sense would have told them their child could show up.  Of course, all of this is done to keep up the tension and conflict and get the ball rolling, but it is still highly unrealistic.
I saw this film using a certain red-envelope service.  It said the film was in English with English subtitles; it is actually in Icelandic with English subtitles.  (I heard that many Northern Europeans speak English, so the first scenario sounded plausible.)  Obviously, there are cultural gaps here.  The son is called ""Maggi,"" which I later learned was short for ""Magnus.""  However, ""Maggi"" sounds like a girl's name to my American ears.  Think about Maggie Simpson, for example.  One minor character seems to be into Black American hip-hop culture.  He uses some slang and has African-American film posters on his wall.  However, he wears a cowboy hat and many hip-hop B-boys would think of themselves as the antithesis of cowboys.  As a side note, the main character and his ex-wife look WAY too young to be the parents of a teenaged boy.
The film fights the image of Iceland as homogenous by showing people of color.  There's a Black, gay man on the team.  (How many brothas live in Iceland!?)  The film seems to be dedicated to a late, biracial male.  The film tries to be bisexual-friendly by having the main character get with his ex.  Like many a gay film, the straight characters often find romantic partners of their own, thus sending the tacit message that gays don't stop straights from getting lucky.  On a possible PC note, one man is seen in a wheelchair using oxygen.  Unfortunately, he says close to no lines, makes no movements, and thus his character may be static, in a problematic way.
The film does have a shower scene, for us horny viewers.  Still, parents in Iceland must not get a certain procedure done for newborn sons that American parents usually choose, if you know what I mean!",1204675200,6,3307,4.709059233449477

I'm not sure what ""Eleven Men Out"" is supposed to be:  comedy, drama, comedy/drama?  Whatever it is, it doesn't succeed in being any of them.  Maybe something is lost in translation.

And it even had an ending that was not worth the agony of the 84 excruciating minutes of 2 dimensional characters. Not one character was explored in depth. Not even the beauty of the leading man could hold me for this one. Why can't anyone make a decent gay movie about love, pride, romance and leave out the pathetic done again and again sappy BS?

I thought most of the situations were handled realistically, situations regarding the main characters family and teenage son. I enjoyed the fact that although this film is very much about football, you don't actually see any footage of the game itself. The film centers more on the background of sports and what it is like to ""come out"" as a pro-footballer. The soundtrack of the film is also excellent, a throwback to 80's glam metal.

3054775,3,B0010X740U,"With the Olympic Games grabbing their share of the headlines these days, let's look at a film about an athlete ""coming out"" in another country ... Iceland.

""Eleven Men Out"" (Iceland, 2005) is about a soccer star on one of the best amateur teams in that country, who abruptly decides to ""come out"" as gay, much to the surprise and complete shock of his teammates, father (who is apparently the head coach of the team), mother, siblings, ex-wife and teenage son. It doesn't go well, with his son ashamed of him, his ex-wife using it as an excuse to relapse with an alcohol problem, and the team trustees benching him until they eventually decide he can no longer play there.  A friend who coaches a lesser-known (and apparently much more diverse, with several openly gay members) team invites him to join, and the ""Pride"" - which becomes almost 100% gay as others hear about it - starts to rack up victories, eventually taking on his old team, in a sold-out game on Gay Pride Day in Iceland.

It's a pleasant coming-out story, but seems more like a documentary than a film with characters and a plot.  We never really get to know Ottar (the player who ""outs"" himself) beyond the facts that he has a past and is somewhat self-centered in not considering (and preparing others for) the possible implications of his announcement to the press, as well as in dealing with a teammate he starts dating.  Some of the dialogue seems ad-libbed and frivilous, but that could be due to the fact that I was following English subtitles (The film is in Icelandic).  Several seemingly gratuitious shots of the players in the shower make this seem almost like a ""Full Monty"" remake at times, and the ending - though perhaps realistic - is too abrupt.  Similar stories have been told better, and this could have been too.

DVD includes several featurettes about gay amateur athletes. I give it three stars out of five.",1218412800,,1899,4.664670658682635
3054776,1,B0010X740U,"This is not a ""feisty comedy"" a ""hilarious comedy"" or a comedy at all. It's probably not a film of any sort. It's just filmstock.

So let's not delude ourselves -- as a movie that typifies a sub-genre of gay cinema, a combination of 'coming-out' and 'sport,' ""Eleven Men Out"" offers nothing distinctive or titillating or rewarding for its target audience, presumably gay males.

If this movie were simply a rehash of the cliches that have come to dominate much of imported gay European cinema, the movie might have been tolerable. Some sweaty guys, some jokes about balls, some family acceptance scenes, some investigative sex, a club scene, a break-up, etc. But ""Eleven Men Out"" fails to capture even one or two of these marketable tropes. What the film does have are strangely mean-spirited and dull episodes, perhaps edited together, chronicling a vaguely handsome soccer-player's interactions with strangely mean-spirited and dull family members, lovers, fellow players. This film is joyless and ugly, often chauvinistic, sexist, biggoted and, well, all confusingly so. All the female characters are saps, whores, or drug-addled. The men are cruel or pathetic, or 'lost.'

The DVD cover is stirringly crisp and seductive, with a man cupping his teammate's bum. The actual film quality is grainy, drizzly, washed out, and the sound is hollow. I cannot see how this is 'stylized' rather than merely amateurish. The cast act like they hate themselves and the material. They do not know where to stand in the frame. When viewers are given 'eye candy' -- gratuitous shots of players showering -- the effect is numbingly banal and, worse, self-conscious.

The sports-aspect of its story, a dreary and confusing take on the politics of club soccer, is handled with side-long discussions in locker-rooms between coaches and half-clothed athletes. None of it is sharp, alluring, or political. The games are non-existent. There are no matches save for barely montaged bits of footwork. Or small crowds of people in stands baring their cheer for reaction shots to off-screen goals. The more intimate portrait of a family rocked by their son's sexuality is filmed with the most languid camera, punctuated by tinny emotion. The father-son struggles are crude and perfunctory.

In one scene, the son walks in on his father having anal intercourse with another man, and the son is disgusted. ""Eleven Men Out"" deserves this disgust -- all relationships in it are reduced to voyeaurism, bad timing, and disappointment. No one has any fun in sex or in love, or really anywhere. There is no pay-off to relationships. When the father and son come back together with a mutual understanding and respect for each other (actually, it's difficult to remember/know if they do), I couldn't help but feel cheated. I thought for sure someone would just off themselves; that is the internal logic of this abysmal film.

This film is Icelandic. I can't be sure it was meant to be a 'gay' movie at all in its home country, before here! studios picked it up for redistribution.

You will regret buying this film from any vendor, no matter the price.",1218326400,15,3120,5.02321083172147

The film centers more on the background of sports and what it is like to ""come out"" as a pro-footballer. The soundtrack of the film is also excellent, a throwback to 80's glam metal. This is one of the best foreign language films I've seen in a long time.",1224633600,,710,4.427480916030534
3289272,3,B0010X740U,"With the Olympic Games grabbing their share of the headlines these days, let's look at a film about an athlete ""coming out"" in another country ... Iceland.

""Eleven Men Out"" (Iceland, 2005) is about a soccer star on one of the best amateur teams in that country, who abruptly decides to ""come out"" as gay, much to the surprise and complete shock of his teammates, father (who is apparently the head coach of the team), mother, siblings, ex-wife and teenage son. It doesn't go well, with his son ashamed of him, his ex-wife using it as an excuse to relapse with an alcohol problem, and the team trustees benching him until they eventually decide he can no longer play there.  A friend who coaches a lesser-known (and apparently much more diverse, with several openly gay members) team invites him to join, and the ""Pride"" - which becomes almost 100% gay as others hear about it - starts to rack up victories, eventually taking on his old team, in a sold-out game on Gay Pride Day in Iceland.

It's a pleasant coming-out story, but seems more like a documentary than a film with characters and a plot.  We never really get to know Ottar (the player who ""outs"" himself) beyond the facts that he has a past and is somewhat self-centered in not considering (and preparing others for) the possible implications of his announcement to the press, as well as in dealing with a teammate he starts dating.  Some of the dialogue seems ad-libbed and frivilous, but that could be due to the fact that I was following English subtitles (The film is in Icelandic).  Several seemingly gratuitious shots of the players in the shower make this seem almost like a ""Full Monty"" remake at times, and the ending - though perhaps realistic - is too abrupt.  Similar stories have been told better, and this could have been too.

DVD includes several featurettes about gay amateur athletes. I give it three stars out of five.",1218412800,,1899,4.664670658682635
3289273,1,B0010X740U,"This is not a ""feisty comedy"" a ""hilarious comedy"" or a comedy at all. It's probably not a film of any sort. It's just filmstock.

So let's not delude ourselves -- as a movie that typifies a sub-genre of gay cinema, a combination of 'coming-out' and 'sport,' ""Eleven Men Out"" offers nothing distinctive or titillating or rewarding for its target audience, presumably gay males.

If this movie were simply a rehash of the cliches that have come to dominate much of imported gay European cinema, the movie might have been tolerable. Some sweaty guys, some jokes about balls, some family acceptance scenes, some investigative sex, a club scene, a break-up, etc. But ""Eleven Men Out"" fails to capture even one or two of these marketable tropes. What the film does have are strangely mean-spirited and dull episodes, perhaps edited together, chronicling a vaguely handsome soccer-player's interactions with strangely mean-spirited and dull family members, lovers, fellow players. This film is joyless and ugly, often chauvinistic, sexist, biggoted and, well, all confusingly so. All the female characters are saps, whores, or drug-addled. The men are cruel or pathetic, or 'lost.'

The DVD cover is stirringly crisp and seductive, with a man cupping his teammate's bum. The actual film quality is grainy, drizzly, washed out, and the sound is hollow. I cannot see how this is 'stylized' rather than merely amateurish. The cast act like they hate themselves and the material. They do not know where to stand in the frame. When viewers are given 'eye candy' -- gratuitous shots of players showering -- the effect is numbingly banal and, worse, self-conscious.

The sports-aspect of its story, a dreary and confusing take on the politics of club soccer, is handled with side-long discussions in locker-rooms between coaches and half-clothed athletes. None of it is sharp, alluring, or political. The games are non-existent. There are no matches save for barely montaged bits of footwork. Or small crowds of people in stands baring their cheer for reaction shots to off-screen goals. The more intimate portrait of a family rocked by their son's sexuality is filmed with the most languid camera, punctuated by tinny emotion. The father-son struggles are crude and perfunctory.

In one scene, the son walks in on his father having anal intercourse with another man, and the son is disgusted. ""Eleven Men Out"" deserves this disgust -- all relationships in it are reduced to voyeaurism, bad timing, and disappointment. No one has any fun in sex or in love, or really anywhere. There is no pay-off to relationships. When the father and son come back together with a mutual understanding and respect for each other (actually, it's difficult to remember/know if they do), I couldn't help but feel cheated. I thought for sure someone would just off themselves; that is the internal logic of this abysmal film.

This film is Icelandic. I can't be sure it was meant to be a 'gay' movie at all in its home country, before here! studios picked it up for redistribution.

You will regret buying this film from any vendor, no matter the price.",1218326400,15,3120,5.02321083172147
3289274,1,B0010X740U,"The story is, if you can call it that, that a prominent icelandic soccer player comes out after a match so that he can be on the front page of a magasine. After that he gets kicked out of his club, finds a gay team (you don't see them play), they drive around to some small villages to play and ends up playing against his old team mates, and then the movies ends...oh yah you find out that he's been married, has an estranged son and he plays boyfriends with one of his gay team mate.

Boring, boring, boring. I am sorry i wasted money on the film.",1217721600,4,549,4.083333333333333
3289275,4,B0010X740U,"Shows that prejudices and hard headed people are all over the world as these guys from Iceland must deal with the gay bashing while trying to compete as a gay soccer team.  It all starts with the star of a popular soccer team announcing to the press after a game that he's gay.  This doesnt go over well with most of the folks on his team his dad included being that he's the coach of the team.

He talks to him like its a sickness or a mental illness that can be ""cured"" when that drama stop for real.  He's not hearing any of it at all and he's also dealing with a way drunk and so out of it ex-wife.  He also has a son to look out for as well and he isn't too keen on him putting his business out for the world to see.

But throughout the movie the gain more favor with other folks who don't have an issue with an all gay soccer team.  It's filled with drama and what not, but its also a fun movie that most should be able to enjoy.",1209427200,2,935,3.889473684210526
