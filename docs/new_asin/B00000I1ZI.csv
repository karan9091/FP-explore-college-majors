1218855,3,B00000I1ZI,"INSEMINOID

(UK - 1980)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (J-D-C Scope)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Whilst exploring a series of caves beneath the surface of the Jupiter moon Xeno, a small team of archeologists accidentally unleash a long-buried alien creature which promptly impregnates one of the female memebers of the crew (Judy Geeson). With the subsequent pregnancy developing at an alarming rate, Geeson is compelled to protect her unborn 'children' from scientific scrutiny and begins to massacre her colleagues, one by one...

Responding to the worldwide appetite for overblown space operas established by STAR WARS in 1977, yet remaining true to his roots as a purveyor of exploitation-horror movies (SATAN'S SLAVE, PREY, etc.), British director Norman J. Warren developed the script for INSEMINOID with writers Nick and Gloria Maley, a team of special effects technicians who were looking for a vehicle in which to showcase their talents. With funding from British and Hong Kong sources, the film went into production at Chislehurst caves (a grim but picturesque location just outside London) shortly after Ridley Scott's ALIEN (1979) wrapped principal photography, though INSEMINOID was completed and released after Scott's film had already debuted, and almost inevitably suffered from less-than-flattering comparisons.

The main problem with INSEMINOID is that the modest 1 million budget undermines its lofty ambitions from the outset, yielding a range of sets, costumes and visual effects which are more reminiscent of ""Blake's 7"" and ""Doctor Who"" than STAR WARS, and the cheapskate production values sometimes provoke unintentional laughter. Faced with some fairly amateurish dialogue, most of the cast can't help but sink to the occasion, though Geeason is remarkably good in the leading role, transforming herself from terrified victim to monstrous avenger with scene-stealing glee (unfortunately, she later bad-mouthed the film, saying it was the worst thing she had ever done). Elsewhere, Stephanie Beacham (THE NIGHTCOMERS, TV's ""The Colby's"") plays the material with earnest conviction, while Victoria Tennant (THE WINDS OF WAR) makes no impression at all as one of the early victims of Geeson's rampage.

For all its drawbacks, however, the film is fast-moving and well-constructed, and benefits enormously from expansive anamorphic photography by John Metcalfe (XTRO, RAWHEAD REX). A longtime fan of the scope format, Warren uses the wide frame to evoke a sense of scale which belies the movie's financial limitations, and to maintain a strong visual dynamic, even during quiet scenes, through careful lighting and composition. There's plenty of gory violence on offer, too, though Warren was forced to make a few cosmetic trims to some of the more explicit sequences, courtesy of the British censor, and that version has prevailed on home video ever since.

Sadly, theough the film was modestly successful all over the world (including America, where a slightly truncated print originally played under the title HORROR PLANET), the director was unable to finance another venture for several years afterward, and his final film to date, BLOODY NEW YEAR (1987) went straight to video. His long-cherished ambition to remake FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1957) in glorious color has yet to happen, which is particularly regrettable - the genre has always needed talented mavericks like Warren, now more than ever.",1006732800,15,3415,5.505725190839694

The pretty bloody FX unfortunately were trimmed in the US to achieve  an R-Rating, so gorehounds shouldn't expect to much.

1218877,2,B00000I1ZI,"""Inseminoid"" is a British piece of derivative theater riding on the coat tails of ""Alien."" Starting with incredibly cheap credits (""Sir Run Run Shaw Presents""...) it has the cheesy production values you would expect from a low budget sci-fi epic from the early 1980's. It looks like half of the movie was filmed in a junior high school locker room and the other half in a salt mine. (In reality it was largely shot in some caves outside London.) The synthesizer soundtrack is particularly dated, and, therefore, entertaining.

Early on there is conversation and narration explaining that earlier expeditions to this planet were disastrous, but that, fortunately, the current expedition has uncovered a huge tomb complex to explore which can help the astronauts figure out what happened to the previous inhabitants. While exploring the tombs, astronauts find a gross mass which attacks them. (This may look very familiar to those of you who have seen ""Alien."") People, starting with astronaut Ricky, go bonkers in short order, and before you know it we see a whiny female astronaut hacking her own foot off with an electric hedge trimmer. (Really.)

After a short but somber space funeral the cast gets right back to looking at rocks and walking around in caves. There is a very lame alien-eviscerating-astronaut scene (realism is not one of the strong points of the film), after which the accompanying female astronaut, Sandy, is kidnapped to be used for the nefarious activities implied in the title. (Yuck.) After Sandy becomes ""with alien"" the flashbacks start in earnest, and she goes on a rampage which is modestly (though not very realistically) gory. There are a lot of fights and lots of screaming. Judy Geeson, an actually quite talented actress, proves that when so instructed she can shriek as loudly as anyone; this is modestly annoying after a short while, especially during the alien delivery scene. A variety of weapons are used in these fights including hammers, crowbars, a bathroom sink, and a laser pistol. What the film lacks in originality it makes up with the diversity of its arsenal.

As the plot winds down, the unpossessed astronauts kidnap the twin mutant alien babies while the remainder of the cast goes after Sandy, who is also now a vampire of sorts (though in an unusual twist on the Dracula myth, she seems to prefer to chew on the intestines and legs). I won't disclose the exciting conclusion, although once again anyone who has seen ""Alien"" may not be entirely surprised.

The film is entertaining in a campy way, as it is laughably bad. The DVD print is quite good. The only extra is a copy of the incredibly grainy original theatrical trailer which contains a few of great taglines like ""The inconceivable is about to be conceived!...It is not a blessed event!""

This is cheese with a touch of gore. It is very derivative of the genre and the plot contains few unpredictable plotpoints, but fans of early 1980's sci-fi or B-movie fans will likely enjoy seeing it once.",1238198400,2,3006,4.909448818897638

Judy Geeson (Dominique, It Happened At Nightmare Inn) plays Sandy, the crazed mum-to-be, who begins killing off her comrades and drinking their blood. I really enjoyed this movie, cheeze and all. Though some similarities between INSEMINOID and ALIEN do exist, this one quickly establishes itself as a story about deep-space maternal instincts gone mad. Can a small group of humans possibly survive Sandy's homicidal hormonal explosion? A unique take on motherhood for sure! Check out those ugg-leee babies...",1199923200,,653,5.288461538461538

If you are having some friends over for drinks you might wanna watch this one as it's hilarious!!

Poor Judy Geason and Stephanie Beacham are the only actors doing their best to act above and beyond the silly dialogue and situations.

The rest of the cast are terrible and the characters make serious mistake after mistake just to wind up sliced or diced.

Still it's fun to watch all these big name actors (in England anyway) run around cheap sets from a really great Judy Geason.",1185408000,,693,4.3076923076923075

More like a mash of Doctor Who, Space 1999, Liquid Sky and some Hammer mishap.  Gory brit space opera filmed in a cave with some sexy breastage and horny alien impregnations.  A whole lotta gel filter lighting and silver myler spandex were used in the making of this film.  People who grew up on 80s late night cable will cleave this lovingly to their breast, all others will probably see it for the space-rape hokum it really is.

1218881,4,B00000I1ZI,"Let me start by dispelling the myth that this is an attempted Alien rip-off.  This movie was in production before anyone involved in it had seen the Alien movie and it was released in 1980.  Both movies do draw upon earlier works such as Bava's Planet of the vampires.  Any comparison between the two is also somewhat needless given the status of Alien as an all time classic and Inseminoid as a competent and entertaining B-movie.

Inseminoid could be described as exploitation meets a Blakes's 7 episode.  The British seem to have been masters of combining very professional small-name actors with low budgets to produce material that hits above its weight, and I think this is a good example.  Where the movie falls down a bit in my mind is that suspense in not maintained.  None of the characters are developed to the point that we have much pity for them as they meet their deaths, and hence the movie does fall back on its credentials as an exploitation flick to provide entertainment.  The quality of the DVD transfer copy I've seen is very nice with no obvious sign of age or wear.  I'd only recommend buying this one to collectors of this genre.  Having said this, I think the movie is much better than many similar low-budget B-movies.",1129939200,4,1245,4.6438356164383565
1218882,4,B00000I1ZI,"I had to chuckle to myself when I noticed I am following up a review for a movie called ""Killer Condom"" with one for a film called ""Inseminoid."" It is completely unintentional, I assure you. Still, it is funny in a dark, demented sort of way. As for these two films, the styles are quite different. ""Killer Condom"" is a warped spoof of American detective films while ""Inseminoid"" falls into the category of straightforward science fiction. Also known as ""Horror Planet,"" ""Inseminoid"" is one of those hypercheesy rip-offs of ""Alien,"" except on this outing it is Brits instead of Americans working on both ends of the cameras. The movie is a very low budget effort, hardly worth mentioning let alone watching unless you always enjoy viewing low budget British ""Alien"" rip-offs. Once again, I found myself wondering how a movie like this could get a DVD release while worthier projects fester on the back shelves of video stores in VHS formats. I am not saying ""Inseminoid"" is bad; it is actually a quite enjoyable romp through the world of schlock cinema, but even I must admit this movie should stand at the back of the line when it comes to receiving a DVD treatment.
On some distant planet in the distant future, an archeological expedition made up of males and females digs up a world of hurt in a series of tunnels near their recently inhabited base. One of the guys nosing around in a tunnel unearths some weird looking crystals, and goes completely bonkers after touching them. The other members of the expedition express the requisite amount of concern for their mentally damaged and recently deceased co-worker, but that doesn't stop them from continuing to muck around in a situation of increasing danger. Instead of hiding away in the research facility to await the arrival of a rescue ship, the crew decides to find out exactly what is going on. Too bad for them. It turns out that some mushroom shaped alien life form (see the cover of the DVD) has decided to emerge from its hibernation, hiding place, or wherever it has been in order to wreak havoc on the gullible humans. The hideous being hurts a few people before casting its lascivious eye on Sandy (Judy Geeson), deciding to ""inseminate"" her (chuckle) so he can have a few children. Before you groan with derision, and you will groan often while watching the film, it is after this incident that ""Inseminoid"" gears up to a snail's pace.
Sandy flips her lid after her experience with the creature. ""Hey, so would I if I just had a sexual experience with an alien"" you might say, and you would be right in part until you discover what Sandy gets up to. She starts roaming around the byzantine tunnels of the research facility in search of her fellow crewmembers because the growing embryos inside clamor for the nurturing taste of human blood. Bodies fall spouting blood and guts as Sandy insidiously tracks down her prey. The lady uses explosives to blast through metal doors, lays in ambush, acts as though she is in peril in order to lure unknowing humans to her, and generally makes a huge nuisance of herself. A diminishing group of survivors frantically monitors the deteriorating conditions in the corridors of the base from a sealed off control chamber while desperately hoping help arrives in time. Predictably, Sandy gives birth to her alien offspring--twins, by the way--before finally succumbing to one of her comrades. The ""twist"" ending not only fails to surprise, it fails in an excruciatingly banal way. Anyone who claims ""Inseminoid"" doesn't rip-off ""Alien"" should have their head examined.
""Inseminoid"" boasts several memorable elements worth noting here. One concerns the presence of actress Victoria Tennant among the cast. She only shows up briefly--just long enough to pick up her paycheck, one supposes--so you have to keep your eyes open. The idea that this actress could go from a cheesefest like ""Inseminoid"" to movies like ""All of Me"" in the space of three years simply boggles the mind. Only Kim Cattrall could boast of a similar seismic shift in cinematic priorities with her trek from ""Porky's"" to ""Sex in the City,"" and that took nearly twenty years. If you tire of looking for Tennant, tide yourself over with the hysterical overacting from Judy Geeson's character. Bette Davis near the end of her career couldn't beat this energetic actress's hammy performance as the doomed Sandy. She shrieks, she cries, she bellows, she cackles, she plots--what a thespian! I alternated from saying things like ""Oh, knock it off!"" to general laughter as I watched Geeson emote herself into a tizzy. Yep, these two elements, combined with set pieces that looked like they were taken from a roller rink circa 1975 and the cheesy special effects make ""Inseminoid"" a worthwhile project for the dedicated film fan.
The DVD edition doesn't offer much in the way of extras. There's a grainy, unrestored trailer and that's about it. At least they offered us a widescreen picture transfer (why, I have no idea), which does look very nice. The audio sounds better than it should. ""Inseminoid"" is rumored to cause watering eyes, chronic fatigue syndrome, shingles, projectile nasal congestion, headaches, and a host of other annoying ailments to those who watch it more than once. So take my advice: rent the film, watch it once very quickly, and return it with all due haste to the video store. There's no sense causing yourself lingering harm by repeating the experience.",1077235200,6,5447,4.883369330453564
1218883,2,B00000I1ZI,"In 1979, director Ridley Scott unleashed the film Alien on an unsuspecting viewing public, pretty much making his career as a director.  Of all the great things to come from that frightening, entertaining and highly successful movie, sequels, comic books, novels, toys, etc., the one thing he probably didn't foresee was the slew of really poor imitations that were to follow, including, but certainly not limited to, Inseminoid, AKA Horror Planet (1981).  Written by Nick and Gloria Maley, Nick being most notable for make up and special effects on such movies as Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, and Gloria's claim to fame being a nominal actress in movies like And Now the Screaming Starts! (1973) and Satan's Slave (1976), Inseminoid doesn't look promising.  And it isn't.  Okay, so who's directing? Norman J. Warren?  The same Norman J. Warren who directed Satan's Slave, Alien Prey (1978) and Spaced Out (1979)?  Oh man, we're in trouble...

This English production starts out with a view of some planet and voice over talking about various failed expeditions to said planet.  There is currently a third one in progress, and we soon get to seen some people in space suits walking around caves.  One of the explorers finds a strange looking pod, and it starts to glow, and then explodes.  Whoops...some other stuff happens, and the gist of the thing is one of the female crew members gets impregnated (ick) by an alien who we see for like two minutes and then never see again.  I know what you're thinking, ""Did the alien copulate with the woman?""  From the trailer you'd think so, but that wasn't the case.  The alien actually sedated the woman and inserted a long, clear, plastic tube between her legs and some gooey, green, lumpy fluid flowed through (double ick).  So anyway, the woman is now knocked up, and it turns out the fetus starts messing with her mind.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  The actress, Judy Geeson, playing the character that gets the space bun in the oven seemed so familiar to me, but I could not place her.  Turns out she was in the much better film To Sir, With Love (1967).  Poor Judy...oh well...as I was saying, the woman laden with alien spore starts tearing up the rest of the crew, and her gestation period develops rather quickly as in subsequent scenes, her belly gets bigger and bigger.  There was a rather revolting scene where two crewmembers get into a fight with the pregnant woman, where the male crewmember basically stomps on the engorged belly of the expectant mother to be while she was laying on the ground.  I know she has an evil space baby inside her, but still, the visual was disturbing and, in my opinion, unnecessary.

Things I liked about the movie...the production values where surprisingly decent, especially for a movie like this.  The sets were fairly expansive and almost realistic.  I guess when you have really low expectations, it's easy to please.  Also, Judy Geeson does appear nekkid, during the insemination scene, and a couple of other female cast members are see in skimpy outfits that clearly mimic Ripley's outfit near the end of Alien.  Both of the actresses who appear this way may be easily recognized as one was Stephanie Beacham, who was on TV's Dallas, and the other being Victoria Tennant, from the Steve Martin movies All of Me (1984) and L.A. Story (1991).  Things I didn't like about the movie...well, the actors kept stepping on each other's lines.  I understand film is expensive and shooting schedules are tight, more so in these types of movies, so there may not have been an opportunity to correct these things.  It happens pretty often in this movie, and it's quite funny.  Also, the music...arrrgh...couldn't they afford someone whose main instrument wasn't a Casio keyboard?  Another thing, there were too many characters, and it soon became apparent the only reason for this was fodder for various kill scenes.  One last main point was of a tactical nature.  These noodle heads had absolutely no concept of even the most basic, common sense tactical abilities when dealing with the murderous mother.  They outnumbered her and had various weapons available at their disposal, but their course of action always involved running away, even when they have the advantage.  Really, the characters that met with grisly ends deserved to die, as they were so utterly incompetent and stupid.

I give credit to Elite Entertainment for an exceptional print of the film.  It was clear and without visual flaws.  Same thing couldn't be said of the script.  The audio was also excellent, providing crispness that allowed us to hear every bit of inane dialog, cheesy electronic musical note, and odd, sometimes-inappropriate sound effect.  My overall view of the film?  Good for a few cheap thrills and unintentional laughs, but not much else.

7909437,4,B00000I1ZI,"When it comes to genre films from the 80s, I have a special place in my heart for sci-fi and horror.  This decade produced some of my all time favorite films, including ALIENS, THE THING, and several others.  Along with these classics, a slew of lower budget titles were also released; some were good, but most were not.  HORROR PLANET actually falls into the good category, although I have to confess I am surprised.  Ive heard many bad things about it over the years, but I didn't get to check it out for myself until the fine folks at Cheezy Flicks were kind enough to send me a copy.  Im very happy to report theres not much cheesiness in this film, and fans of lower budget sci-fi horror flicks should be happy here.

I need to clarify a few things before I move on with the review.  First off, keep in mind HORROR PLANET is a lower budget film.  The estimated budget is only $2 million, which is peanuts when compared to the ALIEN budget, which is estimated at $11 million.  Obviously, you can only do so much with a small budget.  Secondly, there is a popular misconception that this film is a ripoff of ALIEN.  Not so once again.  This film was greenlit for production around the time that ALIEN started filming.  It was released later, which is why many people think its a ripoff.

HORROR PLANET is obviously dated, and it does not have the dark, gritty feel that ALIEN does.  But what it lacks visually, it makes up for with intensity.  Once things start happening, the film takes off like a missile and never slows down.  This is a major aspect of what makes the film so good for me.

The acting is very good as well.  I am particularly impressed with Judy Geesons performance as the main character, Sandy.  Geeson is a great Scream-Queen, and she puts her lungs to good use here, especially during the birthing scene.  Wowthis woman can wail!!

The special effects are pretty good for the time period as well.  While I found the alien a bit underwhelming, it still looks good nonetheless.  And the gore is not bad, either; theres a particularly nice and gruesome scene of a woman trying to saw her own leg off.  We get to see a bit of it, and I like how the effects team put it together.

Even though its touted as a cheezy flick, I didn't find this one very cheesy at all (and thats a good thing!).  Its a fairly well-made science fiction horror hybrid that has a lot of heart and showcases some up-and-coming talent of that time (this was Robert Pughs film debut, for example, and he went on to portray Craster in GAME OF THRONES).  I recommend giving this one a look.  It is available now.",1415145600,,2604,4.40041928721174

7909440,1,B00000I1ZI,"Before I get this review started, you may know by now that I'm NOT one of these people who thinks that low-budget movies are automatically bad.  In fact, there's actually a few movies with small budgets that are among my favorites.  Some of those are Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) and Romper Stomper.  Those movies thrived on thrilling scenes and superb character development that all made sense in the context of films made for adult minds.  Inseminoid (aka Horror Planet), on the other hand, is merely a low-budget Alien knockoff that eschews following its own logic and sensible character development to wallow on being ""shocking"" and nothing else.  Quite frankly, along with Cradle of Filth and Dragonforce, Inseminoid is one of the worst exports to come from England.

STORY

On a seemingly remote planet, a team of scientists are on an archeological excavation mission and find these mysterious crystals that make people crazy when they come into contact with them.  They also disturb an alien race that's been dormant for several thousand years.  The awakened alien kidnaps and violates Sandy (Judy Geeson), one of the crew members, and after becoming impregnated by this alien, she becomes psychotic and possesses superhuman strength, killing her crew members and destroying everything in her path.

CHARACTERS

The characters are what ultimately make this movie so deplorable.  To be honest, up until the point where Sandy starts killing the crew and blowing things up, the characters seemed pretty believable in the context of a horror movie for adults.  However, when Sandy starts her rampage, it's like all the characters decided to become extremely moronic and are almost acting like they're lining up to be killed.  You'd think that on an expensive space mission where safety is paramount, that if one of the crew members lost their minds, started killing people and blowing up the facility, that everyone would make it priority #1 to snuff the psychotic crew member to prevent anymore death and destruction.  However, this isn't the case since it's like the baboons who wrote and directed this tripe either didn't know what good character development is or couldn't write a good script, so they just made the characters act really stupidly to prolong Sandy's life to prolong the movie's length until it hits the 93 minute mark.

An example of just how dumb the characters are is that when Sandy gets cornered in the mess hall after stabbing Barbra to death and blowing up a part of the facility, she's screaming in pain from the pregnancy and the crew members actually try to give her medical help, even though she's already demonstrated that she's a deadly threat to everyone.  One of them brings a deadly mining tool just in case things get hairy, and due to a corny part with the doctor claiming that ""he can't let people die,"" everyone in that scene ends up getting killed by Sandy, and I'm just shaking my head at the sheer stupidity of the cast.  There's other parts of the movie after this where even after Sandy kills even more crew, the others don't seem to be putting fourth too much effort to actually kill her, furthering justification for why I think the characters are dumber than a coffee can full of nails.

Towards the end, Mark, one of the senior officers remaining, orders the rest of the crew to take Sandy's alien offspring and carry them around as if they're newborn babies, even though it should be pretty clear at this point that such alien creatures are deadly.  Surprise surprise, the alien offspring kill off the rest of the crew after Mark finally kills Sandy in an extremely anti-climactic battle (more on that later).

HORROR/EXPLOITATIVE SCENERY

There was one part of the movie early on where Gail, one of the crew, gets her leg caught in a vent and her oxygen system malfunctions, she cuts her trapped leg off with a mining saw and end up committing suicide by opening her suit mask to induce a quicker death.  I'll admit that this scene was pretty convincing in its gruesomeness, and that's really the only good thing I'll say about this.

However, the rest of the horror elements and exploitative scenery are a joke.  The aliens featured in this movie look so lame that you could have replaced them with duplications of Marvin the Martian and I would find them much more terrifying than the aliens in this movie.

The final battle between Mark and Sandy is not only among the most anti-climactic in the horror genre, but also totally nonsensical in the movie's own logic.  Mark strangulates Sandy with some electrical wires, even though Sandy had superhuman strength and in a previous scene, it's shown that she could be deprived of oxygen and still live, so attacking her in a way to deprive her of oxygen shouldn't have done anything to her.  The fact that there was zero point zero gore in this scene made it so boring.

SPECIAL EFFECTS/SETS

I try to give credit for low-budget movies for putting effort into what little they have, and to be fair, the sets do look decent for the meager resources available.  The gore scenes look fairly convincing as well, but aside from the aliens looking so fake, they look so unintimidating that the only way you'd find these aliens halfway creepy is if you're really hammered.

SOUNDTRACK

Honestly, the music in this movie, other than it being typical of 80's horror movies, was extremely forgettable.  Not much else to say besides that.

MATURE CONTENT

This isn't a movie for the kids since aside from the plentiful amounts of bloodshed, there's a semi-hallucinogenic scene of a totally naked Sandy getting impregnated by one of the aliens, and another where she's giving birth to the aliens (though in this scene, you don't really see Sandy's genitalia below the waist).

FINAL WORD

Inseminoid is a movie that's largely been lost in the sands of time over the decades, and rightfully so.  It's a blatant Alien ripoff that woefully fails at everything Alien succeeded at.  Alien had far superior horror scenes, much better characters, astonishing scenery, and much creeper alien life forms.

Pretend that Inseminoid doesn't exist and invest your time and money into Alien, The Thing, and Event Horizon instead (if you haven't already).",1382745600,,6234,4.859981078524125

Warren, best known previously for 'Satan's Slave' (horror) and 'Prey' (which is also a science fiction film dealing with an extraterrestrial disguised as a human being visiting Earth). It is a competently made picture, with some big name actresses (Judy Geeson and Stephanie Beecham, both of whom had worked for Hammer - amongst other studios - previously). Despite the budgetary restraints, it has some good special effects, some not-so-good special effects, but overall does an effective job as a SF-Horror movie. It has an excellent period synthesizer score common to SF and Horror films at the time (for example the works of John Carpenter) and lots of lively ideas.
The touches of sex and horror are effective and the setting in Chislehurst caves (where the notorious Hellfire Club used to get up to all sorts of naughtiness) work very well as the site of an archeaological dig on an alien moon.

'Inseminoid' has many detractors, who tend to fall into two camps (1) viewers who can't use their imagination and suspend disbelief in the face of less than 100% realistic effects, and/or (2) those who believe the film is a 'rip-off' of 'Alien'.

The first group will never enjoy any SF film that doesn't have a big budget sheen, so in terms of judging well over 90% of SF films made, don't have opinions worth considering, since using their imaginations is a step too far for them. Almost every SF film ever made needs the audience to willingly suspend disbelief and engage with the 'what if?' mindset required to enjoy the genre. If you can't use your imagination and need everything handed to you on a plate, you're doomed to never enjoy most SF.

As for those who believe that 'Inseminoid' is a ""rip-off"" of the admittedly near-flawless 'Alien', the fact is they are simply wrong.

In his essay ""The British Post-Alien Intrusion Film"", Peter Wright writes : '...the production schedules for each film do not sustain accusations of plaigarism. When Nick and Gloria Maley wrote 'Inseminoid''s screenplay, 'Alien' was being shot on closed sets; when 'Inseminoid' went into production, 'Alien' had not been released in Britain."" (excerpted from 'British Science Fiction Cinema', edited by I Q Hunter, Routledge 1999). In short, SF film experts have vindicated 'Inseminoid' from the charge of being a rip-off.

Like 'Alien', 'Inseminoid' has clear predecessors in written SF. Many film critics and film buffs are not well read in science fiction (or the history of science fiction) and often have a tendency to assume that ideas in SF films are new, recent, or original. 'Alien', 'Inseminoid', 'It! The Terror From Beyond Space' (a 1950s vehicle often cited as a source for 'Alien') all have a very clear common ancestor in A E Van Vogt's novel 'The Voyage of the Space Beagle', which started life as a magazine serial in 1939. It comprises four linked stories, the first of which (""Black Destroyer"") inspired elements of both 'Forbidden Planet' and 'Alien', the third of which ('Discord in Scarlett') inspired both 'Alien' and 'Inseminoid' in my opinion. The overall scenario of the book inspired both 'Star Trek' and 'Forbidden Planet' and the character of Spock from the former is almost certainly based on one of the main characters in Van Vogt's novel. 'The Voyage of the Space Beagle' is, more than any other book, the ur-text of cinematic SF focussing on hostile aliens. Van Vogt settled out of court with 20th Century Fox for $50,000 when 'Alien' was released.

'Inseminoid', with its' red alien, instantly reminds SF readers of 'Space Beagle'. However, 'Inseminoid' owes far less to Van Vogt than 'Alien' so 'Inseminoid' is actually more original, ebing more reminscent of UFO abduction stories in the details of its ET-human contact.

Interestingly, 'Inseminoid's' archaeological dig setting mirrors an element of the original screenplay of 'Alien' that wasn't filmed, a subplot involving a pyramind and murals depicting the alien lifecycle. It's worth noting that the writers of 'Inseminoid' may well have got this idea from the Dr Who serial 'The Tombs of the Cybermen', which is set on the site of an archeaological dig on an alien planet where the extinct cybermen are interred.

The real message of all this contextual detail is that, in science fiction film, there is very little new under the sun, because writers did it all first, did it a long time ago and simply by pioneering the ideas, did them better (improving upon an existing idea is always easier than creating something from scratch, which is why pioneers are the most important artists). For example, Michel Faber's novel 'Under the Skin', soon to get big-screen treatment, a book that has been hailed as massively original by readers unfamilar with SF, is not dissimilar in parts to Norman J. Warren's other SF film 'Prey' and very similar in theme to Damon Knight's classic 1950s story 'To Serve Man'.

For anyone interested in SF or Horror, 'Inseminoid' is a must-see and deserves to be watched with its ideas in mind (it's a lot more revealing, explicit and involved than 'Alien' is as a gender/feminist piece, even if it is more reactionary). Watching it only in the context as a 'rip-off' of an admittedly bigger, better and more impressive film is a disservice to its relative originality. The 'real' rip-offs of 'Alien' came later: the wonderfully surreal and irreverent 'Xtro' and the fabulous Italian splatter film 'Contamination' 9which also owes a little to 'Invaders From Mars'. 'Alien', 'Inseminoid;, 'Xtro' and 'Contamination' are all worth seeing and are all far better as works of the imagination than some 90% of the big-budget no ideas all surface SF films of the last 20 years. They're also much more fun....

7909443,4,B00000I1ZI,"In the wake of the colossal success of ""Star Wars"" in the late '70s, by the early 1980s sci-fi films were again a big business, and a new crop of them emerged that combined the outer space element with suspense and horror, and were marketed primarily to adults, some examples being ""Saturn 3,"" ""Outland,"" and ""Galaxy of Terror.""

Continuing this tradition is British director Norman J. Warren's ""Inseminoid,"" which was produced in mid 1980 and first released to theaters in the U.K. Midlands in March of 1981, eventually reaching London screens by that fall.

A group of scientists on an expedition to a distant, lifeless planet (surface temperature: 89 degrees below zero) uncover strange red crystals and an alien lifeform that has remained dormant for millennia, just waiting for some poor unsuspecting human to unleash it.  When one of the crew members (Judy Geeson) is raped by this hostile entity, she becomes immediately psychotic, not to mention pregnant, and soon gives birth to a hatching spawn in a particularly disgusting scene.

Produced on a budget of roughly one million Great British Pounds, there is no doubt that budget constraints show in a number of frames of ""Inseminoid"" (particularly the view screens in the crew's control room, which are nothing more than late '70s Zenith 19"" televisions stacked one on top of the other), but overall for a budget of its size I found the film to be very interesting to look at.  I like the spacesuits with voice boxes the cast wears when investigating the ruins, not to mention there is a rather high gore quotient here, such as Geeson reverting to cannibalism in her infected state, and a few nice glimpses of some devoured bodies.  Also, I tend to have a thing for British women in general, and most of the girls here (Geeson included) are lovely and consistently easy on the eye throughout.

With the aforementioned mutilation scenes and sexual assault by the alien perpetrator, it's not surprising that this received the dreaded ""X"" rating in the United Kingdom (but was I believe edited down to an ""R"" for its American release in 1982 under its alternate title ""Horror Planet"").  ""Inseminoid"" also has the distinction of being one of the very first movies to be released on VHS (Betamax at that I believe) in the early '80s, where it had a successful rental run.  More recently in 1999 was this DVD reissue on Elite Entertainment, and the picture is letterboxed and a rather nice print, only showing its age in certain spots.  My only complaint is that they didn't use the cool, cheesy comic book-like original movie poster (see Wikipedia page) for the cover, not to mention the absence of any special features beyond a grainy, unrestored original trailer.

Despite reading a lot of negative reviews of this movie beforehand on the internet, for its interesting set design, enthusiastic gore scenes and fine British babes, I can honestly say I liked ""Inseminoid,""  and other film junkies with a sweet tooth for vintage B-movie trash from the early '80s should find something to savor here.",1362182400,2,3052,4.8934108527131785
7909444,3,B00000I1ZI,"A good low buget movie with Judy Geeson, but a 2.35:1 letterbox is rediculous.  Anything with that ratio should be anamorphic.  I have to hit the zoom on the widescreen tv and that soffens the image.  Don't know if it is cropped on top and bottom yet.  I'll have to see a vhs version.",1335312000,2,284,4.203703703703703
7909445,2,B00000I1ZI,"You may have stumbled across this as Horror Planet.  Then it was renamed and issued a new title, not unlike Contamination (not to be confused with Contagion) which was also released as Alien Contamination.  I'll breakdown the premise for you--as if the title didn't blatantly perform that task already.  A team sets out on an archaeological expedition to another planter investigating a tomb that when unreported from a previous, abandoned expedition.  Their goal is to identify the cause of extinction of an alien species.  Now since the planet's surface temperature is a constant 89 degrees below zero, and noting the title of the movie, I'm gonna' go ahead and guess that this un-heavenly body has been serving as a big alien sperm bank.

 The story jumpstarts when some of the investigators are spelunking through bauxite cave and see a moving shadowy figure inside a crusty white chrysalis-looking structure which, for no reason at all, just explodes!  An unconscious scientist is then rushed to the medical bay clinging to a handful of crystals which contain ""living matter.""  The ""exposed"" crew begin to exhibit a bit of space madness.  What maddened me was that neither these crystals nor the explosion were ever explained.  In fact, these scenes should not have been included in the movie.  Deleting them, with no replacement whatsoever, would actually improve the movie.

 This flirts with being an exploitation movie, but never quite crosses the line.  The alien resembles some anatomical structures you may recall high school sex ed.  When we first see the ""Inseminoid"" it is inseminating a female crew member (who, of course, is naked on an examination table).  As if possessed, the now-impregnated and considerably stronger woman gets a little stabby with a colleague.  Naturally this worked up an appetite, so then she eats a corpse.

 The violence (I hesitate to call it ""action"") is very poorly executed and complemented with the liberal overuse of blood.  Other gore is minimal and uncommon; a severed head prosthetic here, a cut up leg there.  I expected more.  I guess the F/X store ran out of rubber guts. I was hoping that some scenes would look like throwing a side of beef in a wood chipper.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Making matters worse, this movie really doesn't go anywhere.",1320451200,,2315,4.99738219895288
