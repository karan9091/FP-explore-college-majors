1265344,5,B00003CXE6,"By far the story and action in this movie are well synchronized it is based on actual characters and truth.  Maximus was the one fictional  character of a real story.  We don't know if it happened this way, but it  could of.  Marcus Aurealis dies one of the greatest of Roman Emperors and  the last of the golden age of Rome.  Only to be succeeded by his son,  Commedus, who was a vain, foolish, and comtemptable tyrant. I believed that  this story was stunning visually and dramatically, the effects were  delicious with just enough gore, to provide with one of the best stories I  have ever seen.  I was moved countless times, by all the characters.  Even  Commedus, the tyrant, you loved him and felt sorry for him, because he  didn't really want to be the tyrant, he wanted the love of his  father, and  without that he became horribly ambitious. Five stars just sometimes  doesn't seem good enough.",968889600,46,903,4.572327044025157

1265346,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator, played by Russel Crowe reveal in spectacular way the live of a  Roman General (Elius Maximus Decimus Meridius), that lives just at the end  of the time of the last Stoic Emperor (Marcus Aurelius).
This movie is  specialy detailed in the real way of combat, the social clases, the  politics, the power and defeat of the Roman Empire. For the people who  watch this movie with special attention and are really intrested in some  historical facts (even if the argument is not completely true) will find  the most grat movie ever made of the Roman Empire.
The roles played, the  action scenes, the combination between both of them makes this movie one of  the jewels of the 7th. art",966816000,,689,4.675

A clear line is shown between just plain  revenge and duty to country- going along with a dethroned General's motto:  strength and honor.  A classic, good guy vs. bad guy movie where the  protagonist is someone to look up to, someone with leadership  qualities.
A hand also for Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, who did the  score for this film!  Bravisimo!",965865600,,605,4.613207547169812

1266162,3,B00003CXE6,"so Russell Crow is a good gladiator  but i think the extended versions has too many bloody stumps! I remember some stumps fronm the first original standard ediation but this one, theres a scene at the beginnging and its just stumptown frankly and i tihnk its a bit gratiutious on the part of  the taleneted Mr. Ridley. Also i don't like at the end how they carry away Maximus's body  by the other body of the emporer is just lying there hellO! he's the emporer! i know hes evil and moody but an emporerer deserves respect in my view, according to the way i see things.

also this movie is not reocmmneded for children because i think many of them may be upset or offended by such bloodshead. i just hope we can live in a  world wihtout it one day, wherer the Senate has its rightful duties and out deficit isan't being spent on silly gladiator shows!!! just really makes you think aboutthe choices we made as a society, and if y ou think  about it, really very much relevent to our own time and lives today.",1512864000,,1007,4.329787234042553

1266448,1,B00003CXE6,"Extremely disappointed by the video browsing experience I had this evening.
I logged onto my Amazon account to search for ""The Gladiator"" - starring Russell Crowe.
Though upon my arrival to this page, I noticed the writer of the description of this most classic, best film from the year 2000(which is saying a lot seeing how ""Cast Away"", ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", and ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", were all also released in the year 2000), had the audacity to headline Joaquin Phoenix as the ""star"" of the film.
Now let me be clear, Phoenix had a pivotal role as Commodus and played his part with honor and unrivaled villainship, and is also an upstanding actor in films such as ""Her"", and ""Signs"", but to place him as the ""starring"" role in Gladiator? Excuse me? Have you ever heard of Maximus Decimus Meridius? Commander of the Armies of the North? General of the Felix Legions? And loyal servant to the TRUE emperor(not Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix), Marcus Aurelius? THAT man, is the true star of this film.
I don't want to come across as mad, and I'm not calling for this individual to be fired, as I'm sure he or she is a very kind person with a family to feed; I only ask that whoever wrote this description kindly watch this film(because clearly they haven't), and then change the ""starring"" role to Russell Crowe.

Thank you.

1266566,5,B00003CXE6,"What do you do when everything that could be done in a gladiator movie has been done? And the script is right out of the old Charles Bronson revenge movies for having family unjustly dispatched by evil authority. There can never be another, ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), a movie made in its time, for its time, and an untouchable classic.

This gladiator movie is for today's audience and may someday become a classic. Instead of having a splashy image like John Wayne, Russell Crowe has to blend in with the movie and the story. He must be ruthless and compassionate almost at the same time.

Of course if you just concentrate on Russell Crowe, you will miss many other great actors, not the least of which is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus. You can see him again as Brother Cadfael in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"".

What is this? The new Roman Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). See Joaquin again as Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line.""

1266884,5,B00003CXE6,"Having read the reviews when this Blu Ray was initially released, I opted to skip it and just live with the DVD version. Well, fast forward many years and after reading a few reviews stating that the problem had been fixed I decided to take a chance on it. I am happy to report that the Blu Ray now looks great. I looked for the code (B1R2) that one of the top reviewers had stated was the definitive way to tell if you have the new much improved discs and mine didi in fact have this code.

The new transfer looks and sounds about as good as can be expected. It has a film like quality, showing a fine layer of grain and detail, a few of the effects shots are slightly distracting, most notable the tiger in the arena, but if memory serves me correctly it has always looked a little fake.

The film itself is top notch and probably the best sword and dandle epic this side of Ben Hur (the original). Crowe is riveting as the Spaniard and the entire cast deliver wonderfully full characters Films like this are few and far between and a $7 for the 2 disc Blu Ray is a steal! It deserves all allocates it received and should be in every film collectors library. The extras are plentiful and there is an extended version of the film to boot. Is this Blu Ray perfect?

1266886,5,B00003CXE6,"Obviously it's very inaccurate historically ( really inaccurate about Marcus Aurelius in particular),  but I don't think the director intended it to be an exact portrayal of the emperor Commodus and his life and times. It feels more like a tribute to the things we still remember about Rome--- the Coliseum, the senators, the sculptures, and the crazy Julio Claudians. Commodus came across as more like Nero. Russell Crowe was natural in his role, and the emperor's sister evolved into a very interesting character over time. I was extremely impressed with Joaquin Phoenix and Derek Jacobi, their performances were superb.
My main complaint is the violence. Too much of it. We already know this subject matter is dark, hammering the point home is not necessary. A little more emphasis on the politics would have been more balanced.
My main praise is the focus on contrasting the two characters of Maximus and Commodus. The storytellers do a good job in showing that even in your most bitter moments you should not envy your enemies--- a wicked person has no rest, no peace, no real friends. Maximus goes through hell in the arena, Commodus goes through hell wherever he goes because he can never escape his guilty conscience.",1493337600,,1225,4.946601941747573

The first movie of the New Millenium to win the Oscar for 'Best Picture' and rugged and good looking Russell Crowe for 'Best Actor' of the year 2000 A.D., makes this a very, special film. Especially, since this is a Ridley Scott/Dream Works Home Entertainment Film that's a 3 disc DVD, boxed set, in the Extended Edition of GLADIATOR. Complete with a booklet of how it all started. The theme and visual affects are incredible. Set at the time of the Roman Empire in the north where the barbarians were stubbornly defiant, a general who is revered among his troops, is suddenly betrayed, and is forced into becoming a GLADIATOR, to avenge the unjust slaughter of his family. A hero before he ever started, this GLADIATOR will win your heart and your respect, as you cheer for him and his cause. Russell Crowe is absolutely brilliant in this role. And, the movie itself is so realistic, that you will want to jump into the television screen and help this GLADIATOR and his just cause. Incredible action and adventure with a deeply moving story. You can not help but be moved by the climactic ending. An epic film that will tug at your heart strings and leave a deep and lasting, impression. Without a doubt, an excellent and I mean..., a fantastic film.",1487894400,,1332,4.721030042918455

Legionnaires fought for the rather modern French government.  And of course we hear whispering when the characters the actors portray would not have whispered at all.  Hollywood recently realized that humans associate danger with whispering, so they try to keep your attention by having that ridiculous hushed speech when it would have been delivered at our normal conversational speech level instead.  Test my hypothesis.  When you watch movies made in the last 20 years or so, take note of how often the actors whisper.  Compare that to movies made 30 or 40 years ago.  You will discover a very transparent attempt to manipulate your mind.",1483488000,,775,5.2439024390243905

Gladiator in particular, fulfills all that criteria, and that's why I like it so much.

1267605,5,B00003CXE6,"Unless you've been living with Ridley Scott's Martian for the last 16 years, you can't possibly have not seen, much less not KNOW about his Gladiator.  I purchased this DVD when it was first released in 2000 and have managed to watch it over and over at least once or twice a year since.  Triplet this movie with his Kingdom Of Heaven and Robin Hood and you have a tour de force of considerable EPIC proportions, a word Scott is very familiar with: EPIC!

I recently picked up the 2010 Bluray remaster, wonderful transfer and glorious sound, but for economy, if you are still using DVD format (and what exactly is wrong with that anyway?) you have to have this in your collection.  The picture quality is still magnificent, the DTS sound is still magnificent, and if you have the right equipment, who needs the Bluray anyway?

Historically accurate?  Far from it, as historically accurate as Alien, Blade Runner, Prometheus, and The Martian, but together with Kingdom Of Heaven and Robin Hood, they are fantastic entertainment and most of all Gladiator has heart, probably more heart than any other Ridley Scott film.  That is what was lacking in Exodus Gods & Kings, it fell flat because of a serious lack of heart.

If you are looking for good quality film transfer and sound, buy the DVD.  If you are looking for incredible film quality and sound, buy the Bluray (the 2010 version).",1476316800,3,1385,4.690082644628099
1267606,5,B00003CXE6,Russel Crowe is at his best.  Well scripted.,1476057600,,44,4.5
1267607,4,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator shoots the audience straight into the heart of the Middle Ages taking viewers on an adventure alongside the renowned Roman general, Maximus Meridius. The movie embarks on an emotional roller coaster as the wild adventure with Maximus begins leaving audiences astounded with the movies story and characters. With the incredible soundtrack, acting, and cinematography, the movie places viewers right in the center of the story and medieval ages.

As the movie begins, it effectively introduces the Roman Age around 180 CE as the Roman Empire is expanding its territory. In turn, this allows for an easy opening to the movie as it explains exactly what is going on when it all begins in the heat of a battle. Gladiator is a very easy movie for anyone to watch, as no prior knowledge is needed to understand. Few words are used or even needed to know exactly who the main character is and what is going on. Many times during the movie they let the perfectly executed acting tell the story. The body language alone gives details on the personality of characters and tone of the scene.

The superb costume design and makeup compliment perfectly with the actors performance during Gladiator. Viewers will soon find themselves secretly cheering for Maximus and against anyone standing between him and his goal, as there is an emotional connection made with the characters. As the second main character is introduced with his grim soft voice, shadowy eyes and aggressive manner, he is instantly known as the evil of the movie and viewers acquire an enmity towards him. The emotions that are felt make viewers pick a side to root for.

A good movie always has a soundtrack to wrap everything together, and Gladiator had its soundtrack spot on. The upbeat pace of the songs prepares for the upcoming battle. Likewise, a slower, softer song sets the mood for an emotional or dramatic scene. As Maximus walks through the city, ambient sounds of people talking, animals, wagons and many other background noises are heard, bringing the audience along with Maximus down the cobblestone streets of Rome. Similarly, during a battle, swords and yells of the warriors will be heard.

The soundtrack of the movie goes hand in hand with the movies cinematography. Scenes are the correct length, not allowing viewers to get bored, but being direct enough to get the information needed. Along with that, as the scenes switch, attention is instantly brought back (if for any reason it was gone) with a quick event at the beginning of the scene. This can be as little as someones face right in the camera or a catapult being fired at the ominous opposing army. The first seconds of each scene set the mood and tone while, at the same time, reeling viewers more and more into this movie.

Gladiator is a movie that draws audiences in and makes them want more. For a two-and-a-half-hour long movie, the twists and turns of the plot will make sure attention doesnt drift elsewhere. Spectators find themselves trying to look ahead and pinpoint the foreshadows, only to realize a previous scene was foreshadowing the event just shown, sparking an epiphany. The movie does a great job of making the viewer question and think since some scenes may be controversial during that time, as the citizens question the Kings power and their adoration starts to drift the other direction. This is a must see for all movie-goers.",1475539200,,3397,4.890625

1268149,4,B00003CXE6,"In 180 A.D., Emperor Marcus Aurelius' twelve-year war against the barbarian tribes in Germania was coming to an end. Maximus (Russell Crowe), a high-ranking military commander has sacrificed of himself to fight for the Roman empire. The Emperor Aurelius in gratitude for Maximus' service, has anointed him the next emperor over his own son, Commodus. Enraged, Commodus will not be denied becoming the rightful heir to the throne, and he hastened Marcus' death by smothering him. Maximus is forced into slavery and gladiatorial combat, a sport, to entertain the proletariat. Maximus soon gains favor and plaudits with the populous to the Emperor's chagrin. Commodus can't rid himself of Maximus, because that would make him a martyr and further anger the Roman people. The true story is that Marcus Aurelius (121-180 A.D.) ruled from 161-180 A.D., and he died in a Roman army camp in the city that later became Vienna, not at the hands of his son. Marcus was more humane and dedicated to the service of Rome than any of his predecessors. Yet as emperor he was a miserable failure. Under his reign, the Roman Empire began to decline, and it didn't recover for a millennium. He didn't have the requisite vision to solve the empire's problems, either the domestic economic stagnation or the foreign policy issues. He was in the grips of long and indecisive battles in the Middle East (Parthia) and in Europe (Germania). These wars were a financial sink-hole that drained much needed resources from more prosperous times under Trajan and Hadrian. The treasury department was so broke that imperial jewels and gold had to be auctioned off to buy grains to feed the people. Pestilence and plague was epidemic with a loss of one-quarter of the population, causing manpower shortages. Marcus' biggest blunder was permitting his son, Commodus, to succeed him. His disastrous rule lasted from 180-192 A.D. Under Marcus' military campaign against the Germans, Rome was on the cusp of victory and the annexation of a strategically crucial territory in central Europe. However, through Commodus' impetuousness he abandoned these initiatives and called for a peace treaty with the Germans. He returned home to pursue his love of gladiatorial sports that he was obsessed with since early youth. He was a vigorous, virile physical specimen that relished the challenge in the gladiatorial arena. His vicious nature got him assassinated which then brought on a civil war and ultimately to the empire's collapse.",1466812800,,2492,5.125307125307125

Since its 2 disc as soon as I opened the case I mistook the special features disc for the movie disc and read B2R1 on the inner ring...I almost destroyed the entire set just before I noticed i held the wrong disc; the remastered bluray movie does indeed have B1R2 written in the disc.......its B1R2 for the remastered.

Forced into slavery by the corrupt, incestuous heir to the throne, Roman general Maximus [Russell Crowe] becomes a gladiator. His prowess in the arena will eventually lead him to Rome, the Colosseum and a vengeful showdown with the new emperor. An Academy Award winning masterpiece, GLADIATOR is an epic film story-telling brought thrillingly into the 21st century by master director Ridley Scott [Blade Runner and Alien].

FILM FACT No. 1: Awards and Nominations: 2000 73rd Academy Awards: Win: Best Picture. Win: Best Actor in a Leading Role for Russell Crowe. Win: Best Visual Effects. Win: Best Costume Design.

Nominated: Best Production Design. 2000 58th Golden Globe Awards: Nominated: Best Motion Picture in a Drama. Nominated: Best Original Score for Motion Picture.

FILM FACT No. 2: The film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scenes in the forests of Germania were shot in three weeks in the Bourne Woods, near Farnham, Surrey in England. When Ridley Scott learned that the Forestry Commission planned to remove the forest, he convinced them to allow the battle scene to be shot there and burn it down. Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and a 45-degree shutter, creating stop motion effects in the action sequences. Subsequently, the scenes of slavery, desert travel, and gladiatorial training school were shot in Ouarzazate, is a City in Morocco just south of the Atlas Mountains over a further three weeks. To construct the arena where Maximus has his first fights, the crew used basic materials and local building techniques to manufacture the 30,000-seat mud brick arena. The scenes of Ancient Rome were shot over a period of nineteen weeks in Fort Ricasoli, Malta. Finally, the rest of the Colosseum was created in computer-generated imagery using set-design blueprints and textures referenced from live action, and rendered in three layers to provide lighting flexibility for compositing in Flame and Inferno software. The wounds on Russell Crowes face after the opening battle scene are real, caused when his horse startled and backed him into tree branches. In the Colosseum scenes, only the bottom two decks are actually filled with people. The other thousands of people are computer-animated.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Universal Pictures and DreamWorks studio and producer-director Ridley Scott took a big risk sinking more than $100 million into GLADIATOR [2000], the kind of film that had long since fallen out of favour in Hollywood. What has become known as the ""sword-and-sandal"" epic had its heyday in the 1950s with a number of big budgets with American and international productions, not to mention many cheap knockoffs. Set in Greek, Roman, and biblical times. Decades after the genre's popularity had waned, this drama of revenge set in the 2nd century scored big, grossing nearly four times its cost and garnering generally good reviews, not to mention numerous awards, which garnered these awards because the film had cool battle scenes, hand-to-hand combat, togas that we have waited a long time for a sword and sandals epic.

The plot of GLADIATOR centres on the most trusted and valiant of Emperor Marcus Aurelius' commanders, the fictional Maximus Decimus Meridias, for whom the end of a successful 12-year campaign against the barbarian tribes of Germania should have meant a return to his beloved family and farm. Upon the emperor's death, however, power is transferred to his son, Commodus, a real historical figure pictured here with a consuming jealousy over the esteem his father held for the young general. Maximus narrowly escapes being killed by Commodus' guard, but his wife and son are murdered. Falling into the hands of a slave trader, he trains as a gladiator, becoming one of the most popular and successful, all the while plotting his revenge on the evil Commodus.

In addition to elaborate action scenes on the battlefield and gladiatorial arenas and special effects that helped simulate the power and majesty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott's venture was also greatly aided by the casting of Russell Crowe as Maximus. The role was reportedly first offered to and rejected by Mel Gibson; fellow Australian Russell Crowe was cast after considerable acclaim for his work in L.A. Confidential [1997] and The Insider [1999]. Russell Crowe earned an Academy Award for his performance here and rose to major stardom. Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott teamed up again for another period action tale with some factual basis, Robin Hood [2010], which was a complete shambles and total embarrassment, because Russell Crowe kept changing his accent and Ridley Scott said he wanted the Robin Hood film to incorporates true historical figures and events much as GLADIATOR does, well obviously not, as it was a total box office flop and I am not surprised, as the film was a total laughing stock and to have an Australian as the character as Robin Hood, is the most ludicrous and embarrassing thing Ridley Scott has ever contemplated and should of chosen and English actor to play the part and I am glad I did not waste my money going to see that film.

Joaquin Phoenix, who gained weight to play Commodus and a role Jude Law tested for, also saw his career stakes rise considerably after GLADIATOR, which earned him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. The film garnered Academy Awards for Best Picture, Sound, Visual Effects, and Costume Design, as well as six other nominations, including Best Director for Ridley Scott. The blockbuster brought in around four dozen additional awards worldwide and numerous nominations for every aspect of the production.

GLADIATOR was the last film role for veteran British actor and legendary hell raiser Oliver Reed, who died of an off-set heart attack before completing his part as gladiator trainer Proximo. In the original screenplay the character survives an assault by Commodus' Praetorian Guards, but upon Reed's death, the story was rewritten to have him die in the attack. The character's final moments on screen were created with body doubles and some very deft CGI using Reed's own face.

When DreamWorks executives first pitched the project to Ridley Scott, they didn't even show him a script, so the potential director was understandably wary of taking on a genre that had become a joke. Then they showed him the famous 1872 Grme painting ""Pollice Verso"" (translated as ""Thumbs Down"") depicting a gladiator receiving the sign to kill his opponent. ""They really had me,"" Scott told Entertainment Weekly at the time of the film's May 2000 release. ""I hadn't even read the script and I was sitting there begging."" Russell Crowe later said, the same painting was one of the things that reversed his initial reluctance to accept the lead.

David Franzoni's early script, inspired by Daniel Mannix's history of the Roman games, focused primarily on how sports heroes are slavishly worshipped by fans, and he developed an idea about commercialized gladiators making endorsements on frescoes, chariots, even jars of olive oil. Russell Crowe found this to be a rather cynical take on life in ancient times and thought the hero was not sufficiently fleshed out and Russell Crowe was eager to play the part. One obstacle, however, needed to be surmounted; Russell Crowe had packed on 38 pounds to play the anti-Tobacco whistle-blower in The Insider, so he began working out to get into fighting shape, a process that took much longer than he anticipated. He also trained with a sword master in Australia for nearly six months. Luckily Crowe, who owns a 560-acre ranch hours from Sydney, was already an expert horseman.

All his training notwithstanding, the actor took considerable lumps on the set. He cracked a bone in his foot, fractured a hip, had to get stitches in his cheek, seriously wrenched two bicep tendons, and cut one of his fingers so badly that by the time of the film's premier, he had still not regained the feeling in his fingertip. The physical strains were matched by those provided by the lack of a completed screenplay when production began. At some point, it was decided another act was needed, necessitating new writers being brought on board and a move to locations in Morocco, in addition to the original locations in England and Malta.

Besides using a still-intact 17th century fort in Malta, a replica of the Colosseum was built there, costing more than a million dollars and taking two and a half months to build. The final set was a reportedly breath-taking 40 percent of the full scale of the original, two tiers high as opposed to the real Colosseum's four. The rest was added digitally. Richard Harris, who plays the aged Emperor Marcus Aurelius, had been cast many years earlier as Commodus in one of the last of the great ""sword-and-sandal"" epics of the time, The Fall of the Roman Empire [1964], but quit after artistic differences with director Anthony Mann.

Like many of the great Hollywood historical epics, GLADIATOR is the story of the triumph of a heroic figure over seemingly-insurmountable odds. In this case, he is a slave taking on the most powerful man in the world  the Emperor of Rome. The ending may be an unlikely, although, from Commodus' point-of-view, it could be a shrewd move if handled properly, but it is as exhilarating and satisfying as the final. As spectacles go, GLADIATOR has a great deal to recommend it. The film never fails to be involving and entertaining, and there are plenty of moments designed to stir the adrenaline. Additionally, the screenplay manages to avoid the trap of predictability. The villains are at least as smart as the heroes, and far more ruthless.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Pictures / DreamWorks Pictures UK Release Blu-ray is faithfully presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio with a competent, technically proficient 1080p encoded image transfer and is a really good stable 1080p encoded image transfer and a serious step up all round. The image itself is spotless, the picture rock solid in frame, the sharpness and picture detail crisp and the colour largely naturalistic. The contrast is punchy throughout and when the lighting is favourable this results in a really pleasing image, but in darker scenes this can result in some of the detail being sucked in to get those solid black levels, though no more so than on the previous inferior DVD. On the whole, this is a very fine job all round. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Pictures / DreamWorks Pictures UK Blu-ray Release in a very impressive and dramatic 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix features outstanding and surprisingly gripping bass levels heard almost from the beginning and notable throughout. Dialogue has been spread across the front soundstage rather than being done directionally, but its always clear and precise, but sometimes the actors speak very softly and I sometimes had a job to hear what they said, especially ii there was music in the background. And the rear surround channel carries some interesting sound effects sound effects are clear and those dramatic moments in the score come through with suitable vigour and without distortion. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrards music score gets woven impressively throughout the entire two channel sound mix experience. This is a solid presentation of the spectacular audio elements.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

DISC 1:

Special Feature: Extended Version MMV A.D. with introduction by Ridley Scott: Here we get a short introduction from the director Ridley Scott, where he informs us, Im Ridley Scott and what you are about to see if you press play for the Extended Version MMV A.D. of GLADIATOR, this is not the Directors Cut, the directors cut is the length of what went out to the theatres [cinemas], which is the one you have probably already seen and this Extended Version MMV A.D. has a lot of scenes in it that was removed at the editing process for the Theatrical Version MM A.D. and might be worth seeing.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe: Director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe settle in for an analysis of the Extended Version MMV A.D. of the film GLADIATOR, and it's all very compelling, substantive discussion that hits the ground running. Both men articulate their thoughts in an intelligent, enthusiastic manner, and although they sprinkle in plenty of lively anecdotes, their discussion remains focused and serious throughout. The two touch upon almost every topic imaginable that relates to the film, including the rigors of the shooting schedule, various locations, character motivations, individual performances, and creative differences. You name it, it's here. Best of all, Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe enjoy a relaxed, symbiotic rapport that makes this lengthy track an easy listen.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Ridley Scott, Editor Pietro Scalia and Cinematographer John Mathieson: Director Ridley Scott, along with Editor Pietro Scalia and Cinematographer John Mathieson features with this particular commentary with an analysis of the Theatrical Version MM A.D. of the film GLADIATOR. This is a far more technical presentation and a little harder to slog through. The subdued tone isn't as engaging, though the information conveyed is always interesting. Topics include the challenges of recreating ancient history, untraditional filming and narrative methods, CGI effects, the film's operatic tone, and the production's intense collaborative spirit, to name but a few.

DISC 2:

Special Feature: Visions from Elysium: Topic Portal [2005] [480i] Here you get to view almost 300 individual titled categories that is spread over Eleven pages that are available to choose covering every imaginable aspect of the production of behind-the-scenes of the film GLADIATOR. To view each individual titled category content you just click on each title to know more information about the film GLADIATOR. To be honest, this special feature extra is a complete waste of time, because what you view is repeated in the other special features on this Disc 2. If like me you find this tedious, too time consuming and utterly boring, but you have not experienced and do not fancy trying it out, then you are not missing anything and as far as I am concerned this should never have been included on Disc 2. What makes me so very angry is all the Blu-ray Reviews I have read on the internet, give this item high praise; well to me these people are total nerds and total idiots!

Maximus Uncut: Between Takes with Russell Crowe [2000] [480i] [1.78:1] [7:58] This is a typical goof reel filled with all sorts of clowning from Russell Crowe, as well as interacting with other actors.

My 'GLADIATOR' Journal by Spencer Treat Clark [2000] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:58] This is a diary (with photos) of the film's shoot by the young actor who portrayed Connie Nielsen's son.

Trailers [2000] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:36] here you get to view two Theatrical trailers of the film GLADIATOR. You can either watch them separately or Play All.

TV Spots [2000] [480i] [1.37:1] [8:53] Here you get to view 20 separate title categories relating to the film GLADIATOR, for an extensive American television promotional campaign and they are as follows: The General; Heart & Soul; Woman Torn; Heart & Soul Cutdown; Journey Revised; Ruled by Force revised; Battle Revised; Battle Cutdown Revised; Everything; Forbidden; Daughter of an Emperor; Glorious Review; Glorious Short Review; Forbidden Love; Majestic Review; Revised #1 Review and Revised #1 Majestic Review.

BONUS: The Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook includes a 40-page stunning booklet about the film GLADIATOR. It also has extensive detail information that includes: HOW IT ALL STARTED. INSPIRATION. CREATING WORLDS. THE PRODUCTION. ROMAN INFLUENCE. THE CHALLENGE. THE GAMES. THE CAST. LET THE GAMES BEGIN. SOLDIERS, SOVEREIGNS AND SENATORS and SWORDPLAY. Plus wonderful stunning rare colour photographs with extensive scenes from the film.

Finally, GLADIATOR is the epic film that brought back the historical epic genre and to this day, it still stands as one of the very best. The movie truly captures the lives of the gladiators, who were forced to overcome wave after wave of endless battalions in hopes of receiving their freedom. This is the best aspect of the movie, gladiators in Roman times, truly were glorified by the public, the more violent the show they put on, the more the crowd enjoyed it. GLADIATOR also gives us one of the most badass heroes of recent memory, Maximus, played by Russell Crowe who ended up winning an Oscar for Best Actor. In the brief scene where we see him as a general, he is everything you could want in a hero, compassionate, smart, and courageous in the face of an enemy. He immediately wins over the audience as the remorseful general who wishes for nothing more than peace. But once the tale of Maximus takes a turn for the worse, the film flourishes with ideas and becomes an amazing spectacle, just like real life gladiatorial fights. If history is something that interests you, especially Roman history, Gladiator certainly is a must see film. It also happens to be one of the more action-heavy Best Picture winners of all time. Highly Recommended!

1268614,5,B00003CXE6,"When this movie first came out, I resisted seeing it because I was afraid it would be too gory and violent and was only about conflict in the arena.  When I finally did see it, I was captured by its hauntingly beautiful music and the story of a man of principle who perseveres and earns the respect of his fellow slaves, despite the cruelty that has made him a slave.  Russell Crowe is wonderful in the lead role.  He has such presence and  portrays the lead character in  a deeply, almost spiritual  manner.  There is a quality of self containment and quiet confidence despite the odds against him.  It is a touching story and the music is so beautiful and fits the story so well.  Yes, there are some gory scenes, but I find myself watching this movie again and again and just averting my eyes in the gory parts.  I have to laugh at myself for all the resistance I felt toward it initially.  Now it is one of my all time favorite movies.",1457049600,2,939,4.308571428571429
1268615,5,B00003CXE6,"I went to every movie/record store in town looking for this and everywhere it was a minimum of $20. I bought it here for $3+Shipping. This is a great movie. I love Ridley Scott and although this is not a directors cut it does add some length to the film which allows for further character development. Some of the extra scenes are dialogue heavy so if you were looking for extended fight scenes this may not be for you but if you are like me and love to see a character mature throughout a film this is a must have. The special feature documentaries and featurettes are really interesting and give a good insight into just how much work and planning this movie took. Did you know that originally Ridley Scott wanted to have Maximus fight a Rhino in the Colosseum? You heard me right, A freaking RHINO!

1268798,5,B00003CXE6,Incredible. Truly one of Ridley Scott's best films.

1269213,5,B00003CXE6,"One of the best movies of all time for me. Russell Crowe is a truly a courageous hero in this movie and the musical score by Hans Zimmer is excellent. The first Battle at the Coliseum, supposedly in celebration of the Romans defeat of Hannibal and his  Barbarians, the Gladiators being the Barbarians, the Gladiators win, and at the end of the battle,  Russell Crowe is shown on a white horse with sword raised in hand to emphasize their victory. The music at the end of the Battle where Crowe is on his white horse with sword, is so fine, and emphasisis the courage of all these men. Russell Crowe was the leader, telling them to all stick together and they will have a better chance of survival. And they won. One of maybe six motion pictures I never get sick of. Crowe goes from the highest ranking General in the Roman Army and Chosen as heir to the thrown by Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), to a defeated family man who's family was murdered by Roman soldiers at Commodus commands. Commodus commits patricide by killing his father (Richard Harris, one of my favorite actors who played the The Biblical characters of Abraham and John the Apostle towards the end of his career). He steals the thrown. and has the family of Maximus murdered.

 Maximus becomes the Gladiator that wins the crowd (mob) and defies the emperor. Commodus. Commodus becomes a megalomaniac emperor who has incestuous feelings for his sister and wants to dissolve the Senate. Lucius, the son of Lucilla, Commodus' sister, is in constant danger from Commodus, the mad emperor, even though Lucius is his nephew.  Crowe and Commodus compete for survival in the Coliseum.  Commodus stabs Russell Crowe in the side before the battle begins to create an edge for himself in this battle. Towards the end of the battle, Commodus looses his sword and asks the Romans surrounding the battle for a sword. Quintas, a Roman officer tells the men to sheath their swords. (Quintas also saw Commodus stab Maximus in the side before the battle).  Commodus is left with a small knife and tries to kill Maximus. In this struggle, Maximus turns the knife back on Commodus and thrusts it into his throat. Lucilla, who loves Maximus, runs to see Maximus who is dying from the wound by Commodus. The first thing that Maximus says to Lucilla is, ""Lucius (her son) is safe.""  Commodus had been a threat to Lucius especially after Lucilla planned an early escape for Maximus. She had to tell Commodus of her plan concerning Maximus' , or Commodus would have killed her son.  Love this movie. When is is showing next?",1437609600,,2569,4.703786191536748

1269270,3,B00003CXE6,"Everyone loves Gladiotor. I first saw this movie when I was a young teen and just getting into watching R rated movies. I was blown away by the graphic violence and mature content. In recent years it hasn't held up as well as an adult.

The story is very derivative and it's very similar to the story of Moses from the bible. The guy who's on top of the world is suddenly betrayed and drug down to the bottom where he has to work his way up so he can get his revenge and free his people. I can handle a basic and unoriginal story but if there's nothing new being brought to the table and minimal twists and turns to hold my interest then it will be largely forgettable. What about characters? Crowe is honestly pretty generic. It's like he read the script in two minutes and said, ""I got this."" There just isn't enough brought to the character for me to think it's Oscar worthy. Phoenix is a highlight here simply because he's so over the top and looks like he's having a blast with his role. It's a generic villian but he played him well.

The supporting characters are mostly forgettable. They are played well but there's nothing really to them so if and when a character dies, while it's definately messed up, it's just not that big of a deal. The only supporting character that really stood out to me was Proximo and that's because the actor playing him does a really great job. He's one of the few here to look like he's really trying to bring this character to life and make this movie special and it helps. Outside of The Emporer and Proximo there's just generic and uninteresting characters.

All in all it works as a historical fiction action film, but as a serious epic that won all these oscars I just don't agree with that. It's strengths are not enough to outweigh the unoriginal story and largely uninteresting characters. It looks nice and the action is fun, but that doesn't make an epic that will be remembered as a true classic.",1435968000,,1946,4.415041782729805

Responding to consumer concerns that their previous Blu-ray edition of ""Gladiator"" used too much edge enhancement and noise reduction in the high-def transfer, DreamWorks/Universal have reissued the disc, this time with less processing of the picture.  For details about the new PQ and how you might obtain the disc if you already own the earlier BD edition, you can skip on down to the Video section of the review.  Otherwise, take your time and read about the movie.

""At my signal, unleash hell.""

With ""Gladiator,"" it's d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again:  ""Quo Vadis,"" ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" ""Ben Hur,"" ""Spartacus.""  I thought we'd left the sword-and-scandal epics behind us forty or fifty years ago, but director Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner,"" ""Alien,"" ""Legend,"" ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Robin Hood"") resurrected the genre in 2000 and produced a rousing if less-than-cerebral version of the species for the new millennium.  What the film lacks in intellect, historical fact, and common sense, it more than makes up for in action, spectacle, and grandeur.  Appropriately, DreamWorks Home Entertainment present it in a Blu-ray set that's loaded with more extras than would fit in a Roman coliseum.

The story begins in the late second century at the end of a twelve-year campaign by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) against some upstart barbarian tribes in Germania.  The Emperor's main man, his general, is Maximus (Russell Crowe), a strong, silent type who wins the war for him.  The Romans triumph the way they always did--with superior numbers, superior cavalry, and superior tactics.  Thank Maximus for this last turn.  At this juncture, Marcus is old and knows he's coming to the end of his reign, and back in Rome the senators find themselves divided on whether an Emperor should continue to rule or the senate should take over.  The old Emperor doesn't want his son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), to inherit his title because he recognizes Commodus for what he is--a weak, selfish, sniveling, immature tyrant.  In consequence, Marcus tries to hand over his authority to Maximus, naming him in private ""Protector of Rome.""  But Commodus beats the old man to the punch.  Before Maximus can tell anyone about the old Emperor's plans, the treacherous Commodus murders his father, assumes the emperorship, and orders Maximus executed.

Maximus escapes, only to find that Commodus has had his wife and son murdered and his villa torched.  The next thing we know, and don't ask how or why, slave traders capture Maximus and sell him to a gladiatorial school (shades of ""Spartacus"").  From there he returns to Rome and confronts the new young Emperor.  Thus, we get a plot.

Connie Nielsen is also in the cast, as Lucilla, Commodus's sister, for whom he continually lusts in a ""Caligula"" sort of way.  Derek Jacobi (remember him from ""I, Claudius""?) is Senator Gracchus, an ally of Maximus.  And Oliver Reed is the slave owner, Proximo, a role he was unable to finish because he died before the film wrapped, and he had to have some of his work completed digitally.  So, look for an imitation Oliver Reed late in the story.

Basically, then, ""Gladiator"" works as a tried-and-true revenge plot.  The bad guy kills the hero's family, and the hero tries to get even.  DreamWorks's tag line for the film is, ""The general who became a slave.  The slave who became a gladiator.  The gladiator who defied an empire.""  That's about the size of things as the story unfolds over the course of two-and-a-half to nearly three hours, depending on which account of the story you watch, because the BD set contains both the theatrical version at 152 minutes and the extended cut at 171 minutes.

""We who are about to die salute you.""

The movie's primary claim to fame is its fight scenes, both in and out of the arena.  Director Ridley Scott gets a lot of work from his participants, the warfare often reminding one in their energy and violence of the down-and-dirty conflicts on the football fields in Oliver Stone's ""Any Given Sunday.""  Indeed, the comparison between the bloody Roman games of the past and the brutal sports of today is apt.  In both cases, the combat is hot and heavy, with, naturally, the Romans coming out ahead in the blood-and-gore department.  Nor is the film's R rating undeserved.  Indeed, the film glorifies the very thing the Romans so loved and our modern, civilized world outwardly deplores--the spectacle of death and destruction as entertainment.  I guess times haven't changed that much, after all.

Do be aware that the film may disappoint those viewers looking to find another ""Spartacus.""  Russell Crowe is a fine actor and does his best with the title role, but the script almost never calls upon him to do much more than look good in a breastplate.  In fact, he makes Kirk Douglas, always an underrated actor seem like Laurence Olivier.  But, then, Douglas had more to work with, including a script that allowed him some personal feelings to show through.  Crowe, on the other hand, appears always to be at a distance, always a degree removed from any real human emotion, which, I suppose, is part and parcel of his character's personality.  ""Gladiator"" is an action movie above all, and in between the battle sequences the intensity slows down considerably.

In addition to its action, where ""Gladiator"" scores heavily is in its digital special effects, which will come off as either awesome or phony, depending on how you look at it.  A studio no longer has to produce an outer-space, sci-fi adventure anymore to benefit from the miracles of the computer age.  Here, the CGI shows us the glories of ancient Rome in vivid, extravagant detail, with all the city's multitude of people, its grand, imperial buildings, its central Forum, and its spectacular architecture.  But will it convince everyone?  Some viewers, for instance, will find the Roman coliseum in the film magnificent and persuasive to behold.  Yet, the visual-effects folks constructed about three-quarters of it on a monitor screen, which may upset the sensibilities of viewers who find it looks too fake.  The new high-definition picture quality will likely only fuel the fires of contention in the matter.

Video:
Because some consumers felt that DreamWorks had applied too much edge enhancement and noise filtering to the earlier Blu-ray release of ""Gladiator,"" the studio remastered it.  Their official statement is as follows:  ""We are implementing a limited exchange program. This program is only for those consumers that may have preferential issues with some of the technical DVNR (digital video noise reduction) and EE (edge enhancement) choices made in the original source transfer, and so would prefer to exchange it for one that addresses those preferences in a different manner.

While the version that we originally distributed was of the highest quality, some enthusiasts may prefer to view it without the Edge Enhancement and DVNR implemented as standard process in bringing the film to hi-def. This new master resolves those issues.""

Now, about that picture quality.  As with most of Ridley Scott's work, ""Gladiator"" is not only figuratively dark in tone but quite literally dark as well, its colors running high to bluish-greys and dusty browns.  Frankly, the film never looked all that good to me in a theater.  On the earlier transfer, DreamWorks used a fair amount of DNR and edge enhancement to make the picture cleaner and sharper.  In the process, they smoothed over some of the picture's finer details and added halos around many of the objects.  The dynamic noise reduction filtered out some of the film's natural print grain, while at the same time giving some of the scenes a pasty look that wasn't entirely realistic.  Worse, the edge enhancement created some clearly visible halos, particularly noticeable on very large screens or sitting as close to the TV as I do.  At times the picture could be crystal clear, with terrific detail, and at other times it looked faded and washed out.  Moreover, it appeared that the video engineers did not apply DNR or edge enhancement consistently; they applied it to select scenes to varying degrees.  So depending on what you were watching, the picture could look from good to better to surprisingly mediocre.  In terms of edge enhancement in the older transfer, I noticed some evidence of EE in about half the scenes I analyzed.  Yet it seemed to be around spears that I noticed it the most.  There were times when every spear carried by every soldier positively glowed with halos, as though they were lit up like lightsabers.

So, what's the deal now?  To begin with, the studio still offers the movie on a dual-layer BD50, and they still use an MPEG-4 codec to reproduce the movie in its native aspect ratio, 2.35:1.  I compared the two versions by placing them in separate Panasonic Blu-ray players hooked up to almost identical televisions (Sony XBR's) in separate rooms.  (I have both sets adjusted for as near-identical picture quality as possible, with the sets' sharpness controls and noise reduction turned off.)  At that point, I watched through the entire film from the new transfer, and then I compared select scenes (in excerpts and in pause), going back and forth between the two rooms to do so (even if I had both Blu-ray players connected to the same television, the HDMI handshake requires about six or seven seconds to negotiate, about the same time it took me to walk from one room to the other).

Results:  The most obvious improvement in the new transfer is the absence of edge enhancement.  Where in the old transfer I had found EE in at least half the scenes I watched, I could find none in the new transfer.  No more Roman soldiers with lightsabers.  Of course, it also means the new picture looks occasionally softer.  So be it; there's no doubt it looks better.

The decreased use of DNR (Dynamic Noise Reduction) on the latest transfer, however, is not quite so easy to appreciate.  The new PQ does look slightly grainier, with faces more lined and detail bolder, but it's probably not enough to make an irrefutable case for everyone.  What did stand out to me is that the colors on the new transfer appear stronger, more intense.  I'm not sure why.  Perhaps it's a result of not applying as much noise filtering this time, or perhaps the video engineers decided to enhance the film's appearance.  The hues, especially facial tones, yellows, and blues, are definitely deeper.  I'm not sure they are any more lifelike (people now look as though they have darker tans), but I suppose it's a matter of taste, because if I hadn't had the two versions to compare, I would have said the new transfer displays fine, rich, vivid colors.  Which it does.

The problem for me, as I say, is that I didn't care much for Ridley Scott's original vision for the movie's appearance, thinking it too dusky dull and drab in a theater.  On this remastered Blu-ray disc the images show up more plushly, more opulently than I remember them from a theater.  Do I like what I see, and do I think the new BD mastering is an improvement over the older one?  Yes and yes.  The absence of edge enhancement and DNR and the more-intense colors are the most obvious differences, but you'll have to decide for yourself if you prefer the new version over what you may remember from the theater.  I like what I see here.

Audio:
Although the video will remain in question for some viewers, the audio is quite good, the English track coming to us via DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  In DTS Master Audio, the audience can hear catapult launchings, arrows flaming, swords clanging, and heads rolling from all directions, truly a vigorous ""surround"" sound.  Equally important, there are strong impacts involved and a wide dynamic range.  In fact, the dynamic range--the difference in sound level between the softest and loudest passages--may be so wide that it will give more than a few listeners fits.  If you turn the volume up high enough to hear the dialogue, you're likely to be knocked out of your chair when a louder noise pops up.  Keep it in mind.

My only serious reservations with the audio are, first, with the bass, which, while certainly loud, isn't really as deep as I would have expected.  It's not exactly room-rumbling as some soundtracks can be.  And, second, the dialogue, even turned up, is not always as clearly rendered as it could be, and on a few occasions I had to replay a line or two to hear what the characters were saying.  Still, these are not serious concerns in a soundtrack that otherwise comes off quite impressively.

Extras:
Disc one of this two-disc Blu-ray set includes the feature film in both its theatrical and extended editions; twenty-eight scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages;
English, French, Spanish, and Korean subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Additionally, disc one contains an audio commentary by director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe; ""The Scrolls of Knowledge,"" a trivia track newly enhanced with focal points and featurettes, plus for the extended version a deleted scene marker; ""Visions from Elysium: Topic Marker,"" during which you may mark items of interest for viewing on disc two; and a very brief, thirty-second introduction to the movie's extended version by director Ridley Scott.  Interestingly, Scott tells us that the extended version is not the Director's Cut; that is the theatrical version.

Disc two contains the bulk of the bonus items, and they are remarkably plentiful.  ""Visions from Elysium"" contains eleven pages full of short featurette choices, hundreds of them altogether, with an option to save your choices.  That's followed by the documentary series ""Strength and Honor:  Creating the World of Gladiator,"" which covers over three-and-a-quarter hours and eight chapters.  Whew!  Then there's ""Image and Design,"" which includes chapters on original storyboards, conceptual art, production notes, weapons, and still galleries.  Next, we find five abandoned sequences and deleted scenes.  And, finally, there is ""The Aurelian Archives,"" which includes featurettes on ""The Making of Gladiator,"" ""Gladiator Games:  Roman Blood Sport,"" ""Hans Zimmer:  Scoring Gladiator,"" ""VFX Explorations:  Germania and Rome,"" theatrical trailers and TV spots, and more.  In all, there are hours and hours of extras, which combined with the two versions of the movie must set a record for sheer time and numbers involved.  An attractively embossed slipcover encloses the double Blu-ray case and ties everything together.

Parting Thoughts:
To conclude, I would advise the viewer to enjoy and have fun with ""Gladiator"" but not to rely too heavily on Hollywood for real-life history.  This is a movie, after all, and the filmmakers meant it to be fun.  That it is, with stirring action, good performances, and a plethora of visual delights.  Even if you still have concerns with the high-definition video (and let's face it:  no transfer is going to satisfy everyone), ""Gladiator"" is an entertaining ride from beginning to end.",1433376000,2,15156,4.978918058870327

1270048,5,B00003CXE6,"Dream Works Home Entertainment and Universal Pictures present this colossal epic - GLADIATOR, directed by Award winning Director: Ridley Scott. This engrossing action and adventure drama is: Fantastic! Spectacular! And, absolutely magnificent!! It's a Ridley Scott Film, so what's not to like?! With breathtaking cinematography this superb motion picture is an epic for all time. It's the first movie of the New Millennium (2000 a.d.) to win the Academy Award Oscar for 'Best Picture', and rugged and good-looking Actor: Russell Crowe - who stars in the title role, won the 'Best Actor' Oscar for his mesmerizing portrayal of the GLADIATOR. Another reason this makes for a very special film, is the fact that this is an Extended Edition, color, 3-disc, DVD, boxed release. It comes complete with Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Digital Surround Sound and features an enormous and impressive cast. Namely: Joaquin Phoenix, Djimon Hounsou, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and Connie Nielson. The story's theme and content are nothing short of enthralling. Especially since, it focuses on the life of a man who courageously stood against evil and tyranny, an increasingly jealous and insane, young Roman Emperor. The year is 180 a.d. and the Roman Empire in it's exhaustive quest for geographic expansion within the northern frontier where the Barbarian Tribes in Germania were stubbornly defiant, a Roman General (Crowe) together with his brave troops, leads his soldiers to a resounding victory. And in so doing, Emperor Marcus Aurelius' 12-year military campaign to conquer the northern territory and it's people and bring it under Roman rule, came to a triumphant end. ""Roma Victor!"" Having witnessed this decisive and conclusive feat, Caesar was relieved and sought a private audience with the brave and honorable, General. As a reward for his brilliant victory, unswerving loyalty and forth right integrity, the aging Emperor - although he had a biological son, instead preferred that the Empire be ruled by the good General. However, his insecure and jealous son finds this unacceptable and does the unthinkable. He secretly murders his father - the Emperor, and then places the blame on and sets out too murder, the General. In addition to this insidious betrayal, his family is needlessly and viciously slaughtered and his land and fortune are seized. All the while, he is running for his life. But, not out of cowardice. No. He wants to stay alive to avenge the brutal and savage murders of his beautiful wife and child. Nearly dying of his own wounds that were sadistically inflicted upon him, he is forced into slavery and then as a means to get in close physical proximity of the ruthless, young Emperor that did him irreparable harm, the one-time General becomes a GLADIATOR. With his understandable righteous indignation and justifiable desire for revenge growing ever deeper within him, the now GLADIATOR, moves ever closer to confronting the evil and murderous, new Caesar. His military training and GLADIATORial exercises in both mind and body, made him an undaunting and powerful adversary to the unscrupulous and insecure Emperor. This visually stunning, epic achievement, magnificently depicts the GLADIATOR as a hero, before he ever started his fight for justice and revenge. This courageous GLADIATOR will definitely win your admiration and respect, as you can't help but cheer for him and his cause. Particularly, in the face of overwhelming odds. This compelling, extra-long film version is very graphic in violence, blood, guts and gore. Which is matched by the brutal and sadistic savagery which the corrupt Roman Emperor, subjects him, too. This intense motion picture from start to finish... is so realistic, that you will want to jump into your viewing screen and somehow assist this GLADIATOR, and further his just cause: Warranted revenge! To say the least, this riveting film is an incredible action and adventure drama with a deeply moving and very climactic ending. You can't help but have a reaction. It's a monumental achievement and a colossal epic, movie masterpiece which will tug at your heart strings and leave you with a lasting impression. An inspiring film of perseverance which is full of political intrigue, loyalty, devotion, determination, military and personal battles, corruption, blind ambition, devious deception, bloodshed, graphic human carnage and psychological warfare. This is without a doubt, phenomenal movie-making at it's best, which no DVD collector should be without. This film is well worthy of a 'Best Picture' Oscar and your viewing time. For it is truly, a magnificent epic, a brilliant film and an enormously entertaining movie. A definite keeper! Nina Kish",1424822400,,4727,5.270557029177719
1270049,5,B00003CXE6,"Crowe portrays the fictional character, loyal Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the emperor Marcus Aurelius's ambitious son, Commodus, murders his father and seizes the throne, and the general's family. Commodos means to kill Maximus when he will not support his claim as emporer, but Maximus escapes, only to be captured by traders and sold into slavery. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his emperor.

This movie focuses much on the politics of the time, and reveals the life of the gladiator. There is much action and Crowe and Phoenix play their parts well. This will become known as a classic and will endure for a long time. If I would make a list of top ten man-movies of all time, this would be high on my list.",1424822400,,829,4.7172413793103445

It starts of where his wife and son are killed. He is then taken prisoner and made to be a Roman Gladiator, at this point he becomes nothing more then a  vengeful  killer. It ends off with the crazy Emperor killing him dishonestly. The movie was horrible, I do not think I have ever disliked a movie as much as this one.

1270118,5,B00003CXE6,"I was captivated by the music of Lisa Gerrard. Those were hard times and I was impressed with the actors. It was a skill well done. I wonder if the women of that era were as beautiful as they seemed to be in the movie. Maximo's wife was excepyional even in the short parts she was given. Nielson was csptivating. She did an excellent job.
I can say, without reservation, that she was absolutely gorgeous. The plot depicted, what I believe was the essence of betrayal fo thos times in history. Have watched thid movie over and over. Yes, I was mentally captured by the actors & actresses who were cast in fitting roles, but certainly gratefully I didn't live in those times in history. Although brutal, as today's politcal arena seems to be with treachery and cunning political charactors who thrive on power and control, are still cunning. Not only in our country, but devstates so many other countries. Gladiator was captivating and well written and cast. I have a good collection of movies from Amazon, but this leads my list of keeping me enetrtained as I'm a 78 year old shut-in, crippled by my own battles during 40 years in law enforcement with too many horror scenes I've witnessed in real life.

1270119,5,B00003CXE6,"The film Gladiator is a 2000 British-American epic historical drama directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen.  Crowe portrays the fictional character, loyal Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the Emperor Marcus Aurelius's ambitious son, Commodus, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his emperor.
The film begins in AD 180, a mud-filled, foggy and rainy battlefield.  The front lines of the Roman army, on the outskirts of Vindobona, the beloved leader of thousands, a Spanish-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius stands deep in meditation, hours before battle, he then walks towards and stands next to his adored Emperor Marcus Aurelius.  The foggy and muddy scene seems to be slightly out of focus, as the picture pans in and out scene.  The writers appeal to the viewer as General Maximus makes his way to the frontlines with his trusted dog, of German Shepard breed. The film goes on to show General Maximus legion winning the battle, and favor of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, as the emperor is already fragile, old and dying.
The next climatic scene is staged in the Marcus Aerilius tent.  Although he has a son, Commodus, he asks Maximus to succeed him and return glorious Rome back into a republic, giving full control of Rome to the ruling senate. As Maximus Decimus Meridius the great Spanish-Roman General, dreams of going back to his home in Spain, to his wife and child, but has to place his dreams on hold for the love of Rome.  The Emperor Marcus Aurelius asks for one more task from his Great General to lead the army back to Rome, naming Maximus his successor.
The film portrays that Commodus begins to rule after he assassinates his father around 180 AD.  He became sole emperor upon his fathers death, the young Emperor is ridiculed in the film and appears to have problems earning the support of senate and people. He devises a scheme of gladiator games based on great Roman battles and victories.
Screen writers vividly enhance the rage and fury of Maximus on several arena battle scenes throughout the land. Gaining him notoriety in the film as one of the best gladiators, and filling arenas throughout the Roman Empire.  Many people may find the film offensively violent, bloody, and gory. Despite the film being historically inaccurate in most scenes and the visual effects being less than spectacular, the film does a good job at showing how savage that time in history was. After watching this movie I would have to recommend it to all individuals.",1423267200,,2660,4.935123042505593

1270604,3,B00003CXE6,"Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" (2000) takes place in 180 AD and begins with a decisive Roman victory led by General Maximus (Russell Crowe) over the Germanic tribes in what is now Austria. The Emperor (Richard Harris) is dying and wants to turn over control of the empire to the noble Maximus rather than his pathetic son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus catches wind of this, Maximus and his family are condemned, but the general survives and winds up a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed), who trains gladiators. Connie Nielsen is on hand as Commodus' sister who sympathizes with Maximus.

I saw ""Gladiator"" in the theater when it came out. It was over-hyped at the time and, as a result, I was let down, which isn't to say it's bad--not at all--it's just not as great as the hoopla made it out to be. Maybe I was a little disappointed because it's hard to watch ""Gladiator"" without comparing it to 1960's ""Spartacus,"" the first hour of which represents some of the greatest filmmaking ever, and ""Gladiator"" is underwhelming by comparison (with the first hour anyway).

Yet ""Gladiator"" has a lot of strengths, including the serious tone, the score, locations, the recreation of the Colosseum in Rome and the cast. Speaking of the cast, Crowe is probably the film's greatest strength as he makes a worthy protagonist; and Reed is no slouch as he's his typical magnetic self. Believe it or not, Reed died during filming and his remaining scenes had to have his face superimposed over an anonymous actor (!). Maximus' fellow gladiators and friends are also notable (Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller). Furthermore, the arena action sequences are thrilling and indeed give you a glimpse of what it must've been like to be a gladiator.

Phoenix is also exceptional as the love-to-loathe villain, but this is where the film suffers. Commodus (obviously derived from 'commode,' lol) is so repugnant and dishonorable that the viewer has no interest in watching overlong dramatic sequences of him in the palace, etc. These scenes could've easily been cut in half.

While ""Gladiator"" has a simplistic revenge plot there's some depth to glean here and there. For instance, the Emperor (Harris) chooses Maximus to replace him not only because he loves him as a son, but also because he wants someone outside of the corruption of Roman government to return the empire to a republic. That's what we need in the USA, someone not tainted by Washington politics. Then there's Commodus' sister, Lucilla (Nielsen), who initially comes off ignoble, but then you start to understand her plight and sorta hope she's redeemable.

As far as historical accuracy goes (***SPOILERS***), Marcus Aurelius allowed his unworthy son, Commodus, to become Emperor, knowing his incompetence BUT it is believed Aurelius wanted Claudius Pompeianus to succeed him as Caesar in preference to Commodus but was turned down, just as Maximus turned him down in the film. The fictional character of Maximus was partially based on Pompeianus, who had a similar career to Maximus' and personality traits as well, as documented by Herodian. In fact, Pompeianus married Marcus Aurelius' daughter, Lucilla, following the death of Lucius Verus. Maximus was also an amalgam of historical people like Narcissus (which was the protagonist's name in the first draft and Commodus' real-life killer), Spartacus (who, of course, led a significant slave revolt), Cincinnatus (a farmer who saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month ruler-ship after 15 days), and Marcus Nonius Macrinus (a faithful general and friend of Marcus Aurelius). As for Commodus' entering the arena at the end and taking on a mighty (albeit wounded) gladiator and dying, Commodus was known to engage in show combat in the Colosseum, but he was actually strangled by the wrestler Narcissus in his bath, not killed in the arena, and he ruled for a dozen plus years, unlike the relatively short time shown in the movie.

Say what you will about these (common) cinematic deviations, but the movie does inspire you to look-up the historical facts.

The film runs 155 minutes (the extended cut 171 minutes) and was shot in England (the opening battle scenes), Malta, Morocco, Tuscany and Lone Pine, CA.

1271436,4,B00003CXE6,"It's a funny thing how the comeback of the sword and sandal film would also prove to be its ruin. A good film, a solid drama, a great nod to the lost sword and sandal epics of a bygone age. Stellar performances by the two lead actors. Watching this film for the first time as a mere child, Joaquin Phoenix seemed to be the stuff nightmares were made of. An incredible, layered performance. Unarguably his best pre Master performance and it is one that should have earned him an Oscar. An amazing role.

Actually, it's one of my all time favorite performances.

Joaquin Phoenix is an incredible talent. In depicting Commodus, he solidified himself as a true force to be reckoned with. The pure evil he emits without show of it is mind bogglingly well conceived. A perfect portrayal, a damaging accomplishment. Phoenix flies off the handle bars, proving to be both a fiery and intense young actor as well as a more disciplined and cautious one, charitable and refined. Wise and empathetic beyond his years. Perhaps the most vulnerable of all villains, incredibly flawed and outright psychopathic. The mere idea of him makes me uneasy.

His volatile rage, his vicious heart. His deadly passions and unthinkable desires. All of these things are communicated with utmost perfection by Phoenix. You can feel his overarching sense of inadequacy, his black broken heart. His swollen pride. His cries and screams reveal the deepest kind of pathos that his tragically beautiful stare bravely to intensifies. A brilliant performance. One of the best. Magical and enduring.

I don't know it is tragic or not but the sword and sandal epic is now firmly back in the b-movie designation Ridley Scott's Gladiator vigorously resurrected it from. Subsequent filmmakers, influenced by the success of Gladiator to make their own machismo epic, seemed to only be interested in the empty flash and the hollow ricketa racketa that have only proven to be the single elements of Gladiator that can be seen as already-dated. What subsequent filmmakers failed to take from Gladiator was its heart and its fury, and its Homeric attitude towards Good and Evil, how they are branch subdividers in need of CAPITALIZATION. That heroes and villains exist because fate permits them to, because they have to. Because without a villain and without a hero, Good and Evil are just good and evil, just ideas. The rivalry and conflict presented at the core of Gladiator is one of massive proportions. The last Good versus Evil story there ever was. Black and white and red all over.",1407024000,,2542,4.904651162790698

It is destined to be a classic, and is a movie that can be watched and appreciated with each subseqent viewing.

I know that many of the reviews have focused on whether or not the reviewer received the remastered edition. I cannot comment on that because it wasn't a primary selling point for me so I cannot in all honesty state if I received the remastered copy or not. Regardless, I am not disappointed with the picture and sound quality which I thought was excellent.

There are plenty of special features to be had, including commentaries, storyboard designs, and deleted scenes. The bluray comes packaged in a dual disc bluray case. This was honestly the one source of contention for me. I personally felt that a movie this epic, deserved cooler packaging for it's remastered Sapphire Series release. Instead what I got was a cheap dual disc bluray case with no inserts or booklet.

1272210,5,B00003CXE6,"gladiator, general maximus, is a great warrior of body, mind and spirit.  a must see movie, For other uses, see Gladiator (disambiguation).

Part of the Zliten mosaic from Libya (Leptis Magna), about 2nd century CE. It shows (left to right) a thraex fighting a murmillo, a hoplomachus standing with another murmillo (who is signaling his defeat to the referee), and one of a matched pair.
A gladiator (Latin: gladiator, ""swordsman"", from gladius, ""sword"") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their legal and social standing and their lives by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.
Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.
The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BCE, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly games.",1395878400,,1509,5.309623430962343

1272503,4,B00003CXE6,"Fourteen years after Gladiator won the Oscar for best film, I decided I'd watch it.  I was most interested in Joaquin Phoenix' performance as Commodus.  The performance lived up to its hype.  Pheonix turned in a performance of a cowardly, contemptuous tyrant, a thoroughly evil man without being melodramatic.

I'll blame the writers for making Commodus out to be worse than the historians make him.  That is pretty difficult to do.  In history, Commodus had a reputation for neglecting the day-to-day maintenance of the empire in favor of Roman imperial parties with all the debauchery that entails.  Commodus did have a whimsical side that wasn't explored in the film.  He liked to dress up as Hercules, carrying a club over his shoulder and a lion's hide for a jacket.  One thing Commodus did do to scandalize the Roman nobility that was dipicted in the film was to appear as a gladiator in the Colosseum, but this is not how he met his end.  After twelve years as emperor and about as popular as an outbreak of plague, a palace conspiracy was hatched in which his mistress attempted to poison his food, but he survived by purging the meal.  Later in the day, his wresting partner was sent to strangle him in his bath.  That was more successful.  The Seante damned his memory, making him only the second emperor to be so dishonored, the other being Nero.

This is the second movie I've seen which depicts Commodus as the assassin of Marcus Aurelius.  The other is the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a film made in 1964.  Sophia Loren played Lucilla and was easily the bet thing about the movie.  In both films, Commodus is prompted to murder his father when he decides to name another man as successor.  In truth, Marcus Aurelius died of natural causes and there was never any doubt about who he wanted to succeed him.  Commodus had been co-emperor with his father for the last three years of Marcus Aurelius' life.  Marcus Aurelius wasn't as good an emperor as his reputation would suggest.  Classical scholars have a hard time reconciling the fact that an emperor who wrote a book of philosophical musing that is still in print and widely read today wasn't a perfect ruler.

Lucilla became involved in a plot to assassinate Commodus early in his reign.  The deed was to be carried out by a nephew of both Commodus and Lucilla, but he botched the job.  Lucilla was exiled to Capri, where Commodus saw to it that she was quietly executed sometime later.

If I have an opportunity to meet Joaquin Phoenix, I would ask him how he prepared for the part, assuming that he is a method actor.  It would seem that classical historians would not have been as great of help as it might appear as this Commodus, while well played by Mr. Phoenix, could have been made more interesting by incorporating actual actual manifestations of his unbalanced personality.",1393027200,6,2860,4.681362725450902

1272512,5,B00003CXE6,I absolutely loved this movie.  This is a movie that came out when I was only seven years old and I have just got around to watching it recently.  An epic story of betrayal and revenge; this is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen.,1391472000,,237,4.0212765957446805

1272594,5,B00003CXE6,"Unlike many other reviewers I seem to have received the right, remastered BD edition of this movie (the code on the inner ring ends on 'B1R2'), and I was treated to a wonderful movie that hasn't lost its charm after 14 years.  The CG panoramic shots of Rome definitely show their age, but the picture and sound are crystal clear, and the story line and action are still spectacular.

The reviewers who received the same edition yet are still complaining about image quality may forget that this movie was shot 15 years ago, back in the days of film; Hence the grainy image in many scenes.  I personally didn't find it to be annoying at all.  I would definitely recommend this movie in its current edition to others.  It is a solid transfer of a still great movie.",1391212800,3,763,4.5

Russell Crowe gives his finest performance in this picture and will probably never give this kind of performance again!

1272800,5,B00003CXE6,"They didn't know much about Russell Crowe or Ridley Scott - they do NOW!!!! Really great film. Limited in scope, Dated a bit on the special effects. I absolutely love seeing my one of my old favorites Oliver Reed in this - superior work - he died during production and in some scenes it's him, and in some its the CGI him - see if you can tell which. Good cast, good production values, Creepy bad guy in Phoenix - I realize he's a great actor, but he's so bad it makes me like the film less. The idea of our gladiator returning to his family and the shots of the fields and their idea of the afterlife and the shot on his moving body after death are classic - I wanted them to see that effects. So many of these shots are in video games now - I wanted them to see just how unoriginal they are - that this is primary source, and this is an OLD movie by their standards - helps them to see things in a new light.",1388448000,,910,3.978142076502732

The film was created to make money, not to stimulate our intellect and I understand that and in the end I said to myself, i could see this again, only for the ability of Crowe to convey to us the power of loss and imprisonment and especially for the stunning battles sequences that are exciting. The plot is unbelievable, and the special effects even worse and even the editing is loose and discordant but again, Crowe's presence and the fights are terrific so don't go to the theater thinking this is Spartacus.",1388361600,,715,4.465648854961832

1272803,2,B00003CXE6,"Despite the high-quality acting and the absence of profanity, this movie is unnecessarily graphic with abundant bloodletting and a nude scene.  Worst of all, toward the end, a universalist worldview is imposed which can manipulate any impressionistic viewer to believe that all religions lead to the same blissful paradise.  Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, and no one can come to the heavenly Father but by Him; therefore, He is the only way by which anyone can see eternal life in heaven after this life.",1388016000,,523,4.865168539325842

1272917,5,B00003CXE6,One of the finest Russell Crowe movies and indeed one of the all time great films to come out of Hollywood as we are propelled back to Imperial Rome as Crowe gives us a relentless General who became a slave who became an unstoppable gladiator to a man who defied an emperor while seeking to punish the man who destroyed his life.,1387324800,,329,4.32258064516129

1272921,5,B00003CXE6,"Most people have seen the movie and love it. I do too.

My question is regarding the disc.
I got this movie from Best Buy after price match over thanksgiving sale for $3.99.

This is what I noticed:
The case does not have an outer sleeve.
On the back cover, I see ""2-DISC SET"" above the paramount logo.
The UPC barcode is WHITE.

Upon opening the case, there are two grey discs.
I flipped DISC ONE over and held it up to the light. Needed my reading glasses but upon fine adjusting could finally make out the numbers to be NA13081B1R2 on the inner ring. I was relieved that they end in 'R2.'

However, I flipped DISC 2 over and I saw the numbers NA13081B1R1.
I was concerned so I scoured the web for reviews and screenshots.
I re-watched the opening scene and the movie name GLADIATOR appears black and stays black as it fades away.
The rest of the movie which I watched in THEATRICAL EDITION was great. I'm watching this on a 50"" 1080P Panasonic plasma.

My questions:
1. Is it true that I have the remastered version of the movie only?
2. Is it true that the DISC 2 is still the old version?
3. Should I keep what I have or try to get the all new steelbook version?

Any advice/opinions you might have, I'd be grateful if you leave your comments under this review.

This was a case when CGI was truly used to fullest effect.  The music was excellent, although the battle sequence music  both in and outside the arena was derived from the ""Mars"" section of Holst's ""The Planets.""  But what an inspiration !

I will not give it away but I will say that this is one of those underdog stories. Every time I watch this movie I feel motivated to do better. The movie promotes good guys as the good guys and bad guys as the bad guys. And of course there is great music to accompany this amazing film. This is a must see!,1384387200,,477,3.877551020408163

1273216,5,B00003CXE6,"This was a powerfully moving story, stunningly filmed and masterfully paced.  All the major players are excellent.  The extras included are a feast for movie buffs or just someone interested in the making of this film.  There is also added scenes not seen in the theatrical release.  While a lot of effort was put in to making the costumes, weapons, tactics, etc. accurate to history, the history of this emperor was not very accurate.  Marcus Aurelius finally promoted his own son to share the throne as a Co-Caesar before his death from natural causes.  Commodus was strangled by his hired wrestling partner in a plot to get rid of him.  Pertinax took over as emperor as arranged, but his reign was short and led to another  ""Year of four Caesars"" period.  Commodus had light blond hair we are told by Herodian, and was extremely handsome!  But why quibble with details, the story as told is still quite engaging.  But Hollywood misses the mark by not exploiting the real events which are just as interesting instead of spinning their own version--as seen here!  Still, this one is worth the money.",1379203200,,1100,4.761904761904762

1273219,5,B00003CXE6,"This is probably the most spectacular recreation on film, ever, of the ancient Roman Empire.  The camps of the Roman armies, the villas, the cities, all the detailed sets and costumes are awesomely real creations.  I've watched the movie twice and have liked it very well both times.  I've felt glad to be able to view such an outstanding SCENIC  treasure.  I think that's the Number One most excellent thing about the movie.  You truly feel as if you're there in the midst of the drama that's going on.

The next very good thing about the movie is that it tells a very gripping story.  It includes much blood and gore of brutal combat, but there is a serious religious-spiritual theme that figures into the story as well.  The viewer sees the protagonist's sincere worship of pagan gods who are addressed in terms reminiscent of Christian worship, ""Holy Mother"" and ""Holy Father.""  These seem to be tutelary spirits that the main character interweaves with his devoted love for his wife and son.  (No orgiastic pagan behavior here.)  One learns that among these pagan Romans, there is a belief in the afterlife.  There are concepts of ""righteousness"" in these ancient people that the viewer, as a modern conscientious person, can identify with.  Ultimately the movie is worthwhile and satisfying not only because the viewer responds to the immense courage of the ""General,"" the ""Slave,"" the ""Gladiator,"" but also to his tender love for his wife and son, and the mysterious promise offered of the future love reunion in ""eternity.""

As the story opens, General Maximus reminds his soldiers to fight under the motto of ""Strength and Honor.""  He reminds them that ""What we do in life echoes in eternity.""  After a long and successful campaign, all General Maximus wants is to get back Home, but his destiny is to keep fighting for the dream of his beloved Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, who wants to give back power to the people of Rome by ending  political corruption in the Senate.  The reinstatement of Republican integrity would rekindle the ""Glory of the Empire,"" the Great Light that had shone from pre-corrupt Rome.  Maximus ends up fighting to vindicate the murder of Aurelius by his ambitious and vicious son who jealously seizes power in place of the fatherly love he feels deprived of.  (You feel sorry for him but unfortunately he is apparently a really unlovable snake.)

Eventually, the Roman Coliseum appears as a terrible Death pit.  And it's there that Maximus will seek to win his Freedom.  Because of his relationship with the Emperor's sister, and her relationship with a senator who seeks to restore a wholesome government, Maximus fights ultimately to restore Right rule to Rome.

The most memorable thing for me about the movie was the way it depicted the near-death experience and then the final passage into the afterlife.  There was a door-gate which was the entrance; there was a big field of tall grass; there was the road that led to the villa that was ""Home.""  Home, at last.

All actors did great.  The casting choices of actors were excellent.

As loaded as this film is with masculine contests, conflicts, and fights, I don't think any guys would complain that this movie is a ""chick flick.""  It is chiefly the story of a Hero triumphing over great hardships and there is very little focus on his romantic life.  But the story will be interesting for males and females both.

Crow was a stoic pillar of strength as a deposed general turned gladiator around whom Rome's disaffected republican  elements rally.

1273274,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator was a 5+ star movie when it debuted in the theater in 2000, and whether you watch it in VHS, DVD or any format it remains a 5+ star movie. Now released in Blu Ray / Steelbook and surprise, surprise ;-)it is still a 5+ star movie.  What did you expect?  It's Gladiator... and the format it is released will never change the fact it is a 5+ star movie and one of the best movies all time, in this reviewer's humble opinion. I would enjoy Gladiator on a 5"" screen in 4x3 format, heck, I would even watch it on one of those old Viewmaster slide flipper thing-a-ma-jigs from the 70's!!  This movie is a classic, period. There is no other way to put it...

So now, with Gladiator packaged in Steelbook and Blu Ray, and with 17 minutes of new footage in addition to the Theatrical version, could we even make a case that it is better than ever?  Maybe now 5++ stars?

Forget about the fact it is probably one of the most historically accurate movies Hollywood has ever produced.  Then forget about how Russell Crowe turned in the performance of his career - probably the performance of anyone's career.  And let's not forget that this movie was so good, that even Joaquin Phoenix turned in a good performance!  The movie would stand on it's own without any of that - the plot and story itself was well laid out and well executed - and that alone make it a great movie.

The Blu Ray transfer quality of the movie was good.  There were a couple of scenes that did not transfer well, for instance the initial scene on the battlefield - some of the shots came out dark and not as clear as I would have hoped. But other than that, the movie looked great in Blu Ray - and definitely an improvement over my DVD copy overall.

Bottom line - we are talking about Gladiator here.  In Blu Ray.  With 17 minutes of bonus.  And in Steelbook to boot.  One of the best movies ever made.  Amazon should only offer a five star choice for rating this movie - the 4, 3, 2, and 1 star choices should be grayed out and not selectable!

Perhaps the first two reviewers would prefer the old release of Gladiator on blu ray where so many people complained about the Digital Noise Reduction and Edge Enhancement that this remastered blu ray was produced. Perhaps they would prefer the DVD.

Gladiator was shot on 35mm film. Film has grain. I much prefer to see the film grain than to view something that has been excessively processed and treated, but some people would prefer all blu rays to look like they were shot on digital HD cameras. And some people like to find fault with everything.

Just look at the amazon reviews for the 'regular' Gladiator blu ray and you'll see what I mean.

This steelbook rates as 5 stars. You get a two blu ray set of Gladiator, including the Theatrical version, the Extended version and a disc full of special features.

Sometimes a director falls in love with his own directing and tries to do too much. Perhaps Ridley Scott's direction caused it to lose its flow. The guy was good at large scale scenes such as this and did a great job on the gladiator fight scenes, the editing especially and the epic sized sets, but his artistic direction was a bit forced. Also, I don't recommend the scenes between brother Emperor Commodus and his sister for the sensitive set or younger people. Another negative is the historic aspect. They use some real names but this is not an historic story at all. But just ignore that if you know better and enjoy the flick. Just get a different version if you can.",1366588800,2,1135,4.3584905660377355

1273722,5,B00003CXE6,"""Gladiator"" is loosely based on a Hispano-Roman general from the Roman province of Hispania (Russell Crowe as Maximus). Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula (now Spain and Portugal). Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia - modern Galicia in NW Spain). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the vicarius for the Hispaniae (the Celtic provinces). The name Hispania was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. The modern name Spain derives from Hispania.",1364688000,,1002,5.6866666666666665

1274041,5,B00003CXE6,"I did a fair bit of homework before buying this 2-disc Blu-ray set with a January 1, 2013 release date. (Yes, Amazon's description of the set is wrong - an unfortunately common problem!) The original release of Gladiator on Blu-ray was a noise-reduction, edge-enhancement mess that has since been replaced by a much better, more film-like remaster. But how to know which print you have received? This is tricky. Some investigations in 2010 and 2011 revealed that if the back of the Blu-ray case says ""2-disc set"" over the Paramount logo, or if the UPC sticker is not yellow, or if the color of the printed side of the discs themselves is light grey, your Blu-ray print might be the bad one. However, time has shown that these indicators are not reliable.

What about this new release? The copy I received today has a *white* UPC sticker on the back that says ""Distributed by Warner Home Video"" and features the WB logo. (The sole reason for the 2013 re-release, as far as I can tell, is that WB has taken over distribution of this and many other titles from Paramount.) The case features the ""2-disc set"" label and a 2010 copyright date. BUT THIS IS INDEED THE NEWER REMASTER! The principal giveaway is that the unprinted side of Disc 1 features a code along the inner ring which ends with ""B1R2."" But the only sure test is to play the movie. From the start, it has a film-like appearance that is not excessively scrubbed of grain and minor noise, but is nevertheless polished and color-corrected. It looks and sounds fantastic to me. I saw no noticeable flaws during the opening battle sequence that would suggest to me that this is the wrong print of the movie. (Hooray!) What small flaws I did notice seem to be inherent to the film and should stay as they are.

I hesitated to replace my 2-disc DVD copy of this movie. I'm very glad to have this new release. It is the high-quality Sapphire Series Blu-ray release with both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, commentary by Scott and Crowe, a vast collection of featurettes, deleted scenes, images, and more.

1274118,4,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is a fine, well made film which offers great entertainment and some excellent performances. But although it takes it's inspiration from 60s movies The Fall Of The Roman Empire and Spartacus, it can't compare with those great films on some levels. The much hyped CGI set of the Colosseum, for example, doesn't look as impressive as the sets built by Samuel Bronston's team for The Fall Of The Roman Empire, because those sets were actually BUILT and what you see on the screen is real. Also the visual sweep of both films is unmatched here. Spartacus and Fall really do offer a feast for the eyes, but for me at least, Gladiator can't quite manage this. To my eyes, CGI can't hold a candle to solid reality.

The acting is fine in Gladiator. Russell Crowe is superb as Maximus; easily the equal of Kirk Douglas' Spartacus - and I'll concede he's far superior to Stephen Boyd's equivalent character Livius in Fall. But the greatest pleasure for me was to be found in veteran actors Richard Harris (Marcus Aurelius) and Oliver Reed in what was sadly his final role as Proximo. Harris manages to invoke subtle shades of his King Arthur from Camelot to the Roman Emperor weary of war and wanting only the best for his people, while still portraying a substantially different character. Reed reminds us once again of the genuine talent so often obscured by the public persona in his portrayal of the callous gladiator school owner who regains his humanity.

Where Gladiator does triumph, is in it's abilty to express the sheer depth of the inhumanity and evil that drove the Romans to lust for gladiatorial combat. It's portrayed unflinchingly in all it's gory horror. Censorship in the 60s prevented Stanley Kubrick from this in Spartacus, although he pushed the envelope as far as he could. A simple shot of a terrified man urinating himself in fear captures the horror perfectly.

In the final analysis, however, it doesn't ultimately compare with the classic 60s films which inspired it, though it remains a worthwhile and enjoyable modern epic.",1358467200,,2053,4.843304843304844

Picture of prior blu ray release was compromised by horrendous picture quality for blu ray.  Hopefully this is corrected to warrant re-purchase.  Also, the extended edition is 177 minutes.  If this blu ray release is not 177 minutes then best to continue to buy DVD copy for added footage.

1274449,5,B00003CXE6,"I've had this on DVD for years both the single disc and the 2 disc signature selection, and they looked fantastic if you got the remastered version, it seems this edition was also messed up when it was first released, or so I have read, they had the same problems with the DVD's and they fixed it, and they certainly fixed this one, I was a bit afraid when I bought later reading that Paramount messed up on the first batch of this edition, but I've read there are certain ways to tell if you got the good one, one way is to check the color of the UPC code on the back, if it's yellow, most likely you have the good one, another way is to check the numbers on the underside of the disc, the number should be B1R2, if you have both of these things located, then most likely you have the right one, my thanks to all the former reviewers that pointed out how to tell, much appreciated.

Now on to the quality of the transfer, man oh man where to start, well, right off really, the battle of Germania is just unbelieveable, you can see every little detail, it is really fantastic, those shots of the fire arrows flying through the air is just incredible, and the columns of horses charging, wow, just wow, and the interior shots with all the candles and such just jump right off the screen, and once you get into the gladiator scenes in the arena's, oh my lord, it feels like you're really there, everything from the sand to the armor and weapons just looks so good, and another thing I really like is that I see no grain what so ever, which can happen with blu rays with older movies, not all though, and this one shows none, pleasently surprised.

Now the audio, and I must say, it's right on par with the quality of the video, you can hear every little thing, from the sword fighting, to the charging horses, and of course the dialog, the 5.1 DTS really shines here, so double win for video and audio.

Now for the extras, and this does have extras that even the signature selection DVD does not have, such as 'Strength and Honor: Creating the World of Gladiator' which is a whopping 3 hour making of, I have not watched it yet, but I will be for sure, I like to see extras at this magnitude, theres also the Scrolls of Knowledge which is an interactive feature, which you can learn what life was really like back then in addition to the movie, you can also watch all those seperatly, which is nice, and you also get the extras that were part of the Signature Selection DVD, which is HBO First Look, Creating the Music of Gladiator, and Gladiator: Roman Bloodsport, and A Night With Russell Crowe, plus some images, deleted scenes and such, the extras are fantastic!

And another thing I really like about this set, is that it comes with both the theatrical cut and the extended cut which is about 20 minutes longer, 20 more minutes of Gladiator? I'm game! and both versions are on one disc, I love both versions, so thats another bonus for this set.

Paramount has done a great job with these Sapphire Series, I will be reviewing the Braveheart one and the Saving Private Ryan ones when I watch them, I've sampled them, and they look fantastic, but this one here is truly outstanding.

Now if you buy the triple feature sapphire series set, you get all 3 movies said above, but you won't get the extras, and I'm a completist, so I bought all 3 seperatly, but still, these 3 movies on blu ray for about $25.00 for the set is still a great deal don't get me wrong, just no extras.

I don't need to say much about the movie, fans of this film know truly how great of a film this is, so my focus was on the product itself, so if you are a fan of this movie, this edition is a MUST HAVE!, I'll still keep my DVDs of it of course, but this one will see the playing time!",1353974400,,3764,4.2633053221288515

1274655,3,B00003CXE6,"Russel Crowe channels a bit of the actor Mel Gibson. The Gibson of Braveheart and The Patriot. I see those two movies are advertised as similar choices on Gladiator's Amazon page. Perhaps it's Crowe's natural charisma and he even has to restrain himself at times, or at least doesn't have to act too hard.

Gladiator is a friend of mine's favorite movie. My friend is a male model and studying acting, so I value his opinion. Actually, I value it more because he's a friend. I see this film won the Academy award. None of this convinces me this is a great movie. Well, great, of course by the judgement of consensus, and the experts, but it just didn't interest me that much. Perhaps I shared just a little too much of Crowe's nonchalant attitude. . . I just didn't care that much. Perhaps the subtlety is what I Should have liked. Perhaps that made it more personal and less about empire.

It just wasn't that entertaining for me. I'm not glad I watched it - I'm not a better person now - lol. I don't think.

I did look up Commodus and Maximus on Google. I wonder if Commodus, the villain in the film, was actually a great man.",1350777600,,1129,4.366666666666666

Good work all around. This movie is a good example of when you have a good story and it is well written it can lift everything else. I imagine that during the production of this movie the people involved knew they had something. The acting was strong for all of the major characters. Props to the casting director who, it seemed, made some interesting choices that paid off big. I am happy that a blockbuster action hero type was not cast as the gladiator and they went with Russel Crowe. Crowe really does have some acting chops. Who would thought that a shy, introverted, tabacco executive (The Insider) could knock it out of the park as a Roman General. ""Quintus why are you armed?"" was a memorable scene along with others. Jaquin Phoenix really stood out too as the ambitious, manipulative, bastard son too Marcus Aurelius.

1274742,4,B00003CXE6,"I just received the three-disk DVD--two versions of the film plus two disks of supplemental material. I'm not sure the supplemental disks are necessary. But the extended edition of the film itself fleshes out a few things left unexplained in the original theatrical release, which I saw in 2000. The chief difference, for me, is why Quintus (Tomas Arana) orders his Praetorians to sheathe their swords during the climactic fight between Maximus and Commodus. The Emperor had ordered him to execute two of his men for concealing the fact that Maximus escaped the forest execution. Though Quintus defends his men and his own actions, it is clear that Commodus is not buying it; and I suspect that Quintus, who was in fact Maximus' friend and immediate subordinate in Germania, was complicit in facilitating Naximus' escape. The final sequence represents a kind of payback to the Emperor for what he made Quintus do, i.e., execute his own men. He will let the fight proceed even if it means the death of Commodus.

For the film itself, Gladiator never loses its power. It is a dark and brooding saga that never quite made sense to me as a revenge tragedy until Ridley Scott explained it as a journey of a man who wants to go home, rather like Odysseus. Maximus has lost through murder his wife, his son, and his place in Roman society. He seeks vengeance--almost suicide by duel--to take him to the Afterlife where he can be reunited with the only two people he loves in this world. When Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) whispers to him ""You're home"" she understand the nature of Maximus' epic journey to rejoin his family.

One of the interesting supplements deals with May 1999, when Oliver Reed died unexpectedly, and how the filmmakers dealt with the gaps he left. In a word, brilliantly. Reed's performance was great, and sustained the dark nature of the film. Crowe reputedly is both a consummate professional and grating pain in the butt. So, for that matter, was Phoenix as Commodus, who showed us the wounded nature of the man who could take his own father's life from shame and emotional desertion, and then turn to incestuous love for his sister.

The battlefield scene in the first part of the movie defines the universe as cruel and merciless. That vision prepares us for the arenas at Zucchubar and Rome itself. Win or die: there are no middle grounds.",1346976000,,2355,4.781326781326781
1274853,5,B00003CXE6,"This is by far one of my favorite movies, and one of Russel Crowe's best. It gets me amped everytime I watch it and its very inspiring.",1346889600,,135,4.037037037037037
1274854,4,B00003CXE6,"Someone I trust recommended this film to me, and someone I distrust said it was bad, so I decided to check it out, and was pleasantly surprised.

Admittedly, the thought of ancient Rome brings back images of ferocious lions and burning corpses to a Christian like myself, but I enjoy a good historical fiction as much as the next guy, and this film is certainly that.

A trustworthy, courageous roman general named Maximus is rewarded by Caesar for his latest successful campaign, with the promise that when he dies, Maximus must take his place, returning Rome back from the brink of corruption and totalitarian rule.  However, neither Maximus nor Commodus; the son of Caesar, are pleased to hear this.  Commodus assassinates Caesar before he can make his plans known, rising to become the emperor and betraying Maximus, killing his family and trying to have him executed.

Maximus is soon captured by slave traders, who sell him as a gladiator.  His military experience and great strength and skill make him a natural in his new profession, but his heart still longs for one thing; the death of Commodus, and the fulfillment of Caesar's last wishes.  The rest of the movie is about the chances that Maximus gets to confront Commodus again, and his quest for revenge and the restoration of the glory of Rome.

Though the story itself never really happened, it rang with something rarely seen in movies these days; the message that virtue matters much more than cunning or authority.  At every turn, Maximus is shown to be brave, determined, protective of his friends and faithful to the Caesar who once commanded him in battle, while his enemy Commodus is shown to have every form of vice; greed, selfishness, laziness, cowardice and sloth.

The one black spot on this movie's record in this regard is that ultimately, it is still a story about revenge.  Oh, sure, they include a lot of stuff about ""fighting for the glory of Rome,"" and struggling for the good of the people, but in the end, you know the real reason why Maximus is fighting so hard is that he wants to avenge the deaths of his family.

I say this is the only black spot because any traditional kind of story, like this one, is going to have conflict and bloodshed.  It's inevitable.  There's a reason why this film is rated R.  However, even this is not taken to the extreme it could have been.  Most of the time, Maximus is essentially forced to fight and kill, and in one noteworthy instance, he actually shows mercy in a fight against a strong opponent; a rare thing in the roman games.

Ultimately, though, what I liked most about this film was the noble sacrifices made by the hero and his friends in the later parts of the film, and the movie's very clear message that there is an afterlife, and what you do in this life matters for that very reason.  It's a truth too often ignored; too infrequently discussed.  By no means would I consider this film perfect, but I definitely enjoyed it.  Just don't try showing it to the kids.",1344556800,,3002,4.649621212121212

1274856,5,B00003CXE6,"I'm not here to give my opinions of plot and acting.  My book report days ended years ago.  Only the quality of the film on blu ray means anything to me and you can decide whether you like the actual film on  your own.

Disc one has both the theatrical release ,which Ridley Scott claims is the Director's cut ,  as well as the Extended version with plenty of additional footage.  I have both the original SD release and the Sapphire SD releases and this 2 disc set takes the cake for video transfer quality.  Deep dark blacks and rich hues even in muted scenes.  Really quite excellent.
The audio is DTSHD lossless audio but often the score itself seems to envelope the foley effects of the action which occurs in too many spots to specify.  Never the less, the audio sounds great on my fairly esoteric audio system.

The 2nd disc contains more extras than you might want to watch in one sitting.  While the letters on the back of the disc are simply too small for me to read, I ordered the disc from Amazon about 1 month ago and just got to it today.  I have watched the Gladiator many times and always enjoy it. One of these days I will travel to Pompei myself.  In the meantime, be assured that the quality of the Sapphire Edition of Gladiator is well worth it.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.

Whichever academic produced the research for this film should be shot for incompetence. When the Roman general, at the start of the conflict, shouted out 'Roma Victor' instead of the grammatically correct 'Roma Victrix', I knew I was in for a long haul. Whoever heard of anyone being called 'Proximo' ? And how did Maximus get from Germany to Spain so quickly ? The Occidental Express ? The actual gladiatorial scenes were well organised and thought out. It will not escape the viewer that the film is virtually a crib of 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'. For Russell Crowe supply Stephen Boyd, for Joaquin Phoenix supply Christopher Plummer, for Richard Harris supply Alec Guinness, for Connie Nielsen supply Sophia Loren. Add James Mason to this illustrious group and you have people who can act instead of people who 'go over the top'. Phoenix looked no more like Commodus than Jay Robinson like Caligula in 'Demetrius and the Gladiators (the movie, not the pop-group), both of them overacting. Of all the films involving gladiators, Spartacus is still the best. If people aren't convinced by Kirk Douglas, they will be less convinced by Russell Crowe who, whether he plays Maximus or John Nash, is still Russell Crowe.",1339200000,,1323,4.8584070796460175
1274859,5,B00003CXE6,"I remember first watching this movie in the theaters, and in the final scene, a man in the audience stands up, begins to utter a few expletives, and storms out of the theater. It was then that I realized how affective movies can be; for the good and the bad alike. Those who deny the afterlife will likely feel uneasy watching this movie in particular. And those who believe in the afterlife will likewise feel uneasy, watching the gradual destruction of a soul (the emperor's).

What is most striking, is how good and evil are seemingly enfleshed into the two main characters, portraying one's descent into darkness, and the others ascent to glory. The former possessed all the riches of the world, and the latter possessed nothing--humbled to a slave--and yet was in the end glorified while the other forgotten. The parallels to the spiritual life are evident, notwithstanding the extreme violence.

**NOTE: There is a deleted scene in the DVD extras of Maximus witnessing Christians being fed to the lions in the Colosseum--something which historically occurred under the reign of emperor Marcus Aurelius (as well as numerous other emperors). As shown in the scene, the Christians would kneel down to pray and sing psalms while awaiting their slaughter. Go to google and type in ""The Christian Martyr's Last Prayer"" to see an accurate painting of this, with the priest intoning the psalms surrounded by Christians in prayer.***",1338336000,2,1430,5.004201680672269

Gladiator isn't a gently-tugging-at-your-soul's attention kind of movie.  It GRABS you from the very first, less than 5 minutes into the opening, and doesn't end until the movie is over.  Even then, I recall wandering out of the theatre, almost in a ""fugue"" state of mind.  THAT'S how powerful was the movie's moral is, not to mention plot, character development, protagonist vs antagonist, all the way from the gripping start to the ending.  Evil vs. Honor, the ""parable"" of the consequences of choosing to live the thrill of EXHILERATION, acheived ONLY via the absorbtion of selfish greed and power, compared to the everlasting courage of a principlied, moral, ethical, self-effacing life.

Actually, Ridley Scott DID do another classic - Alien (the original.)  But with Gladiator, Russell Crowe, and Joaquin Phoenix could not have been better chosen for the roles played.

1274957,4,B00003CXE6,"Opening in the age when Rome ruled the territories from Israel to the coast of Ireland, the film introduces us to the greatest military leader they have ever known, Maximus (Russell Crowe), a man favored by the dying emperor to succeed him in power. Caesar (Richard Harris) believes Rome has been corrupted and knows the people are unhappy with the current government. His desire is to instill a democracy where the senate and elected officials will have more power than the emperor. Maximus is a natural leader. The people follow him without question... if he were able to persuade those in power in Rome of the worth of this ideal, Caesar's dreams of a powerful self-governed nation would come to pass. But his son and heir Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) stands in his way. A power-hungry, mentally deranged young man who has long sought his father's good opinion, the future emperor of Rome is not about to let solitary rule to slip through his fingertips. Commodus murders his father and asks the allegiance of Maximus to the throne. The general scorns him, and is in turn punished. Maximus is taken into the wood to be executed, his family to share the same fate.

Managing to escape from his keepers, Maximus flees home... but is too late. His wife and son have been murdered, his fields and harvest burned, his home laid to ruin. Driven by revenge, he vows to avenge their deaths one day. Weak from battle and injury, he's captured by a caravan of slave traders. His new owner intends to use him as a gladiator, to earn favor in the violent sport of Rome. Unwilling to fight in the training duels, Maximus proves himself unbeatable in actual combat. His distaste for this cruel, barbaric practice is evident. In the meantime, Commodus knows the senate plans his removal and entertains the Roman people with the promise of great sport. There will be 63 days of gladiator games in the great coliseum, to honor the memory of his father. Maximus' greatest desire is to fight in those games, and stand before the emperor... so he might deliver the fatal blow.

Only one thing stands in his way... the beautiful Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), a former lover and older sister of Commodus. She knows her brother's evil nature, suspects he had a hand in their father's death, and must constantly reject his overly friendly affections. These elements combine into a story that, while theologically is way off, represents the age of Rome excessively well. The magnificent buildings, the violence of the gladiator games, the cheering of the crowd. We have the wronged hero who must fight to survive. The beautiful woman in distress, and the cruel villain, who in key scenes reveals a childlike helplessness. Gladiator won Best Picture, among numerous other awards, and is well worth it. The screenplay is rich with authentic, memorable dialogue. The grand scale and costuming are impressive. The acting is first-rate. Though put into spattering blood a bit, the CGI is incredible. The movie has a slightly sober but moving conclusion.

Though having been warned about graphic violence and gore, Gladiator was much less bloody than I anticipated, but still uncomfortably realistic. I am not fond of movies that are violent simply for shock value, and this is not one of them. What it is, is an extremely moving film that shines with the elegant brilliance of a bygone era of filmmaking.",1332374400,2,3371,4.8591304347826085

The reason was that Gladaitor was a much more educational thing to do than half a day of thrid grade. The movie illustrates war, love, and honor better than any of its predicesers including Braveheart. The first scene of the movie is one of the greatest battle scences ever created to this day. The battle tactics and realities of war were more vivid in this piece than many people were willing to imagine. Even the almighty Roman Empire sustained extensive casualties and injury. The movie then goes on to show how Maximus is captured and forced into being a Gladiator for another mans profit. This and war were the two most common ways a man became a Gladiator. Maximus then with the seeking of vengence out matches every Gladiator in the known world and causes the Emporer Commodus to fight him in an attempt to rid him of all that he meant. In actual history Commodus did actually fight as a Gladiator for fun, but his actual unduing was the Praetorian Guard.

1275036,5,B00003CXE6,"What I have noticed is that the grand scale of epics has diminished mostly in the past ten years. Seldom does a film successfully balance action, emotion, power, scenery into one cohesive story. Gladiator is that one blockbuster hit that is larger than life, yet scales back its grandness to let you experience Maximus' story, his rise and fall, personal tragedies, and triumphs. What Ridley Scott ""gets"" is that a film of this magnitude shouldn't just be gore, action, violence and the battles of benevolent and corrupt forces, with one side prevailing. There should also be pathos and emotion, glimpses into character perspective, and larger themes explored.

Gladiator exposes the nature of corruptness in those who hold high ranking positions, as Commodus' (Joaquin Phoenix) lust for power and popularity knows no bounds. There's a sense of mob mentality in the Roman crowd, with their allegiances for or against him changing on a whim. Knowing he can manipulate the masses with bloodshed and entertainment, Commodus is able to play this hand well. At the other spectrum, Gladiator also illustrates the importance of loyalty as a means of living an honorable life, echoed in Maximus' statement: ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity.""  Maximus is sort of microcosm of the past ideals, with successful, powerful but just rulers in charge. Brought down to low status, Maximus attempts to survive in his new found role as Gladiator, while restoring some order in Rome.

There are many things about this production that are top notch: great casting and performances by its stars, a wonderful music score and scenery, epic gladiator battles, just a larger than life epic atmosphere.

If there was one slight annoyance, it was that Commodus was a bit too over the top in his villainy. It seemed like most characters were well-developed, but his just was a little too one dimensional.

Still, Gladiator is an awesome viewing experience, one of those films that draws you into its story. It's one of those films you can come back with repeated viewings. (This review is specifically for the Two-Disc Collector's Edition).",1325289600,,2119,5.060171919770774

I didn't get the ""remastered"" version and being based in Singapore it means it's difficult to get a replacement but truth be told, I didn't even notice the ""imperfections"" until I was told about them and until then I was quite happy with the overall much improved picture and sound quality over the standard dvd that I originally had.  The opening war scene sounded excellent in the DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround mode for example and the 1080p definition made the picture quality the best I had ever seen it.  Ridley Scott in the introduction to the extended version makes it clear that it is not the Director's cut which he says is still the thearetical version however my personal preference is for the extended version which I feel does make the film a little better and the actions of the cast a little more understandable.  The greatness of this film comes from an excellent script coupled with excellent performances from a great cast and other than the principal actors special mention should be made for Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi's roles as well; old-timers who can still effortlessly steal the show.

Do contact customer service first if you want to get the remastered version which is something I would have done had I known about the issue in advance but as far as this still being a great movie that looks and sounds even better in 1080p and DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround with two versions of the film there is no doubt.

1275042,3,B00003CXE6,"I am a big fan of Ridley Scott, but I think this is one of his worst films.  On the positive side, this film has the unique atmospherics that you expect from his productions, the acting is strong, and he strives to inject interesting historical themes into the plot.  However, given that I have loved so many of his films, this one disappointed me.  I guess I could say its effects are so spectacular that Scott thought he could coast on them, that the film's content and characters have a laziness about them that I would not expect from a great filmmaker like Scott.  The characters are two-dimensional, the action is hardly realistic, and the themes so maudlin and milked for effect that it disgusted me at times.

In addition, as a Rome history buff, I admit that I am put off by the wildly ridiculous inaccuracies in the film.  It's just an action film, so I can imagine viewers who liked it would tell me to lighten up.  Scott makes it into a discourse on democracy - Marcus Aurelias' general wants to bring back the republic, Commodus wants it to stay an autocracy - when it was nothing like that; the republic had been dead for over 100 years.  Moreover, removing the insane Commodus solved nothing:  Rome headed into a catastrophic period of instability in the passage of power, yet the film makes it look like that was all that was needed.  Granted, I suppose I should look at it purely as an action film, and it is a good action film, with blood guts, and daring.  The trouble is, I saw and loved The Duellists, one of his early films, so I know that he can pull off an absolutely first rate historical film, with realistic and yet unusual characters, without glaring make-believe, and deep themes that stick with the viewer, in my case for decades.  I was hoping that this film would be similar, and it certainly could have been.  Instead, it is a crude formula film, though lavish in production.",1316390400,2,1908,4.511627906976744

When I watched the video, several of the battle scenes blurred and you really didn't get a good view at times because the scene was shot so far back or microscopically close at turbo speed and detracted from my enjoyment of the movie. There were several twists in the plot to keep my interest on how the Gladiator was going to win back his status in the empire. The level of incestuous interest by the part of the brother for his sister was not a highlight of the movie for me. A few of the details like how some of the pivotal information was gleaned by Caeser to intervene on his sister's actions made the movie complicated to follow toward the end. Perhaps additional viewings of the movie will make some things more apparent, but I usually ""get"" movies the first time. I found the movie to be in a similar style to the HBO ""Rome"" series.

While the original release has seen a lot of highly vocal backlash, the remastered version couldn't look any better. Simply put, it is reference quality, pushing the detail envelope enabled by the blu-ray resolution to its limits, and showing the film as it was truly intended by the filmmakers. Pristine, with bold colors and exemplary contrast, this is how a blu-ray master should be. Paramount sacrificed some marginally bad PR (the importance of a small percentage of home theater enthusiasts is disputable in the grand scheme of things) in exchange for not having to recall their previous version, and seemingly going out of their way to mask the differences on the outside packaging to make distinguishing the two more difficult. It's getting almost to the point now that you might be better off simply putting the disc in your player and looking at the image yourself to see which version it is. You can be sure that if you receive the newer version, which will only become more probable as time goes on, that it will not be representative of all the bad ratings it has garnered here on Amazon.

1275592,5,B00003CXE6,"I broke down and purchased this blu-ray taking a chance as to the quality of the disc. I have to keep in mind that this is a first generation blu-ray disc and that all videos are not created equal. Some videos are simply Standard DVD transfers with nothing done while others are given the royal treatment before being released. One example of a standard transfer may be Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves while one example of a movie that gets the royal treatment may by Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. Gladiator does seem to fall in between this as there was no WOW effect after watching the movie nor was there a let down either. I have a 32"" Sharp Aquaos 1080i with a Sony Blu-ray player hooked up to an Onkyo HTS-6200 Receiver via HDMI. So this would vary according to your setup.
While I read a lot about the exchange program I was skeptical about taking the chance. However, I read The Digital Bits website and [...] web site and decided to take the chance. Contacting Paramount I got hold of one of the nicest customer service reps I've ever talked to in a while. She was patient with me as it was not easy to verify what they were asking for. Paramount if you read this I sent you the wrong disc and I will be happy to send you the right one. SO please contact me.
So in about 3 weeks I received my corrected disc with the ""R2"" on the play side and I rushed it ahead of my other disc and I definitely had the WOW effect. I say if you have any questions just call Paramount and they will be glad to help you. I'm glad I did.
I just wish the studios are companies that have the rights to release a movie won't rush it to market just to make a sale. As a film enthusiast between SD-DVD and BD-DVD I would prefer the best picture possible along with the best audio possible (Dolby Digital 5.1 / True Dolby / HTS Master audio). We consumers can wait and may be able to pay a little more (Gone With The Wind 70th Anniversary blu-ray collector's edition for example) if the film is released the best way it can be without us having to double are triple did some time in the future.

1275678,5,B00003CXE6,"Russell Crowe does a splendid job in this big budget period epic, playing the Roman General Maximus. Maximus is tapped to be the next Emperor of Rome. Predictably, he is betrayed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar's blood-progeny (shades of DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS). The spineless Commodus is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, who devours his role with relish. Commodus sells the general into slavery, after which Maximus ends up a gladiator in Rome.

Crowe's performance is dynamic, even given that he growls his way through most of his dialogue. The action asequences are exciting, appropriately gory, and (as far as the Roman histories tell us) historically accurate. Rome was a culture where brawn outweighed brains in value, and social standards of behavior were tied to an Emperor's own idiosyncrasies. In GLADIATOR, the Thinking Man (represented by Marcus Aurelius) is displaced by the Mob, who crave nothing more than bread and circuses (represented by Commodus). Maximus, a warrior-poet straddles both eras.

In terms of story, GLADIATOR inevitably samples much of Kirk Douglas' 1960 masterpiece SPARTACUS, the story of a slave-gladiator turned liberator. For those who have never seen SPARTACUS, GLADIATOR will be an original treat; for those who have, the older film is still a stronger draw, with better performances, more memorable characters, and far superior sets (no CGI cheats).

Crowe acquits himself well, and in his desire for a Rome ruled by laws, Maximus is a not too far distant cousin to Spartacus, the spokesman for human dignity. Given my choice, I'd watch Kirk first and Crowe second, but I'd want to own them both.",1282348800,3,1636,5.212927756653992

1275681,5,B00003CXE6,"As you've probably read from other reviews, there's a new Blu-ray transfer of this film, which originated in Europe (first released in the Netherlands I believe?). By demand, and perhaps under pressure from Universal in Europe, Paramount are slowly putting out the new transfer in the United States.

However, they seem afraid to admit their mistake, and so the whole thing is pretty secretive. So far, there's no new release with ""remastered"" or any such phrasing on the cover, nor is there a way to tell which discs have the new transfer save for one little detail (which may not even be 100%, but most people who've brought home these copies are reporting they have the new transfer, as do I):

On the back of the case, NOT on the slipcover, normally there would be the words ""2-DISC SET"" above the Paramount logo in the lower right corner. If on the case itself the text isn't there, and it's just a blank space, chances are it's the new transfer. BUT KEEP IN MIND that it doesn't matter if that space is vacant on the slipcover; I made the mistake of bringing home a copy that had no text above the logo on the slipcover, and it was the old, shoddy transfer, and ""2-DISC SET"" was above the logo on the actual case itself.

There is another thing to look out for which may not apply all across, but people have been reporting that the new transfers don't have a white title sticker on the top of the case like most releases do. Mine didn't. So if the ""2-DISC SET"" text is missing on the case, and there is no title sticker, it should be a definite thing that you're getting the new disc (but no promises).

As for the transfer itself, it's really quite astounding--one of the best, most detailed, most richly filmic Blu-ray transfers I've seen yet. For fans of the film, or even if you're not too keen on the film but are an HD enthusiast and just want to behold the capabilities of the Blu-ray format, I suggest this Blu-ray--the new, ""remastered"" one. The old one really is a pile of dung, with loads of digital noise reduction to wipe out the grain and all detail with it, and tons of edge enhancement to try and compensate for the eradicated detail, causing figures to ""pop out."" It's a mess of a video master done for DVD ten years ago; this kind of thing was done on the DVD format so that the film could be ""most visible"" on small standard definition TVs. It does not pass in the high definition realm.

Very highly recommended--if you can find the new transfer. Hopefully Paramount will start making it more obvious which copies of the Blu-ray have this new transfer, with a yellow UPC bar or something, or a new release altogether, promoting the new, greatly refined video master.

(Apparently there is an exchange program going on for those with the old disc who wish to have the new, both in the US and the UK. Look up The Digital Bits' daily column to get information on that.)",1281139200,11,2893,4.46969696969697

1275883,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is one of the greatest films of the last several decades, a cinematic masterpiece transcending time and genre. Part drama, part historical, part action, it is all excellent.

There is no weak point, but the story is perhaps most immediately gripping. A superbly crafted tale full of spectacles, twists, and intense drama, it is set in one of the Roman Empire's most interesting times; the movie is dramatic, moving, and above all engrossing. Very few films have pulled me in so completely; it is engaging nearly from the start, never fails to hold interest, and has one of the most spellbinding climaxes ever. This last not only literally had me on my seat's edge but also had my heart beating rapidly and seemingly in my throat.

Much has been said of the battle scenes, and they are indeed among the most brilliant ever filmed. The choreography is top-notch, the actions are performed skillfully, and everything -- setting, lighting, music -- is perfectly complementary. Above all, it is unusually realistic, so visceral we almost feel it. This is far from the usual light Hollywood fare; people bleed, scream, and die, and all is shown with stunning verisimilitude. Perhaps most fundamentally, and certainly most surprisingly, this is never corny or overdone. Some controversy unsurprisingly resulted; quite a few viewers thought the violence over the top, with several known to me being unable to sit through it, including some usually not prone to such things. The squeamish should certainly be warned; those averse to graphic violence will probably not like the film, though this should be obvious from the title alone. That said, it is important to remember that the film is set in a particularly bloody part of the always bloody Roman Empire; their wars were brutal even by war's standards, and their ""games"" are perhaps unmatched in the sad roll of humanity's penchant for making violence a spectator sport. Many films portray the Roman Empire, but few make its horrors so astonishingly clear, which is to its credit; the subject had been whitewashed long enough, and no serious treatment can continue the trend. Unfortunately, as always in such cases, this leads some to like the film for the wrong reasons. It is important to realize that Gladiator is not glorifying violence; it indeed in many ways does the opposite by showing war's futility and destructiveness plus the fatal effects of unchecked monarchy and petty revenge. The film takes the Empire as it was, for better or worse.

As deserved as the action's acclaim is, it unfairly diverts attention from many other excellences. For example, though it is obvious why action fans would love Gladiator, it is far more than an action film. It is in fact profoundly emotional; I have known several people to cry over it, including one not known to have cried over any other movie - and indeed only a few times ever. The story of Maximus, one of modern film's more believable, immediate, and deeply stirring heroes, is incredibly rousing. We immediately feel for him despite his apparent brutality - perhaps even in part because of it, which says much about the film's remarkable subtlety. His struggles and triumphs move us greatly; several scenes affect me more powerfully than almost any other film's. Perhaps Gladiator's most notable aspect is diversity; dramatic and action-packed as it is, it also has more than a little romance and even some humor. It is one of the more well-rounded films in recent memory, strongly pulling us in many directions.

Also highly noteworthy is the vivid Roman Empire recreation. This has again been attempted often but rarely, if ever, as successfully. Director Ridley Scott of course had the benefits of CGI - unthinkable in the days of early Roman film epics - but wisely avoids overusing it. Nearly any other director would have relied on it to realism's detriment, but he skillfully mixes it with sets and straight footage, creating a stunning montage. Few films are so visually breathtaking; the Empire's vast reach is on clear display, from Rome's grandeur - still hardly matched - to distant steppes, forests, and fields. The coliseums are also well-done. Everything is in place; costumes are superlative, lighting is just right, etc. It takes a rare film to bring a distant era so vibrantly to life, but this succeeds beyond all expectations.

Historical epics were an early Hollywood hallmark but were long out of vogue by 2000. Gladiator helped resurrect their popularity and reputation, but few attempts to replicate its success have even remotely matched it. Verisimilitude is what makes it work, but it is important to keep in mind that, despite being a historical film, it is not strictly historical. The settings are of course real, as are many characters and some events, but Maximus and most of the plot are fictional. This is no fault; the film does not pretend to tell history. The important thing is that everything seems plausible and is well-done; one should hardly expect more. Anyone wanting documentary-level history will be disappointed, but Gladiator does the important service of making an important time seem interesting and relevant; it has doubtless lead many to look into the era more thoroughly, which is what a historical epic should do.

It is of course impossible to talk of Gladiator without enthusing about the amazing acting; one would be hard-pressed to find another film with such consistently fine performances. There is no weak job, but a few stand out. Russell Crowe's starring role is deservedly praised; Maximus is one of the most multi-dimensional film heroes one can think of, and he pulls off all the angles with mesmerizing force. Crowe has a presence that few actors have and most would give nearly anything for; he need not even speak to convey very powerful emotions. This comes to the fore, as he moves from a tough guy persona worthy of any pure action hero to thoughtfulness to tenderness and seemingly everywhere else. However, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is even better - nothing less than one of the greatest of all-time. His Commodus is one of the most fearsomely convincing villains in screen history; the depth of true savagery he conveys is simply astonishing. Yet he is far from a one-dimensional villain; a conflicted, complex individual, he has many facets, and Phoenix portrays them all so deftly that we alternately revile and (almost) feel bad for him. Several of the lesser characters - notably Proximo, played by Oliver Reed in his last role - are similarly subtle.

All told, Gladiator deserves to stand with the all-time great films; it will surely be looked on as one of the decade's best, and anyone wanting a truly great film would be wrong to miss it.",1276128000,2,6741,4.976042590949423

1275889,5,B00003CXE6,"SPOILER WARNING...IN CASE YOU NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE!

""Gladiator"" is a Hollywood epic at its best: an action-packed adventure story with good guys versus bad guys, and some kind of uplifting moral message. Since it was made just a few years ago, the special effects are just fabulous. It's also a Hollywood epic at its worst: historically inaccurate and completely unrealistic.

In other words, brace yourselves for a real treat!

The main character, the righteous Roman general Maximus, is appointed emperor by an ailing Marcus Aurelius, who wants to stop his crooked son Commodus from taking power. Commodus, true to form, strangles the old man to death and has Maximus sold as a slave to a gladiator school, after first having butchered his family. Unfortunately for Commodus, Maximus nevertheless reaches Rome and the stage is set for a final combat between the two protagonists. Yes, Commodus himself challenges Maximus to a fight to the death at the Colosseum! Guess who wins? In the end scenes, the Roman senate restores power to itself as a dead Commodus lies on the arena. Maximus dies, too, but is immediately taken to Heaven where his family is already waiting for him.

I don't deny that ""Gladiator"" is a great movie. But no, don't base a term paper about Roman history on it, please. Marcus Aurelius was an average Roman emperor who would have been quietly forgotten except by specialists, had it not been for his philosophical work ""Meditations"", arguably the most known and least read book in history. I tried to read it some time ago, and found it part unreadable, part morbid and pessimistic. Haven't you read it yet? You haven't missed much, citizen, I assure you. Yet, this work has earned Marcus Aurelius the reputation for being some kind of deep thinker and saintly man, when he was just another Roman dictator. And no, he had absolutely no plans to give power back to the senate (which wasn't elected anyway). In fact, he appointed Commodus his co-ruler!

""Gladiator"" is probably more correct when it paints Commodus as a villain - he had that reputation already during his lifetime. Indeed, it was Commodus, rather than his father, who was murdered by strangulation. Roman chronicles also claim that Commodus fought as a gladiator for his own higher amusement. Commodus is one of the few Roman emperors denied posthumous deification by the senate, showing how hated and unpopular he was. (This seems to have been one of the few effective powers the senate had during this time.)

But what about Maximus? I must say that Maximus is the least believable character in the entire movie. But then, heroes never are believable, are they? There was very little morality in the Roman Empire, a system based on slavery, wars of conquest and super-exploitation of the peasantry. Not to mention the blood sports, the persecutions of Christians, mass crucifixions and what not. In order to make Maximus a morally upright person, ""Gladiator"" has to portray him almost as a Christian! He prays to his gods or ancestors in Christian fashion, acts a bit like Jesus ""turning the other cheek"" before smiting his enemies, and ends up in Heaven.

Watched it over the weekend having picked it up a few weeks ago when it was on sale at amazon. The negative press this release has been getting is WELL DESERVED. I am not exaggerating in the least when I say the video looks like a 480 source scaled to 1080 resolution with overly aggressive sharpening and digital filtering. Edges look enhanced and fine details get blurred over throughout, all of which takes away from the viewing experience. In my opinion, it is marginally better than the Extended Edition DVD scaled on my Toshiba HD-XA2, and nowhere near the quality that the Blu Ray medium is capable of. My recommendation would be to stay away from this release unless you absolutely must watch it in ""high definition"" today.",1263254400,10,829,4.684931506849315
1275998,2,B00003CXE6,"Most reviewers seem to point out the edge enhancement (EE) and noise reduction as the primary issues with this Blu-ray release of this modern historical epic that has become a classic. After viewing, I've concluded that may not be the entire story. It looks to me like the source film scan may have been lower resolution, perhaps coming from a previous DVD release. The aim of the EE, which is an unsharp mask filter, is to increase visual acuity, or the perceived resolution. This is okay when there is resolution there to enhance, but the film does not seem to have the resolution you'd expect from high bitrate HD, and appeared more like up sampled DVD. Throw on top of that noise reduction, which can destroy details in the process of hiding noise, and you have a heavily compromised image. In addition, the colors and contrast were not very 'punchy'. Overall the image seemed muted and stale, I've seem better HD images on Comcast.

My playback set-up is a Mitsubishi 73"" DLP on PC with the best available hardware and software. It could be that I've become spoiled by modern releases such as The Dark Knight and Transformers 2, both of which look absolutely jaw dropping on a DLP. But I don't believe that's the answer because I've seen much older films released on Blu-ray that look excellent, Goodfellas for example (on HD-DVD). Additionally, the sound track seemed heavily compressed on my 2-channel set-up. I'd describe the sound as `dead'. The dialog was muddy and the LFE track was nonexistent.

The only redeeming quality of this release is the film itself, which was just as superb as I remembered it. This was the first time I've seen the extra scenes. I felt they changed the flow of the film and compromised the plot on several points. The scene where Commodus takes a sword to a marble sculpture of his father Marcus Aurelius stood out for me. This emotional outburst showed commodious as even more physiologically weak than I remember, nearly to the point where he is sympathetic. Another scene that stood out was the execution of two Praetorian guardsman when Commodus manipulates General Quintus into giving the execution order in spite of his pleas to spare the accused traitors. This scene changed my perception of Quintis. Why did he suddenly decide to support his former friend Maximus in the final scene where Maximus fights Commodus when he could have over thrown him on several previous occasions? Who does Quintis really stand behind? Is he a moral character; or merely a soldier following orders? Does he fight for Rome, or does he fight for the emperor? Overall, I understand why these scenes were cut in the interest of time for an already lengthy film. They do fill in some holes and add some interesting details to the film and were worth watching, but subtract from the plot as much as they add.

In summary, don't buy this Blu-ray release. If you're a big fan of the film, and want to see it on Blu-ray, I would recommend renting this and buying a later release that will hopefully be much better.",1263081600,8,3033,4.729678638941399

I strongly believe that the tremendous success of this movie at the box office and the awards is tragic testimony to how the art of film-making has declined from storytelling to mere sensory stimulation. Consider: music that never lets up; reverb added to every voice, even when characters are talking out in the open; constant use of quick camera cuts to ensure that you never have a chance to study or reflect on anything; every scene keyed to the same pitch of intensity, so that there is little to distinguish a fight in a small provincial amphitheatre from the climax in the Colosseum. It's all just a barrage of noise and light calculated to keep your reptile brain stimulated while your intellect shuts down.

Compare this film to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartacus/dp/B00005A8TY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartacus</a>, a movie that could not be made in this era because the younger generation, overstimulated by movies like Gladiator, would consider it boring. Despite the lack of computer FX, the action scenes in the earlier movie are so much more successful because (a) they stand out against the background of long, slow, quiet plot and character development and (b) they are coherent, unlike the muddled battles and fights of Gladiator, where you don't get much of an idea of what is going on besides general mayhem.

It's really sad that manipulation of the senses has become so confused with artistry. Sad because more movies like this will be made, while we get to see fewer and fewer that offer any stimulation for the higher parts of the brain.",1260748800,10,1805,5.111864406779661

b) Big budget has allowed Scott to film a grand Roman epic.
  1) Terrific opening battle scene with the Roman war machine launching a 2nd century AD blitzkrieg on the barbarians.
  2) Excellent computer created spectacle of Roman grandeur.
  3) Great sets of the emperors palace, senate, and lavish costumes.
c) Ridley Scotts directing trademarks;
  1) Staging of intimate scenes filled with personal tension.  The eerie candlelit scenes between Phoenix and Nielsen, with Zimmers haunting music in the background, make the movie for me; ""Busy little bee!"".  Scott does this same kind of staging in Bladerunner and Empire Of The Sun and it is hypnotic.

1276203,5,B00003CXE6,"IMPORTANT NOTE: Several days ago I received a replacement disk of ""Gladiator"" with a new transfer in which edge sharpening and grain reduction have been reduced or eliminated. Paramount insists (see their site) that such enhancement is necessary and correct -- it is NOT! -- and this new edition was made solely to satisfy a number of people who complained. That must have been a /huge/ number, because the cost of remastering and repressing a film is not pocket change. (The new version can be identified by a /yellow/ -- rather than white -- proof-of-purchase tab on the back.)

This is typical of the home-video industry. When the LaserDisc was state of the art, some companies (such as Paramount) would transfer beaten-up 16mm prints (eg, ""Hud""), completely ignoring the fact that LV was a medium for movie lovers and videophiles. It's typical of American businesses to degrade the quality of a superior product to the point they think is ""appropriate"" for the Great Unwashed.

I realize home video is not the same as theatrical presentation (it can actually be a lot better!), and the studio /might/ want to make adjustments for the best image quality. I can understand the desire to reduce grain -- a /bit/ -- and sharpen the image. But when such ""enhancements"" are so heavily applied that they /degrade/ the image /and/ the viewer's pleasure, they've gone to far.

There is no reason (other than saving money!) /not/ to produce the best-possible transfer -- if only so you won't have to redo it. Those who don't or can't see a difference won't care. Those who do, will. (I just read that Blu-ray now has a 17% -- 1 in 6 -- market penetration in American homes. Amazing.)

Only Disney and Warners (which controls its own and several other studios' catalogs) have, as far as I can tell, made a consistent effort to produce superior transfers. Universal is erratic, with a not-very-good ""Spartacus"" followed by a beautiful ""Back to the Future"" trilogy and a superb ""Psycho"". (You really /have/ to see the latter. If Mrs Bates doesn't knock your eyes out (ar, ar), the image quality will.)

Please read the following with the preceding in mind.

-----------------------------------------------------

I've seen several reviews -- both in magazines and on-line -- excoriating this transfer for its mediocre image quality. I'm not sure what they're talking about.

As for sharpness and real detail, this transfer has gobs of it. Richard Harris is a lined and wrinkled geezer, and the close-ups of the women -- well, woman -- plainly reveal that they're (she's) not wearing makeup.

My only complaint is that this is the first Blu-ray I've seen with visible edge enhancement. You will occasionally see trailing-edge overshoot. It's not common, but it does occur.

Regardless, the BD's image quality quite obliterates the DVD's. Oddly, the CGI looks much more believable in the Blu-ray than it does on the DVD. I've seen this with other films, and have no explanation, other than the extra detail makes the fake stuff more plausible.

As for the film... It's ""Ben-Hur"" redux, without the Christianity. The /overall/ arc of the stories are the same -- a man is unjustly accused of crimes, then has to ""prove himself"" to the Roman populace. The principal difference is that ""Ben-Hur"" is a story of revenge in which the principal character eventually discovers how unimportant revenge is, while ""Gladiator"" is explicitly not about revenge, but about a man's desire to return to what /is/ important to him.

Russel Crowe might /think/ he's the world's greatest actor, but he ain't. The otherwise-sharp script portrays him primarily as someone who /doesn't/ want to be where he is. It's hard to act /negative/ attitudes, and he does little except yearn and pine and be noble. Perhaps this is all for the good -- the part is better underplayed. Richard Harris is far more effective -- and memorable -- as Marcus Aurelius.

Outside of the fact that the story is a broad fictionalization of real people and events, there are surprisingly few (apparent) errors or anachronisms. The principal error is getting the ""thumbs-up/down"" gesture wrong. The thumb represents the sword -- ""thumbs up"" means cut the guy's throat, ""thumbs down"" means bury the sword in the sand. And when Oliver Reed's character complains that his giraffes won't mate -- ""You sold me queer giraffes!"" -- it reflects a modern view of sexuality that would have made no sense to Mediterranean people.

""Gladiator"" is, overall, an very entertaining and well-paced film -- but it's hardly an Oscar contender. It won because, as with many Best Picture winners, it lavishly combines Spectacle and Sentiment. Though almost everyone dies, there's still a Happy Ending.

The extras are lavish, including a 3.5 hour (!) feature on the film's making. The first 12 minutes or so of it were transferred with the wrong cadence, and every time something moves, you see scaning-line breakup. There are also at least 100 short segments on various aspects of the film and its production.

The excellent cast, especially Joaquin Phoenix as the amoral Commodus, help to personify the debauchery and arrogance of ancient Rome, while Crowe delivers both as a man's-man and also as a humbled slave, defeated in life by Rome's excesses but redeemed in death by his devotion to family and honor.

1276290,4,B00003CXE6,"This review is for the UK Steelbook release (same transfer as US version). I viewed it on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Panasonic player.

I am a huge, long-time fan of this film, and like many, was looking forward to the Blu-Ray release. Although I had read some preview reviews, I am very impressed with this Blu-Ray. I do not own the UK Superbit, which I am told is a better overall transfer, but in comparison to the standard definition version, which I did own, this film is an obvious upgrade. I own 390+ Blu-Rays and this is one of the sharpest and color rich transfers I have seen so far. I think the anticipation of fans, put an extreme expectation on perfection for this transfer, as did the studio's touting of the ""superior"" nature of the ""Sapphire"" series. And yes, I have seen several ""reference-quality"" BD's, like the UK Zulu which remains the best PQ I have ever seen, along with discs such as I Robot.

There are some problems with this disc, due to over-digitization. But those scenes were few and far between, for me, and the detail, starting from the opening battle scene, down to those where Maximus is walking through the fields, and daylight shots, the clarity and detail on this disc is amazing. The DTS sound also does not disappoint, as it did not in the SD version. It is also possible that some with an LCD screen, or other brighter settings will see more of the digitization, but in Cinema Mode (my setting of choice), on a Plasma, the theater experience was replicated with true representation at home, for me.  The film remains one of my favorite films of all time, and it continues to be towards the top of my list for Drama films. The cast is at its best, and Ridley and all creative talent involved deserve every accolade bestowed upon this film.

Regardless of what you hear from threads and reviews, give this disc a chance, at least as a rental. Whether a superior transfer is released later on,  or not, this film has never looked as good, to me, as it does in this Blu-Ray edition. PQ 4.5/5, AQ 5/5.",1254614400,3,2041,4.490566037735849

To me, it never looked worse than a dvd. It always looked better. And the flawed transfer never stopped me from enjoying the story. I haven't seen the movie for several years. And I enjoyed renting it.

1276386,3,B00003CXE6,"First things first:

I have watched this Blu-Ray disc in my home theater environment. I am not reviewing this based on screen shots on a PC monitor. I really think this is the only fair way to truly evaluate a film, which is inherently a moving medium that is intended for viewing in a darkened, controlled environment.

The Blu-Ray:

Paramount's ""Sapphire Series"" has debuted with a double-barreled blast of action - Gladiator and Braveheart. But one of the rounds didn't fire, and I'm sorry to say it was this one (On the other hand, Braveheart is probably the finest HD video transfer of a 90's film EVER).

Video is problematic throughout. The beginning shots of the film, which feature a text intro superimposed on a background of golden mist, betray serious color banding and posterization - usually a sign of Digital Noise Reduction or Edge Enhancement gone awry. And while DNR is tamed to some extent for the rest of the film, EE remains present throughout.

Had these effects been present throughout the whole film, it might not have been as noticeable. However, the ""Extended Edition"" features scenes which were edited into the film from a 2005 master - and these shots show much more fine detail, much less edge halo, and better color fidelity. So it kind of slaps you in the face when you return to the film proper.

I do not want to give the impression that I freeze-frame my way through an entire film looking for problems. I try to let it breathe, and if it is still a pleasing presentation despite flaws, to enjoy it on its own terms. ""Gladiator"" does deliver in this respect. I would say that 10% of the film, and not just the new footage, is competitive with some of the better Blu-Ray discs out there. Usually, the strongest elements are close-up shots of faces and armor. Well-lit scenes fare much better than dark ones, too, which is unfortunate, since Ridley Scott has such a dark, muddied hand for cinematography.

But when it's bad, it's almost DVD-level bad. Medium and distance shots, especially the Rome fly-over upon Commodus' return as emperor, are positively CRAWLING with false information created by edge enhancement. Black levels also refuse to remain steady in darker scenes - some are nice and inky, while others are a gray mush.

At its best, this BD looks better than the previous two DVDs. But at its worst, it aggravates anyone who truly craves top notch HD. If you're a casual user, this probably won't bother you terribly. But if you are an A/V junkie, be warned.

The soundtrack is fine, in a generally well-balanced DTS-HD track.

Extras include two strong commentaries, an EXTREMELY long and exhaustive making of feature on disc 2, and many, many, many small vignettes on Roman history, production, and all sorts of minutiae. It really is an impressive assortment, except that all, sadly, are in Standard Definition.

So essentially, Paramount did everything right with this edition of Gladiator, with one small exception - the film itself.

The Film:

In my opinion, ""Gladiator"" has not aged well. This is probably more a statement about me than about the film. When I first saw it, I found it an engaging swords and sandals affair with a nice historical flair and a rousing storyline. I've now seen it a good 10 times, though, over the past 10 years. I'm sad to say I now find it rather trite and pat Hollywood storytelling, especially when contrasted with the much more interesting real history of Rome.

To be fair, as Russel Crowe bellows in the protagonist's role, ""are you not entertained?"" It's still a rousing action spectacle. Crowe is an action star par excellence, as well as a fine dramatic actor. Joaquin Phoenix cuts a dashing and creepy figure as the villain, Commodus. Various supporting characters are also nicely portrayed.

But it just rings so empty. Many characters are posterboard cut-outs, only serving to advance the plot, without an internal life of their own. If you want to see a telling contrast, watch Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus,"" another gladiatorial epic. Granted, that film has the likes of Kirk Douglas, Peter Ustinov, and Laurence Olivier, who would have to strain to make a bad movie, but still. As they say, ""If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage."" Well, it's just not on the page here.

Much of the problem, in my opinion, rests with the film's utterly ham-fisted treatment of historical events (another Scott dud, ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" suffered the same faults). There really was a Commodus who succeeded Marcus Aurelius, and he really did fight in a few gladiatorial games. But that's where the film departs with reality. The writers seem dead-set on draining the real events and persons of all possible subtlety, and on reducing the story to a trite hero-vs.-villain tale, in which the heroes fight for democracy, and the villains want to french-kiss their sisters (See also: ""300"".)

In the end, it's a big, dumb action spectacle. If decapitations and gushing spurts of blood are your thing, you will not be disappointed. Perhaps that's all I wanted when I was 20. But I guess I'm older and wiser now, and I need my entertainment to suit those things, too.

Conclusion:

I am rating this Blu-Ray on the quality of the disc itself, not on the film. I may just be in a curmudgeonly mood at the moment on the content. It is still entertaining. Maybe it will even inspire a viewer or two to research the real story.

But as a Blu-Ray, consumers should know what they're in for. A/V enthusiasts will find a disc that only meets the standards of some of the early Blu-Rays from 2006. It is by no means a perfect presentation. It also seems unlikely that Paramount will re-issue this disc any time soon. So it's a tough recommendation.

If you're a more casual viewer, however, or if you have a smaller screen (40 inches or less), the faults of this transfer will probably not be as evident or mean as much to you.

So call it a qualified recommendation with a caveat emptor for the enthusiast crowd.

So, for all you who like to get into odds&ends in movies, I replayed The Gladiator, and the movie Zulu soundtrack starts at 00:04:15 (immediately after Crowe says, ""Is acceptable, agreed?"") and continues on-and-off until 00:06:27. Sounds like the same Zulu soundbite repeated at varying times.
Then I replayed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zulu-1964-Blu-ray/dp/B001CTBGNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zulu (1964]) [Blu-ray</a>]. The part(s) of the Zulu soundtrack used in Gladiator comes from 01:09:45 to 01:10:46 in Zulu. The Zulu are rushing the fort, but only to allow the Chief to count the British rifles. The Zulus smash their spears against their shields and cry, ""uSuthu!"". Their leader says something like, ""BOONG, WATREECE!"" and the Zulu rush forward saying something like, ""Yah!"" or ""Yo!"", the leader repeats, the Zulu repeat. That's exactly what's on the Gladiator soundtrack.

...and from Wiki: ""The Germanic war chant in the battle scene at the beginning of Ridley Scott's film Gladiator is the Zulu war chant from Zulu. In the video commentary, Scott revealed that Zulu was one of his favourite movies.""",1252368000,4,1433,5.45045045045045
1276460,4,B00003CXE6,"Amazon.com needs to seperate reviews.  Blu ray reviews should NOT be lumped in with standard dvd releases.  The blu ray version of this movie is far superior to the standard dvd version. Both in picture and sound quality. The movie itself features great performances from the whole cast inlcluding the late Oliver Reed who died in Italy right as this was being finished.  The fictional story of the evil emporer Commodus and his betrayel of his top general is a interesting one.  In real life Rome had just had a number of great emporers : Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian and then Marcus Aurelius who was Commodus's father. All of these men had fought on the frontiers and made the empire strong , they were excellent emporers and then came the degenerate partier Commodus.  He fought in the gladitioral games and spent the empires money on his desires while the frontiers were being attacked.  He was cruel and finally killed and that was a good thing for the world.  But he was in charge for many years and not a few months like in this movie.  Still the movie captures his evil nature very well as does the actor who protays him,  and it presents a story about revenge.  This is a good movie in spite of this historical misstep.  After all they couldn't have the main character fight for ten years waiting for revenge.

This was supposed to be Paramounts ""Sapphire Series"".  If this is what they have in mind, I'm not buying next time.
I also watched ""Braveheart"", also part of the Sapphire Series, which has a beautiful transfer on Blu ray.  It's a shame when you think that ""Gladiator"" could've looked like that, too.  Winner of 5 Academy Awards, and less than 10 years old, and this is the best they can do?
I'm just glad I got Gladiator on sale, and I also get a rebate for being an owner of the DVD version.  If I was anyone else, I'd wait for the price to drop below $14.99.

1276465,3,B00003CXE6,"Having just watched it, the reports of Gladiator's travesty on blu-ray seem to have been somewhat exaggerated by a mob of detractors befitting of the Roman Coliseum.  I can certainly acknowledge that it does indeed exhibit very noticeable edge enhancement causing shimmering images and flickering most noticeably on objects such as chainmail and other accoutrements and the opening titles suffer most of all from heavy color banding and solarizing the result of the DNR post-processing.  However the (blu-ray) sky isn't falling and claims of ""vanishing arrows"" and spears ""disappearing"" in mid-air seem to have been blown out of proportion and I had no problem at all seeing them on my 46"" LCD.  There is no doubt that the picture quality could have been improved, and for the debut of Paramount's so-called ""Sapphire Series"" this presentation is something of an embarrassment for the studio and its reputation for future releases under this banner seems questionable, but the detail and clarity of resolution are better than watching the upscaled DVD copy.  The extras are insightful and the sound is nothing short of spectacular.  Still, I did not let these moderate technical flaws detract from the overall enjoyment of the spectacle of the film itself.

1276468,3,B00003CXE6,"There are technical flaws, covered extensively by other Amazon reviewers, in this film contributing to its mediocrity - over reliance on computer generated  backgrounds/special effects; too many scenes filmed in dim or blue light; excitement punctuated with too long boredom. However, there are deeper and more fundamental flaws; some which ought to cause grave concern:

1.) Why was this mediocre film so widely acclaimed? Perhaps it was the spectacle of Coliseum violence, violence that is one step beyond the spectacle of NFL football; violence people in American society are hankering for. Hankering for because as Americans fail to see the larger problems of society go unresolved, they long to see resolution achieved in other venues - games, contests -; resolution that allows them to imagine the violent, painful and bloody end of their enemies (for example, a liberal imaging the death of a conservative, and visa versa). The success of this film is an evil portent for where our culture may be headed.

2.) Everyone should be troubled that while Hollywood finds it almost impossible to cast in the mold of a hero anyone with Christian faith, Russell Crowe in this role is depicted as a man of worth because of his faith in the gods worshipped in Rome. His strong faith in these gods is depicted as a stabilizing and grounding influence in his life, over and against his semi-crazed Emperor-antagonist. Faith also allows Crowe's character to endure the cruel treatment of his family and to hope and believe he will be rejoined in an afterlife with lost loved ones.  In light of who the Roman gods actually were, was Crowe's character's faith reasonable, or worthy of admiration? By what mechanism do the gods of Rome provide justice in an afterlife? For example, Crowe's character is sure his loved ones will go to a heavenly afterlife, partly because they were a target of evil, but the movie begins with Crowe butchering thousands of Germanic tribesmen - presumably with families themselves - which Crowe's character, and Rome, is invading as imperialist conquerors.

I even brought my girlfriend at the time to see it, and we talked about it nonstop.  It is rare for this type of movie to be embraced by females, maybe it was Russell Crowe?  Who knows, regardless this movie was a masterpiece.  Absolutely perfect from start to finish.  I purchased the DVD the day of its release ages ago and am contemplating purchasing a Blue Ray player and this would defiantly be one of the first movies I purchase.

Well, my brother happens to be a big fan of this movie as well and has a Blue Ray player.  So he invited me over so we can catch up and watch this movie on Blue Ray.  I could not tell that this was on Blue Ray.  In fact, I thought it was even worse than the DVD I have at home.  The extended parts that were included were pretty cool, but I was definitely expecting more from Blue Ray.  My brother threw in another movie afterwards to ensure me that it was just the movie, and not Blue Ray in general, and I was blown away by the quality of Sin City on Blue Ray.  So I still will give in to the Blue Ray, but not this movie.

Here I am checking out what other people think of Gladiator in Blue Ray and it looks like everyone is in agreement that it was created rather poorly.  Can this be redone?  I would definitely purchase this movie, but I already have it on DVD, so work that Blue Ray Magic!",1251936000,12,1480,4.1223776223776225

I decided to pop it in and the first thing that came up was a selection for me to choose the Extended cut or the Theatrical version. I was shocked! Most of the reviews stated that this was not the Extended cut. I had the option.
My HDTV is a 37 inch Sony ""tube"". It is very critical about picture quality. Little things show up much quicker on a tube set than on a plasma or lcd. So, let me say, the picture was fine.

There are some moments that shine, but the difference between the great quality of the extended scenes and the processing that plagues the theatrical scenes are very noticeable that it has really made me question why the whole movie couldn't be transferred with the superb visuals displayed in the extended scenes.

This story is set in the time of Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), and his successor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Russell Crowe portrays a gladiator, Maximus Meridas, who comes back to reap his revenge on Commodus after being forced into slavery. Connie Nielson, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed also star in this film. What makes this movie so good, besides the great cinematography, are the strong characters. This film is as much about the choices people make in life and how this affects their lives, as the ebbs and flows of our existence.

This blu-ray disc was filmed with 5.1 dts master audio and in 1080p. There is some evidence of DNR(digital noise reduction) and EE(edge enhancement), but nothing so much that it spoiled my viewing of the film. The film is mostly crisp and clear. This disc also has lots of extras, including deleted scenes, interviews with scholars about history, and commentary from Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, but best of all is the inclusion of an extended cut which has sixteen extra minutes of deleted scenes.

Gladiator, on the other hand, was a disappointment in all areas. When the level of detail is taken to this extreme with DNR and EE it results in a very artificial and harsh picture. This is the case with Gladiator. So extreme is the ""scrubbing"" of this film that actual parts of the movie are missing, as reported. This is unacceptable. Any QC could have easily spotted this before production. To make matters worse, this is part of their ""Sapphire series"" which apparently means...we don't care, just give us your money you idiots.

Of course, it wouldn't be the first Blu-ray title to have excessive DNR applied, but scrubbed to the point it actually removes parts of the film? I believe that IS a first. Arrows and fireballs that magically disappear and then re-appear? I know the Romans were a rum bunch but I'm pretty sure they didn't have cloaking technology back in the day.

Just as Sony did with The Fifth Element, Universal need to do a new high-definition transfer and issue a recall notice as a matter of urgency...and for those unlucky folks who've already coughed-up their hard earned, an exchange programme needs to be implemented at Universal's expense.

For me, this is not the best looking blu-ray out there, and a classic like this does deserve a better treatment. But it is the finest looking print of this movie. It is beautiful for the most part and whether you can see 11,000 arrows or 10,000 is irrelevant!

This disc is a retread of the 2000 transfer, made for the DVD.  What this means is that considerable edge enhancement (EE), or false sharpness, remains in place.  Universal, in prepping the old, outdated transfer for release, smeared what is called ""digital noise reduction,"" or DNR, all over the picture, to remove both the natural film grain that provides facial detail and other wonderful Blu-ray things, as well as cover up the nasty results of EE, which include white halos around most edges.

The result?  A terrible picture:

1. The detail that justifies a Blu-ray upgrade, namely clear backgrounds and great facial detail, is GONE.  It does NOT look like film, and barely upgrades the detail on the DVD.  Yes, it's slightly better, but only because of the increased resolution.  It's a barely noticeable upgrade.

2. Some elements are actually missing!  Like arrows and catapult ammunition.  Gone.  Erased.  Some spears have been magically segmented due to the errors.

In short, DO NOT BUY THIS BLU-RAY.  It is a mere marginal upgrade from the DVD, and you should send a message to Paramount with your wallet.  This is not worthy of the Sapphire label, and is not worthy of your purchase.",1251676800,65,1258,4.914285714285715

Also, I immediately noticed very visible halos around the heads of the actors and edges of buildings in the film, indicating that the studio used a bit too much digital sharpening, i.e. edge enhancement, to make the picture look sharper than it probably was in the first place. I further noticed flashes of unnatural color here and there in the film. If there is an upside to the HD transfer of Gladiator it is the HD audio which is very good. Gladiator is a film deserving of a dynamic visual presentation in High Definition.

1276738,1,B00003CXE6,"This Blu-Ray is the topic of much discussion across the HD world and the Internet.

Reputable sites like The Digital Bits who have seen the disc report :
""The problem is with the level of detail. The vast majority of the film has a slightly digital-looking quality to it, and there's clear edge-enhancement ""haloing"" visible. The extended edition scenes, however, look fine - no halos, no digital patina - they're very natural looking. If the whole film looked like the extended scenes, we wouldn't be having this conversation. What it looks like to me (though it's impossible to be sure, obviously), is that someone at Universal (keep in mind, it's Universal that controls the assets for DreamWorks - not Paramount), decided to re-use the original digital master of the HD transfer done back in 2000 for the very first DVD release.

Now, that transfer was state of the art for its day, and it was approved by director Ridley Scott, but obviously it's a far cry from the quality of new HD transfers done today, in 2009. One of the biggest problems is that until fairly recently, video mastering engineers were still applying edge-enhancement to their digital masters knowing that they were going to be used ultimately for standard-definition DVD release, and also analogue VHS and laserdisc. It took the mastering community a long time to break the habit.

In this transfer, you can see it in the image. It's also clear that the 2000 digital master has been digitally-filtered to reduce the haloing and other artefacts - the signs of DNR are not hard to miss. That's in contrast to the extended edition scenes, which were transferred in HD in 2005 and so look much better. They're still not quite up to today's standards, but they look far superior to the rest of the film and there's no edge-enhancement or obvious filtering visible. The footage simply looks natural - as it should.

There's been some talk of DNR being so excessive that - for example - arrows and fireballs disappear from one frame to the next. This IS an issue, but the fact is that when you watch the image in full motion it's not something you really notice. The arrow or fireball is highly visible in one frame, less so in the next, more so in the third, etc. You still detect the object in motion, so you don't go, ""Oh my god, that fireball just disappeared!"" The image just looks generally digital and lacking in fine detail.""

So there,make up your own mind. I for one love this movie and have both the original and Special Edition on DVD and have just cancelled my Blu-Ray order with Amazon. I will not be forking out another 26 Bucks for a lesser quality Blu-Ray. Paramount need to fix this now!",1251590400,22,2673,4.666666666666667

According to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits, they more than likely used an HD master from way back in 2000 for all theatrical footage and a newer HD transfer from 2005 for the extended scenes.

Therefore, the 2005 material looks pretty good, though not as good as the best modern HD telecine work and definitely not as good as Braveheart (it received a fairly recent HD transfer), with no trace of Edge Enhancement and only minor Digital Noise Reduction applied.  In comparison, the 2000 transfer for the bulk of the film is a completely waxy, smeared mess devoid of fine detail with EE up the wazoo.

Hopefully, pressure can be brought to bear towards Paramount and Universal and they will re-release this modern-day masterpiece with a brand new HD transfer devoid of all the various problems presented here, and issue an exchange as Sony did with The Fifth Element.

But would is not would, but could! The blu-ray release here, is defect!

It has been processed by software that automatically removes fast moving objects. In the intro scene, a lot of arrows are missing flying in the air. The fireballs are distorted. Movements are distorted.

That's not all. The picture has boosted sharpness resulting in edge enhancement, halos around objects, making the scenes artificial looking. There are introduced digital noise reduction, that smoothers details in skin, textures, organic objects. You like wax faces, then by all means, buy.

That's not all. The extended cut scenes are fault free. So watching the extended cut, you will have the theatrical and extended cut scenes, mixed in, making the viewing seems like an even greater travesty.

I can not recommend this release to anyone. I watched this on a 104"" screen and I would prefer to watch the DVD in upscaled form instead. The Braveheart title, also available on the Sapphire label is stunning. Really beautiful, but this one ... don't buy!

1276814,2,B00003CXE6,"<Complete excerpt from review on digitalbits.com> for which I wholey trust and respect the opinion of Bill Hunt, editor.

Okay... so, I've seen Gladiator and Braveheart on Blu-ray this afternoon. I should let you know that I tried to get the discs from Paramount directly. They're usually very helpful and responsive in such situations, but they genuinely don't seem to have them available to send them out until early next week, for whatever reason. Given the controversy around the Net regarding the Gladiator transfer, however, I still wanted to be able to see the discs today myself - rather than comment on all this screenshot silliness - to make my own judgments and report here in time for you all to have fair warning prior to street date (9/1 - this coming Tuesday). It's your money, and you want to spend it wisely. You need information in order to do that.

Let me first comment on the whole issue of screenshots. Judging a disc based on a few screenshots is, I think, silly. A screenshot represents 1/24 of a second of film. For a 2-hour film, that just 1/172,800th of the total visual information. You just can't properly judge a transfer based upon that little information. Screenshots CAN be illustrative of various kinds of image-related problems. But you really have to see the image in full motion to judge the complete context and impact of anything you see in a single frame grab. There's also the problem of potential alterations or artifacts that result from the frame-grabbing process itself, not to mention any changes resulting from image compression/editing software used by the poster - no matter how well intentioned - to present the frame-grab online. Finally, I've seen enough deliberately Photoshop doctored frame-grabs posted in discussion forums in my day that I just don't trust them. Ultimately, the only real way to judge these things properly is with your own eyes, first-hand, in context, in full motion, presented on proper equipment. Period.

That being the case, an exhaustive search of retailers and rentailers in my area turned up a ""mom and pop"" rental shop nearby that had both Blu-ray titles available for rent prior to street date. I was able to pick up the discs this morning, and I've since gone through the transfers in some detail. I'm not going to talk about the extras - I'll do that in more detail next week, and I can tell you with confidence that the extras on both discs are absolutely first-rate. No complaints there whatsoever. As for the A/V quality, however, here's my two cents...

Upon first glance, and as expected, the HD presentation quality of Gladiator isn't as bad as some online would have you believe. Color and contrast is fine at all times. The problem is with the level of detail. The vast majority of the film has a slightly digital-looking quality to it, and there's clear edge-enhancement ""haloing"" visible. The extended edition scenes, however, look fine - no halos, no digital patina - they're very natural looking. If the whole film looked like the extended scenes, we wouldn't be having this conversation. What it looks like to me, is that someone at Universal (keep in mind, it's Universal that controls the Gladiator assets for DreamWorks - not Paramount), decided to re-use the original digital master of the HD transfer done back in 2000 for the very first DVD release. Now, that transfer was state of the art for its day, and it was approved by director Ridley Scott, but obviously it's a far cry from the quality of new HD transfers done today, in 2009. One of the biggest problems is that until fairly recently, video mastering engineers were still applying edge-enhancement to their digital masters knowing that they were going to be used ultimately for standard-definition DVD release, and also analog VHS and laserdisc. It took the mastering community a long time to break the habit. In this Gladiator transfer, you can see it in the image. It's also clear that the 2000 digital master has been digitally-filtered to reduce the haloing and other artifacts - the signs of DNR are not hard to miss. That's in contrast to the extended edition scenes, which were transferred in HD in 2005 and so look much better. They're still not quite up to today's standards, but they look far superior to the rest of the film and there's no edge-enhancement or obvious filtering visible. The footage simply looks natural - as it should. There's been some talk of DNR being so excessive that - for example - arrows and fireballs disappear from one frame to the next. This IS an issue, but the fact is that when you watch the image in full motion it's not something you really notice. The arrow or fireball is highly visible in one frame, less so in the next, more so in the third, etc. You still detect the object in motion, so you don't go, ""Oh my god, that fireball just disappeared!"" The image just looks generally digital and lacking in fine detail. Overall, I would grade the A/V quality of the Gladiator Blu-ray thusly:

Gladiator
Video: 15.5 (theatrical footage)/17 (extended scenes)
Audio: 18

Let me be clear: Gladiator on Blu-ray is quite watchable - especially if you have a smaller screen. On the comparative grading scale we use for Blu-ray, the very best DVD video and audio quality would be graded a 10. So it's definitely an improvement over the previous DVD releases. The problem is, the best Blu-rays - most high-quality titles on the format these days - score in the 18-19 range. So while this disc is watchable, that's just not good enough, either for the format as a whole or for most fans and enthusiasts",1251417600,32,5600,4.78593588417787
1276815,1,B00003CXE6,"I'm no expert on Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) and Edge Enhancement (EE) and how it affects Blu-ray picture quality, but even I know something's seriously wrong when parts of the picture are *erased*. Compare the screenshots on the AVS Forum post:

bit.ly/EkTmM (Amazon seems to screen out external links in reviews, so just copy and paste this into the address bar)

Especially shocking to me (in terms of parts of the images being erased) are images 3 and 7. If you compare one of the broadcast HDTV versions with the Blu-ray version, you'll see that in image 3 (with the ""Germania"" caption) part of the spear on the left-hand side has been erased because the image-processing software thought that it should blend in with the tress in the background...

Even worse, in image 7, I can count at least 15 flaming arrows that have been removed from the Blu-ray version, presumably because the software thought that they were scratches or imperfections that had to be removed. Also, if you look on the right of the image, part of the fireball has been erased by a blue splodge. You can see what it looks like by downloading the video clips linked from the second post (you'll need a reasonably fast computer to play the 10-second 1080p clips and software such as VLC Media Player from videolan.org).

1276906,3,B00003CXE6,"This movie is a great action movie of the toga-sandal genre, it is NOT a historical movie, though it is set in Ancient Rome. The true history of Commodus is much more exciting, imaginative and colorful than the trite story line we are given in this film.
Here are the most important facts on which the movie differs from history:
1-Commodus was never disowned by his father, on the contrary from a very young age Marcus Aurelius wanted him to be his heir and gave him all the necessary titles and honors to go along with the job. All evidence points to exactly the opposite, he loved his son too much rather than too little. It is hard to believe such an intelligent man picked such a poor successor since at 19, which was his age at his father's death,  (and roughly our equivalent of 30) Commodus must have demonstrated his character faults plenty of times. He was co-ruler with his father from 176 onwards and his father died in 180. He did not have to kill him to become the ruler as he already was.
2-Commodus had a sister Lucilla, ( he also had several others, none of which appear in the film) who had been married to Lucius Verus, co-ruler with his father, when he started his reign, and therefore had the title since then of 'Augusta'. She conspired against him in 182, according to the sources the cause was friction with the Empress Crispina, Commodus' wife. This was just two years after he became sole emperor, with two of her lovers, Marcus Ummidius Quadratus (the consul of 167, who was also her first cousin) and Appius Claudius Quintianus, both were executed, she was exiled to Capri and then conveniently murdered. She was married at the time but her husband was not implicated in the conspiracy. This is a much better script than the movie's and I can not comprehend why it was not used instead of the convoluted absurd scenario that was concocted.
Furthermore this Lucilla looks like she just graduated from Vassar. When will American audiences comprehend that the Romans were overwhelmely dark-haired and that only the Barbarians at that time were fair?? Such a persistent racist perspective, which is present since the beginning of Hollywood by British actors playing the roles of Romans, is really incomprehensible today, particularly in the case of Lucilla's child that looks ready for kindergarten in Switzerland or the senators we see, all of which could be having a drink at the Harvard Club and none of which could have possibly been a Roman aristocrat.
3-Commodus did fight both animals and gladiators in public, however he did not die in the arena, but was strangled by his professional trainer, the wrestler Narcissus, who conspired with Commodus mistress, Marcia to get into his bedroom and strangle him after Marcia had made Commodus drunk. There are discrepancies in the sources as to whether it happened in the bathroom or the bed, either one of which would have been better than the silly circus fight that we knew before he started it he was going to 'lose'.
4-Maximus as a character did not exist at that period, it is a complete fabrication with a little bit of Spartacus, Richard Burton's Anthony and a lot of Steve Reeve's Hercules thrown in a blender.
5-The emperor Commodus was heavily muscled and bearded and considered a model of male beauty at that time. Numerous statues show him in Hercules' regalia.  Joaquin Phoenix is terribly miscast in the role, he looks like a Roman bureaucrat, at best, and at worst like just a jackass. His costumes are particularly wrong, much more suited for the Opera stage of Venice during the 18th Century. His makeup would have been great in a silent film and is strangely out of place here, verging on the comical.
6-The depiction of the gladiators, like all American productions relating to this period of history completely and purposefully distorts the facts of their daily life and exercise by censoring, hiding and refusing to allocate nudity and the strong presence of sexuality, both heterosexual and homoerotic that was part of that world. When will we see that our present day ideas on the topic had NOTHING to do with the way these people lived?? What we see here is a varsity team that can kill in the field, not the super stars of the Roman arena that had huge fame and wealth along with all the perks that came with their violent, brutal profession.
All of the above taken into consideration, the movie is an entertaining, fast-action fantasy that has escapist value. Russell Crowe never looked better and he does do an extremely convincing characterization of a provincial, country-loving, old fashioned virtuous and somewhat brutish Roman general of the type the Romans themselves always liked to praise with great respect.",1250035200,2,4718,4.794840294840295

Thinking of what throwaway title to use for the review I recalled the South Park crew's mockery of Crowe's accent in the film. But who knows or for that matter cares what a Spaniard sounded like a couple thousand years ago? Surely not like Crowe, but the Romans didn't speak English or look too much like many of the actors portraying them in Hollywood films! And who cares about actual history? Nobody watching ""Gladiator"". Except for the ""realistic fight scenes!"" and new digital depiction of Rome and it's Coliseum of death we aren't too concerned. Marcus Aurelius was a real Emperor, last of the so-called ""Five Good Emperors"", and a great stoic philosopher, but events depicted in the film are loosely based in fact or fabricated.

***spolier alert***

Believe it or not the first time I watched this movie I didn't like it.  It didn't turn out how I expected or had hoped.  You know, the typical Hollywood ending where Maximus would ride into Rome with his armies at his back to conquer Commodus in an epic battle of good vs. evil.  Instead Commodus cheats and kills our hero.  After watching it a second time, however, it became my favorite movie of all time and that still holds true today almost 10 years removed.  The real story is Maximus' enduring honor, pride, and devotion to family, country and his morals.  I could go into greater detail, but there are better wordsmiths who have gone to great lengths to write some awesome reviews.  I just thought I'd throw my two cents out there.

The climactic fight with Commodus is still a major disappointment not just because it's so underwhelmingly staged but because, unlike The Fall of the Roman Empire, the film it relentlessly plagiarises, Commodus is never a credible threat: where Mann gave him foolhardy courage, Scott has implied he's a coward throughout until even a wounded hero can't even the odds.

Here scenes that weren't fully explained in the original cut have been fixed with an extra 17 minutes of bonus footage.

This film has plenty of intense fighting scenes with all the fights being fast, hard-hitting, uncensored, and very bloody, which is what they should've been like. And every single fight sequence is unique from the others. which will please most people, great characters like Crowe and Phoenix, authentic storytelling, believable special effects.

The storyline was excellent. The acting was some of the most memorable in many years. The special effects were amazing. The Cinematography was perfect. The battles were incredibly realistic and beleivable. Russell Crowe(Maximus) was perfect at playing his role; a Sad Hero. Throughout the movie you are made to believe that all he is trying to do is win his freedom. He has no ""save Rome"" attitude as I thought he would before I saw the movie. I thought he was going to be a ""Rebel"" trying to save the people. But what he is, is a man trying to win freedom and revenge against the man(who is the King's Son i.e. the Prince) who slaughtered his family and the king(who happened to be his best friend and the father he never had).

1277286,3,B00003CXE6,"Great entertainment but hollow.  There are so many holes and so many details that are wrong in this movie that detracts a lot from a great performance from Russel Crowe that is about the only thing worth saving in this movie.  I want to be entertained but also want to learn something in the process and dislike very much when historical details in big budget movies are not taken into account.

First the story was a remake of Fall of the Roman Empire which was a movie from the sixties, I believe that movie is better done than the more modern Gladiator.

The quirks:  first is highly doubtful that the Second in Command of the Roman Empire will fall all the way to gladiator in the social ladder no matter the circumstances.  Great leaders as Maximus is depicted to be have partisans, friends, bankers, Senators and military men in their camp, these men will never allow their leader the shame of being sold as a slave.  Even if Maximus kept his identity in hiding the minute it was known it would have generated such an uproar in Roman Society (which was very conservative and class concious) that the Emperor would have to liberate the great man on the spot.

Commodus was badly depicted, Roman annals usually depict him as a Hercules not as a wimp, he indeed fought in the arena as a gladiator to the astonishment and censure of the Roman Society and he indeed died in a coup but he didn't die in the arena as depicted in the movie but was assasinated by his mistress ( a gladiatrix and part of a well planned coup de etat) in his palace.  Marcus Aurelius was indeed a philosopher and a man of reason but never tried to return the Roman Empire to the control of the Senate, he nominated Commodus as his heir and there is no mention in any historical record of a General of the Northern Legions that achieved an status of rival heir to the empire to Commodus.  This is great historic license in a time where historical records abound.

The gladiators were not paired as the movie depicts and did not use the equipment depicted in the movie.  There was a strict pairing of gladiator classes for example the Retiarius (net and trident) always fought the Secutor (short sword, shield, closed helmet); the Samnite (equiped as almost a roman legionnaire) fought the Tracian (heavy shield, short sword, hevily protected).  The contest was usually ability and speed against superior weapons. The movie shows gladiators not having a class system, and the equipment depicted looks more like 10th century sarracen helmets and other anachronistic weapons.  Since gladiators cost much to train and feed they were a huge investment for the owners making the fights to the death a rare ocurrence and not a norm such as the movie shows.

The battle in Germania shows some interesting details and I like the way the soldiers are portrayed and the heavy use of artillery which is the first time I see in the recreation of a Hollywood Roman battle, but then they mar the effect by showing an infantry charge in testudo formation which was not used for open battle but only to breach a fortified position.  The Roman infantry relied on movility and their highly skilled use of weapons , first they approached the battle field at a convenient distance started the deluge of pilum as the legionnaires carried two javelins a light thrown at grater distance and a heavy thrown nearer to the enemy.  The purpose of this evolution is disabling the first rank of the enemy by killing, maiming or disaibling the shields and creating breaches in the enemy formation to be exploited in the subsequent charge.  After throwing the pilum javelins, the roman legion charged into the enemy at a run attacking with the gladius short stabbing swords, they did not use slashing techniques as portrayed in the movie but tried to stab the enemy at close quarters.  The battle as shown in the movie was badly choreagraphed and the romans did not use the advantage of superior training but thay engage in a mele.  The cavalry charge was probably well portrayed.

Again we had the possibility of getting a great movie but some directorial decisions especially concerning the details made it a rather mediocre production.  This is hard to understand as there are many historians and consultants that could have been used to get the historical details right.",1214179200,3,4319,4.70026525198939

This film asks questions that we as a society face every day the questions of right and wrong and what happens after you die. Overall this film is one of my favorites and definitley worth watching.

It's not just that it has more room to breathe, more that the additional footage, particularly the scenes away from Maximus where the future of Rome takes center-stage, raise the stakes beyond the simplistic revenge tale the theatrical version all too often settled for. The climactic fight with Commodus is still a major disappointment not just because it's so underwhelmingly staged but because, unlike The Fall of the Roman Empire, the film it relentlessly plagiarises, Commodus is never a credible threat: where Mann gave him foolhardy courage, Scott has implied he's a coward throughout until even a wounded hero can't even the odds.

Think of this movie as alternate history, the way things should have been, so to speak.  Anyone familiar with Marcus Aurelius the philosopher will recognize that Maximus was the embodiment of his ideal man:  at one with the universe, standing up to any adversity, accepting of all humanity, yet willing to fight for what is good and noble in the world, while recognizing how wretched the world can be.  If Marcus Aurelius could have created his heir, he would have created Maximus. Commodus was, historically, a wretched, depraved man.  While the facts about Commodus were incorrect in Gladiator, his character was aptly portrayed.  The story in this great movie - and I do think it is a great movie - could have been written by Marcus Aurelius himself: the way things s'posed to be.  Strength and honor!",1196467200,3,989,4.851190476190476
1277461,5,B00003CXE6,"Anyone who knows me knows my unwavering devotion to this film.  In fact it was this film that introduced me to the man I now consider a god among men so it will always hold a special place in my heart.  That aside though I can honestly say that `Gladiator' is a masterpiece of a film, from start to finish, utterly amazing to witness.  It is far from your generic action fair for it manages to embody the audience with emotions which for the most part find themselves nonexistent in films of this nature.  This of course is a result of the iconic performance by Russell Crowe who breathes so much life and realism into Maximus.  When Maximus falls to his knees to kiss the burnt feet of his beloved wife and child my body was flushed with chills for I felt his pain, his sorrow and his fear.  I think it's safe to say that Russell Crowe earned that Oscar fair and square.

I've always been drawn to epics of this nature.  The swords and sandals type war films have always intrigued me and I can honestly say that I have yet to see one that reaches the grandeur that is `Gladiator'.  `Gladiator' tells the story of Maximus Decimus Meridius, one time general to the Roman army, as he battles in the gladiatorial arenas just waiting for his chance at revenge.  Maximus' life was going well for a time.  He was leading the army to victory (as is seen in the opening battle sequence), earning the respect of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and in effect earning the right to return home to his wife and son.  Before he can return home though he is given a privileged assignment by the Emperor, an assignment that ultimately causes Aurelius' son Commodus to kill his father and order Maximus' execution.  Not just that but he goes as far as to order the murder of Maximus' wife and son leaving him with nothing.  Maximus of course escapes his own death only to uncover the extent that Commodus has gone.  With a broken spirit and a wounded soul Maximus collapses in the desert only to wake up a slave being trained for the coliseum.  When Maximus hears that Commodus is holding a gladiatorial event in the honor of his late father he sees this as his golden opportunity for revenge.

What Ridley Scott has done here is create for us a beautiful and intoxicating story of love, betrayal, devotion and revenge.  As `Gladiator' unfolds we watch the story of a man and his plight, his determination fueling our interest.  We become invested in this man and his relationships.  We develop our own loathing for Commodus (thanks in part to Joaquin Phoenix's fantastic performance) as well as our deepest sympathies for his beautiful sister Lucilla.  Lucilla becomes an emotional catalyst for the film in areas being almost the only mediator between Maximus and Commodus, as well as the members of the Senate against Commodus' rule.  Lucilla once loved Maximus herself but now she needs his help more than ever to help carry out her fathers wishes of handing power over to the Senate.  Lucilla has a lot at stake though.  Not only is she risking her own life by deceiving the Emperor but she risks the life of her young son Lucius who's taken a liking to the gladiator known as Maximus.  Lucilla also has to detour her brothers sickening advances towards her in hopes of spawning a perfect heir.

Russell Crowe delivers one of the most powerfully moving performances of his career (I'm still sticking by his `Insider' work as his finest) and definitely turns out the most impressive performance of the given year.  As Maximus he delves deep into his character (doesn't he always) and gives the audience a reason to watch.  Joaquin Phoenix also delivers a spot on portrayal of the evil Commodus.  He perfectly captures the immaturity within Commodus' every move and that lies behind every motivation.  Connie Nielsen is wonderfully reserved as Lucilla.  With her restrained performance we can see the underlying emotion within her each and every step.  The supporting players also deliver on all fronts.  Oliver Reed is hilariously entertaining as Proximo and Richard Harris is effective as the dying Marcus Aurelius, but it's Djimon Hounsou who really shines here.  With his moving portrayal of Juba, a fellow gladiator, he brings to us a glimmer of hope amidst the doomed affair.  It's no wonder this man is a two time Oscar nominee already.

As wonderfully effective as the cast truly is there is no star like the amazing cinematography.  With each and every passing of the camera lens the screen illuminates with detail unlike any other.  The Italian country side is gorgeously captured, the Roman Coliseum (as digitally remastered as it is) is fantastically accurate and the set designs are breathtaking to say the least.  What I found amazing was that each and every actor looked dignified and authentic, which is hard to do when you're running around in togas and fighting in sandals.  Nothing looks cheesy but everything looks as it should and carries the feeling of weighty authority that it deserves.

I'm sure there are plenty of individuals who will find fault with this film but this is one of the only times where I wholeheartedly agree with the Academy in their choice of best film of the year.  `Gladiator' is, in my humble opinion, the best film to be released in 2000, and in some areas the best film to be released in the past decade.  It's one of, if not my favorite film of all time, but even I will admit to the biased love that is my undying devotion to Russell Crowe as being the main reason I say that.  Whether or not you worship this film as much as I do I'm sure you at least have to agree that it is, above all else, stunning.",1192924800,,5632,4.628398791540786
1277462,4,B00003CXE6,"2000's ""Gladiator"" is a visually stunning throw-back to an earlier era of epic movie-making. Director Ridley Scott recreates the Roman Empire in all its decadence, as an heroic Roman General is betrayed by the greedy and unscrupulous son of the Emperor, and forced to become a slave and a gladiator.

Russell Crowe is outstanding as Maximus, the general who is favored by his Emperor (an excellent cameo by Richard Harris) to lead the Empire over his greedy and unstable son Commodus (played with over the top depravity by Joaquin Phoenix).  Commodus murders his father, takes the throne, slaughters the family of Maximus, and consigns him to slavery.  A wise slave trader (Oliver Reed in his last film role) sees Maximus' potential and turns him into a gladiator.  Maximus' military skills make him a formidable competitor who fights his way to fame with the Roman mob and draws the fateful envy of Commodus.  The stage is set for betrayal and violent confrontation.

The set-piece gladiator combats are thrilling and worth the movie by themselves.  A superb supporting cast enhances the movie, notably Connie Nielson as the sister of Commodus and the object of his depraved desire.  The recreation of Rome is detailed and authentic.  The movie is highly recommended as good entertainment.",1189900800,,1290,5.075829383886256
1277463,1,B00003CXE6,"In one scene early in the movie, General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a prisoner who is about to be executed. He is kneeling, with his hands securely bound. His executioner stands behind him with his sword-point on his neck, about to sever his spine. The next instant Crowe is on his feet, sword in-hand and with both hands free. What utter nonsense!!! The only reality in Hollywood today is that today's movies have none. This movie, like most today, is annoyingly unrealistic. How can one possibly be ""entertained"" by such mindless garbage?

In another scene, the Emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) tells Maximus that before his soldiers murdered his wife they raped her repeatedly, and she begged them for more. Today's Hollywood loves to wallow in such filth! I do not, and I sincerely hope you don't either.

In short, this movie insulted my intelligence and assaulted my conscience, which is why I am giving it one star. Frankly, much of it doesn't deserve that.

BTW, I fully expect the negative responses to this review to outnumber positive responses seven to one, which is yet another indication of the serious trouble our culture, and our country, are in today.",1189382400,6,1161,4.883248730964467

1277544,5,B00003CXE6,"With Kubrick gone and Spielberg in semi-retirement, Ridley Scott is now arguably our greatest director.  Gladiator is a great cinematic achievement, grasping the concept of honor, courage, and duty in the story of a Roman general(Russell Crowe).  He believes that Commodus(the new emperor) did in the prior emperor and will not promise allegiance.  It's a fateful error and he's brought down.  He must flee in exile and return as a gladiator, doomed to fight to the death in the Colosseum in Rome.  But the way he does it, with efficiency and honor, we are drawn into his fate and care for him, and the nation(Rome).  The themes are so universal that at the end, you feel that you've reviewed not just his life, but your own...
Now, to be sure, this is Hollywood.  In reality, there's no hard evidence that Commodus(the young emperor who secures the throne) ever did in his predecessor.  His sister far from being a victim was, by some sources, part of the conspiracy not of him but against him.  Eventually, this young emperor was himself done in by the seemingly endless Roman tradition of conspiracy and turmoil.  But, as with all films, we can forgive some poetic license and just sit back and enjoy a masterfully presented story...",1186185600,,1236,4.787735849056604

I usually don't care for some of these kinds of films as they seem to get a little tedious, but this film is very engrossing and filled with great action. Crowe proves himself to be one of the finest actors today. I'm a big fan of Richard Harris after his Oscar worthy performance in Wrestling Ernest Hemingway and he adds credibility to this picture.

It's a good thing though to familiarize modern audiences with the likes of Marcus Aurelius, however, and the movie deserves the accolades that it got. Russell Crowe is magnificent here as was Joaquin Phoenix. The latter's career is rising at present in the same manner as the mythic creature with the production of outstanding work in both The Village and Walk the Line. They're both excellent actors and are perfectly cast in this epic. Gladiator has about all you need from a film with constant action, beautiful sets, and an intriguing plot.

1277548,5,B00003CXE6,"This is a superb film from the opening battle scenes right through to the end. As it was directed by Ridley Scott this shouldn't surprise you, since he is one of the most consistent directors around.

Russell Crowe takes the leading role of Maximus, a Roman General who is betrayed by the son of the Emperor and he gives a commanding performance. The authority he gives off as a Roman General is spell-binding (not to mention his impressive physical condition) and if anything I would have given best Oscar for this role rather than A Beautiful Mind. In fact its a stellar cast all round with Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings all playing good supporting roles. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, the treacherous son of Marcus Aurelius and Connie Neilson his sister.

The cinematography and cutting is excellent, and although this was made 7 or 8 years ago now, the CGI efects still look good to this day. There are some brilliant scenes inside the Colloseum, noteably where the Tigers are released during a Gladiator fight, and during the scene involving the chariots.

Although the film is nearly 2 and 1/2 hours long, you'll never be looking at your watch during this. This is what cinema and film (and I include DVDs in this as well) were meant for. There is no basis of fact behind the story, but in the end who cares this is just great entertainment.",1182297600,2,1380,4.694214876033058

1277552,5,B00003CXE6,"Amazingly, interestingly, and surprisingly, the movie Gladiator received 5 Academy Awards because of its rich quality and Russell Crowe's perfect, pleasing, polished, prized performance. The movie Gladiator is a Ridley Scott film which is a Dreamworks and Universal production, and stars Russell Crowe as Maximus:  the general who became a slave, who became a gladiator.  Although Gladiator is rated R for intense, graphic combat, it is an excellent movie lasting a highly refreshing two hours and thirty-five minutes, and is a movie that most teenagers are permitted to watch along with their parents.

 The movie Gladiator is about the Roman army's general by the name of Maximus who becomes a slave, and then is made a gladiator.  When Rome's Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, begins to grow old and weak, he decides to crown Maximus as Emperor before he dies, because he had realized that his only son, Commodus, was unfit to become the next Emperor of Rome.  Unfortunatly, Commodus was informed of his father's astute decision.  Commodus brutally murdered his father.  He became Rome's Emperor.  Maximus fled for his life.  Tragically, Commodus tried to have Maximus secretly slaughtered by his men in the wilderness.  Escaping the Emperor and his men's wrath, Maximus hurries to his home to try and save his family before they can be killed.  Across the rural terrain, Maximus rides his horse, treads the path on foot, and rests on the rocky ground until he reaches the outskirts of Rome.

 Maximus faced his worst nightmare.  Arriving at his home out in the wilderness, Maximus finds that he came too late, since the Emperor's men showed up before he did and they killed his wife and son, who were not warned of their fate.  Hopelessly, Maximus trudged away from his beloved home and the life he used to have because there was nothing left for him there.  While Maximus buried his beloved family near his homestead, he was slowly lossing his strength and losing the will to live.  Along the edge of the road, he plodded on until he collapsed on the ground, unconscious.  He laid there, motionless.  Maximus was soon spotted by an ignominous slave caravan, was captured by the slave caravan, and was displayed for sale as a slave when he awoke.  After a man came along seeking to purchase some slaves to become gladiators, Maximus was immediately and wisely chosen as one of the men.  Maximus' life becomes a nightmare.

 Since Maximus had plenty of experience in battle, because he was an army general, he fought surprisingly well in the arena.  Defeating every opponent in the arena as easily as if he were swatting a fly, Maximus was prolific as a gladiator, and so he gained a wide reputation.  Because of Maximus' great reputation, Commodus, (who is) now Emperor of Rome, not knowing that the great well-known gladiator is Maximus, decides one day to watch him fight.  Angrily, Emperor Commodus realizes that Maximus had evaded the wrath of his men, that Maximus had survived all these years, and that Maximus was standing in front of him at that moment as the idolized and famous warrior himself.  Commodus plots an evil scheme.  Maximus is challenged to fight the Emperor for his freedom, and when they fight, the outcome is utterly shocking.

After reviewing the movie Gladiator, Jonathan Foreman of the New York Post stated, ""Russell Crowe is simply magnificent!""  Personally, I love the movie!  Viewing, reviewing, and critiquing Gladiator, Andrew Johnston, who works for US Weekly, rates the movie as ""****"" because he, too, thinks that Gladiator is a wonderful movie.",1179273600,,3577,4.96969696969697

It is a heart wrenching tale of one man's struggle to survive against all odds with the only thing keeping him going is his hope for revenge against the one man that destroyed his life.  The historical accuracy of the movie is amazingly good in reference to how the Colosseum was composed and some of the methods of fighting.

It was the first time I've seen a movie set in ancient times where the costumes didn't look like they were taken from a toga scene in a bad college movie.  The script, acting, and music work so well together, it sends the viewer along for an emotional roller coaster.  It is one of those movies where you guys might have to tell your wives/girlfriends that you have an eyelash to get out of your eye.  The battle scenes are amazing, a bit on the gory side, but is expected considering the subject matter.  The casting director should be given a promotion for his/her work here.  The special effects, concerning the recreation of ancient Rome in all of it's glory, are striking.  I found the extras worth watching.  It is the first time I actually sat down and watched a movie over again with just the commentary playing.  Russell Crowe points out a few bloopers that are still in the movie, which I found interesting.

1277832,4,B00003CXE6,"When you go to the ruins of Rome now, you get really no sense of the scale and the grandeur of what that forum would have been... It's hard to get it anywhere except from some of the great epic films of the past like ""Quo Vadis,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" ""Barabbas,"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire.""

Scott's ""Gladiator"" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time...Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier... We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving...

One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed... He's a gruff businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right moment...

Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters... He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor... But there's another moment between Harris and the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen that I liked very much... Harris says, ""Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. "" They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, ""This is a pleasant fiction."" I felt this short scene so sophisticated... It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this relationship...

The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's "" Fall of the Roman Empire,"" had Russell Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is ""Strength and Honor"" is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...

Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character... Ridley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall...

Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, ""Gladiator"" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically luxurious way that really gave the audience something different, so emotional and intimate...",1167436800,2,2752,4.857142857142857
1277833,4,B00003CXE6,"This is a very good, well acted movie. The story centers around a general in the Roman legion who is enslaved and becomes a gladiator of reknown, called the Spaniard.

The general, Maximus, esteemed by all the legionaires that he commands, is a favorite of the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. The Emporer has a son, Commodus, and a daughter, Lucilla. While Lucilla is clearly the worthier of the two to inherit her father's empire upon his death, she cannot by virtue of her gender. The Emperor knows his son to be unworthy to rule in his stead, as Commodus is totally devoid of character and craven. So, Marcus Aurelius, knowing that his health is failing, tells Maximus of his wish to declare him protector of Rome upon his death, in hopes of returning Rome to the people, as a Republic. Unfortunately, Marcus Aurelius makes the mistake of telling his son the same, thereby bringing about his death at the hands of Commodus.

Commodus, now Emporer, extends the olive branch to Maximus who refuses, knowing that something unsavory has happened to Marcus Aurelius, for whom he had great affection. Rebuffed, Commodus has Maximus arrested with an order for his execution, as well as the ravaging of his lands and the slaughter of his wife and small son. Maximus escapes execution, but does not make it home in time to save his family. Captured by slave traders, he is sold and becomes a gladiator known as the Spaniard. This is all I will tell you about the plot. Watch the movie and see for yourself.

Suffice to say that Russell Crowe gives a masterful and powerful perfomance as Maximus. Yet, I think Joaquin Phoenix gives an extraordinary performance as the the evil and sinister Commodus. His role is not a majestic, heroic one, but for that reason alone, his performance is, to my mind, the more compelling one, as it is stangely moving. If there are any Oscar recognized performances to be eked out of this film, he should certainly receive strong consideration for best supporting actor. As to the special effects, I was disappointed because, at times, the special effects were noticable; that is, you could occasionally tell when special effects were being employed. It does not necessarily detract from the film; it is just a little jarring to be aware of it.",1165017600,2,2268,4.780612244897959

With the combination of a captivating plot, marvelous acting, and second to none special effects, Gladiator shines as one of the best films recently produced.

The placement of actors and their performance in this movie is nearly perfect. Russell Crowe is captivating from the very start, and his character's homely attributes make him nearly impossible to dislike.  The character is simultaneously filled with many emotions such as anger, passion, bravery, and loneliness.  Crowe exhibits the qualities needed to perform in this type of role.  Phoenix, in addition, portrays the desired effect through his character with flying colors. The character, along with Phoenix's one of a kind touch makes Commodus create a sense of disgust in the viewer.

The historical aspect of the movie, in my opinion, is very well done. Though it may not be completely accurate, it illustrates the grandeur of the Roman Empire magnificently and creates a good balance between history and Hollywood.  The plot is filled with passion and the classic themes of freedom and the power in people.  The action sequences in the movie are great with nearly uncensored views of the bloody life a Roman gladiator.

The film has something for everyone from the action film junkie to someone who enjoys quality artistic expression. Ridley Scott achieves a nearly perfect balance between having to sell in the box office while still attempting to be as historically accurate as possible. I would recommend this film to everyone.

It was overmelodramatic, the music was bad, and the cinematics was worse.

Russel Crowe is no actor, he reminds me of Marlon Brando in Street Car Named Desire.  All he does is bellow....yay.  He was not even close to Heroic. Though, he's a little bit better than Mel Gibson or Brando in those chosen films.

It really would have been Braveheart, had they forced Russel Crowe to speak Spanish....<shudders at the imagination of it>.  If they changed the ""acting"" for Crowe, why not change the character into an Englishman, or something....calling him ""The Spaniard"" all the time made me laugh when I watched the movie.

1277837,4,B00003CXE6,"Russell Crowe is well-cast and in excellent form as the Roman legionnaire general Maximus, a well-loved hero of Rome and devoted servant of the aging Marcus Aurelius.  Maximus is not only a great commander, but is loved and respected by his soldiers, and deeply trusted by Aurelius.  As his death draws near, Aurelius entrusts the fate of Rome to the reluctant Maximus, precisely because he does not want the task.  Maximus has no ambitions for power -- he wants only to return to his home and family after years of hard campaigning.

The emperor's son and heir, Commodus, however, is not pleased that Aurelius has robbed him of the throne by asking Maximus to restore the republic rather than perpetuate imperial power.  After Aurelius is dead, Commodus quickly moves against Maximus, who refuses to support his claim to be the new emperor.  Commodus' plot to kill Maximus fails (of course, or we wouldn't have much of a movie), but Commodus doesn't know that.  He does, however, succeed in brutally murdering Maximus' family, thereby sparking the unquenchable fires of revenge.  Maximus is enslaved by a former gladiator turned entertainer, Proximo, and forced to become a gladiator himself.  Maximus quickly distinguishes himself in the arena under the moniker ""The Spaniard"".

Thus Maximus unwittingly is launched on a collision course with the emperor himself, as he is brought to Rome to compete in the Coliseum.  When his true identity is revealed, he finds that the adoration of the people enables him to defy the will of the emperor.  Maximus, then, is the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor.  Throughout this narrative, the noble, pious character of Maximus is starkly contrasted with that of the ruthless, perverse, self-serving Commodus.  Although the ending takes some liberties with history, it is nevertheless a quite fitting conclusion to what is essentially a morality play.  The cinematography is of the highest quality, and the gritty, gory action sequences create a strikingly realistic look back to the days of ancient Rome.

1277911,4,B00003CXE6,"The plot of ""Gladiator"" has been adequately covered elsewhere -- a devoted and hugely successful Roman general slated to succeed the aging Emperor, is outfoxed by the Emperor's son, enslaved and returns to Rome as a gladiator to exact revenge. I found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable, with incredible fight scenes including tigers, and an awesome recreation of ancient Rome. It's gotten to the point that you know there is CGI work going on, but you can't tell exactly what it is.

The film is superbly casted, from Russell Crowe as the betrayed general to Joaquin Phoenix as cunning young Emperor Commodus, to Giannina Facio who plays Crowe's wife - seen only is a few off-screen moments. The armor and weaponry are terrific as well, being appropriately intimidating and sticking to period themes. The writing was rather workaday, but at least did not detract from the action. The big clich of the plotline - hero wreaks havoc to avenge harm to his family - was surrounded by enough new and interesting material not to matter much.

The star attraction, of course, was the Roman Coliseum and the games that were held within. As stated earlier, the computer images were utterly realistic, making the place seem perfectly real. The filmmakers also had the wit to allow a bit of emotional depth to the characters  -- for instance, allowing newcomers the time to marvel at the wonder of Roman architecture.

The one false note had to do with Commodus's fate and the intent of his enemies.  Though the historical Commodus seems to have enjoyed dressing as a gladiator and had a too-close relationship with his sister, his fate is not as dramatic as portrayed in the film. Neither did Rome revert to a Republic, as implied in the film. These touches were inserted evidently to appeal to Western audiences, but do damage to history in a way that is intolerable - like writing a film in which George Washington builds the Panama Canal.

The DVD extras in this edition are rather lame, and are little more than promotions for the film. An in-depth look at the making of Rome in a computer would have been fun and educations, but was not included.

Shortcomings aside, the film is riveting and fun. Definitely recommended.",1151712000,6,2218,4.805774278215223

Indeed, a modern-day Commodus would steal the throne of an empire, neuter its Senate (and House of Representatives) and pander to an unwitting populace with an unending series of gladiatorial games (the war on terror).  George W. Commodus has all but assassinated his wiser, kinder, gentler father and eagerly disassembled many of his nobler works during a smirking, self-indulgent six-year reign. He has even survived the challenge of a popular former general (Wesley Clark) whom he did not have to stab in the back before their contest (the loyal opposition did it for him). The still-unanswered question is who will rise up as our Maximus to strike down the petulant boy-emperor and restore the dream that once was the United States of America?",1151193600,6,1066,5.016949152542373

1277971,5,B00003CXE6,"Without any doubt, Gladiator was the best action film of all-time. It's amazing! The story of this movie was extraordinary. Maximus (Russell Crowe) had the ferocity of a warrior but with dignity and character. He combined the great feeling of heroism and bravery with goodness. Commodus, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius's son (Joaquin Phoenix) was a person with an insatiate thirst of human blood and capable of the most inhuman actions. His dislike about himself was reflected in his difficult personality. He was envious of Maximus because people loved him and above all because the Emperor loved Maximus mere than him. Although his wickedness, he suffered for this condition and, it causes into the public a sense of pity. The Emperor was an honest man and he fought for his people. He was never proud of his son and he paid for it with his live.

This movie is the most realistic historical movie on Romans produced so far. The computer work on ancient Rome is beautiful and pretty much correct. The first 10 minutes (battle in Germania) are so real that you feel like you just did a time travel. The violence is cruel and disturbing, but that only adds to the realism of the movie.

Of course, there are some amazing fight scenes as well, in the Coliseum and other gladiator venues as well as Germania, where we are introduced to Maximus putting down a barbarian rebellion. The combat scenes are where the CGI work and other special effects especially shine, with a fight between Maximus and his cohorts against a squad of charioteers making for one heady adrenaline rush.

Ridley Scott is an absolutely talented director. He and a talented team of writers figured out a new way to breathe life in the old formula, with the help of CGI and a talented leading man. One of the best movies of Ridley Scotts since Alien and Blade Runner.

Russell Crowe is more than adequate in the role of Maximus, he did a very decent job on his role and he does deserve the BEST ACTOR from those movies awards. Joaquin Phoenix also did a very outstanding job in his role. The acting of this movie was flawless and stunning.",1144022400,6,2106,4.668463611859838
1277972,4,B00003CXE6,"This was a great all around film with excellent direction, acting, and scenery.  The Majesticness of the Roman empire was captured nicely and the power of it's people and culture were also well rendered.

Bottom line?  This was a somewhat sad movie which was surprising as the title and concept had me figuring it was gong to be a rough & tough action movie.  Sure, there was a lot of action and bloody fighting but the undertones of the film were mainly sadness, despair, and ultimately revenge.  The main character goes through what can only be described as hell on earth from an emotional standpoint.  I mean.... geeesh...how could he take all those things that happened to him and his loved ones and not go completely crazy?

Russell Crowe did a nice job as the under-spoken Gladiator and his nemesis was the perfect ""spoiled brat"" heir to the throne type that you want to immediately choke to death.  Nicely done.

The only shaky parts of the movie would be the convenient end fight that just seemed a little contrived.  Also, I question the how sane the Gladiator would have remained given the horrors he had to deal with, especially on an emotional level.

This 3 disc set has an Extended Edition by 17 or so minutes.  I was a little dissapointed that the little bit with the lions attacking the people wasn't put back in.  I remembered that from the old DVD.  Disc 2 has a great documentary about the making of the film that's pretty substantial, covering aevery aspect of production.  The segment about the ""resurrection"" of Oliver Reed is especially interesting.  The special effects team had to re-do several shots of Oliver Reed and adjust the lighting and colors to make it seem like he was in a different place.  They also had a few shots where his face was placed over a double's body.  I'd say they did a pretty good job.

1277976,5,B00003CXE6,"Director:  Ridley Scott

Cast:  Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nelson, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou.

Running Time:  155 minutes

Rated R for intense, graphic combat and some language.

The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott (""Alien"") and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, ""Gladiator"", who is ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".  ""Gladiator"" chronicles the story of Maximus (played brilliantly by Oscar-winning Russell Crowe), General to frail Caesar Marcus Aurelius' Roman Army as well as a husband and father. After a victorious battle far from home, Caesar (Richard Harris) holds private court with Maximus to offer him his position after his passing. Overhearing this, Caesar's jealous and scheming son Commodus (a solid Joaquin Phoenix) guilts his father then murders him. Commodus plots to get rid of Maximus because of his lust for power and envy of his father's love for Maximus.  Maximus survives Commodus' henchmen's attack, is found near death only to be sold into slavery, loses his wife and son to murder by Commodus' minions, and becomes a very celebrated gladiator in the area.  Eventually, Maximus decides that he must kill Commodus, who is creeping along to the edge of insanity; however, Commodus thinks Maximus must die, as he believes Maximus is more popular than he.  The two enemies reveal to each other that their conflict can only resolved with a fight to the death.

With a budget of over $100 million, Scott certainly delivers the goods. ""Gladiator"" transcends the notion of ""blockbuster"" that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and Ben-Hur.  Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc), but also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting; a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.

The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent occasionally may occasionally annoy, but this aside, he was well and truly up to the billing. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Connie Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guards of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.  So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualize the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe.  A visually exhilarating masterpiece that is not only one of the biggest motion-picture spectacles of the decade, yet considered to be one of the most powerful as well.",1141171200,5,4040,5.0344827586206895

He seems to have gotten away with these shortcomings because his taste for visual aesthetics is peerless.  He is one of the few working directors whose grasp of visual beauty is constant and always gratifying.

In Gladiator, we are once again surprised because the grapevine said that the script was not really finished at the start and it kept changing with more than one writer in the pot mix.  Indeed, the Gladiator story is superficial and the concept as old as the hills of Rome, but one can hear an old song once more beautifully rendered.  Unquestionably, this is a beautifully realized film.  It has all the elements, including a great lead player and solid supporting cast.  Here, we bid good-bye to Oliver Reed, who died with three scenes left undone.  The scenes are not missed, but some of us will miss Reed.

There is also new bonus material on the second and third disc. All the documentaries provide an interesting insight into the making of the film.

""Gladiator"" is on second position among my all time favorite movies. The cast is outstanding. Russell Crowe's performance is absolutely brilliant.

There are so many scenes which are pure joy to watch. The dialog and the score are pure ""ear-candy"". I am not a fan of Roman or Greek empire movies, but ""Gladiator"" is different from all the other old and new films about this period.

The extra footage in itself is fantastic. Some dialogue is repititive, but it draws out the story and make the intentions of the characters much clearer. Also while some of the footage was in the earlier DVD release's deleted scenes section, putting it into the movie gives it much more perspective than can be provided by watching single scenes by themselves.

You hear about the writers' dissapointment with story changes, the producers talking about getting Ridley, their reactions to the death of Oliver Reed, etc.

Disc 3 features some additional deleted scenes, storyboards, massive production photo albums and other nifty things that a viewer can sift through.

Commodus was an ill conditioned youth when he took the throne at 19 and proved to be a latter day Nero. And like Nero he died an undignified death. A professional athlete was hired to strangle him to death in his bed in 192 AD because no Caeser would have ever fought like a Gladiator in the colisseum. Also Marcus Aurelius was only 59 when he died so he probably didn't have white hair and a beard.

First, if you are considering this DVD and you don't have DTS ignore all the whining by the DTS crowd. While its disappointing it is not there. It doesn't destroy the set. Especially, keep in mind the majority of us don't have 1000 dollar audio setups to enjoy the DTS sound. Its a minority all in a hoot on this one.

As for the film - its a improvement. Many have said it, so I'll be succinct. The added character development (Lucilla, Politics, Proximo and Commadus' scene in the basement) all augment the characters wonderfully.

So, without recycling other viewpoints? If you are a fan of this film, more than likely you'll find the Extended Edition enjoyable as well.  It takes what you saw in theatrical release and adds a layer or two in spots. Thats a welcome addition to me.

Only downside - if this was to augment the original DVD release why include the theatrical release again? Space used for the Theatrical release could've been use more wisely. They should've just made this Extended Edition only.

The story of Maximus is a human, entertaining one, the depiction of Rome is the best we've yet seen (thanks to some digital imagery)and as a result, as viewers we really do feel transported to that time and place.  I think some of the history is flat out wrong, like the ending which suggests that Rome will become a Republic again (yeah, right!), but hey, you can't have everything.  I will say this, for all it's glories maybe the movie is a tad overlong, but that's hardly to be mentioned when compared to the magnificence of the opening battle sequence and the tension of the rounds in the colosseum with the gladiators fighting for life and death.  I hear there's going to be a sequel, but it will have to take place in Tartarus...",1130803200,,889,4.503105590062112
1278154,4,B00003CXE6,"It helps to have a smattering of historical background to fully enjoy the portrayals in this epic. Epics have historic consultants to advise the producers and directors on the periods in question and R. Scott obviously listened to his. The attention to detail is very commendable. The opening battle scenes with the Germanic tribes is laudable and quite realistic. Attention to costume and military weapons is exacting (except perhaps for the chrome helmets and swords and the 'kung fu' like handling of them), but thats hollywood entertainment... can't get away from it!

Russel Crowe as the fictional Gladiator is powerful and realistic. The portrayal of Commodus is also brilliantly done. Surprisingly not much has come down to us regarding the real Commodus and most of what we do have was written after his death. He was popular with the public for his games and free bread, but pretty much despised by everyone else, so what has come down to us is believed to have a very negative bias. History tells us Commodus always wanted to be a gladiator and is suppose to have actually fought several hundred gladitorial contests in the arena before the crowds. Of course, one would guess the contests would have been 'fixed' with the winner being a foregone conclusion. However a number of his contests were against wild beasts... (lions, and tigers, and bears... oh my). It is also speculated that the beasts would have been drugged to some level, but it would be impossible to 'fix' one of those contests for a sure outcome! The point being... Commodus was brave enough to get in the arena with them in the first place. He also raced chariots in the Hippodrome (the Circus Maximus), a very dangerous sport to be sure! He regularly wore gladitorial costuming around the palace and gave important positions and money to his gladitorial and charioteer favorites.  History also states he married his sister (alluded to in the movie) and was assassinated in his palace rather than killed in the arena (a forgivable error for the plot). Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent job of portraying Commodus as unbalanced (not insane). In the movie, Commodus murders his father but it should be noted that within the royal family murder was commonplace in this period of Roman history as a means of advancing to become emperor. (His father actually died in bed of illness, but this IS a Hollywood telling of history afterall.) If you don't get yourself bogged down in the historical inaccuracies, you will really enjoy this film. The acting by all is superb.

A footnote: Roman law gave the father the right to kill members of the family (particularly sons) if he was disobeyed or the family dishonored. So, life and death in Rome was looked upon with a very different perspective than we do today.",1130716800,5,2782,4.864978902953586

On top of that, there is a French track (Il est l pour quelle raison? Je ne sais pas), the commentary (good to have) and the trivia track (nice to have). Disc 1 suffered from having all that material crammed into it. The audio quality is worse than the Dolby track of the original Signature DVD. But if you've heard the DTS track on the original you just could not sit through this one. Once you go DTS you can't go back! Why didn't the producers of the extended edition simply put each version of Gladiator on a separate DVD? A 3-disc box could easily have been a 4-disc box without much extra expense. They could have done away with the French track to increase the bit rate. Heck, they could've done away with the theatrical version altogether! Near the end of the trivia track they suggest that the fans keep both DVD editions together as one 5-disc super edition. Then what is the point of having two theatrical versions in that collection? Although I'm disappointed I still have to say that the documentaries on disc 2 are very good.

With a small disclaimer by Ridley Scott before the film, letting the viewer know that ""this is not a director's cut"", the movie still plays through weaving an even more elaborate and engaging story.

1278159,3,B00003CXE6,"Truly it wasn't. My friend and I watched the film and we were expecting a lot more excitement than there was. My friend was right there was way too much dramatics and not enough action and the acting in itself was kind of lame in parts. Russell Crowe is a very wooden actor to me. It's like he had one face on the whole time in the film and I was thinking what is he truly feeling right here- is he mad, sad, worried? Russell is not the best actor again the wooden performance he gave turned me off from the passion that the film should have been leaking out. And every leading actress is always trying to find justice and also wants something extra from the man who is supposed to bring this justice- I mean that is getting so cliche and I didn't like watching that same old material in this film. Couldn't the Ceaser's sister just want to save her home without any romantic feelings involved? I mean honestly. That is kind of stereotypical and it gets old. Braveheart did the same thing and I think these romances are rushed and honestly there is no time for them. Like I said, the drama was overdone and there wasn't enough action.

The only interesting parts were where Russell was standing ready to fight. The tiger scene was particuarly interesting and the woman with the arrows. Then at the very end with the very last fight scene. And these interesting parts hardly took long to finish, and then once more they went back to the dramatics. I don't know, maybe I'm too picky, but I have seen better historic films and this definitely is a mere average historic film. It was nothing breakthrough except for the plot, which didn't carry out too well. With a few more fight scenes, and a few snip snips to the overfilled drama and a cut out of the romance between the ceaser's sister and Russell- it doesn't work at all in that film- I don't think this film wouldn't have been bad. What historical film- makers need to know is that when we watch swords and armor we expect to see that a lot of the time, and when their armor comes off then they better have a good and interesting reason for it that keeps the movie going into more exciting scenes instead of lazing off into dramatics we could care less about and further just bore us. Just a pinch of drama and plenty of fight scenes is what a historical film is- I think people don't get that at this present time and that is why I am constantly bogged down with drama- fillers like Alexander that I am fooled in thinking will actually be an exciting action film.

1278231,4,B00003CXE6,"""Hail Caesar! Those who are about to die salute you!"" And Ridley Scott's brilliant skills as a director certainly brought vivid imagery to the pageantries and spectacles of the Roman Empire. The film is more a historical fantasy epic as opposed to strictly a historical epic.  In addition to a fantasy context, the film is also plagued by various historical/anthropological errors.

As a fantasy, the film's historical license makes the story historically absurd. It would be somewhat akin to having George Washington being an officer to a tyrannical George III and who flees from him after he's accused of plotting against the crown.  In the mean time, George III has Washington's entire family executed.  Washington finds refuge in the Americas and returns to London for revenge.  He fights George III mano-a-mano in front of a full Parliament and kills him.  Washington returns to the colonies and announces their independence.  Hurrah! And even that would be less of a stretch than this film's story.  Maximus is not a real figure but rather a composite of several Maximi. The film also makes it seem as if Commodus died in a short time after he began his reign which was not the case. Although Commodus did personally participate in gladiatorial spectacles, he was not killed in the arena but instead killed in his chambers 13 years into his reign.  Although the film's end leaves the question open whether the Republic was restored: it was not and the notion of republicanism in Rome at that time is equally erroneous.  In terms of a popular republican movement, the last time the Senate seriously contemplated restoring the Republic was upon the death of Nero over 120 years before. Such sentiments were long dead when Commodus ruled and people had become both dependent and accustomed to imperial despotism.  A well developed imperial bureaucracy provided many peoples with prominent positions and considerable influence to keep the imperial institution fixed as a permanent one. The scene with senators Gaius and Falco tempting Maximus with thoughts of a Republic within earshot of Commodus and Marcus Aurelius is therefore absurd.  Even the 'benevolent' Marcus Aurelius would probably have had them immediately executed for entertaining such dangerous ideas.

In addition to factual errors, many of the sets and costumes were historically incorrect.  The unpaved dirt roads leading into Rome probably the most amusing. The battle was well done and most of the armor accurate except for the Praetorian guard who look more like they came from a galaxy far far away than from Imperial Rome.  The armor was over polished and the helmets completely out of place aesthetically.  The same is true for some of the scenes in the gladiatorial shows such as the crossbows which didn't exist at the time. Finally, Commodus' triumphal procession through the Sacra Via in a pitch black chariot with white blinding marble walls and statues everywhere is not an accurate depiction of what a Roman triumph would have been like.  Marble statues and reliefs were painted which would have made Rome a more colorful place than depicted in the film. The clothing and their colors don't reflect the fashion of that period at all either. The costumes and furnitures actually looked Napoleanic more than anything else. The soundtrack was the biggest disappointment. Although the incidental music was authentic, the wailing new-aged Persian singing for the main title was completely out-of-tune with the context of the movie: What were they thinking?  Is this a movie about Maximus or Mohammed? The music for the Commodus' procession was also such a cheap steal of Richard Wagner's ""The Ring"" trilogy they might as well have stuck to the original. Placing such divergent compisitions as the title track and the processionary one in the same film is more a cacophony than a symphony.  No creativity whatsoever in that department.

Despite these draw backs,the acting by Crowe and Reed was decent.  Russel Crowe fit the role very well as a humble general (those were also very rare in Rome except perhaps for Lucullus and Belisarius.) An entertaining historical fantasy!  The star of the film is definitely J. Phoenix as the demented Commodus.  The combat scenes were a little too quick in sequence but certainly captured the mood of the fury and excitement the crowds expressed at these spectacles.

If they do, they are almost certain to be disappointed even with films that make a point of trying to be accurate.  Story always seems to take precedence over truth value.

Russell Crowe won the academy award as best actor for his  perfomance as Maximus, Roman general turned gladiator.  He dominates the film from beginning to end, and a good thing too.

1278235,4,B00003CXE6,"Lets start off with the historical misrepresentations.
1. Maximus never existed.
2. Marcus Aurelius never intended to make one of his generals emperor. Rather, a general proclaimed himself emperor once hearing news that Marcus Aurelius died however, his troops executed him shortly after for making that absurd proclaimation.
3. Commodus was not killed in a gladatorial battle in the Collesseum. He was executed by a wrestler that he was training with at home.
4. Rome was not returned to a republic after Commodus's death but, a successor was appointed.

The historical inaccuracies here are mindboggling furthermore, infusing fictional characters during history may be acceptable for artistic lisence purposes however, changing the outcome of historical events cannot be justified since thats considered rewriting history which is what happened in this film.  Most people like myself were not aware of the detailed history of Rome therefore we assumed that the characters and events that this movie portrayed were factual to an extent, However that wasn't the case and I personally felt intellectually cheated  for being mislead in that way. this movie did present some factual events such as of Commodus killing his father (although that is mostly speculation since historical records do not clearly indicate how Marcus Aurellius died), Commodus ruling as emperor of rome, COmmodus performing as a gladiator in the collesseum although he fought against gladiators forced to use wooden sticks while he used lethal weapons. Thats why he always won. Commodus also ruled rome for 12 years unlike this movies portrayal of a 2-3 year period.

As much of a Sacrilege to history this movie presented, the plot is nevertheless compelling and the visuals are extraordinary. Russell Crow was believable as a fierce gladiator with a moral a conscience outside the arena.

In conclusion, Ridley Scott basically patched some facts together and made a fictional story. It appears maximus's character was inspired by the  true history of  Spartacus's rebellion against Rome. THe Parallels are apparent by Maximus and Spartacus rallying gladiators of different cultures and languages to overcome  the Roman challenges however, The Irony is that true history of Spartacus's rebellion is more grand and more inspiring since he reallied thousands of people (not a mere 20 like Maximus) to defeat thousands of highly trained roman legions  9 consecutive times in open war battles (not in a staged arena such is what Maximus did). Spartacus amazingly kept up this rebellion for a period of 2 years until he was finally outnumbered by 3 roman legions.",1126483200,,2631,5.305288461538462
1278236,5,B00003CXE6,"Director Ridley Scott has made a movie about dying that lives up to its subject: two of his leading actors died, one before finishing his performance and another following the completion of his. For these two old hard-drinking friends, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, ""Gladiator"" was their final film. How fitting that they have left us in a popular movie of astonishing scope and splendor.

""Gladiator"" is a savage sword-and-sandal spectacle (it revived the genre), a rumination on the politics of then and now, a chronicle of dysfunctional royalty, and a revenge tragedy that turns into a happy family reunion in Heaven. Cecil B. DeMille would have given his last bullhorn to have made this movie, but he lacked the skill and artistic sensibility which Scott has in abundance.

Not that DeMille would have fancied the Freudian dynamic of the script, but neither was he the storyteller that Scott is. In relinquishing power, an aging Roman emperor (Harris) bypasses his son (Joaquin Phoenix) for a popular general (Russell Crowe) to rule the empire as a republic. After an act of patricide, the son later sums up his dilemma: ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an empire.""

As the general-cum-gladiator, Crowe commands the screen impressively and got an Oscar for it. Phoenix gives the most complex performance and should have won one (he was nominated); Connie Nielsen, as his wary sister, spends most of the movie dodging his incestuous advances. Derek Jacobi seems to have been born a Roman senator. There isn't a weak performance in the picture and several are outstanding, including those by Harris and Reed.

Computer graphics provide some of the most mind-boggling images ever created: amassed warriors on battlefields, bustling streets of the ancient world, sweeping views of cityscapes and landscapes, and a Forum overview that includes the entire Coliseum; when gladiators enter it, the camera completely circles them, giving us an eye-popping view of the huge interior crowded with Romans screaming for blood.

Scott has an artist's eye for composition and juxtaposition. He knows when to pull his camera back, when to thrust forward. The production design, art direction, costuming and music for this movie are brilliant, as this extended DVD version attests. The supplements on the three discs are generous and non-repetitive, and the extra 17 minutes of footage deepen and finish the film.

""Gladiator"" is an intimate epic, if there can be such a thing, and a large scale piece of big box office entertainment. Is there anything the movies can't do?",1126051200,4,2621,5.11214953271028

Do not buy the extended version. The studios must be stopped from making these multiple versions of their movies on DVDs.
Backbeat is released by the studio with only a 2.0 track on it then released later in 5.1. Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas was giving similar treatment.
If you have a home theatre system then you have even less reason to buy this extended edition. Where do the studios get off releasing a movie with a DTS track on it then releasing a longer version missing the DTS track? They tried to do this with The Bourne Identity. Guess which one I'm keeping? That's right, the DTS version. Gladiator has one of the best DTS tracks ever on it, everything is so clear and perfectly balanced. I'm sick of the way the studios keep screwing over the public by not releasing the ""Special"" edition as the normal edition.

Gladiator DTS:ES 6.1 is the only version of this movie that should be released. Help teach the studios that they can't screw us around like this.

While the new packaging and the extra documentary features are OK, this new edition doesn't really add anything of interest. Let me list some of the problems I found with the Extended Edition:

- First of all, no DTS soundtrack, which detracts a lot of value from any updated version of the film. The DTS track in the original DVD release was extraordinary, and it's difficult to understand why it is missing in this special edition.

- The new Dolby Digital mix included in this Extended Edition is problematic. The middle/center channel seems much lower than the rest, so the conversations are barely audible at times, yet fights and action scenes are very loud. None of these problems existed in the original DVD release: both DTS and Dolby mixes were properly balanced. Not in this version. I compared them side by side and couldn't understand why they had messed up the mix so badly in this super-duper edition. It's not worth your cash.

- The new edition of the film adds 17 minutes of footage that were left in the cutting floor. To tell you the truth, there's no compelling reason why those 17 minutes shouldn't remain in the cutting floor. These missing scenes really don't add much to the story, and hardly call for an ""extended edition."" I was hoping they were going to include the much talked about fight of Maximus with a rhino. Forget it! The extra 17 minutes are mainly conversations building up the political conspiracy going on in Rome.

1278334,1,B00003CXE6,"I believe that there are serious quality control problems with this new Gladiator Extended Edition based upon my own experience.

I purchased my first copy on the day it was issued 8/23/05 at my local big box electronics store. I was very frustrated to find that there were multiple quality control problems with disc 3. The only feature that it would play was the production design primer. It would not play anything else on the disc. When I tried to go to each new section it would freeze up each time. I tried over a dozen times with no luck.

I returned the set on 8/28/05 and exchanged the extended edition for another. They claimed they had no other complaints about disc 3 problems.

Well when I tried to play the new exchanged extended edition disc 3 I was even more frustrated because now no features would play on disc 3. I will be returning this set for a full refund this week.

I've seen other posts on other DVD sites where customers are also having problems with this Gladiator Extended Edition. I just read one where the customer could not get multiple features on disc 1 to play properly and he said he would be returning the set for a refund and stick to watching his two disc DTS version that came out several years ago.

I plan to do the same. What a major disappointment. It is sad that there is so little quality control on a set that costs almost $30.00 most places.

So buyer beware is my message. I'd be interested to know if other customers had problems with their Gladiator Extended Edition sets as well.

1278404,4,B00003CXE6,"""Gladiator,"" conqueror of the Oscars, returns for another ovation Aug. 23 in an ""extended edition"" three-disc set.

Star Russell Crowe makes his debut as a DVD commentator, looking back at the globe-trotting production with his pal and director Ridley Scott. Their talk is spirited and informative, light on the Roman history and heavy on production anecdotes. The men seem to be having a great time, especially when busting on co-star ""Joaq"" Phoenix, a nervous Nellie during filming.

Crowe rides Scott about his late-in-the-game decision to have the hero killed off: ""It's cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. Great idea, mate! We could have been on 'Gladiator 10' by now.""

Scott points out some of the new scenes, which add 17 minutes to the film. ""People who have enjoyed this movie in its short form, they're going to like the hell out of this.""

The new-to-DVD extras sprawl across discs 2 and 3. Among the best is a new documentary that, unbelievably, rarely drags over its three-hour running time. A must-see chapter is ""The Heat of the Battle,"" about staging the warfare. It captures director Scott making battlefield decisions: ""I need something really brutal. Chop his f---ing head off.""

A 25-minute segment covers the curious tale of Oliver Reed, who died three weeks before the end of production. The visual effects team shows how their digital resurrection of the actor averted $26 million in reshoots. Reed talks about the film on-set, looking hardy and engaged.

Widescreen visuals on a DreamWorks test disc were first-rate, as they were on the first DVD, released in 2000. The aspect ratio is 2.35:1. Alas, the generous audio options on the original disc, such as DTS ES, have been reduced to a Dolby Digital 5.1 track.",1122940800,11,1742,4.969072164948454

As for Crowe: if you have any doubts about his acting ability, please see Romper Stomper (1993).  His character in that movie, the charismatic but terrifyingly cold leader of a gang of skinheads, is the polar opposite of the one he plays here in Gladiator.

1278488,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is possibly the greatest action-adventure film of the past decade, and this is the movie that made Russel Crowe the superstar he is today (much like Top Gun launched Tom Cruise to superstardom). The action scenes and intense battle footage are some of the most heart-pounding moments you'll ever see on screen. Any guy who sees Gladiator will momentarily wish they could be Maximus.

The movie features a great plot, thrilling action-packing fighting, superb acting, great costumes and cinematography, and an excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. The snowy woods and forests of Germania and the sun-baked deserts of North Africa really stand out, adding a sense of realism and brutality to the storyline. The film's score is very fitting for soldiers who are heading off to battle. And who can forget that memorable bloodbath in the Colliseum where Maximus and colleagues face off against opposing Gladiators armed with horse-powered chariots and superior weaponry?

Critics of Gladiator invariably blast the film as nothing more than excessive machismo and violence. I couldn't disagree more. The plot is quite elaborate, with several sub-plots thrown in along the way (but I won't ruin the film for those who haven't seen it yet). The acting really takes this film to the next level, though. Maximus's stoic demeanor and iron-like will is portrayed perfectly by Crowe, who took home the Oscar for Best Actor in 2001 for his performance in Gladiator. Joaquin Phoenix gives a convincing performance as Commodus, a spoiled royal brat and megalomaniac concerned with his perception among the Roman public. Connie Nielsen is under-used in this film, but nevertheless gives a good performance as ceasar's daughter. The film momentarily hints at a past romantic affair between Lucilla and Maximus, but all we are left with is speculation. Just who is the father of little Lucius?

I won't ruin the plot, but the storyline follows General Maximus as he leads Rome to victory over a barbarian uprising in Germania. Following the death of ceasar and some unfortunate luck, Maximus finds himself sold into captivity to a slave master in North Africa who uses his property as gladiators because of the popularity of this spectacle. Maximus hacks and slashes his way to become the top gladiator in the Roman empire and soon finds himself heading back to Rome - ready to avenge an old score. Along the way, Maximus wins the loyalty and respect of his fellow gladiators and the Roman public; in the process he achieves an almost emperor-like status. This sets the stage for the film's climax.

This was the first Russell Crowe movie I ever saw, and I've been a Crowe fan ever since. Some actors were just born to star in musclebound, action-packed films - and Crowe is one such actor. With Stallone and Schwarzenegger both heading into their 60s, Crowe may be on the verge of becoming the top action actor in Hollywood. Of course, neither Sly nor Arnold ever had Crowe's acting ability, and Crowe never needed steroids to build his muscular physique.

I fully recommend Gladiator to any fan of the action-adventure genre. However, an important word of caution: If you are squemish when it comes to violence, some scenes may be hard to watch. There are several scenes of graphic combat in Gladiator, so be forewarned.

The DVD contains several nice extras. There are several deleted scenes, the most disturbing of which pertains to a group of Christian adults and children who are fed to lions inside the Colliseum. Ridley Scott provides commentary on both the film and the deleted scenes, and there is information on the production of the film and interviews with Crowe. There are audio options as well, allowing the viewer to choose between Dolby 5.0 and 2.0 Surround Sound channels. The picture quality is very good and vibrant, and when a subwoofer is added to your system, be prepared for a thrilling cinematic experience.

Some reviewers have criticized Gladiator for its historical inaccuracy. It should be pointed out that this film never claims to be a true story. However, the main characters are based off of historical figures from different eras of the Roman empire. Marcus Araelius was a real-life Roman caesar, as was Commodus (although they were NOT father and son). Maximus is a re-creation of the Roman General Narcissus, who actually did kill the real Commodus. Joaquin Phoenix's character, Commodus, hints at an incestuous lust for his sister - which mirrors the psychotic real-life Roman emperor Caligula, who had sexual affairs with each of his three sisters.

However, if viewers are really that concerned with real-life accuracy, they should be tuning into the History Channel rather than Gladiator. In the motion picture, it is its non-stop action, quality acting and directing, and entertainment value that push Gladiator over the top.

1278493,5,B00003CXE6,"Here's a recipe for a bad career move if you're Roman General Maximus:

1)Start off your morning by opening up a can of old-fashioned Imperial Roman whup-a** on some barbarian hordes;

2)Top off your understandably impressive win with a victory dance around the battlefield on your warhorse(accompanied by war-dogs, no less), culminating in a little tete-a-tete in the tent of the Big Enchilada himself, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (a dying man played, appropriately, by another dying man, Richard Harris);

3) Get outmaneuvered by scheming daddy's boy and heir to the Empire Commodus (the mostly insufferably smarmy Joaquin Phoenix), who does a little downsizing: throttling the Emperor and demoting you from General of the Roman Legions to, ah, Dead Guy. You and your family too.

So that's pretty much ""Gladiator"": equal parts saucy historical epic and revenge flick, ""Kill Bill"" with a toga and a gladius instead of shades and a katana.

It's the sort of soaring, riveting, exotic concoction Hollywood was born to do: use classical history as grandpa's attic, ransack it, gussy it up, inject gobbets of gore and glory and a huge dose of trashiness into it, and in the end just dump the entire audience down the chute into the steaming, sandy vortex of a Roman gladiatorial pit. We who are about to die, Salute You!

""Gladiator"" is basically just 1964's epic ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" with a fresh coat of paint and some nifty CGI-tigers, and with all the eye-glazingly dull diplomatic blather cut out (because let's face it: who in their right mind goes to these things to watch old dudes in skirts babble on about how they'll take over Lutullus? Not *this* centurion!).

Come to think of it, that flick featured the same characters (Marcus Aurelius, love-interest Lucilla, a wicked Commodus, even a disgraced general Livius) agonizing over the same conflict: Emperor kicks off, bad boy Commodus takes over, hero and villain go mano a mano in the arena at the end. Hmmm---maybe somebody should call their lawyers...

At any rate, this version looks gorgeous, and is there anything---anything, I ask you?---that is as glorious as pumping up the volume on the big arena fight until you can rock the rafters of the house two counties over?

Everything is quick, deadly, stylish, and tantalizingly rustic: all the high style (courtesy of Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathiesen, with a martial, exotic score mustered up by Hans Zimmer) cloaks the fact that ""Gladiator"" pretty much boils down to two brilliantly-staged fight scenes strung together by about 100 minutes of tedium.

Russell Crow broods and glowers, and the flick is ninety shades of electric when he's at the center of it. Richard Harris does his patented ""Old King in Winter"" thing charmingly for his five minutes of screen time; Phoenix spins his sword and appears, mostly, painfully constipated; veteran character actor David Hemmings scarifies with his eyebrows; Oliver Reed works it as Proximo; Connie Nielsen (Lucilla, and yep, that was the Sophia Loren's name in ""Fall of the Roman Empire""...hmmm) manages to be shockingly, mouth-wateringly beautiful in a scant role.

But ""Gladiator"" isn't about that. It's about the spectacle at the dark, rotten heart of the Ancient World: about the Colosseum filled with the bellowing of ten thousand throats, filled to bursting with bloodlust and giddiness, about blood and sweat and steel and fear on the sand-covered surface of an arena of death two thousand years ago. In that regard, ""Gladiator"" succeeds wildly.

Are you not entertained?

1278563,5,B00003CXE6,"After looking at all my reviews I realized that this review does the film no justice and I just emphasize my fasination with anything Russell Crowe so I've decided to rewrite my review if in hopes to help a few appreciate a great and wonderful film.

My original review:

First of all I decided to write my review for Gladiator today and I pulled it up and now I just have to say I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE RELEASING AN EXTENDED VERSION TO THIS MOVIE!!!  Now that I said all that...This movie introduced me to Russell Crowe.  I've been hooked ever since.  My wife says I'm obsesive, but who can blame me.  In this film Russell glows, he reaks of star, he oozes forward with OSCAR written all over him...Yes, there are other films that Russell owned, like A Beautiful Mind and the recent Cinderella Man, but this is what really got him noticed.  The story here is quite good for an action film, considering most action films lack (there are a few exceptions, like Armegedon & The Matrix for example)  There is pure emotion portrayed here by the entire cast, but notibly moreso in Crowe and Phoenix...The movie is quite gory, but please don't let that hinder you from watching this film...Ridley Scott brilliantly placed this film together and made one of the best films I've ever seen.  The battle's and fights are amazing and very well put together...everything about this film is eye catching.  I would recommend to anyone.  You won't be dissapointed.

And now, my new review:

Maximus (Crowe) is a loyal general of the Roman army, a man devoted to serving his country, a man who left behind his loved ones to serve the Emperor Marcus Arelious (I know I butchered the spelling)...theres just one problem and that problem is the Emperor's some Comodus (Phoenix) who wants rulership after his fathers death, and since his father is unwilling to do so, wanting the Roman empire to fall back to the ways of the Senate, Comodus murders his father in order to attain rule.  After doing so he has Maximus taken out to be exicuted.  Maximus of course escapes and upon returning home finds his wife and son have been murdered.  The week and tired soilder then collapses and is found by traveling merchants as sold as a gladiator to fight in the Roman games Comodus has decided to throw in rememberence of his late father.  Here is Maximus's chance for vengence, and vengence he will have.  The film is spot on with a tight script and impressive acting on all fronts, a film that delivers solid action with an emotinal sucker punch.  Much praise for Crowe who gives us a look at an amazingly strong man, one who can rise above what he's been redused to in order to free himself from the pain.

What a terrific chance and choice he made. A star was born, and the movie Gladiator, was one of the most magnificent movies of the summer of 2000. Russell and Ridley made such an impact on the world. Russell won Best Actor, and Gladiato won Best Picture. it made such an impression on Hollywood and the World, that every Director decided to try their luck, to no avail.

TROY, ALEXANDER etc. Even Ridley's KINGDOM OF HEAVEN could not meet GLADIATOR standard. Like Chris Rock the comedianne said, the lead actor was not Russell Crowe.

1278566,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator revisits the epic genre last seen in Ben Hur and in Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus. Scott's Gladiator successfully explores the formidable savagery of the Roman gladiator games and the ageless and universal appeal for violence.

Having proven his valiant commitment to Rome, the great General Maximus (Russell Crowe) earns the respect of his army and of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Weakened by a lifetime of war, yet conscientious of the brave and noble nature of his General, the dying Caesar decides to appoint Maximus as his successor and bewilders his ambitious and amoral son Commodus. Before the true successor is officially announced, however, Commodus silences his father's wishes, coerces his observant sister Lucilla, rises to power, and condemns Maximus and his vulnerable family. Escaping death, Maximus is sold into slavery and is trained as a gladiator by Proximo, who knows how to exploit the spectators' thirst for violent entertainment, and who teaches Maximus the importance of winning a crowd. Driven by the mission to avenge Commodus' cruelty and corruption, and guided by his unshakable principles and sense of justice, Maximus is transformed from a slave to a hero.

Gladiator is the product of the carefully choreographed sword fights, of magnificent set design, especially the reconstruction of the Coliseum, accurate costume designs, and weaponry design. Gladiator captures most of its glory in the heroism of its main character Maximus, the General/Gladiator. The character's strength and appeal derives from a well-developed role and from Crowe's accurate personification and skillful performance.

Gladiator, however, owes most of its success to its clever exploration of the notion of ""spectatorship"". By providing violent images of the gladiator games, the film portrays the Roman crowd's thirst for violence while simultaneously confronting the film's spectators with their appeal for screen violence. In this manner, Gladiator connects the violence of the arena with the violence of the screen and establishes a common ground between the ""Roman mob"" and the ""movie theater mob"". Consequently, Gladiator manages to lure the viewer into reacting as the Roman crowd does, ultimately rejecting the villains and sympathizing with the inspiring hero, as the Roman crowd does. All in all, Gladiator is a spectacular film that cleverly uses its poignant images and its powerful characters to create a dramatic story that speaks of the corruptibility of the human mind and the redeeming powers of love and justice.",1117152000,2,2545,5.487244897959184
1278567,3,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator by Ridley Scott won a lot of awards and was praised by a number of people. It is a gritly movie, with revenge, honor, triumph and some decent acting. It is supposed to based on history of Roman empire, but much maligned. A lot of similarities exist between this movie and Braveheart. I do notice that a number of people like both movies, probably due to the similarities. It will easily appeal to people who are drawn to battle and blood sports. Like a number of recent movies, it suffers from a lack of good screenplay. The days of great epics are gone. Many have compared it to Spartacus and found this wanting. I do not concur. Spartacus had spectacular acting and screenplay. I cannot remember any of the great lines in this movie, though it had good graphics.

Spartacus on the other hand had Lawrence Olivier, Peter Ustinov and Kirk Douglas give magnificent performances. Even the lines in the movie are resplendent. That movie has stood the test of the time, which I suspect this will not. People who see such movies would say this is a movie, not a documentary, so it need not be close to the truth. In the past, directors like William Wyler used to Gore Vidal to clean up the script for movies such as Ben-Hur. Nowadays, they do not bother. If something is inaccurate why bother, very few people read about the Roman empire, its rise and fall. All they want is a brief 2 hours of spectacle. I shudder to think that they go back home thinking that what they saw was the truth. This movie had a good score and decent photography, so I give it 3 stars. I can watch a few times, but it falls short of the great epics. The laughable part was an emperor fighting with a general in the arena. I do not know who came up with that, do people who see the movie stop and think for a moment how stupid that is.",1117065600,2,1817,4.344117647058823

1278569,5,B00003CXE6,"This film made me a Russell Crowe fan..I had put off watching this film for a long time and when I finally got to see it I was totally blown away by Crowe and the wonderful drama in the film!  Joaquin Phoenix is also to be commended for his absolutely devastating performance as well..The film draws you in and absolutely draws a ton of emotion from you..It is just a great movie!  What can I say!  Ridley Scott did a wonderful job of directing this film and the actors were perfect!  Russell Crowe was fully convincing as Maximus and you felt every bit of emotion when you watched his powerful and intense scenes..***Spoiler***I was especially moved by the scene in which he first sees his wife and son's bodies after he arrives too late to save them..

The arena scenes are especially graphic and may be a turn off to some but I thought they fit well into the context of the film.  The music absolutely complements the film and the look of the film is what is so unique..This has to rank on my list of all time favorite films!!",1116806400,,1029,4.361256544502618
1278570,4,B00003CXE6,"A Caesar with little common sense wouldn't have a choice. Gladiator deserves the approved sign not with one, but with two thumbs up.

With state-of-the-art digital technology, the Roman epic of director Ridley Scott brings us the return of the glorious city that was Rome. It had never shone so densely opulent; so outlandishly declining.

On the verge of dying, Emperor Marcus Aurelius makes the decision to name Maximus, general of his army, his successor, with the hope that he will protect Rome and give back the power to the people. But his ambitious son, decided not to fulfill his father's will, will untie a chain of events that will change the future of the Roman Empire. Maximus will have to survive the jealous wrath of Commodus, the murder of his family and the infamy of being enslaved. But as a gladiator he will find the way to serve Rome and to fulfill the promise done to the late Marcus Aurelius.

The epic cinema returned big. Reliving all the pomp and ceremony of old civilizations, Gladiator will dazzle you with extraordinary battles, realistic scenes of fight and admirable views of England, Malta, Italy and Morocco.

Russell Crowe is a magnificent gladiator; a combination of brain, muscles and a noble soul, that places him in the same rank of Kirk Douglas's Spartacus or Charlton Heston's Ben Hur. His Maximus is a hero in all the extension of the word, virtuous, genuine, charismatic and very, very human.

The rest of the cast is magnificent, from the selection of Joaquim Phoenix as the despicable Commodus, whose resentments and jealousy are concrete, to Richard Harris in its small but impressive Marcus Aurelius.

Under the skillful direction of Ridley Scott - who brings out the best from the script supported by a range of technological tools- Gladiator succeeds finding a perfect balance between action and emotion. Its main center is in the characters and in a history that captures the importance of our actions. Their protagonists emit vitality, in the battlefield, in the bloody sand and mainly, they convince us that it's worth to live or die by the values and ideals we have inside.",1116547200,,2124,4.886111111111111
1278571,4,B00003CXE6,"There is a new DVD of this excellent film coming out in August. GO to DVD town for more details.

For those people who do not speak, write or understand Spanish, here is a full translation of the review above this one:

A Caesar with something of common sense would not have an option: Gladiator deserves the sign of APPROVED, not with one, but with two thumbs up.

With digital technology of last tip, the Roman epic of director Ridley Scott brings us of return the glory that was Rome.  Never lit up so densely affluent; so extravagantly decadent.

On the verge of dying, the emperor Marcus Aurelius decides of naming as his successor to Maximus, general of his army, with the hope that he protect to Rome and he return the power to the town.  But its ambitious, determined son Commodus to comply not the will of his father will untie a chain of events that will change the future of the Roman Empire.  Maximus should survive to the jealous ire of , the murder of its family and the infamy to be a slave.  But it will be just like a gladiator that Maximus will find the way to serve again to Rome and to comply the done promise with the dead Marcus Aurelius.

The epic movies returned to the large thing.  Reviving all the pomp and ceremony of the old civilizations, Gladiator will dazzle them with extraordinary battles, scenes of realistic fight and some admirable views of England, Malta, Italy and Morocco.

Russell Crowe is a magnificent gladiator; a combination of brain, muscles and noble soul, that places him in the same rank of Kirk Douglas in Spartacus or Charlton Heston in Ben Hur.  His Maximum is a hero in all the extension of the word, virtuous, genuine, charismatic and very, very human.

The remainder of the distribution is magnificent, since the selection of Joaquin Phoenix as the despicable Commodus, whose resentments and jealousy they are palpable, to Richard Harris in their small but stunning role of Marcus Aurelius.  Every actor is excellent: Oliver Reed (who passed away some days before culminating the filming), proud as the former gladiator Proximus, Connie Nielsen in the role of Lucilla, Djimon Hounsou like Juba and the veteran one Derek Jacobi, as the senator Gracchus.

Under the right hand direction of Ridley Scott -who removes the best of the hyphen supported by a range of technological tools- Gladiator succeeds to find a perfect balance between action and emotion.  His main focus is in the personages and the flow of a history that captures the importance of our actions.  Its protagonists emit vitality, in the country of battle, in the bloody sand and above all, they convince us completely that is worth while to live or to die for the values and ideal that we carry inside.",1116547200,2,2723,4.698947368421052
1278572,3,B00003CXE6,"Yes, it's got all the trademark Ridley Scott gritty imagery and fantastic cinematography, plus the usual Scott posers, but as cinema it is the same old Hollywood Roman epic cliche with the same old bad-blooded, self-deluded, and obsessively criminal Emperor and the same old man-of-the-people, victimized warrior hero whose integrity miraculously overcomes the Roman system. Zzzz. What's worse, as history it's retarded.  Nothing happened this way, folks, and there are countless anachronisms.  I don't believe that the movie medium is anyplace to really get your history, but at least it shouldn't try to pretend to be historical when it's not even close to the facts.  This is, pure and simple, an abuse of history for the purpose of glamour. At best, it's simply a costume drama fantasy.  They should have changed it from Rome to Lemuria--then they could have added some dragons and fighting skeletons and emulated ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" which is what this movie is closer to than Tacitus.  Otherwise--a Roman general who's actually a man of the wheat--wow, powerful..zzzz. Take away the fight scenes and this is pretty boring stuff. But yes, the fight scenes were often wonderful.  Too bad it wasn't Tacitus.",1116460800,2,1216,5.178571428571429
1278672,1,B00003CXE6,"I have been of the opinion that Ridley Scott is an opportunist with no originality.  While Braveheart itself fabricates history, it is not without some enthusiastic immitators.  Ridley Scott evidently took the Braveheart forumla to heart, and his attempt to clone it is the flick Gladiator.

I realize it's a matter of personal taste, but the choice of Crowe as the leading character is a poor one.  There's always something filthy and unseemly that comes through Crowe.  I can't put my finger on it, but it's a persistent problem with Crowe as far as I am concerned.

Now back to Scott.  His latest venture, Kingdom of Heaven, again follows the Braveheart formula, and exploits the hatred towards Islam in the West.  An opportunist he is.",1115683200,6,739,4.856
1278673,5,B00003CXE6,"I remember first watching this movie in the cinema, because at that time there were no other movies showing that my friends and I have not watched. What followed was an amazing cinematic experience like no other, my eyes were glued on the screen at all times and I was literally on the edge of my seat. ""This is the story that would resonate in the years to come, the ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur"" of our time"", I was thinking to myself...and true enough, it took home 5 Academy Awards.

Maximus is a grizzled war veteran in the eyes of his soldiers and the Emperor, Marcus Aurelius...but what he wants more than anything else is to go home to his wife and child and tend to his crops. After leading the Roman army to victory in one of the most breath-taking battle scenes I have seen in movie history, Marcus Aurelius summons Maximus to his camp, and asks him to take over administration of Rome until he sees fit to pass governance to the senators. Before Marcus Aurelius announces his decision, his son, a very upset Commodus kills the Emperor and takes his father's place. Commodus asks Maximus to swear loyalty to him, he doesn't and what follows is a story that is emotional, powerful and compelling at the same time.

Strengthening the story in every way possible is a very talented cast, led by none other than Russell ""the Oscar"" Crowe. It seems that every movie he does earns him an Oscar nomination and in this movie, he deservedly won the award. Casting Crowe at that time was a brilliant decision by the film's director, Ridley Scott because he was relatively unknown, so we don't see Crowe as Maximus...we just see Maximus. His portrayal of the man was exceptional, every tear, every stare, every move speaks volumes. This was a man tormented about his past, unhappy about his present and doubtful about his future. This was one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. Of course, the rest of the cast are no less impressive. Joaquin Phoenix, as Commodus gave a fine performance as someone who is evil, not because he chooses to be, but because of the way he had been raised. He has felt vulnerable and not loved his whole life. It's easy to read his mind, ""Why do these people who hate me be treated any nicer?"" With a supporting cast that includes Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, you expect nothing but the best, and they do deliver in spades.

The directing of the movie was also flawless. Ridley Scott knows what he's doing, he has a good idea what the audience is expecting and he makes the right decisions. Where other directors have tried and failed (Troy and Alexander comes to mind), Scott weaves a story that by the end of the movie, every person who is watching the movie, would want the hero to win..but will he? The anticipation that Scott evokes is what makes this movie special. The action sequences in this movie is also no walk in the park. They are shot with extreme precision, that when you watch it...every strike, every blow seems to be happening right in front of you. With a good home theater set, I am sure you will understand what I mean.

But ultimately, no home theater set is needed for you to really appreciate this movie, the powerful storytelling and superb acting is the driving force behind this movie and I for one, am all for that. If you have not watched this movie, I'm afraid you're missing out something special as movies like this, they come once a blue moon. Hope my review was helpful enough to spark some interest in getting this movie, you won't regret it!",1115683200,,3538,4.540752351097178
1278674,5,B00003CXE6,"I'm trying to think of another movie that I could put on the same list as GLADIATOR. Maybe Amadeus. As with Amadeus, Gladiator's sound track has no equal. When you take films like these and add scores that have no equals you get movies that stand alone on top of a small list. Gladiator is the world's GREATEST movie ever made!",1114300800,3,327,4.377049180327869
1278675,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is truly a spectacular movie.  Think that the greatest aspect of it was how ""real"" it was. The movie itself really drew you into it, making you feel like you were there. The troubles the main characters faced really make you sympathize, and therefore make you care about the outcome. I think something that contributes to this was great acting; the actors did an excellent job portraying their characters.

I would like to say that you have to like the general genre of the film to like the movie. It's a very impressive film that you will 'really get into'.

Also, it is one of the few R-rated films that I think would be acceptable to younger audiences (there's a bit of gore, but that's about it).",1113955200,2,710,4.53125
1278676,5,B00003CXE6,"Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and nominated for an additional seven, Gladiator is one of the best produced and directed films of its time. Reminiscent of Mel Gibson's Braveheart, it creates a world so seemingly realistic, that you find yourself drawn backward in time to the glory days of Rome. The musical score, the costumes, and the sets form a synergy that, with lifelike animation, serves to replicate life in early millennial Rome.

The opening scene of Gladiator is simply awe-inspiring as the Roman legions advance on a band of rebels resisting the empire from the outskirts of Gaul. When the commanders signal the order for attack, the fury of hell is unleashed as flaming arrows and iron bars batter the unified front of the rebel fighters. The scene invokes more memories of Desert Storm than an ancient battlefield, and it visually illustrates the overwhelming power that was once the Roman Empire.

The leader of this battle is Maximus (Russell Crowe), a Roman general loved by his men and admired throughout the empire for his impeccable character. When the aging Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) secretly reveals his plan to appoint Maximus caretaker of Rome upon his death - willing him the task of restoring the Senate and eliminating the dictatorial rule of the Caesars, it sparks the ire of his overly ambitious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). When Commodus murders his father, he asks Maximus to provide his allegiance to the newest emperor of Rome. But Maximus refuses, and Commodus orders his death.

A magnificent fighter in his own right, and enjoying the aid of friends in the legion, Maximus manages to escape his death sentence. Traveling thousands of miles to his home only to find his wife and son murdered, a broken Maximus is taken prisoner and sold as a slave to a man named Proximo (Oliver Reed). The older man hopes to profit from his slaves by training them to become gladiators.

At this point, the true action of the movie takes hold, as Maximus (ideal soldier of the Roman Empire) runs roughshod over his opponents in the gladiatorial arena. With every conceivable weapon of the time deployed against him, and sometimes facing down a number of opponents simultaneously, Maximus leaves the ring time and time again as a triumphant victor.

Having enriched his owner, Maximus eventually makes his way back to Rome where he plans to fight as a gladiator in the greatest arena of all - the Coliseum. Meanwhile, Lucilla (sister of Commodus and former lover of Maximus) works as a power broker behind the scenes, attempting to bring the Senate and the army together in order to remove Commodus and restore the power of the Republic. When Maximus defies Emperor Commodus in front of a packed house at the Coliseum, he's forced to remove his mask and announce his true identity to the Roman people. The revelation leads to an unprecedented gladiatorial contest - Maximus versus a sitting Roman Emperor, with the victor acquiring total power. But the sleazy Commodus has a few tricks up his sleeve, and he doesn't plan to give in easily to arch enemy...

As a work of entertainment, Gladiator is second to none. The action sequences provide endless thrills, and the dialogue between the characters is wrought with political intrigue, lust for power, and conflicting realities. Russell Crowe is superb in his role as the hero Maximus. Noble in his intentions and powerful as a leader, Maximus represents the ideal of honor and chivalry. One of those rare films that forces the audience to root for its characters, Gladiator is a definite must-see film. If you liked the movies Braveheart or The Patriot, then you'll love Gladiator...

1278677,4,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator was released back in May of 2000 and quickly became a box-office smash and was certainly one of the biggest films of the summer.  I remember how thrilled I was while viewing it at the cinema.  It soon earned a lot of oscar nominations and took home 5 Academy Awards including Best Picutre and Best Actor, unfortunately Director Ridley Scott did not take home an oscar because he lost to Steven Soderbergh for ""Traffic.""

  Russell Crowe stars as the general Maximus in this exciting epic.  Joaquin Phoenix delivers a superb performance as the evil emperor Commodus.  Connie Nielson, Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris all deliver fine performances too in supporting roles.  This film is a grand epic, featuring wonderful and exciting fight sequences, beautiful sets and locations and of course great direction.

Many comparisons have made to ""Braveheart,"" and well they don't seem entirely just, I love Braveheart and coincidentally it also won 5 Academy Awards, but I feel they are both excellent films and two stand-out epics.  THey are certainly two of the best epics that have come out in the last 10 years.  Also many comparisons have made between this film, ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy.""

While I did enjoy ""Troy,"" and thought it was a tremendously entertaining film, I feel that ""Gladiator"" was a more substantial film with a better script and better acting.  In terms of action, well that's hard to say.  Both deliver excellent action sequences, but Troy's action sequences are bigger, considering some of the action sequences are major battles.

  Overall this film is a beautiful movie, with an excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard and is certainly much better than Troy's soundtrack by James Horner, though that isn't a terrible soundtrack.  This is a must-own film or at least rent it.",1111881600,2,1842,5.023102310231023
1278678,5,B00003CXE6,"I know this film came out almost five years ago, but I just watched it again last weekend and I can't resist logging onto Amazon and telling you how inspiring this story is.

I'll skip talking about what a great actor Russel is (and he truly is) and jump right to the heart of the story.  Ridley Scott has created for us a tale of a man who was born to be a warrior but who at heart is a gentle, sad, kind hearted man who wants nothing more in life then to honor his wife and son, and the depths to which he searches his soul to reach that goal left me more aware of my own place in life and how I must strive harder to lead a more fulfilling existence.

I don't see this as an action film.  Okay, I know that it IS of course, an action film, but to be honest the fight scenes are few and far between.  Yes, there is some blood and gore.  No, it is not excessive.  Yes, people die.  No, it is not glamorized.

The real story takes place out of the Coliseum and comes to life in the dialog:  Maximus (Crow) with his soldiers and fellow gladiators, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) with his sister, Commodus with the Senators, Maximus with the child Lucious.  The dialog is remarkably well written, and the acting is stunning.  THIS is where the real story takes place.

And to punch-down what was already a timeless masterpiece, the cinematography, the special effects and the music are humbling in their perfection.  Normally these are aspects of a movie I don't pickup on until the second or third time watching it, but in Gladiator ever element is so rich and beautiful that you can't help but be impressed with all of it from the very first time you watch it.

This film is not for everyone.  Despite how inspiring it is I don't think I would like my own son watch it until he is well, well into his teenage years.  But when he's ready, we will certainly enjoy it together.",1111708800,3,1870,4.252124645892351

1278732,5,B00003CXE6,"`Gladiator', directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe succeeds, like `Spartacus' and unlike `Troy' because it is less about action and violence than it is about politics and righting a wrong. In fact, except for the opening battle scene with the Russell Crowe improvised line, `On my signal, unleash Hell', the combat direction and filming is not as well done as Brad Pitt's battle scenes in Troy. This is not to say `Gladiator' did these poorly. It's just that the real interest is in the political conflict between Commodus, Marcus Aurelius' son, played to the hilt by Jaoquin Phoenix and Crowe's character, the Roman general Maximus.

Regarding the historical action and scenes, I think the film's set designers, costumers, set decorators, and special effects artists got almost everything almost exactly right. In fact, it is a great treat to see talented special effects put to good use on something other than star destroyers, Nazgul, and vampires. The effects lavished on the Coliseum were not just for the sake of impressive size. They added lots of very effective touches such as the relatively recently discovered awnings used to shade the fans in the upper bleachers. Combat, both in pitched battle in Germania and in the arena is very well researched. It was an excellent little touch to see Maximus loose a sword, only to instantly draw a backup sword from his saddle and continue reigning death and distruction on the barbarians. It's amazing how a minor inaccuracy can ruin the effect of some of the very best movies, such as when modern tanks were used in battles between Americans and Germans in North Africa in `Patton'. You would think they could scare up at least a dozen American Sherman tanks and a half dozen German Mk IV's. Similarly, I really began to wonder why Aurilius' daughter seems to be wearing but a single style of earring throughout the whole movie, which covers at least a year of real time.

Note that most of the special effects really succeed better on the small screen than they do on a big theatrical screen. The seams between live action and the effects seem to be a bit less noticeable.

I have been a Russell Crowe fan since I saw him in `LA Confidential' and I doubled my respect for his abilities when I saw his appearance on the Bravo interview show, `Inside the Actor's Studio'. In that one-hour interview, he revealed a greater insight into the craft of acting than the interviews of William H. Macy, Robert Redford, and Robin Williams all rolled into one. If any actor can be said to have inherited the mantle of Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Montgomery Cliff, it must be Crowe. In this interview, he said that the cast and crew began shooting the film with not much more than an outline. This may seem typical on a Jim Carrey or Robin Williams comedy where the producers are reasonable in expecting the great improvisational talents of these actors to carry them over the rough spots, but this seems inconceivable when you are shooting a historical costume drama with a budget of over 100 million dollars. It turns out that some of the most effective lines in the movie were Crowe inventions on the spot. The importance of Crowe to the movie cannot be underestimated, as the intensity drops by several notches when Crowe is not on the screen, and by several more when neither Crowe nor Phoenix are on the screen.

The three veteran character actors, Oliver Reed as the gladiator master, Richard Harris as Emperor Marcus Aurelius, and Derek Jacobi as the Roman senator, Graccus, competently carry out their roles, but none are quite as convincing as the second string actors in the great Masterpiece Theatre series `I, Claudius'. Their performances also cannot hold a candle to the similar roles in `Spartacus' played by Peter Ustinov, Laurence Olivier, and Charles Laughton. I think this is not from lack of talent, I think it is from poor writing. The only other important role, Marcus Aurelius' daughter, is very weakly played and written. Against Crowe and Phoenix, the part really needed a much stronger presence such as Angelina Jolie, Hillary Swank, or Charlize Theron. These quasi-historical characters need both powerful performances and recognizable faces so you instantly know this is an important character, since they will probably be on the screen for less than a quarter of the movie.

All of this is interesting to gab about, but the real meat of the movie, again, is politics. This shows that even in dictatorships, even those backed up by hereditary legitimacy, having the backing of the nobility and the army was required to carry out your agenda. As far as I have been able to determine from my reading of history, much of this story is fictional, based on the real Emperor Marcus Aurelius, his campaign against the Teutons, his death, and the succession of his son, Comedus. I can find no trace of the character Maximus. Crowe's description of the genesis of the character in his interview convinces me that he is pure invention, which the writers were to name `Narcissus'. Crowe talked them out of that one. But that is neither here nor there. The drama is based on the fact that as a gladiator, Maximus gains the favor of the crowd by his victories in the arena, and Comedus cannot dispatch him except in a public venue.

I must say that the music written for the movie, especially for the dream sequences when Maximus anticipates returning to his family in Elysium (heaven of Roman religion), is especially effective, even if the tunes and the vocals have a very strong Gaelic sound to them. The dream melodies would fit quite nicely into the elven scenes of `Lord of the Rings' as they do in ancient Rome.

`Gladiator' may not endure as a classic like `Spartacus', but Crowe's performance alone is worth the price of admission.",1110672000,,5814,4.813813813813814

It really doesn't get much better than this! I also want to respond to the review titled ""pure hollywood"" by king wolf, where the reviewer criticizes the scene where Maximus and Commodus battle in the Colosseum. This scene actually has historical significance! Commodus, whose character is fairly strictly based on the Roman emperor of the same name, did battle gladiators in the Colosseum as a way of showing off for the people of Rome. Although he wasn't killed this way, he was assassinated by an athlete! So, king wolf, if you were slack-jawed during that scene, it was for the wrong reason.",1109808000,3,761,4.7293233082706765

I've seen this film many times and it's never the action or the gore that moves me; it is always the story. It is always the emotional component that shines through.

A close friend of mine is an atheist. He doesn't believe in God, Heaven, Hell, or an afterlife. Nothing. He confided in me that the ending of this film always makes him weep. Knowing what I know about his beliefs, I asked him why. He twisted and turned and tried to get out of answering the question, but I kept after him. Eventually I let it go, but I never stopped thinking about it.

In my opinion, what my friend never wanted to admit to is this: In the end, this movie made him believe.

1278737,5,B00003CXE6,"I hadn't seen this movie when it came out in theaters (yes, I know, that was me, the one single person who actually didn't go see it).  Finally got around to renting the double-disc dvd and am blown away by it.  Much has already been said in praise (rightly so), of Ridley's direction, (superb, no one does it better), the effects (unbelievably good looking, in all respects; they may have not built Rome in a day, but came pretty damn close); the lighting, the score, the action/battle/coliseum scenes, the costuming, all of it magnificent and appropriately sweeping and grandiose.  For me, however, its' the acting that makes the movie.  Russell Crowe as Maximus is terrific, (particularly in the more sensitive aspects of his character, as when he dreams of home and family); and everyone else, including Richard Harris in his final role, fantastic; even the child actor, Spencer Clark, as heir to the throne Lucius, does a nice job in tunic and English accent.  For me, though, the scene stealer was Joaquin Phoenix as the arrogant, jealous, incestuous, chilling, pathetic, wholly mad Emperor Commodus.  We can see his health and grip on sanity decline as the movie progresses; his pallor becomes more and more pasty, his eyes become more and more sunken with dark circles beneath as his hold on Rome slips, and his paranoia and irrationality grow.  The infamous ""Busy bees/AM I NOT MERCIFUL????!!!!"" scene really sends shivers!

I also wanted to comment on the extras included in the double disc set on the dvds.  There are some great features on this.  My favorites are the behind-the-scenes specials, detailing the special effects, the fight choreography, the architecture, the history of the gladiator games, etc.  There are interviews with many of the creative folks involved, including with most of the actors, and they are all delighted to be doing what they doing, most of them playing around and joking in the interviews.  (Russell Crowe laughs about being so close to live tigers in some of the arena scenes, and then being told he shouldn't play a ""girlie-game"" like soccer because of the risk involved; Joaquin Phoenix told of riding into the coliseum via chariot, as Ceaser Commodos, waving to the crowd in a ""regal"" manner, all the while thinking ""Who am I kidding, I'm from Florida"".) It's little insights like that which makes it that much more interesting, at least for me.

My favorite part of the bonus material is a written movie journal by the young actor Spencer Clark; the child really is very bright and articulate and I was impressed with his descriptions of the filming process and life as a child actor.  He's really quite observant and insightful and made friends with everyone on the set. His reactions to what was going on around him, the enormity of it all, with the same kind of excitement and fascination that us laymen probably would.  I liked his behind the scene pictures too, including of Crowe and family and ""mates"" at a cricket match/barbecue, and teaching Spencer some naughty limericks. (Spencer got him back later with some of his own.)  He teased Phoenix about his costume being a ""dress"", and also commented on a scene he filmed with Phoenix and himself where a sword Phoenix as Commodus was leaning on slipped, and Phoenix was professional enough to continue with the scene with a straight face and saved the take. He was so into the character, so intense, that that little mistake made it into the movie and it seemed ""right"", somehow. These kinds of things can't be scripted, they happen by accident and can either be a ruined take or add a tiny nuance to the character. Spencer Clark was very impressed with Joaquin, and so was I (even more so!) upon learning this little tidbit.

The dvd earns the five stars I've given it.  Wow, is all I can add.

Watch the movie, enjoy the extras.  This is a good one, a rare one.  Highly recommended.",1106524800,3,3891,4.794910179640719

Maximus' quest takes us from Rome to North Africa and back all the while providing an extraordinary plot along with some great scenery.

The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in historical adventures after a long dormant period.

Needless to say, Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, especially Joaquin Phoenix's character who as Emperor Commodus, steals the show!

1278740,5,B00003CXE6,"Let's start by saying that ""Gladiator"" is the first great film of the new millenium and maybe the best film of the decade, so far, period.  There are not enough superlatives to describe how great this film is.  Kudos all around to director Ridley Scott, his superb technicians, and the excellent ensemble cast lead by the break-out actor of the new century, Russell Crowe.  This film has passion, it has spectacle.  It is simply breathtaking.  ""Gladiator"" is a throwback to the epics that were made years ago before the costs made them prohibitive.  Thanks to CGI, the illusion of being in the Arena in ancient Rome was made possible.  What makes these effects more special is that similar technologies were utilized to evoke the classical period for the so-so ""Troy"" and the lousy ""Alexander"".  CGI is okay but you have to have a decent movie, as ""Gladiator"" proved.  In this film the effects are in the service of a great story and some great acting.  Enough has been said about how good Russell Crowe is as Maximus, the Roman general left for dead who re-emerges in the Arena as the people's champion.  He won the Oscar for it after all.  Let's go down the list of all the great performances in this film:  Richard Harris, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, David Hemmings, Dijmon Hounsou.  Last, but not least, I'd like to cite Oliver Reed as Proximo, the world-weary exhibitor.  Reed was a great character actor whose life was unfortunately cut short by his taste for high-living.  This film is a fitting epitaph for his career.  Though this DVD package is some four years old it's still one of the more impressive on the market.  It contains some good extra material on the technical attributes of the film as well as an extraordinary documentary about the real-life gladiators of ancient times.",1102550400,2,1799,4.766990291262136
1278828,5,B00003CXE6,"Germania
March, AD 180:
Marcus Aurelius' eighteen-year military efforts against eastern and northern tribes have drawn to a close. The Stoic emperor (who in much of the West has come to symbolize the Golden Age of ancient Rome) is passing on, to have the throne occupied by his only living son, Commodus. Marcus actually had little choice in this matter: Either make Commodus the new emperor, or have him executed.
It seems unlikely that the son would have murdered his father, as Commodus was Marcus' named successor, and was already officially a joint emperor.
Once in power as the only rulng Caesar, Commodus led a generally shameless regime. His sister Lucilla did conspire with a few senators to have him assassinated, and when the plot failed, he had the senators executed and his sister banished and then executed. From there, his reign was characterized more or less by viciousness, caprice, and insanity. He renamed Rome the 'Colonia Commodiana' (Colony of Commodus), envisioned himself to be the Greek god Hercules, and entered the arena as a gladiator to fight man and beast. His unpopularity appears to have grown until, when he made known that he intended to instate himself as consul on New Year's Day, 193, several of his advisors conspired to have him murdered. Commodus was strangled by a professional wrestler on the night of 31 December 192. Civil war followed his death.

Much of Ridley Scott's Roman-era epic GLADIATOR wanders into fictional territory, despite the rootedness of a few individuals in actual history. Of course, this is nothing new. From ""Spartacus"" to ""Shakespeare in Love"" and beyond, studios and producers have used their story-telling talents to expand and explore, creating tapestries that range from very historical to almost entirely (or entirely) nonhistorical.

So why have I given GLADIATOR five stars? Because it works well - very well - on the narrative level! As someone else has suggested, it is not really a biopic. Before the movie premiered in theaters most people on the street would be hard pressed to recount very much about the historical persons involved. Instead, here is a story with interesting characters going through some provocative change and circumstance, in which the two subset stories of (1) Commodus & Lucilla in Rome and (2) Maximus in Africa come together for an almost fate-initiated clash of calculating spite that climaxes in a slave-versus-emperor face-off in the Colosseum (then known as the Flavian Amphitheater). The story exhibits a respectable measure of originality; plot lines are largely not predictable.

The Roman Empire is reaching the zenith of its power and glory, spanning three continents, from Spain to Judea, from the Danube to the Nile. Emperor Marcus Aurelius - having concluded his military campaign against the Germanic barbarians - must now find someone to serve as 'the protector of Rome' (pending the Senate's readiness to rule). He knows his son Commodus is too corrupt for the position, so he appoints his now-favorite general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, for the role. When Marcus Aurelius breaks the news to his hopeful son, Commodus throws a fit, and father tries to comfort only to be suffocated by his scheming progeny. Commodus assumes emperorship, and when Maximus declines to pay homage, the young Caesar orders his execution, and his family's. Maximus foils the attempt on his own life and escapes, but not in time to save his wife and son. Distraught over the loss of his family, the former general is sold into slavery, to be trained as a gladiator. When the trainer learns that 'the games' have been instituted, he - and Gladiator Maximus - head to Rome for an unforgettable matchup.

Sure, Marcus' (and the Senate's) desire to ""give power back to the people"" sounds rather modern, as the Roman Senate of 1800-plus years ago was not as 'democratic' as is the United States Senate - though we may label it a few steps toward the idea - and that and other elements enrich the story, making it more palatable for [modern Western] viewers.

Quality performances by Harris, Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, and Reed. Other strong appearances by Jacobi and Hounsou add to the appeal. Plus great directing by Ridley Scott (especially during the action sequences), well-positioned cinematography, and a rousing score. For all of its shortcomings in the historical files, GLADIATOR has scope and grandeur.

P.S. For those who wish to learn more, various online sites offer some information about Marcus Aurelius, Commodus (and perhaps Lucilla) and about the world of the time in general, but the best source is probably Encyclopedia Britannica 2004.",1101772800,4,4645,5.097240473061761

Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a Roman general who leads the troops in conquering Germania for the empire. When an aging Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tells Maximus that he'd like him to rule Rome once he's gone, a classic confrontation ensues between the brave and charming soldier--who wants to return home to his wife, son, and farm--and the jealous and conniving Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the emperor's only son, who is thirsty for power.

Stellar Film, Fine Features Make It a Home-Theater Must...., September 20, 2004

I usually don't like ""sword and sandal"" films, ""spaghetti westerns,"" or films set in ancient Rome. But ""Gladiator"" bowled me over twice--once in the theater and once again at home courtesy of the two-disc DVD. (In fact, I consider that DVD such a staple that I'll probably screen it every year or so for years to come.)

As you probably know, the plot takes an outstanding Roman general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), from the site of his greatest military victory, and made him persona non grata the minute the old emperor died and the new one, his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) took over under dubious circumstances. Maximus was scheduled for execution by the insecure new emperor but escaped and headed for his villa in Spain, but it was too late--Roman troops had already crucified and burned his wife and child. Maximus suffered a nervous collapse and was sold into slavery.

As portrayed by the powerful and versatile actor Russell Crowe, the plotwork of Maximus' struggle out of that and into ""top billing"" as a gladiator in Rome's Coliseum is best left to the movie; but as I alluded to before, even a short-attention-span guy like me found this meaty film downright riveting. Not to be ignored is the role of dialog and character development that intelligently and even gracefully motivates the plot. In a sense, this is the kind of epic 20th-Century Fox tried to make in 1962 with Cleopatra but generally flopped; happily, ""Gladiator"" deserves its already iconic status. It has everything--an epic scope, taut plotting, and performances worthy of the dialog: alongside Crowe, featured actors include the late Oliver Reed, the ever-so-slithery Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus, and wonderful Derek Jacobi as the elderly Senator who views his nutso new emperor with the detachment of a patrician and the fear of someone worried about the common people's welfare.

Thanks to computer animation and lots of graphic design, we are put in the middle of a quite realistic 50,000-seat Coliseum. (The ""bells and whistles"" special-feature aspect of the DVD package include a fine documentary of the making of the film, and intelligently discusses how computer-generated imagery [""CGI""] played such a foundational role in it.)

Oh, yes, the blood-and-guts factor at those games? The spectacles are fast, violent, bloody and (despite my every effort) intensely absorbing. And needless to say the scene when Maximus confronts Commodus, who had given him up for dead, is remarkable. your-pal-al allen smalling /
This is just one wonderful flick!",1095638400,2,2657,5.112903225806452
1278893,5,B00003CXE6,"I loved this movie, but it is a little long around the middle, and some of the fight scenes are just okay whereas others are brilliant, but otherwise this movie is still really good.

1278895,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator marks the return of those epic movies about the Roman Empire of the 50's and 60's i.e. Spartacus, Ben Hur that seemed bigger than life. It is a grand spectacle of a movie that contains amazing fight and electrifiying battle scenes (think about the opening 15 minutes of the movie..!!) as well as superlative performances from not only Russell Crowe, who richly deserved his Best Actor award, but from an assortment of wonderful British actors i.e. Richard Harris, David Hemming, Oliver Reed.

Gladiator tells the story of Rome's most decorated soldier / general - Maximus. Maximus is loved by Richard Harris - Marcus Aurelius Caesar - who sees qualities in Maximus - strength, honour - that he does not see in his own son, Commodous (a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix).

When Commodous hears that his father is dying and will not be bequeathing the title of Caesar to him, but instead handing over the management of Rome to his most trusted general, Commodous murders his father and decides to execute Maximus for treason - not recognizing the treacherous Commodous as the new Caesar. In addition, he also decides to have Maximus' wife and son crucified as well.

Maximus escapes his executioners and escapes to his home, only to find his family murdered and his home burned to the ground. Shortly thereafter, he is found by Oliver Reed and banished to Reed's gladiator school.

The rest of this epic movie follows Crowe's ascent to ""gladiator superstardom"" while thirsting for revenge against Commodus, the man who killed his family.

Russell Crowe was made for this role. He commands much of the time on the screen and it's impossible to take your eyes off of him. Prior to his many fights in the colliseum, Crowe is like a focussed but caged animal just waiting to spring into life. It doesn't matter how much the odds are against him, Crowe is relentless in his desire to live to eventually get his revenge.

He's a natural leader of other men and it's remarkable to see him exert his leadership skills over the other gladiators who have also been captured and enslaved into this life. Crowe quickly gains ""superstar"" stature amongst the Romans who flock to the Colliseum to see him and this creates a problem for the Emperor, who sees the threat that Crowe poses, but can no longer just have him killed for fear of offending the Roman citizenry.

Like many of the great Hollywood historical epics, Gladiator is the story of the triumph of a heroic figure over seemingly-insurmountable odds. What sets this movie apart is that it manages to perfectly blend sweeping action scenes and great computer effects with a wonderful story and magnificent performances from both the leading and supporting cast. It never allows the special effects or grandeur of the scenery overshadow the basic storytelling of a slave / gladiator who is taking on the most powerful man in the world. Too many Hollywood films rely on the millions of dollars that they're able to throw at the digital and special effects and hope that this alone will salvage the movie (I disliked the Matrix movies immensely precisely for this reason.!)

This movie essentially tells a story that may not be entirely original, but it is told in an honest and forthright manner and is believable. Maximus is a decent man who is committed to a singleness of purpose - whether it is destroying the germanic army in the opening scene. Or exacting his revenge on the cowardly emperour who murdered his family.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the efforts of the film's director, Ridley Scott. Best known for Blade Runner and Alien, Scott has managed to create an incredible canvas that conjures up the majesty that must have been ancient Rome. Between his vision - and Crowe's performance - they succeeded on a level that is not very often acheived.

It's no surprise that this movie successfully managed to be both a commercial and artisitic success and will appeal to both men and women.

Highly recommended.",1093305600,2,3987,4.831378299120234
1278896,4,B00003CXE6,"Ridley Scott, who directed ""Gladiator"", took some of the best elements in classic movies like ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" (the set designs, the big production values, the man-to-man combats, the huge number of extras), and combined them with modern elements inspired by movies like ""Braveheart"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (the digital effects, the realism of the battles, the man fighting for his country and seeking for revenge).

""Gladiator"" is a modern epic with good performances and good direction work. The cast includes solid actors like Russell Crowe, who dominates his role, specially in the physical aspect where he really looks like a warrior. Richard Harris in a brief but essential role as Marcus Aurelius. Joaquin Phoenix as the infamous Commodus, he portrayed one of the most cynic villains in recent years. Oliver Reed as Proximo, he also gave a memorable performance.

Ridley Scott gave a dynamic pace to ""Gladiator"", even though this movie is an epic, its length is shorter than movies like ""Ben-Hur"". He also used CGI visual effects in a lot of open camera angles, for example, in the landscapes there are a lot of CGI elements added to the shots.

 The movie, by far the best of the year 2000, is not only an award-winning production, but it is also one of the few that I personally enjoy watching again and again and again. Not because it is flawless (at times the storyline is quite predictable) but because it portrays life and death in the Roman Empire in such a way that it really bring those old buildings we all know since childhood (the Coliseum, the Forum, Via Appia, etc) back to life.
 And yet it does so not at the expense of the story but through it, from the characters, to the script (they're so many quotables lines from Maximus and Commudus alone to make a CD)...in fact everything in the movie, from the battle in Germanica to the last fight at the Coliseum, is portrayed with realism plus an amazing score lacking in so many movies these days.
 The movie of course is not to be seen as ""history"" in the academic sense but rather as an historical exercise, Holywood style, of one of the most facinating and complex periods of Western History. The attention to the detail is amazing, especially in the opening scene (the battle in Germanica) and the gladiatorial fights. Even most deleted scenes are great in the sense that they allow us to understand the characters a little bit more (Commudus' sword smashing of his father's marble bust is a most see), although they neither add nor take of the story. The casting is superb, with Russell Crow in the main role, Joaquin Phoenix as the Emperor Commudus, along with such legends as Oliver Reed as the freedman slaveholder and Richard Harris as the great Marcus Aurelius.
 I'll recomend strongly that anyone who sees this movie shoudl do his/her homework and do a little of reading about Rome, both as a Republic and after, and the huge importance of the entertaining business in her late everyday life (an importance unreached until recent times).
 Overall, a classic epic of an scope and ambition not seen since 'Ben Hur'; full of action, drama... and yes, more action.

1278966,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is one of my favorite movies.  It has action, drama, great cinematography, outstanding fight scenes, love, great acting, and most importantly, it's a great story.
For those who haven't seen it I don't want to give away the entire plot.  Briefly, Maximus, the virtuous and victorious commander of the Roman army over the Visigoths, is asked by the dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, to become the protectorate of Rome upon his death and return the rule of law to the Senate, making Rome once again a Republic.  Aurelius's evil and ambitious son, Commodus - fully expecting to made emperor himself - will have none of it, striking out against his father and destroying Maximus.  Maximus becomes a slave, then a gladiator, eventually finding himself fighting in the Roman Coliseum in front of his nemesis, Commodus.
The story has somewhat of classic plot line - similar in some ways to the Tale of Monte Cristo as Maximus seeks revenge, but more than revenge, he seeks to carry out the wishes of a dying emperor and a higher cause.  The movie also paints Maximus as the classic Republican citizen, who wants nothing more after securing victory for Rome than to go home to his family and farm.  Unfortunately, events conspire against him as he forced to make yet another sacrifice for this country.  Even at the bitter end he seeks to serve Rome.
On a side note, unlike others I didn't find the special features that interesting.  They were pretty typical ""The Making Of"" documentaries.  And the historical piece was not that new, to me at least.",1085616000,,1549,4.815094339622641

1278968,5,B00003CXE6,"After forty years the Epic Roman film is revised and reborn in unmatched magnificence. The new age of the ancient world in film arises under the vision of Ridley Scott and presents us with the Oscar winning star making performance by Russell Crowe.
  Now that we have the wonders of computer graphics there is no place that film makers can not take us and no world past, present of future they can not create in ways that would a few years ago proven cost prohibitive.
  The demise of the ancient Epic of the early 60's may have been in part due to the fact that to recreate Rome, Greece, or Egypt with any degree of splendor studios had to build full sized sets and people them with thousands of extras. See as superb examples of this real time expensive film style illustrated in ""Cleopatra"" 1963 or ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" 1964 (Which has many parallels to ""Gladiator""). But today we can revisit this old genre and make it exciting and new with our technological advancements in film.
  Scott and his collaborators have given new life and spawned a new generation of epic such as the upcoming ""Troy"" and ""Alexander"" with this impressive and exciting film.
  The only thing I found disturbing in the recreation of Rome was that it was painted in terracotta's and blacks. I would have preferred to see the riot of color that Rome actually was. But beyond this nitpicking I am thrilled by what I see on the screen.
  But for the first time viewer there awaits the visceral impact of Russell Crowe's creation of Maximus.  Truly a star turn that few actors of his generation could achieve. He fills the screen, the film, the very era with authority, strength, and even tenderness and proves here that there is nothing this fine talent cannot do. With Maximus he transfigures his screen persona to the Elysium of the greats such as Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, and Paul Newman.
  Scott has surrounded his star with stellar supporting performers who add to the film with talent and in some cases just the right touch of humor.
  The music by Hans Zimmer, which by now is much imitated in TV miniseries of late, recalls the greatness of Rozsa and Alex North and adds dimension and scope to the picture.
  The cinematography by John Mathieson, particularly in the opening scenes in Germania is of such skill and beauty that the viewer is transported to the 1st Century A.D.
  The DVD is chock full of wonderful extras including a hilarious parody trailer for ""Chicken Run"" (this is an Easter egg. Just look for the Roman eagle on Richard Harris' breastplate.)
  ""Gladiator"" is a supreme effort and well deserving of it's many laurels.",1084406400,,2634,4.658008658008658
1278969,4,B00003CXE6,"Does anyone truly remember the golden age of cinema anymore? It was the era when the screen was lit up with lavish epic-dramas set against ancient backdrops such as Greece or Rome, where the likes of Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston fully controlled the attention of movie-going audiences across the country for three-plus hours, and when going to the movies cost you under a dollar (and that was including popcorn and soda-pop). Well it seems the studio executives in Hollywood are becoming quite nostalgic as they are willing to take a risk and return motion pictures back to the genre that many thought was dead long ago. And it was Gladiator, a film that contained what many thought was a washed-up director and no-name leading man, that resurrected the ""ancient"" genre thanks to its nearly $200 million domestic haul, massive DVD release, and its five Academy Awards wins including Best Picture. Now Hollywood is going all out in, what they hope will be, the new golden age of cinema complete with lavish three hour epic-dramas, gladiatorial and militant battle sequences, and overly-oiled up leading men ... if only they could be convinced to bring back old ticket prices, only then would we be truly satisfied but perhaps that is asking too much too soon.
The story center on a man who was once in the service of a vast ancient empire commanding troops in grand feats of battle but now serves merely as entertainment in the gladiatorial events fighting for his life. Maximus Decimus Meridius was one of the greatest generals the Roman Empire had ever seen in that he courageously fought in battle, won the field when he was commanded to do so, and retained the loyalty and devotion of his troops. Here was a man truly a rare sight in the area of leadership, one that could, if given the opportunity to, lead Rome back to its former glory as a republic and not an empire. That is what the current emperor, Marcus Aurelius, sees in him and why he choose Maximus over his son Commodus to take control of Rome when he dies. Unfortunately Commodus suffocates his father before the announcement can be made public and orders Maximus to be secretly done away with. After escaping from his captors and returning home to find his wife and son crucified, he is taken by slave traders and made into a gladiator meant to kill other slaves for the enjoyment of the veracious crowds. When he is entered in the gladiatorial games in Rome, he sets out to enact his revenge on Commudus, either in this life or the next, all the in the effort of seeking retribution for the deaths of his innocent family. The story for Gladiator, though marred with numerous historical inaccuracies, is quite honestly one of the most entertaining and visually engaging epic-dramas in years. Though it is not the most original story line one could come up with (it borrows heavily from Hamlet and other Shakespearian plays), the plot does manage to keep the audience's attention even against a lengthy two hour and forty minute running time.
Gladiator is one of the rare shining example for the rest of Hollywood ... a $100 million budgeted epic does not need tremendously famous leading men and women to be successful as long as the cast members that are used in the film are suited to their roles and work cohesively well together on screen, which this film demonstrates in spades. The role of Maximus Decimus Meridius is quite possibly Russell Crowe's most commanding performance to date, with the only exception being his role as Captain Jack Aubrey in the naval drama, Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World. He successfully transitions his character from a dynamic general in the beginning of the film to a barbaric gladiator by the mid-way point of the film, and yet at the same time he maintains some of those leadership qualities that made the character so enduring to begin with. Another relatively unknown, at the time of this film's release, actor who manages to light up the screen was Joaquin Phoenix with his exuberant and often disturbing performance as the Emperor Commodus. The character is so overly emotional, viciously conniving, and eerily mysterious that one can't help but have extreme hatred for him from the moment you first see on screen. Phoenix does a tremendous job at emotionally setting a character that you are meant to hate, which only fuels already fervent enthusiasm for Maximus as he progresses through the film. Possibly the only slightly famous name on the list of cast members belongs to the late veteran actor, Richard Harris, though the only people who may have really recognized his name would have been film enthusiasts and fans of his work. Harris presents a character that, although he is the emperor of a vast empire, is frail and grandfather-like in manner and actions, which makes his death scene all the more excruciating to watch. And praise must also be given to Connie Nielsen, the only woman of the cast, who showcases a strong and caring woman trapped between the wishes of her dead father, the brutality of her powerful brother, and her enduring love for Maximus. It is not till the final sequence of the film till we see her fully come into her own and present it a way that is eloquent and yet commanding at the same time.
Overall, Gladiator successfully resurrects the once dead epic genre albeit more sanguineous, vicious and gut-wrenching then its golden age predecessors. Visually, and emotionally, this film is nearly perfect with Ridley Scott's direction taking the ancient world of Rome and presenting to the movie-going audience that is neither overwhelming nor is it trivial to their view of the story at hand in this film. The only major complaint that can be made about this film is its constant lack of respect, or reverence, to historical events and characters involved in the plot of the film. One can say that this is an action-drama that is not meant to be played out for historical purposes but the fact that it deliberately takes historical figures and twists their lives to make them more interesting for the overall plot of the film should be disturbing to many educators, though, it must be clearly noted, that this is hardly the first, nor last, time Hollywood is guilty of such a crime. But taking the film, despite all of that, for what it is, Gladiator is one of the most enthralling and emotionally compelling dramas of 2000, though not at quite the level of being the best picture of the year.",1084320000,,6456,4.775491949910554
1278970,5,B00003CXE6,"The epic may have passed from popularity decades ago, but every so often the genre crops its head up and shows us just why these types of movies are so compelling.  ""Gladiator"" is a solidly acted movie and well directed.  I'm not going to hide the fact that Ridley Scott is my favorite director, and this movie is a good example of his directorial talent.  ""Gladiator"" certainly has its drawbacks, the most obvious existing in its historical inaccuracies.  Although the rewriting of history is irksome, I have to admit that this is only a movie.  As such, it's primary concerns are maintaining quality acting and artistic vision.
None of the emperors - Marcus Aurelius and his son, Commodus - are true to their historical personas.  In actuality, both were very strong individuals.  I tend to think that ""Gladiator's"" Commodus is more like Caligula or Nero - obviously insane with dysfunctional sexual tendencies.  However, since this movie is not a biopic, this is not a major concern.  It's intention was to create a compelling story centering around a fictional general.  Both Richard Harris and Joaquin Phoenix (especially Phoenix) create multi-dimensional characters.  The ending, which I won't spoil here, is completely inaccurate, but, again, I don't consider this a detractor from the film.
The only real thing that bothered me in this film was, firstly, the ""iffy"" dialogue the studio squeezed out for Oliver Reed's Proximo after his death.  I suppose recasting his character would have been impossible and disrespectful to Reed, but I don't think that they did an adequate job continuing on his character.  My second criticism is that the movie didn't show enough of the Roman Senate.  I would have liked to have seen how Commodus's rising power affected that elite class as a whole, but then again, that probably wouldn't have been in keeping with the nature of the film, which centers around Maximus.
Again, a solidly acted movie with the spectacular Ridley Scott at the directorial helm.  Give up your reservations against its historical inaccuracies and embrace its artistic vision.",1084060800,,2096,5.069970845481049

Russel Crowe was destined to play Maximus.  He outshined Mel Gibson's role in Braveheart.  Jacquin Pheonix played a wonderful villain in the film as well.  This definately every Academy Award that it received.  This movie is the greatest film based on the Roman times other than Ben Hur.  I highly reccomend this film.",1083715200,,614,4.654205607476635

1278973,3,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator was the first in a series of recent successful Russell Crowe movies, and I think he started on not so bad a foot.  The plot is centered on a general (Russell Crowe) who is loved by all, until the emperor's crazed son gets wind that Crowe is supposed to takeover instead of himself.  As all jealous based plots go, Crowe is sent away and stripped of his old life.  This is much like Dante in Monte Cristo, except for the fact that Crowe becomes a gladiator instead and has to find himself and ""old Rome"" through the games instead of a prison cell.  It is an okay movie overall, but really the only things that made this movie interesting to me were the gladiatorial games themselves.  I feel that the dialogue and basic plot overall is lacking, but I understand that the basic plot highlights the action, and therefore not meant to stand up to much criticism in the first place.  Historically it is off too, but not everyone cares about that kind of thing these days, but if you do be warned.  I would say this movie is worth a rental, and maybe on a personal level you will find it more exciting than me, but I would not just go off and buy it.",1081987200,2,1154,4.290322580645161
1279052,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiatorial combat is immortalized in this film, the only way it can be: through stunning action sequences and beautiful imagery. It also immortalizes, above all, director Ridley Scott.
Roger Ebert complains of people with short memory spans praising this film while forgetting that films like Spartacus have supposedly done this before. Well, I have a good memory, and I remember Spartacus. In fact, I kept on remembering that film while watching Gladiator, only in the context of, ""This is so much better than Spartacus. It goes beyond."" The action is better, the visuals are better, the story is better, and the acting is better. Sorry, Kirk.
Since this is an action film, the story isn't the most important element, but for an action film it is actually quite good. For one thing, I liked the disturbing under-the-surface incest element going on between Commodus and Connie Nielson. Furthermore, it was interesting to see how Crowe gained support among the gladiators until it became as if he were a general leading his army again. The plot itself needed to be there in order to fully create a sense of grandeur. With its insurrection story, the rise of the hero and his trek to the capitol of Rome, and the look at the people in power, the plot creates a sense of time-and-place necessary for an epic that couldn't exist with the visuals and action alone.
The acting is among the best one can ever seen for an action film, and there is plenty of fine dramatic work pulled off by the two main actors. Russell Crowe is now one of the best ""new"" (four or five films so far) actors in film. We believe, in his glances and the ways he delivers his many great lines, that he is Maximus. He is poignant, hate-filled, and sorrowful all at once. The praise he is getting is deserved. But why isn't Phoenix being lauded just as much? He carries the film in the second-largest role just as well as Crowe. His Emperor Commodus isn't a good villain and has no real character, but Phoenix adds so many layers to him and turns him into a great antagonist that that alone makes his performance excellent. He commands attention just as Crowe does. All by himself (no help from any great dialogue or development), he creates a villain that is prissy, whining, ambitious, pathetic, and malevolent, and worthy of our hate as well as our pity. It's a wonderful transformation. To sum it up, the characters themselves aren't really developed at all- but the acting is so good that it seems they are.
Now, onto the action, which, as I had hoped, is plentiful and intense. It has diversity and grandeur. All the fights were fast, hard-hitting, uncensored, and very bloody, which is what they should've been like. And every single fight sequence is unique from the others. There's the match where two men fought chained to each other, the opening war battle, Maximus vs. numerous other fighters, and the final sword duel, to name a few. This is so much more than just two half-naked men fighting with swords, which is what it could've been. The film also captures the feel and the motion of combat. Ridley Scott speeds up the film slightly during fight scenes to show the chaos and rapid reflexes necessary to survive. During the fight scenes, the camerawork is nonstop and covers the combat as one big blur to the fighters. (But we can still follow the fights themselves.)
This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image-driven action films I've ever seen. Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail, art direction, even distinct lighting (the Collosseum orange, other parts of Rome dark blue). Just look at the wide multitude (seemingly infinite number) of battle masks, weapons, and locales. Cinematography is skillful and impressive. There are tons of memorable shots, like Maximus entering the ring with rose petals coming down on him like rain from above, Commodus' pure white battle costume (when he's being risen up on the platform he looks like a demented angel ascending to heaven), and the images used to represent Crowe's home- the gentle hand carressing the wheat reeds, the door to his house, etc. They had a surreal quality and each were bathed in their own distinct color. Excellent work, Ridley.
A very impressive film. So why can't all summer movies be this good? We'd be spoiled.",1081728000,,4338,4.769946808510638
1279053,5,B00003CXE6,"Maximus Decimus Meridias ( Russell Crow) is the general of the Roman army. Over the course of being general, Maximus has won many victories which has caused him to be loved by not only his soldiers, but the aging emperor Marcus Aurelius ( Richard Harris) as well. As time grows nearer towards the emperor's death, he names Maximus as his successor over his son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix)in a private conversation between Maximus and himself. When Commodus is told the news by his father, Commodus kills him in a fit of rage. In order to keep his father's last wishes hidden, he orders that Maximus and his family are to be killed so that he can become Rome's newest emperor. Maximus manages to escape before he can be killed, but loses his will to go on when he discovers his wife and son dead. He is captured by a slave trader named Proximo ( Oliver Reed) and forced to compete as a Gladiator until he is killed in battle. However, Maximus proves to be a worthy Gladiator, and soon wins the hearts of the crowds in the Colliseum. Maximus uses his desire for revenge to fuel his way towards gaining his revenge on Commodus.
Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" is an amazing film. For 2 1/2 hours I was glued to the screen and loving every minute of it. Gladiator is the first film since Braveheart, that captivated me and left me speechless. Everything about this film was extremely well done. The story was extremely inspiring because of what Maximus is forced to go through. At times I was also somewhat amused by the story because it featured elements of the WWE and reminded me of the Stone Cold Steve Austin/ Vince McMahon feud. The more that Maximus rebelled against the system and defied the emperor Commodus, the more he was revered. The battle scenes in this film are unreal. They are so violent and realistic, that you wil be made to flinch at times. The musical score to this film was amazing. It was extremely powerful and moving. Each time that it played throughout the film, the intensity of the scene would increase. I also thought that Ridley Scott did an excellent job at recreating the Colliseum and ancient Rome in general. Everything from the actor's dialogue to the costume designs were dead on. Rusell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were both amazing in their roles and played extremely well off of each other. Their feud was extremely entertaining throughout the whole film. Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen, and Djimon Hounsou were all fantastic in their roles as well.
Overall, Gladiator is a great film. The story is inspiring, all the actors involved did a great job, the musical score was very powerful, and the film effectively recreated ancient Rome. The 2 disc DVD set is great on its own. The first disc features the film and offers outstanding picture and sound quality. If you have surround sound, you will love watching this film when using it.

  The performances were extraordinary. Russell Crowe is amazing as Maximus, but the real standout, omitted in earlier reviews, is by Joaquin Phoneix, as the looked down upon Caesar of Rome, Commodus. My two other favorite were played out by Connie Neilsen and Richard Harris. Overall, the charcters brought their emotions upon the auidience very well and let me relate to them.
  Technically, the film acheives greatness all across the board.
From the spectacular visuals, state of the art direction (Ridley Scott), and fitting costumes, to the screenplay and powerfull score (Hans Zimmer).
  The many battle scenes are breathtaking and extremly fun to watch. Some memorable scenes included the opening battle with the barbarians of Germania, The first colleseum battle in Rome, the tiger fight, Maximus' getaway, and the climatical concluding battle between Maximus and Commodus.

1279059,4,B00003CXE6,"I was very impressed by Ridley Scott's truly magnificent depiction of his vision for the film.  One can nitpick all sorts of details in the film as historically inaccurate etc., but if those details were rendered more accurately they would often actually interfere by being misinterpreted by modern audiences.  Richard Harris portrays the philosophical Emperor Marcus Aurelius very, very well; his character meshes almost perfectly with the thoughts written down in the real Marcus' excellent _Meditations_ well enough to be uncanny.  (The sole exception is essential for the film's plot.)
Oliver Reed is also excellent as the gritty, wizened gladiator camp operator Proximo.
Russell Crowe brings great force of character to Maximus, a very high-ranking Roman general with long-standing connections at the very top of the food chain so to speak, who also remains down-to-earth and sensitive enough to be personally admired by his troops.  He brings that combination of sensitivity, intelligence and able willingness to bring on extreme yet controlled force (simply and very effectively of emotion at times) to his scenes throughout the film to great effect.
The Germania battle scene is probably most accurate and incredible depiction of Roman war techniques the screen will see for a very long time.  Occasional suspension of disbelief is required there though; Ridley Scott is depicting a vision of a great, well-equipped but increasingly challenged superpower military in action effectively enough, so just don't nitpick some of its treatment of ballistic physics or other small details that could make you wonder.  Sit back and be impressed (and set your player to full-width widescreen).
The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard (who invented her own language of indescribable sounds specifically for emotional effect) is masterful, helping carry the action and intensity along without interruption from scene to scene.
The depiction of Imperial Rome was impressive overall, depicting it as somewhat more organized in layout than it actually was, again I suspect to support his depiction of ""the greatness of Rome"" for his vision of the film.  The outside views of the CGI Colosseum again be nitpicked, but it's still very impressively done and the views from center stage of the roaring crowds in the realistic, well-detailed gleaming marble interior make up for it.  Considering that the bloodsport put on in the Colosseum was put on for folks generally of little more than what we'd consider a 2nd-grade education, I won't criticize the previously WWF-compared combatant presentation style.
The camera work is also excellent, especially when including the touchingly done Elysian Fields scenes.
The outcome is not what you'd expect from a typical Hollywood lots-of-fights film, not at all.
Ridley Scott has set out to display the challenges faced by real people whose roots lay in a collectively held fierce desire to build something people of any time could look back at in both awe and humble respect, but who then found themselves having achieved most of that dream while also finding that realized dream half-occupied by the ever-present dark side of human nature.  He succeeds magnificently; that is what in my opinion makes it a truly great film.",1077235200,,3266,5.30174081237911
1279060,4,B00003CXE6,"This is definately the type of movie that brings a new approach to Roman history and Rome itself.
The movie starts with a deep sense that Maximus is a leader, yet a very loyal follower with deep respect for his leader, Ceasar.  It shows the respect an army has for its leader and reveals a respect for the soldier at first.  Yet, you will see when the one who is ultimately in charge desires, followers will do as they are told, nothing asked, to destroy someone who was loyal.
This movie made Crows career, and he made the movie a good one.  He was good in LA Confidential and great in this.
The movie takes us to 4 locations, 5 if you count the Elysian fields.  You wonder if there will be a Spartacus type uprising after Maximus is revealed in Rome.  The portrayal of the Coliseum is magnificent.
There are some clever scenes to the movie as well, well thought out interplays between the character and his or her actions.  You wonder if Maximus ever will get his revenge on the new Ceasar.
From the first effects of a great battle with the German tribes in the north to the last scene in the Coliseum, this movie with its epic proportions will not dissappoint you.
It is a movie of courage and endurance.  A good example of how someone who is at the end of their rope can more than hang on to live to conquer again.",1076630400,,1318,4.290322580645161
1279061,4,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator has been called unworthy of the best picture Oscar is got by many critics. At one time I thought it was great but not Best Picture worthy as well. However now that I think about it, it deserved it. Okay the WWE like announcing of the Gladiators is silly like critic Roger Ebert made referrence to. He had other problems with the movie none were solid reasons not to like it. Here's all the reasons to like it. The cast is strong especially Russel Crowe in the lead, the direction is excellent, the story is well told and the battle scenes are fantastic. Okay the movie uses a lot of Special Effects for Rome when old movies like Ben-Hur were made impressively without such technology being available at the time. So what though, whether you think the visuals  look good or not they don't hold the movie down and they aren't what make the movie so strong anyway.
  The movie is still one of the most entertaining movies you'll see and it's a shame that Roger Ebert sat down and picked it apart because there's nothing that makes it bad...at all. Ok some things might be un-accurate to the time period.  Still though if you ignore such things and let the story and Russel Crowe's performance take hold of you I don't see how it's possible not to like it then. The supporting work by Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, the late great Oliver Reed and late great Richard Harris are all fine as well. My point is that despite minor flaws Gladiator is still a very good movie and deserved that Best Picture award!",1076112000,,1514,4.494545454545454
1279140,5,B00003CXE6,In this movie Russell crow plays a great roll and he is great at it too. He is in the roman army until the emperor of roam gets murdered by his own son and blames it on Maximus Decimus Meridius(Russell Crow). So Maximus flees to go home knowing that the roman empire would strike there first. When he arrives at his long driveway he sees smoke in the air. He walks up the driveway to find his wife and son burnt to death while being hanged. He breaks down and goes on journey for revenge. He goes through the desert and gets hurt bad and collapses he is soon picked up by a slave wagon and thus the gladiator. I thought this movie should get two thumbs up. I thought it was a marvelous story and adventure about ancient Rome. I was a little long but it had something for every second of it. the movie was criticly acclaimed and nomiated for may acadamy awards such as best actor in leading role and won and best picture and won. i saw the movie at the theaiter and bought it the day it came out. it will make you cry laugh joyful and happy. it will leave you on the edege of your seat the whole time.

1279142,5,B00003CXE6,"Despite the overall good rating this film gets, I'm surprised at the number of picky and outright unfavorable reviews it's received.
True, it's not quite flawless; it has at least one plot glitch I can think of, and it is framed upon the dear old stock B-movie revenge fantasy (which was NOT invented by Shakespeare--it was a tried and true formula long before he got to it.  And while we're at it, I can't say I noticed anything Shakespearean, pseudo or otherwise, about the film's dialogue, either).  But that's just about it for flaws.
The movie is about dealing with the reality of death.  How to face one's own death.  How to cope with the loss of loved ones. What is worth the sacrifice of death. What happens after death; the movie firmly and plainly affirms the idea of an afterlife.  The movie does this not just with dialogue, but with imagery, music, and mood.
The filmmakers knew enough not just to deal with such subjects on their own merits; the film would have been limited to PBS showings if they had.  They knew, as Proximo did, that they had to entertain to get it across to a wide audience.
Did they succeed in blending high themes with blockbuster entertainment?  (For that matter, how many blockbusters bother to try at all?) I'll say they did.  Even most of its detractors will concede the action elements.  But if you haven't seen this, do so, or if you have and missed out on what it was really trying to do, give it a another try.  And as you're watching it, if you've followed along with the movie's real themes about how one comports oneself in the face of the reality of death--one's own as well as that of others--then you too will feel it right in the gut, as I did, at the end when Lucilla says ""You're home"".",1075075200,2,1740,4.460567823343848

1279144,2,B00003CXE6,"""Gladiator"" is an astonishing success -- and by that I mean that I am astonished by the level of success this mediocre flick has attained.
Why are people so enamored of this film? Why was it even made? Clearly spurred on by the fortunes of the ultra-realistic ""Saving Private Ryan"" (which is infinitely better than this movie), ""Gladiator"" is a long, dull, boring slog through action sequences we've seen before in other, better movies.
The obvious CGI is ugly, the photography dank and dark, the script ridden with cliches and the performances as stiff as nails -- including the lead performance of Russell Crowe, who is about as dour, joyless and inert as any actor I've ever seen in any movie. Mel Gibson played a similar character in ""Braveheart"" (lone man takes on the aristocracy to avenge the death of his wife), but with much more verve and energy than Crowe musters here. Crowe is a complete flop in this movie.
But, people love it. It won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (over ""Traffic"" and ""Crouching Tiger""!). I remain baffled by the money and the kudos spent on this movie.",1074211200,5,1093,4.697916666666667

1279147,4,B00003CXE6,"""Gladiator"" has many ups and downs.  In many ways, I agree with some reviewers who describe the plot as thin and lacking real substance.  While the story does follow a mock Shakespearian line, the film is really not that surprising and I was not awed by the acting performances in this film, save Crowe.  ""Braveheart,"" a similar film, had a little more to offer as far as a turbulent plot is concerned, but let's face it-it's the same kind of movie.  We are not dealing with a movie that is supposed to achieve greatness through its clever dialogue and wit.  This film is an entertaining visual splash that I believe succeeds quite splendidly.  If you love action films, the wonderfully choreographed combat scenes that star Crowe and his Roman short sword are spectacular.
Joaquin Phoenix just annoyed me in this film-plain and simple.  So, in part, you could say that he was doing his job.  But he was a bit over-the-top in his bad Shakespearian rendition of Commodus and I just wanted him to get off the screen whenever the camera fell upon him.  Instead of creating an interesting villain, Phoenix created another stock ""woe's me"" character.  Crowe's performance, on the other hand, is quite good-particularly for the amount of lines that he has to prove himself.  The scenes that show Rome at its height are impressive and I enjoyed the transformed time period of this film.
""Gladiator"" is a summer blockbuster that is a fun film, a movie that can be watched over and over again.  Despite its surface-deep dialogue and lousy attempt to pull-off a psychologically driven, Shakespearian plot, it manages to lay out one of the more enriching action films of recent years.",1072396800,2,1673,4.811188811188811
1279148,1,B00003CXE6,"This movie was lots of fun. The story was so gritty and affecting. I remember after watching it for the first time, I made my own sword from scrap wood & laid into some mailboxes and windshields.  Ancient Rome burned in my heart.  GLADIATOR charges the blood with electricity. The characters are so compelling, deep and human. The villain, played to perfection by Joaquin Phoenix, was pure brilliance.  Russell Crowe dips his hand into the gritty Earth and produces a hero of uncommon, brutal honesty.  The lions, the vicious cheers of a blood-thirsty crowd...

I give this movie exactly ONE STAR.  The story, even for an epic, was compelling for a grand total of five minutes.  The plot blunders predictably along, creating little or no emotional momentum & absolutely no sense of adventure.  Kids in a sandbox could contrive a better story than this piece of garbage.  About an hour into this vacuum, I just wanted Russell Crowe to kill Commodus so I could get back to my life.

Joaquin Phoenix ""vexed"" me with his paper thin performance as the twisted, impotent usurper.  Perhaps Phoenix can't be blamed for the job he turned in?  They gave him such a narrow, cardboard role to play - a weak foil to the driven, fertile, masculine Maximus.  There was no descent into madness; something vaguely human that would have at least given some dimension to this silly story.

Ridley Scott created a beautiful film.  The cinematography was masterful - like a crazy European car commercial.  A wild, powerful sports car rolls into the coliseum, everyone stops their torturous acting & begins to feel the fine interiors, check under the hood, blare some music and then comment on the trunk space.  Maybe a quick ride to showcase the vehicle's performance?  A lion could sit on the hood and roar a little bit - an obvious appeal to the grunting desire to identify with virility and power that lurks in all of us.  Oh well.

The mass appeal of this bore was a clear demonstration of the famous quote: ""a sucker is born every minute.""",1071792000,6,2023,4.725714285714286

1279222,4,B00003CXE6,"Written in the classical fashion of the Hero's quest (the old way of Hero stories, for whom their fall from grace is the journey to revenge and redemption), Gladiator brings back the charm and violence of the so called Roman Empire, with its self indulgent blood thirst, and thankfully away from all the Christian topics (commonly surrounding the genre back in the old days), it is about the thrive for power and payback for the sins of thy beloved, even if it is your brother or sister, revenge conveys into the motif to kill for the masses, the most popular events in the Empire, played all over the realm, lasting for long centuries. The ones about to die salute, there for when applauding, you give then back their dignity and will to overcome the other Gladiator, the crowd decides their pardon or kill, and so the Arena is brought back to satisfied the need for such an entertainment, the mother of all blood sports, and the mob's red torn ideal of entertainment, Hail Caesar!
Gladiator was intended to be only an appealing summer movie for audiences all around the world, but it ended being much more. Honored with 5 Academy Awards (Including Best Picture), the film revive a genre that had been forgotten for more than two decades, and almost 40 years after the last gladiator movie (Spartacus, 1960), intrigue political, and huge action spectacle are again the Odeum of Dark Blood and deceive, towards the Emperor's son, to overcome the uncanny mighty thirst of manipulative will over the people, to be their father, and consume the sister's love, twisted and rising over an splendorous dry atmosphere of dust and red water.
Wisely choreographed, and visually breathtaking, Gladiator uses the camera and sound maximum to blend the action / adventure angle around factual characters (Marcus Arurelius and his son Commodus), but away from their factual life realities, Maximus is the favorite Son, and Commodus the unmoral blood, where the story is to much alike, or to much a coincidence with its predecessor, The Fall of the Roman Empire; Stolen or Homage?
Ever since Blade Runner, Ridley Scott hasn't been able to rise the directorial quality that made him initially a young promise in the film industry, with Gladiator he came close (not matching the excellence level of his first 3 films, Gladiator is his best movie since Thelma and Louise), Scott's direction is elegant and visually rich, along with a pace that allows the story develops without any hesitation, the result values by own merits, from Germania to Rome it self, the landscapes are enhanced and enlightened by a magnificent photography that brings all the beauty of the surroundings, (Gladiator loss Best Photography against Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). The amazing visually effects made possible the breathtaking grandeur of Rome, specially in its beating hard, the Coliseum, shown as it had never been seen before, the 360 degrees shot of the Gladiators entering the Arena is the visual climax of the film. Massive fights against barbarians, or strategy to survive the recreation of the battle of Cartage, the choreography stands approaching with realism and sense. Russell Crowe brings freshness to the all to used classic Hero (who's unbreakable in his believes of moral and honor), wining the Academy Award for Best Actor (even though Crowe's performance is excellent, his character was the most simple of the nominees, there for, he didn't deserved the praise). The supporting cast shines also, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, also brings something fresh to the also all to used pusillanimous villain. A short appearance by the late Richard Harris (one of his last films), in the indispensable Marcus Aurelius role, gives elegance to the cast, the also late Oliver Reed, brings sharpness to his last role: Proximo. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla does an O.K. job.
Gladiator posses one of very best music scores made in the last 30 years, composed by the great Hans Zimmer and the legendary Lisa Gerrard, the score is an absolute masterpiece, fresh, strong, solid, and complicated, (unfortunately, Gladiator's score loss the Academy Award against Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, an score that is nothing more than nice).
The DVD edition comes in a great transferring, widescreen edition with DTS 5.1 surround sound, and the excellent DTS ES 6.1 surround sound. The extras are worthy of watching them several times (I love the Trailers), specially the great documentary made for this DVD, Gladiators; Roman Blood Sport, gives more data and insight about this fighting class. A whole combo is what this version is.
Maybe not the best film of 2000, Gladiator is a great visual experience, certainly one of the best films of its year, and a great come back for the genre.",1067385600,,4745,5.015209125475285
1279223,5,B00003CXE6,"In all respects, ""Gladiator"" is the perfect movie that should and does appeal to both men and women.  For the men there is no shortage of blood, guts and gore, from the opening battle sequence between the Roman Northern Army and the barbaric Germans to the exceptional scenes in the gladiator's arena.  For the women, of course, there's Russell Crowe.  For all, this exceptional epic silver screen masterpiece brings to life the intriguing story, filled with deception, deceit and heroic valor, of a Roman General who was on the precipice of becoming the Roman Emperor who then, by a twist of fate, became a slave and slave who became a gladiator and a gladiator who defied the Emperor himself.
Few movies, with the exception of ""The Lord of the Rings"" can truly compare with the epic nature of this film that tells its tale with such intrigue and a truly compelling plot that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seat from the opening sequence to the end credits.
Russell Crowe deserves all of the praise and accolades he earned for this film.  He truly became Maximus for this film, in every aspect.  Joaquin Phoenix played the part of the mentally unstable Commodus to perfection and the ever beautiful Connie Nielsen as Lucilla performed brilliantly.  Richard Harris' brief but poignant appearance as Emperor Markus Aurelius serves quite poignantly in showing what a brilliant actor he was and his talents will be and are sorely missed in the film industry.
Director Ridley Scott who has brought forth such huge films as ""Alien,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Blade Runner,"" shows his talents as an exceptional director quite brilliantly in this film and he deserves every last accolade he earned for this stunning and memorable film.  The score for the film matches perfectly with every scene, lending brilliantly to the mood and atmosphere.
The premise:
Russell Crowe is Maximus; the Roman Northern General who as the film opens up is leading his army to the end of almost five years worth of campaigning against the barbaric Germans.  In a brilliant and exceptionally well choreographed epic battle scene, the Roman army defeats the Germans and the campaign is finally over.  Emperor Markus Aurelius is there to witness the final battle and he's more or less taken Maximus under his wing and thinks of him as his own son.
As Emperor Markus Aurelius knows he's dying he also knows that his only heir to the thrown, Commodus, is not a ""moral"" man and he doesn't wish for his powers as Caesar to pass to him.  He asks Maximus to take the thrown but Maximus has to think about it for all he's thought of during this long campaign is to returning home to his wife and son to be a farmer.  When Emperor Markus Aurelius tells his son Commodus that he will not be emperor, Commodus murders his father in a psychotic display lacking any true emotion for his father and conveying a more despicable outrage that he wouldn't be Caesar.
As Commodus' reward to Maximus for his many years of faithful allegiance to his father and to the Roman Empire, he asks Maximus but once to acknowledge him as Emperor and Maximus refuses; Commodus orders Maximus' wife and son murdered.  He then has Maximus led off by Praetorians to be executed.  As is Maximus' ""talent"" he is able to free himself from the Praetorians and begins the long journey home, only to find that his wife and son are dead.
Here is where this compelling story takes its surprising turn after Maximus buries his wife and son, he collapses on their graves, exhausted and depleted by the wound given him from one of the Praetorians.  He is picked up by slave traders and taken to the Middle East where he is sold to Proximo, played brilliantly by Oliver Reed in his final role.  Proximo is a former gladiator who fought his way to freedom and now runs his own games.
What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most brilliant and compelling epic stories to have ever been brought to the silver screen and DVD, in which Maximus, Roman General, becomes a slave and then a gladiator and ultimately the gladiator who challenged the Roman Emperor himself.
I highly recommend this masterpiece to any and all fans of this genre and who love what movie making is all about because ""Gladiator"" is one the ""definitive"" films of all time.  {ssintrepid}

1279224,2,B00003CXE6,"A predictable ""ride"" as maximus, the big strong, chisel-jawed hero, climbs his way up the ladder of opposition and difficulty, defeats his enemy, and gets to see his wife, in slow-motion, to some cheesy music.  The universally evil and reprehensible Emperor sure made a good villain.  No reason to sympathise for him at all.  The best scenes, in my opinion, were such simply because of the difficulty of the production.  For example, the battle bewteen Germanic tribes and Roman Legionnaires.  Amazing battle. The scene amazed me, simply because i have not witnessed anything of that nature.
If hollywood can't make something original, or believable, then it shouldn't make anything at all.  there are plenty of fine films that have already been made.
Good set design and costume dosen't make a good movie.  Case in point: Titanic. Oh, but it makes money, i forgot about capitalism.
The movie was so incredibly tedious, it's very very hard, to give it a second viewing without simply fast forwarding to the action sequences..... which would belabor the question ""why did i pay for all the scenes i don't want to watch?""
Want to see a good movie with elabourate sets and costume?  Barry Lyndon.  Want to see a good 'journey of the hero' movie?  see lawrence of arabia.  Don't waste your money patronizing Ridley Scott.

1279225,4,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is a film that shines from the first frame to the last, with it's amazing performances, breathtaking cinematography and outstanding direction.
The film is about a Roman General, named Maximus (played wondefully by Russell Crowe) who is betrayed by a corrupt prince, who murdered his family; and comes to Rome as a Gladiator to seek revenge.
Russell Crowe is brilliant in this film. He wraps himself in this character and makes it his own, which gives the viewers a sense of compassion towards this being and understands the pain and anger that he has. Joaquin Phoenix is great in being the villian of the film; this is a role that I haven't seen him in before and his acting capabilities just shine and proves that he's an actor that has many tricks up his sleeve.
Director Ridley Scott, is fantastic in showing us the grand scale of The Roman Empire, with his glorious battle scenes and the magnificent scale of the Art Direction that is found with the Roman Statues and Architecture. Scott establishes that he's a director with incredible vision and oustanding declaration for what he wants to present.
Everything in this film is presented on a grand scale, which makes it's Oscar win for Best Picture the more deserving, since, it's a film that shows the true meaning of human emotion and a cinematic experience that can only be expressed in one word: Epic",1063497600,,1369,4.780590717299578
1279226,3,B00003CXE6,"When asked, the screenwriter of GLADIATOR says he was unaware of an ealier film, THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (1964), although both stories are book-ended the same.  To the story-tellers of both films, it was apparently not important to reveal that Emperor Marcus Aurelius actually wanted his only surviving son, Commodus, to take the throne (thereby breaking the tradition of picking and adopting the best man to rule the Empire).  Also, Commodus reuled 11 years (from 180 to 191ce), although GLAIDATOR gives the impression that it was closer to 5.  Commodus' sister telles Maximus in the beginning that she has a son nearly 8 years old; later, her son meets Maximus in Rome, shortly before Commodus' death.  In reality, this child should be a man of 19, although he is depicted as closer to 13.  In the end, however, what bothers me most about GLADIATOR's script is that the tale is unfinished.  It begins in a specific year (180), and gives extensive details of the northern campaign, plus the Emperor's imagined death.  It then gives pages and pages of discussions on ""what is Rome?"" and how can the ""idea that is Rome"" be saved from the curelty of the Emperors?  Will Rome remain an Empire or revert back to a Republic?  A senator (Derek Jacobi) is introduced to show that the Senate is against Commodus.  This Sentator is finally jailed for treason and then freed - but to what end?  With Commodus dead, and Maximus dead, where is the rest of the story?  What happens next?  What happens to the senator, Commodus' sister or, especially, her son, the supposed heir to the throne?  He's old enough to succeed (historically, that is).  Does he take the throne or not?  Who is the next Emperor?  At least the 1964 film (with the most rediculous ending in Hollywood history) answers that question, with the throne being offered to the highest bidder among Rome's millionaires.  The DVD presents the film in a lovely picture and sound transfer.  Ridley Scott's film is beautifully mounted, and took enormous pains to present equisite details of ancient Roman life.  The acting by Crowe and Reed is especially outstanding.  But without a proper ending, in my opinion, the movie fails to satisfy a certain emotion need.",1063411200,,2217,4.8121693121693125

Gladiators fighting against chariots is one of the best combat scenes ever made and make you understand why it took so long to outlaw gladiator fights in Rome. Almost makes you want to be there and watch it live!
opening battle with Germans is done impressively, but super inaccurate:
Romans won their wars not with cavalry charges but with marches of superbly disciplined, trained and equipped infantry.
Cavalry at that time was used only to chase and finish off routed enemy.
They did not even have stirrups yet, which made horseman effective on the battle field few centuries later. during the period when Gladiator takes place cavalry could not and would not make a ""decisive charge"".
and finally, in that battle German tribesmen were MUCH more likely to have mounted troops than Romans, which they don't.",1061856000,,883,4.932885906040268
1279328,2,B00003CXE6,"As universially popular as this movie is, I am apparently a closet case. I hated this movie. The saving grace is Joaquin Phoenix. Now although I understand in the world of internet reviewers, my assessment means squat, but I think I need to get this off my chest.
Gladiator is an over-hyped money machine that happened to be released in a down year for Oscar worthy contenders. The huge reason why is because it is nothing more than the merger of Spartacus, Ben-Hur, with some Braveheart sprinkled in for good measure. There is even a scene in which a ""teacher"" paints a would-be gladiator with different colored paints to show the different kill areas of a body while in combat - an alomst exact copy of Spartacus. I don't understand what the appeal is to this movie, except that those other movies have been long since forgotten and this can be viewed as a ""fresh epic.""
Another overrated aspect of this film, aside from the film itself, is Russell Crowe. While I admired his work a year later in A Beautiful Mind, he didn't show me anything Kirk Douglas couldn't do. Oscar voters were floored by his ability to look angry and mumble lines and swing a sword. Tom Hanks, who also was nominated that year for Cast Away, had to lose 70 punds, grow a 2 foot long beard and carry a movie by himself for 75 minutes, but Crowe's ablilty to kill people was one of the greatest acting jobs ever! I'm being sarcastic, by the way. Phoenix, who plays the villian, is the one who wowed me. He appeared to actually loate Crowe, as I'm sure people do when Russell goes to a bar at night and starts beating them up.
I'm not a fan of Spartacus either, but rent that instead of over-rated hype machine of 2001, otherwise known as Gladiator.",1061596800,7,1724,4.476190476190476
1279329,5,B00003CXE6,"My rating indicates my regard for this film in terms of its entertainment value. The plot is essentially uncomplicated and too often predictable. There is almost no character development. And there is only one conflict, really, whose resolution occurs long after the most thrilling action has occurred. However, Russell Crowe's performance as Maximus is (no pun intended) commanding, the special effects are first-rate, and -- from beginning to end -- this film is visually stunning. The plot (such as it is) focuses on Maximus who, soon after his greatest military victory, finds himself enslaved and in training to become a gladiator. (By then we already know that he is a fearless and skillful warrior.) Eventually, circumstances enable him to return to Rome where he hopes to gain revenge on Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) for reasons which should not be revealed in a commentary such as this. Although working with an idea-impoverished screenplay, director Ridley Scott keeps the narrative moving along at a brisk but appropriate pace. Although Crowe dominates the screen (and was later selected to receive an Academy Award as best actor), others in the cast provide strong performances. I was especially impressed by Phoenix, Richard Harris' brief appearance as Marcus Aurelius, Oliver Reed (Proximo), Djimon Hounsou (Juba), Derek Jacobi (Gracchus), and Connie Nielsen as Commodus' sister Lucilla.
For me, three years after seeing Gladiator for the first time, the dominant images are no longer those of the life-or-death competition but rather, of the opening scenes when Maximus leads his troops to victory against the Saxons, later when he returns to his farm, and still later when he and Juba nourish their friendship with exchanges of confidences. How ironic that a film so filled with brilliantly-staged violence should persist in my memory because of images wholly unrelated to that violence. It received an Academy Award as best film as well as for best costume design, sound, and visual effects. I think it is a notch or two above earlier and similar films such as The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) but not quite in the same league with the director's cut version of Spartacus (1960).

When he escapes, he's bought as a slave that fights to the death for sport and entertainment. He builds a big reputation and gets to fight in Rome's Colliseum to get revenge.

1279334,5,B00003CXE6,"Having been brought up in the classics, naturally anything that has to do with ancient Greece or Rome will catch my attention. Whether it holds it for very long or not is another matter; fortunately, Gladiator, for all of its shortcomings, did.
This is a work of fiction, and must be approached as such. I have seen numerous reviews that criticise the film for its lack of authenticity and historicity -- this is perhaps an unfair criticism. It is as unfair as if to say Star Wars is unhistorical, or the events portrayed on Spin City didn't really happen historically -- of course they didn't. This is what fiction is all about. Of course, there will be some grounding in reality (do we really want to divorce fiction completely from reality so that every city becomes Metropolis and every proper name must be changed?). Once I realised that this movie was intended to be a work of fiction, and not a dramatically-charged documentary, I relaxed and had an enjoyable time.
There was an emperor Marcus Aurelius, who was rather effective in a Machiavellian way early in his reign, and later turned to a more philosophical bent; his collected thoughts have been published in many forms, including as part of the great Harvard set of great thinkers. His son Commodus did in fact succeed him, though not after suffocating him on the German frontier, and was an emperor of a fair inferior stamp; he played to the mob, not necessarily more than previous emperors had (and, in fact, Marcus Aurelius had not suspended the games in Rome--no wise ruler would risk such a thing), but rather more than the elite classes of Rome would prefer.
Commodus in fact had (as did many emperors before and after) love affairs with relatives, friends, and strangers. He was ruthless (this much the movie kept true), but not quite as clever at intrigue as even the movie (in which he finally gets his come-uppance) suggests.
The character of Maximus is a complete fiction. An honourable man for whom Semper Fi would be the appropriate appellation; he is charged by his beloved emperor Marcus Aurelius essentially to save the empire and restore the Republic (how odd that he receives assistance from a character played by Derek Jacobi, who played the Republican-minded Claudius in I, Claudius); alas, the end of the film leads one to believe that with the death of Commodus, the Republic will be restored.
The Republic was never restored. The Empire fell, and anarchy took its place. The Dark Ages in the West ensued, and the Eastern Empire became the Byzantine Empire, leading a decadent and slowly-crumbling existence for another thousand years.
But, heroic tales owe nothing to political realities (as most who discern the truth behind modern political campaigning will inform you!) -- this is a tale of honour and the triumph against great odds of virtue.
Russell Crowe does an admirable job as Maximus, the Spaniard general turned slave by betrayal, who finally wins his dignity back in the arena in Rome. Joaquin Phoenix does an interesting job as Commodus, both weak and manipulative while being determined and ruthless. Derek Jacobi turns in his usual good acting job, though perhaps he is the wasted element in this film.
The cinematography is choppy, particularly in the battle sequences; this is, I am sure, meant to convey the disarray and distraction of battle. I am not sure it succeeds. The dream sequences and 'floating' periods are rather strange, with camera trickery more akin to a music video than an epic film. There are some very well done pieces, though, including the use of colouration to show vibrancy or gloom on the well-done modeling of Rome and the Colloseum.
The battle sequences that open the film are well done and realistic with regard to tactics and conditions of the Roman fight against the Germanic tribes. Unlike movies like Spartacus, which highlight some of the marching tactics, or Cleopatra, which shows use of the turtle formation, but do so in relative isolation from surrounding conditions, in Gladiator we get both a sense of the discipline and tactics of the Roman army as well as the difficult conditions under which they were fighting. As one Marine commentator told me, the Romans were often outnumbered by the ferocious Germans, but the discipline and battle tactics of the Romans usually won out because there was unit cohesion and command structure that looked at the larger battle as a whole; whereas the Germans at this period were independent, individual warriors who each, while brave and fierce, saw himself as a leader, and thus did not work together. The Celts often had the same problem.
Of course, on the other hand, there were bits of reality that were omitted from the film -- gladiators did indeed become superstars in Rome, more popular than the rulers (of course, that situation happens in modern times, too, where athletes and film stars are often far more popular than political leaders). Gladiators went so far as to endorse products and do much that modern celebrities do, but this was considered 'over the top', and left out of the screenplay.
Some judicious editing might make this a great film; as it is, it is a very good film, one that sets a new standard in what was considered a dead (or at least comatose) film genre.",1058745600,2,5270,4.8566666666666665

This genre of film has had some real tragedies and this film showed what could happen in the hands of a true craftsman like Scott.
The extras are true blessing especially when it comes to the deleted scenes. In the commentary running with them Scott says they were all sacrificed for time and that is a shame as they were really fantastic even if they did end up on the cutting room floor. They added so much development to the characters especially that of Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix.

1279336,4,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is a richly textured, well-written, and most of all truly spectacular film, I realy liked it. There is a lot of action and suspense.
But it's a bit too violent.
The actors act very well particularly Russell Crowe.
The characters are very attaching so you feel often sad.
Crowe's performance is so good really because of his charisma, the way he looks and speaks. His powerful screen presence enables him to capture the audience's attention, and Maximus is really a character you can root for.
Joaquin Phoenix is convincing and intelligent as Commodus, having an authoritative, commanding presence.
The fact that Commodus has done and tried to do such sick and evil things makes you really hate him.
Roger Ebert said that a quirkier actor might have been more fun in the role.
But if there was, you probably wouldn't be able to hate Commodus as much.
The old pros Jacobi, Reed, and Harris are all great, but Reed stands out in the trio, giving a splendid performance and since he appears in the film longer, his character is fleshed out more. Nielsen is fine as Commodus' sister Lucilla.

He employs an extraordinary cast, which include Russel Crowe who won an Academy Award for his portrayal as the fallen general Maximus.  Not to mention Joaquoin Phoenix is creepy and sullen as the coniving Commadus and the late Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are wonderfully animated in their respective roles as Proximo and Marcus Aruelius.  And Connie Nielson is effective as Commadus' sister, who is terrified of mourning her slain father for her fear of her unstable brother.

The visuals are not limited to computers though.  The costume and set designs are exquisitely detailed, down to the last thread of silk on Connie Nielsons' gowns.

Now, everyone is entitled to their own opinion (with the internet you can just about read everyone's anyway) but I see ""Gladiator"" as a triumph as a modern-day epic.  It brims with equal parts visual splendor and genuine emotion, carried by restrained but stylistic direction and wondrous acting.  It succeeds at being both a feast for the eyes and as grand storytelling.

If you thought the archers' scene in ""Robin Hood Prince of Theives"" was a good one, you'll love how this movie opens up although it's a couple of shades darker.  From there it gets interesting on a drama level, although the action only subsides for a few minutes.
The heart of this movie is the jouney of a man named Maximus - a Roman General betrayed by a young (and quite mad) emperor and captured as a slave after being wounded.  As a slave he is forced to fight for his survival in the games.  As he did in his previous life, Maximus becomes a leader.  As a leader, but still a slave, Maximus now threatens the emperor who as time wears on threatens to destroy Rome from the inside with is growing madness.
The acting performances are absolutely superb, as is the story.  I had never seen Joaquin Phoenix before in anything, but his asking price should have doubled or better after this film.  Although Russell Crowe's performance is also exemplory, it was Joaquin playing the part of a man on the edge that had me glued to the screen, but I'm partial to really bad guys when they're played well and the screenwriters did an excellent job of making Commodus a man to be feared by interplaying what you see coming with what you don't.  Richard Harris' brief role is also a memorable performance.
The cinematagraphy is splendid as is Hans Zimmer's musical score.

As the son, Commodus, kills his father, Maximus is threatened by death as he refuses to follow him. He is captured and becomes a gladiator, with only one purpose - revenge.
If anything, Gladiator is a clever fable against democracy and the masses, who are represented by the throngs of Rome who seek ""bread and games"". They can be made to cheer for the death of thousands and thousands - like people today cheer at movies depicting the War on Drugs, and foreign wars. They can be pacified by bread and games, while corrupt individuals manipulate the power around them to gain material riches, and the Republic (the rule of law, the US Constitution) is crumbling.

It is definitely one of my top ten favorite films, because of its excellent character development, excellent storyline, and excellent portrayal of the time period and of the life gladiators lived.
Gladiator is the story of a Roman general who, in the beginning of the film, is leading his army of soldiers against a stronghold. It is the last stronghold they must take over before they achieve total victory in the war. Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is the Roman general survives the battle, leading his forces to victory. The emperor, Marcus Aurelius, who presides over the battle commends Maximus for his abilities as a general. A little later on he chooses Maximus to succeed him as emperor instead of his son (Joaquin Phoenix). When he learns that his father has chosen Maximus instead of him to succeed as emperor, he kills his father, then tells the people he died of natural causes. When Maximus refuses to acknowledge him as emperor, he orders Maximus to be killed. Maximus narrowly escapes from the executioners with his life and makes his way to his homeland, where he finds that his wife and small son have been murdered by the new emperor's agents.
He is then captured by citizens of Zucchabar and taken to Zucchabar to be sold as a slave he, along with several other slaves, is purchased and forced to live the life of an arena gladiator.
The rest of the movie portrays Maximus the gladiator struggling to stay alive as he battles professional fighters, barbarian hordes, and tigers, determined to win his freedom. The film's climax comes when Maximus battles against the emperor himself . . .
Gladiator is a film which should not be missed by anyone. The excellent character development, plot construction, and choreography makes it one of the best films ever made (in my opinion). 5 stars",1052524800,,1895,4.851851851851852

Crowe's performance is dull and destitute, and quite frankly, makes the whole project destitute with his dull and empty presence. He's like paper-mache up there. Yeah, I know Maximus' world takes a tragic turn for the worst, but COME ON! He's a paper-cut-out for the entire movie! Very annoying. What's worse is he actually got an Oscar for it. Yikes! Who knew wooden acting was awarded so shamelessly?
Yeah, I liked the hyper, ultra-violent action scenes. The movie had the potential to be a great action film. Thus the reason it gets 2 stars. Well, not the only reason... this abysmal failure of a movie has somewhat of another saving grace. Yep, Joaquin Phoenix's abrasive performance as the villain, Commodus. He's too good for this tedious mess. It's just too bad his brilliance can't correct the errors that litter the rest of this tedious insult.
In the end, Gladiator is completely void of any intelligence, originality, and soul. People bawled at the end. I didn't. How could I? I didn't feel for Maximus. He was a dry, sour and ridiculous character. He's extremely hollow. So is the script! I can't understand why so many people commend this...So many awards for such a weak little meaningless, forgettable movie.
So, in summation, this inferior pile of wretchedness is literally clubbed to death with more cliches than you can shake a stick at. And to tell you the truth, I laughed at the end. It's THAT [weak]. A movie that struggles for 2 hours to build up this intense level of emotion and drama, and failing so miserably. Makes me chuckle.

It's good and Ridley Scott does a great job at directing this big film because that is what it is! The film spans all the way to a war with barbarians and other opponents in the beginning to the war within Rome's own human civilization. Anyways Maximus is a true warrior in the film and I love the old fashion tactics they used when fighting against the herd of monsters from within the colesium.

1279556,4,B00003CXE6,"This is a modern take on the Gladiator movie.  A Roman general, Maximus, has loyally served on the German front.  When a new and jealous Caesar, Commodus, ascends the throne, he orders Maximus and his family killed.  Maximus excapes and ends up in a provincial arena as a gladiator slave.  When Commodus decides to have a season of games in the Colliseum, Maximus's troupe travels to Rome and he searches for a way to avenge his family's death.
This is a typical story in terms of epic filmaking, and this film is most definitely an epic.  From the Private Ryan-esque battle at the German front (featuring 1000 extras, flaming arrows, and mud!) to the CGI-generated recreation of the Colliseum, it's a treat to watch and soak in the atmosphere.  The performances are uniformly good - Crowe was probably better in the Insider, but won his Oscar here as Maximus.  It's a good thing Crowe can sustain interest, as he's onscreen something like 85% of the time!  The supporting performances are also good.
This is a typical Ridley Scott film.  He almost blows it with a couple of (as it turns out) non-fatal errors.  The first is that the entire film (155 minutes!) is on the same level of intensity.  Any mood for 2.5 hours is tough to take, but the oppressive sombreness of Gladiator is particularly dangerous.  However, the gladitorial spectacles are sufficiently diverse to break it up.  More annoying is the uniform drabness of the film.  The colours are completely washed out greys and browns.  This was done to match up the CGI (not quite up to the challenge in 1999), but the overall look is dull!  Oddly, parts of the soundtrack then clash with the visuals because the music is too bright.  The CGI is generally non-obtrusive (except when showing large crowds), so I can forgive this problem as well.
The DVD extras are quite nice, especially the hour-long documentary on gladitorial games.  It's no surprise that the ""real"" characters in the film, such as Commodus, are not accurately portrayed, but does lend credence to the general accuracy of the situations - they may not have happened as filmed, but COULD have.  There are cut scenes, the commentary by Scott and others is interesting, so the DVD is well worth getting.",1045612800,,2229,4.772845953002611
1279557,4,B00003CXE6,"Personally I liked that film - especially the soundtrack. A film is of course not a history lesson. Still I don't see the harm if the producers had cared to stay closer to the circumstantial facts. Armory and clothing came close enough, except for crossbows, the Alsacean breed of the dog  and the cell phone an extra had dropped in the second part. Especially Lucilla's haute couture came straight from wall paintings in Pompeii.
It looks good on the screen to see the Roman infantry trot up to their enemies in close formation and take cover behind their shields when the barbarians fired a volley of arrows. However that's not how it was done in those days. The Roman legioner was not a Greek hoplite who held formation with shields locked. The Roman infantry man had three paces of open space to his neighbors left and right, giving room for his moves. The second rank spread accordingly covering the gaps behind the first rank etc.
So instead of losing momentum and stop to receive the arrows and take the full shock of the opponent's onrush the Roman legion would pick up the pace, discharge their ""pilum"" - the spear or javelin- and go straight for the kill. A legioner coming at you would do exactly the same move, Shaka used to teach his Zulu warriors 1,500 years later: a sweeping move with the shield would deflect the opponents defense and the sword or assagai would go straight for the kill in one decisive stab into the undefended side.
Both, Shaka and the Romans kept the blade deliberately short, so that the fighter had to go on close quarter - which actually is an advantage because it leaves the opponent fewer options for fancy moves. Perhaps Hollywood is thinking that this industrial killing technique doesn't make good film-copy? In Shaka Zulu's case it was still effective enough to annihilate a complete British brigade fully equipped with Springfield rifles and field artillery.
The main thing of course are the gladiatorial combat scenes. In the film it is very simple: every gladiator is a slave (or convicted criminal), every encounter a fight to the death. Not so in ancient Rome: many gladiators were actually free born people from all walks of life - in one instance even an emperor - who had chosen the arena as a career. But like the professional boxers in modern times, or the Japanese sumo wrestlers, a fully trained gladiator was obliged to enlist in the stable of a licensed impresario.
Not every fight was a mortal combat. In fact far less than 30% of all combats ended with a kill. Gladiators fought for money, even slaves received a purse. (Slavery in antiquity didn't mean loss of wages: an enslaved mason received the same minimum wages as his free colleague, the difference being that the slave's owner took out his cut.) There were contract rates for different kinds of performance; comparably low for feigned combats to show off the combatants skills in good clean entertainment at, say, weddings and funerals. Only an extremely rich patron could actually afford to pay the rates for mortal encounters.
Historians also like to quibble at Proximo's accusation that Marcus Aurelius had shut down the arenas, apparently for humanitarian reasons. The truth here is that Marcus Aurelius, a civilian to boot, was forced to fend off an invasion from Persia. His generals performed brilliantly and even invaded Iraqi territory. But among the trophies they also brought back the small pox. The epidemic ravaged the Empire for a whole 15 years and reduced the army to a mere skeleton force, of which every hostile tribe from across the border took due notice. So the civilian Marcus Aurelius suddenly found himself confronted with the task to rebuild the army practically from scratch and to wage war on the intruders. He partly accomplished this by drafting all the gladiators, whether free or slave, from all over the empire. So the arenas closed for lack of fighters. So far I see no reason why the film could not have reflected these facts more faithfully.
That the emperor was assassinated is Hollywood's favorite myth. There is no evidence for a plot on his life. As a matter of fact - but this would of course spoil the story - Commodus was already co-emperor for six years before Marcus Aurelius died in the camp of exhaustion and disease. This was the whole idea: one Caesar at home and one in the field, so that the surviver would guarantee continuity. Commodus continued to reign without causing complaints for another six years, and only changed to the worse after a failed plot on his life. From then on his eccentricities ruined his reputation and he died in 192 from a mysterious ""accident"" in the gym.",1045440000,2,4653,4.787313432835821

I think it brings to life the time period better than any other film of its type. It is a great popcorn munching piece of eye-candy. But as an historian I really cringed with one of the premises of the movie. I also know that there are some people whose only information regarding historical events comes from watching Hollywood movies. That is not a good thing. Historical accuracy is not one of Hollywood's best attributes.
At the end of the film they would have you believe that the Empire was abolished and the Republic was restored. (Anti-monarchial sentiments?) But in reality that was not the case. The two emperors are historical figures who actually lived in real life. Emperor Marcus Aurelius ruled Rome from 161AD until 180AD, while his son, Commodus, excellently played by Joachin Pheonix, ruled from 180AD until his murder in 192AD. But hopefully most people are aware that there was not a restoration of the Roman Senate after the death of the emperor Commodus. The Empire in the West survived for another 284 years, while the Eastern, or Byzantine, Empire survived until 1453 when emperor Constantine XI was deposed by the Turks.
I think films such as this are good for capturing a way of life that can be hard for people to conceptualize, and they can also be an excellent impetus for investigating further into historical information.",1044662400,,1451,4.831325301204819

And I think by far the best performance was that of Joaquin Phoenix (Emperor Commodus), who not only looked like an overfeed ceasar, but convincinly played a madman obbsessed with winning the affection of both the populace and his sister and yet tormented by rage and jeleousy.

It is played when he is praying, but it also comes about when the group wins its first fight in Rome during the ""Battle of Carthage"" at a much higher tempo.  Those that criticize the ending as being sad, I ask this question (warning, spoiler here) Why is is a sad ending?  Maximus got to be with his family at the end of the movie, which was his goal at the beginning, he got what he wanted.  There was an afterlife, therefore, there is no reason to be sad about it.

1279651,5,B00003CXE6,"""Gladiator"" is a film about one man's fight to rekindle the flame of a great idea on the verge of being completely extinguished.
The great idea was Rome - one of Man's supreme efforts to realize the Ideal which mankind has ever striven to attain.
But this ideal is lost under the rubble of political corruption, injustice and immorality.
A man of courage and honor - General Maximus makes a promise to a dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius that he shall salvage this great idea before it is lost forever, lost irrevocably to mankind.
But before anything can be done, Maximus becomes a terrible victim of the socio-political system by which he has hitherto remained untouched, and at whose summit we behold a moral monster - Commodus - the son of Marcus Aurelius.
From the position of a renowned military leader, this system pulls him down to its dregs - Maximus becomes a slave and a gladiator.
Can a mere gladiator - who faces the prospect of a violent death every moment of his life - rise against the mighty Roman power and rescue mankind's greatest and grandest dream from remaining a dream forever?
This is what ""Gladiator"", a magnificent, dramatic and compelling epic is all about.
""Gladiator"" is unabashedly concerned with the projection of a positive hero whose stature remains undiluted to the very end.
The performance by every character in the film, particularly Russell Crowe, is wonderful.
A film replete with thrilling action, blood and gore, violence and suspense, ""Gladiator"" is not just an action-for-the-sake-of-action film.
It has profoundly and undeniably important philosophical-metaphysical implications.
This combination of a historic perspective with a definite political viewpoint; a metaphysical dimension with a grand sense of life; a truthful presentation of the eternal laws of human existence with the projection of moral values - integrated to a nail-biting,terrific and terrifying story - this superb combination makes ""Gladiator"" one of the best films of the recent times.",1040342400,,2000,5.175925925925926

1279725,2,B00003CXE6,"The film shows Imperial Rome winning a battle in the Black Forest. But wasn't that one of the few battle Rome lost? Rome's economy was based on slavery; they had to continually conquer new lands to replenish the cheap labor needed for their plantations, owned by the rich and politically connected ruling class. Sort of like today's corporations, except now the conquest of foreign lands means there is no need to import cheap labor; they send the factories there.
After the battle we see some high level intrigue among the leaders. The speech of a tired old Caesar (""End the corruption, Restore the Republic"") suggests the leader is senile. Handing power to a popular military leader is the antithesis of a republic! And so the stage is set for personal conflict, a simplified way to explain economic and political conflict.
The General rejects the new Emperor's hand, and is rejected in turn. He escapes execution, his family does not. Somehow he winds up in North Africa (?) without crossing the sea. (Does his travails remind you of 'Yojimbo'?) Then the gladiator scenes follow - to remind you of professional sports? He is told that popularity makes the star, not statistics!
The special effects recreate ancient cities, but the lack of movement in the backgrounds tell. Do some of the scenes remind you of 'Star Wars""? Or some of those costume imports from forty-plus years ago? Like many other films, the action picks up when the story line lags. Do rulers still use circuses to entertain and distract the masses from their problems? Only in other countries.
Caesar and Maximus both expire, but they don't say what their replacements do. This seems like the sickest movie since 'Silence of the Lambs', and appears to have done as well at the box office. Does this movie have any redeeming social values?",1036540800,4,1810,4.86084142394822
1279726,1,B00003CXE6,"I watched Gladiator on TV last night - what a piece of ... Oscars all around for this garbage? [I] always knew the Oscars were BS, but now I really know it for sure! Was Ridley Scott sleepwalking when he did this? I know he's inconsistent (see Bladerunner for one of his great films) but this verges on Paul McCartneyesque erosion of talent. This is from the same year ""Traffic"" was released - not a perfect film but surely more Oscar-worthy than this waste of celluloid (and waste of my time). I will grant that this type of ""epic drama"" is best suited for the big screen, not chopped up for television, but ... is ... whether it's 20 feet tall or the size of my TV.
This movie is glaringly dumbed down - it relentlessly plays to the lowest common denominator, whether in its annoying and intrusive musical score (the placement and use of the music more than the music itself) or it's laughable ""faux Shakespearean"" dialogue ... what, the Romans spoke fake Elizabethan English? Bad fake Elizabethan English? I realize there's precedent for this type of speech in historical dramas, but it frequently doesn't work and it's certainly misplaced here. The special effects, scenery, etc. look good but, as with the recent Star Wars movies, the window dressing doesn't really matter...Forget Gladiator.

Edit: I was looking through my profile today, and skimmed through some of my past reviews.  It needs to be said that this one was fairly heavily censored, making it appear to have been far more obscenity laced than it really was in its original version (for example a word meaning ""excrement"" beginning with C and ending with P was removed, among others of similar nature).

More importantly, a lot of the content was removed, and several phrases substituted for my actual words.  For instance, I never wrote ""Forget Gladiator"" (Nor ""F.. Gladiator in any form). The review was more coherent and read a LOT better before it was bowdlerized.  Having said that, I'll still stand by the bit of it which did make it through.  The bad fake old English accents were particularly jarring in the film, in addition to the stilted performances.  I like action and period films if they're well done.

On peculiar thing I noticed was: in one of the battle scences, the score sounded a little too much like Mars, the bringer of war; from Gustav Holst's ""The Planets."" Of course, that is just something that a music buff would notice, and anyway, it didn't take away from the movie, the composer was probably just learning a lesson from the master.

Everything battle-wise looks old-hat after Kenneth Branaugh's HENRY V and Gibson's BRAVEHEART. GLADIATOR is an enjoyable film with great acting (of course) by Crowe, who carries the film with his singularly massive screen presence.  The supporting cast is good, but on occasion, unremarkable.  I have seen the film three times and remember little about most of the characters.  The locations are great and the script is good if forgettable.  This probably should NOT have won best picture, but you already knew that.  Even so, it remains one of the better films of the year.
The DVD is packed and gets a five star rating. I don't know what else could have been added to it. The picture and sound quality are great though not to reference standards.

2-DISC COLLECTOR'S EDITION DVD
THE MOVIE: Frankly you've never seen anything quite like GLADIATOR before. It's a great comeback for the swords 'n sandals epic genre and it mixes in love, drama, brilliant action and a few chills. The movie remains interesting throughout and is very stylishly done. The movie is also lovely in wide screen format. There are a couple of plausibility flaws but with such a big scale you can excuse them. Deserved winner of 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
THE SPECIAL FEATURES: Packed with stuff. On one disc there is the movie in wide screen format and on the second you've got all the special features. The Making of featurettes are a thoroughly entertaining treat and they answer all your ""how did they do that?"" questions. HBO's The Bloodsport of a Gladiator will interest those who are interested in gladiators and old times, personally for me I felt it was boring. From the Cutting Room Floor gives us 25 minutes of deleted scenes which are a delight. You can have them with or without Ridley Scott's commentary. If I were to change this I would've had Ridley Scott giving the commentary before the deleted scene and then showing it. He talks over what's happening and it's quite annoying because if you want to see the commentary you have to go back and forth if you also want to watch the scene. There's also a treasure chest with 7 minutes of unused footage put into a montage. Cool. There's also interviews with Hans Zimmer about scoring Gladiator, which show his compassion for his work and it's interesting to see. Spencer Treat Clark's production diary I couldn't be bothered reading entirely but in places it was pretty good. There are also a whole heap of photos, theatrical trailers and storyboards, plus cast and crew biographies. If only all of this were as entertaining as the movie it would've been a 5-star DVD. But I am unfortunately going to grade GLADIATOR down 1 star because a few of the features are very dull. Plus in some of the scenes the picture quality is BAD! But the sound effects and some very good special features make this worthy of your cash.",1035158400,,2130,4.728494623655914
1279814,4,B00003CXE6,"The other reviews on this site list all of the admirable qualities of Gladiator. However, there is something that needs to be adressed. It's a good movie, but it has one flaw: its deadpan seriousness.
Gladiator pays homage to Spartacus, Ben-Hur: epics of Ancient Rome. However, it ignores that the other films aren't all serious. The tone of the other films has some lighthearted parts. However, this film just won't let up on the gloom.
I can apreicate that Maximus (Crowe) has lost everything he had, and so isn't inclined to be happy. But director Ridley Scott seems to think that this means the entire film should be sad. Humor and drama, as a rule, help each other thrive.
There are, to be fair, some lighter notes: two times the viewer chuckles. However, two is hardly enough: Hamlet, a dark play by any standards, has some great laughs of all stripes.
Gladiator is a good movie; it has a properly epic feel at times, and is quite stirring at times. But the overly depressing feel that covers the film keeps it from acheiving greatness.",1035072000,2,1042,4.668478260869565

The award-winning actor Russell Crowe plays the leading role in this movie as Maximus, a Roman general turned gladiator.  With a 2 hour and 35 minute run time, this movie does not leave you wanting for adventure.
  Maximus wants nothing more from life than to return to his family and take up farming again.  A friend to the people of Rome, as well as the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, he is unable to return to the life he had previously led and due to his fame, and the jealousy of that fame, the antagonist Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix) attempts to have him and his family killed.  It is after the murder of his wife and son that Maximus vows to get his revenge. It is also at this point that the action intensifies making the movie the Award Winning picture that it became.

The plot of ""Gladiator"" centers around Maximus (Russell Crowe), a decorated Roman general who wants only to go home, but the Emperor (Richard Harris) names Maximus his successor.  His immoral son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) gets jealous, kills his own father, and orders Maximus executed.  However, the good general escapes, only to be captured by slave traders and bred as a gladiator--a killing machine with a single purpose: to entertain the crowds of the Colosseum.
""Gladiator"" is blessed with fine acting, photography, sets, and costumes--not to mention the bold score by the always fabulous Hans Zimmer.  Director Ridley Scott knows how to entertain, as he keeps the action scenes exciting but not too gory.  Even the slower parts are showered with tension, a true sign of a great drama.

In essence, that is all we as consumers of entertainment demand when we open a book or watch a movie.  Yes, we may have our reservations (e.g., ""I don't like the actor""...""This is not historically accurate""...""This plot has been presented thousands of times before""...), but in the end, ultimately, the triumphant success--or lack thereof--of any work is wholly dependent on its ability to tell a gripping, compelling story.
Ridley Scott gives us a story in GLADIATOR.  From the opening scenes in barbaric Germania, to the bowels of dusty dungeons in distant lands, to the eye-opening magnificence of the Roman Coliseum, to the wondrous luxury of the palace of Emperor Commodus, GLADIATOR tells a moving, thrilling, harrowing story of heroism and revenge.  At the end of this film, when an avenged Maximus is finally able to join his murdered wife and son in the afterlife, I as a viewer experienced completion...the story had been told.
Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris and company give exceptional performances.  GLADIATOR is an epic.  An epic story.",1032825600,3,1112,5.155555555555556

On the other hand, it can be very personal and intimate at times...witness the very first scene, where we see Maximus daydream of being home, running his hand through his farmland.  Or the various scenes where we see him wrestle with his desire to avenge the death of his wife and son while attempting to rid Rome of the vile Commodus.  This is a film that is absolutely riveting from beginning to end; it is impossible to overstate the impact that Hans Zimmer's score has on the action...and the heart-wrenching emotion from Lisa Gerrard's voice harkens back to Titanic.

Heck, Russell Crowe's double-punch smackdown on Joaquin Phoenix alone is worth the price of this DVD.
Obviously, any gladiator-movie worth its salt has to have plenty of combat, and Ridley Scott's film is no disappointment. The pace of the film slows down periodically -- but every twenty minutes or so, a massive fight scene breathes new life (and death) into the picture.

1279821,2,B00003CXE6,"I can't say that I hated this movie.  It just didn't particularly engage me.  It is a movie that can't decide what it wants to be...is it your typical summer action flick, with lots of blood and gore and special effects, or is it a political thriller, full of scheming, machinations, treachery and betrayal?  This movie tries to have it both ways, without success, the result being that it is supremely boring much of the time.
It is pretty obvious early on, after a nice big battle scene to open things up, that we have a tried-and-true story of revenge underway.  The unbelievably heroic Maximus is betrayed and his family slaughtered by the evil emperor, blah blah blah...it is obvious that a showdown is brewing.
So why don't we get to the showdown already?  Instead, we get blah blah blah...Marcus Aurelius blathers a bunch of gobbledy-gook and nonsense to Maximus about restoring the Republic (oh sure!)...blah blah blah...we find out that Commodus is evil and corrupt, but all he really ever wanted was his father's love and approval, blah blah blah...the emperor's sister has had the hots for Maximus all of this time, blah blah blah...the senators are frustrated with the emperor's indifference to administrative affairs, blah blah blah....oh god just make it stop.  None of this blah blah blah-ing is of any real substance, so you just sit through it, waiting for the next gory fight scene.
I enjoy movies that have plenty of dialogue, and some of my favorite movies have not a whit of violence in them.  But the massive amounts of dialogue in this movie do nothing to propel the plot forward.  It only bogs the movie down.  Trying to make the characters multi-dimensional in what is, in essence, a live-action comic book, in fact makes the characters only look all that much more ridiculous.  Don't try to make Commodus look ""sympathetic"" by portraying the conflicted nature of his relationship with his daddy...who cares?!?  He is merely a plot device, like so many Shakespearian villains.  He does not need to have his motives explained.  So don't explain them, again and again.
Even the fight scenes left something to be desired.  Why not just stick a bunch of cardboard figures in the stand and a stuffed tiger in the arena?  The technology certainly exists for making better special effects than this, for crying out loud.
When my wife brought the video home a second time I popped it in and started to watch it.  Without realizing it at first, I fast-forwarded through one combat scene to the next.  Ultimately, I realized that this is truly the proper way to watch this movie.  It should take you only about 35 minutes this way.  How efficient!
Never mind the appalling liberties that the movie took with historical fact; I think we all have come to realize that no movie is going to be particularly faithful to the historical record, especially where Rome is concerned.  With movies like this, the viewer is not looking for a history lesson (I hope), but it would be nice to have some decent pacing so that we don't die of boredom between the fight scenes.",1030406400,4,3075,4.75517890772128

1279947,5,B00003CXE6,"A wonderfully intriguing and complex story.  I agree with those who didn't see all there was to see the first time through.  Indeed, it was after the third or fourth time through that I realized movie wasn't really about arena combat at all - The bloodthirsty gladiatorial combat is simply the backdrop against which are played the two major themes: saving Rome in accordance with the wishes of the dead Emperor Marcus Aurelius as well as saving to from the despotic clutches of his biological son, Commodus; and the second theme that develops as the now slave Maximus wants disparately to join his murdered wife and son in the hereafter.
Crowe (Maximus) and Phoenix (Commodus) are set against each other and you get wound into the battle between good and evil, honor and betrayal, loyalty to an ideal and Commodus' despotic avarice born of jealousy and huge insecurities.  Often overlooked in the critiques, but also very good is Connie Neilsen, the multi-lingual actress from Denmark who plays the part of Commodus' sister Lucilla.  Her apparently long-dormant and now reborn affections for Maximus sets off Commodus, who vainly pursues an incestuous tryst with her throughout much of the movie.
Rebuffed at almost every turn and correctly fearing that Lucilla has plotted against him, Commodus eventually dares to enter the arena to fight Maximus...  A bit far fetched; however, according to the historians, the real Commodus would from time to time show his ""bravery"" by going down on the floor of the area to personally administer the final blow to an otherwise incapacitated gladiator - the real Commodus was apparently every bit the coward of the movie version.
Great movie -  Crowe, Phoenix and Neilsen give wonderful performances in this larger than life epic.  Destined to be played again and again at my house.  The sound track alone is worth the price.",1027468800,,1864,4.990322580645161

This movie, although extremely violent, has an awesome story that is very inspiring. It's about someone who does things for the right reason. It's interesting how throughout the whole movie our Gladiator is really a person who would rather not kill, but does so because he has to.

Russell Crowe stars as the victorious Roman general even Marcus Aurelius wants to succeed him as ruler of Rome. But Marcus A. makes the really stupid mistake of telling his biological son his plans in private, so guess what happens to him? Suffice it to say that the son quickly becomes the new emperor. The general survives a death plot only to find himself enslaved and sold to a gladiator trainer played by Oliver Reed.  When we hear that the new emperor is terribly fond of Coloseum games, we can put two and two together to figure out the rest of the plot.
Bad Things?  The cutting was so confusing, I didn't know what was happening! Major problem. Another problem was the so-called acting of Russell Crowe. This is best actor? More like walk-thru acting to me. He was far better in ""A Beautiful Mind"".
Best Thing? Joaquin Phoenix as the villainous young emperor. He really stands out in the picture. Seems to me he's been studying his Laurence Olivier tapes, especially ""Spartacus"" and ""Wuthering Heights"".
The most obvious predecessor to this movie is Kirk Douglas' ""Spartacus"". There, a gladiator army takes on the legions of Rome with some success before their tragic downfall. Even has a gladiator school, though Peter Ustinov's is a more interesting place.  Other familiar scenes of gladiators who won't follow ""thumb"" in the arena, allowing their vanquished foes to live also derive from ""Spartacus"". I further contend that the makers of this movie were ripping off--now don't laugh at me--the Kevin Sorbo ""Hercules"" TV movies. Look at the one where Hercules has to journey to the underworld and his wife gets killed. You'll find it strangely reminiscent of a lot of this movie, especially the music and Elysium depictions of his wife in the afterlife. But frankly, ""Hercules"" is more entertaining than ""Gladiator"", and of course so is ""Spartacus"".

Ridley Scott has created a vision that is in my own humble opinion, the best look into the such a great era. His research and details have indeed given us a feel of what it is to be living in that time. He makes us forget the world we live in for awhile and transports us into his world of gladiators and violence.
Russell Crowe is the topping on this creamy pie - the one that binds it all together. He has created such a believable character that you wanted to cry - cheer and feel anger with.

The problem is the hero. As a general he hacks and slices barbarians. Through misfortune he is made a slave and he hacks and slices through gladiatorial games. There is no reason to like the guy and the idea that he wants to join his family in the after life doesn't hold much water.
What is worse is the fact that is glorifies ancient Rome. You get the sense that film makers believe that the Roman Empire was a noble enterprise. Never do you get the sense that, like in Unforgiven, that the killing is needless or that the hero is in fact as bad as the people he's killing. I wasn't enjoying the film because I was never convinced that the heroes task was either justified or compelling.

1280053,4,B00003CXE6,"By the time I'm writing this review, this movie is already two years old.  However, I feel that the DVD creates such a strong presence for a film with excellent technical values that it can't go unrecognized.
Odds are you've already seen this movie (or you already know what it's about), so I'll skip that part.  The story of how aa man loses power and then fights for revenge, while inadvertently gaining popularity, is a cliched story that reminds me of the E! True Hollywood Story on Hulk Hogan.  However, the film features powerful performances all around (especially from scene-stealing Phoenix) and a Rocky-esque script that will have you interested for the most part.  But the real cool thing about this movie is the action.  It's expertly directed (thanks to Ridley Scott) and is everything that action should be: action-packed.  The many action scenes contain graphic violence and copious blood-shedding, which adds to the film's off-the-charts entertainment factor.  (It's an action movie after all.  Have a sense of humor!)
The film's Oscar-winning sound and visual effects are done justice in a big way.  The picture quality is excellent and provides a very film-like experience.  Colors are deep and well-saturated, but never bleed.  Blood spews across the screen and creates a very convincing experience.  Modest edge enhancement can't be ignored (at least not by me), but all in all, this is a near-reference quality disc with only one minor quibble from me.  Watch this film on the biggest, widest TV you can find.  The film's theatrical aspect ratio of 2:35.1 is preserved and is presented anamorphically.
Now here's where it gets REALLY good: the sound.  Lord in Heaven, this has to be one of the greatest soundtracks ever burned onto a DVD.  Presented in DTS-ES and Dolby Digital EX, this is THE demo disc.  Surrounds used all the time (even in quiet scenes) and the ambient effects are exceptional.  During the battle scenes, swords clash, chariots turn over, flesh is pierced, and a bunch of white guys scream.  It's an audiophile's wet dream and shouldn't be missed.  The bottom end is extremely powerful and will give your subwoofer a good run.  Damn, this is a good mix.  The DTS is better due to more controlled bass, but both give you a big bang for your buck.  There is also a Dolby Surround 2.0 track.",1025395200,,2329,4.870229007633588

1280058,3,B00003CXE6,"Over the years, it seems that Hollywood has forgotten how to make great Roman era epics. Watching Ridley Scott's award-winning ""Gladiator"", it was obvious to me that they still can't remember.
""Gladiator"" follows the story of Maximus Decimus Meridus (Russel Crowe), the emperor's new favorite to become his heir. The emperor's son, Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), is enraged. He kills his father and exiles Maximus, who escapes to find that both his wife and son have been killed. He is found by slave traders, who sell him to gladiator trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed, who died during production*). As he competes in matches in the Colosseum, Maximus's life soon becomes a quest for vengance.
This is a brainless action movie posing as a thoughtful one. The fight scenes, when they occur, can either be exhilirating or an incredible bore. The opening sequence in Germania is yawn-inducing, while some of the Colosseum fights, one involving tigers, are quite something (albeit very similar to WWF matches).
It is very hard to accept this as a popcorn flick. There's too much campy drama, brought about by a monotonous script. Apparently the writers forgot how to use a thesaurus; the words ""Rome"", ""glory"", ""vengance"" and ""kill"" (seemingly) serve as the complete vocabulary for all of Rome. The characters are incredibly flat. Smiles, good humor and anything else that would have lifted the spirits of these dreary characters are nearly nonexistent.
The film's visuals are depressingly ugly, with a very limited color pallette. The audience is treated to brown, orange and tan for two and a half hours- the whole thing might have just as well filmed in sepia color tones. The special effects are bland, colorless, and lack detail. People will no doubt be impressed with the digital work to restore the Colosseum, but this feat pales in comparison to other films which have a much richer quality to their visuals- ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"", for example.
The acting is mediocre. Russel Crowe gives a stable performance, but it does not consist of much more than yelling, grunting and stabbing. Joaquin Pheonix whimpers all the way through his performance, which gets very tiresome and comes off as pathetic. The only real balance comes from Connie Nielsen, who plays Commodus's well-meaning sister. She does well in an otherwise dull ensemble.
There is no way ""Gladiator"" could have been a great film on the level of ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben Hur"". However it could have been a fun popcorn movie, had it stuck to being just that. But in the end, poor decisions in art direction, casting, and a deplorable screenplay turn this summer blockbuster into a wannabe of epic proportions.

1280138,5,B00003CXE6,"After the critical and commercial dissapiontments of White Squall (1996) and Gi Jane (1996), Ridley Scott returns to form with Gladiator! Starring Russel Crowe, the film is centered around the famous Roman legionaire Maximus, who is betrayed by the emporer's son Commudus (Joaquin Pheonix) and is sold to become a competetor in the roman arena. Russel Crowe's commanding performance as Maximus is gritty and brilliant, and it's easy to see why Crowe won the best actor Oscar for the role.
Scott's visioanry trademark seen in films like Alien and Blade Runner is excellent, with huge CG re-creations of ancient Rome. Working with such an enormous scale and with such a big palet to use, Scott's unique talent for vivid and brutal storytelling is to the fore.
The collosal action set-pieces in the roman arena are breath-taking, and with top-notch stunt work and sharp visuals, the backgrounds, vistas and entire battlegrounds are done to masterful effect. Hans Zimmer's score for the film is a real romping, 'wake the neighbours up' soundtrack that is one of his best. The cinematography is astounding, with 'helicopter shots' over Rome, and the ear-splitting sound fits the film's brutal tone.
The acting is really impressive, with legendary actors Richard Harris as Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the late Oliver Reed as Antonius Proximo, a slave dealer who trains Maximus. And Phenoix plays the part of the evil Commodus with relish. But this is Russel's movie, and his performance is brilliant, combining ferociousness with pathos.
The DVD extra features are exceptional, with a feature commentary from Scott and the other film-makers, an extensive 'making of' documentary, deleted scenes with optional commentary from Scott, trailers, T.V spots, production notes, cast and filmmaker's notes and more fascinating production info.

The battle scenes are gritty, but still manage to convey a sense of heroism.

1280230,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator took home the Oscar for the Best Motion Picture of 2001 and rightfully so. Gladiator is a great movie with a great plot. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is taken from a high place of being a general with the Roman Army to a lowly slave and gladiator. Without giving away any more of the plot, I will just say that Maximus engages in several fights for his life and for Rome.
Every member of the cast in this film of epic porportions deliever the best performances of their career. No element of this film is done unintelligently, which actually would have been very easy to do in a film about a time where men wore women's style garments. The only thing that may be over rated is the special effects, some of which are clearly CGI (Computer Generated Imagery).
The Special Features Disc includes features that go above and beyond the normal call of duty. It flaunts some things we have never seen on any DVD yet. Dairies, trailors, televison spots, and many featurettes.
Bottom Line:
You will love Gladiator. If you like action movies you get plenty of fights. If you like romance you will find that in Gladiator as well. Some war as well, inklings of comedy, and drama make it a blend of everything we go to the movies for.

What more could you ask of Gladiator? It's crowd-pleasing, entertaining, its got Russell Crowe, CGI tigers, swords, lots and lots of action and a suitable running time for a battle epic. I enjoyed Gladiator even since it came out. I thought it was clever and enthralling entertainment that kept me captivated with its ferocious and heartfelt story.
On the subject of the story, Gladiator really does have a lot going for it. It may not look a lot on the outside, but look for Gladiator's interior and you will see there is actually quite a lot going on the film. The big picture of course is the story about ol' Maximus (Crowe) becoming a gladiator and defying an empire. However the movie also has some excellent sub-plots which bring across the messages of family love, revenge, jealousy, history, friendship, death, war and terrific conquests. I was constantly surprised at how much I was learning from Gladiator, even if it did have some historical inaccuracies.
To bring to life all these stories we needed a great director, someone who used his/her vision to bring such a highly anticipated cinema event to life. Thank God for Ridley Scott. Scott puts all his heart and soul into the film and it finally emerges as one of his most enjoyable and entertaining and overall best achievements to date. Scott uses every ounce of his filmmaking passion and incredibly he makes this movie look, feel and seem every inch like a gladiators stadium.
Scott's cast also does extremely well in delivering the goods. Heading, of course, is New Zealand's own Russell Crowe, who has never faulted yet. Crowe brings such a manly, strong and enjoyable hero to watch you literally have to choke back the urge to cheer for his character. Joaquin Phoenix is the villain in the film, he brings an eerie screen presence, and he is finally matching up to the standards of his late brother, River. Connie Neilsen is the main lady in the film, and struts through the movie with a great elegance. Neilsen carries herself excellently, and she proves that she can do better than just an extended cameo (The Devil's Advocate). Oliver Reed is also particularly enjoyable, as is Amistad's Djimoun Hounson, and Richard Harris is perfect in the very small but largely important role of Marcus Aurelius.
The movie looks great, too. The battle scenes are gory and the incredible sound techniques used in them are eye widening. The costumes are beautiful and have a lot of range, Janty Yates did do a good job, but the armour and most of the costume designs weren't actually made in the times when this film is set. Never mind, they look good and suit the cast, and at the end of the day that's what matters. The CGI and effects are like nothing you'll probably see throughout 2000 - you cannot even tell these are special effects. I almost thought that Scott had got his team to build a coliseum and make Russell Crowe fight real tigers. Stunning!
The length and pace of the film suited me fine. Even though it is over 2 hours, Gladiator actually never really bored me or had me uninterested, so I was fine with the couple of hours well spent in the cinema.
I really liked the way the movie begun and ended. The beginning really proves a man's hand gliding across grass can lead to a lot of different points in a film, and the ending almost had me in tears. This movie is very well done and never goes over the boat with cheesiness. I guess that's exactly why I felt so much for the characters and never found myself sighing or rolling my eyes when the dramatic scenes were on.
Gladiator is a film you'll love or hate. I loved it a lot, it's a movie that has the power to entertain you with action, stun you with thrills, take your breath away with some amazing atmospheric special effect places, and definitely make you feel a lot for the people in the movie. I highly recommend this to not only action gurus and Russell Crowe fans, but I think everyone will find something they like in Gladiator.

Additionally, the film was disappointingly historically inaccurate. Commodus reigned as emperor for about thirteen years, was a physically imposing individual of daunting martial prowess, and his death was the result of intrigue and poison rather than as portrayed in the film.

1280286,5,B00003CXE6,"Film, more than any other art, has the wherewithal to create an epic tale. One reason is that the medium is literally larger than life. The screen exaggerates everything. Another reason is that most people who make movies are gamblers by nature. They often invest staggering sums of money on a single movie. Sometimes, they hit the jackpot. The three most successful movies of all time are Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, and Titanic. Each had an epic tale to tell. Each cost a fortune, made back an even larger fortune, and became legend in the public's eyes. Since Titanic was released just three years ago, it appears that this form of movie making is as popular as ever. This year we have Gladiator. Financially it did well, though grossing nowhere near what the Big Three did. Artistically, it's as good as almost epic I can think of. It certainly disproves the notion that the 'sword and sandal' movie is dead and buried.
The place is the Roman Empire. The time is the Second Century AD. A Roman army, led by Maximus [Russell Crowe], is ready to wage a decisive battle against fierce Germanian troops. Winning the battle will bring to Rome and its emperor, Marcus Aurelius [Richard Harris], peace for the first time in years. Marcus has been at the battle front for many months and is now joined by his children, Cummodus [Joaquin Phoenix] and Lucilla [Connie Nielson]. After the battle, which is a most intense and brilliantly orchestrated piece of film making, Marcus gives Maximus, whom he loves like a son, many new responsibilities, though Maximus wants nothing more than to return to his farm in Spain and to his wife and son. The treacherous and insane Cummodus, terrified that Maximus will prevent his succeeding to the throne, plots to have Maximus killed. While the hero escapes, he pays a terrible price and winds up becoming the gladiator of the title. Lucilla, who also loves Maximus, can do nothing, for fear that Cummodus will harm her young son.
In Gladiator Russell Crowe has finally found his way to major stardom. He is perfect as Maximus, giving him a macho facade that masks a loyal, caring and intelligent man. Joaquin Phoenix gives the best performance of his career to date as Cummodus. The two actors make formidable onscreen adversaries in several chilling scenes, most of which take place in a nicely rendered vision of the Roman Coliseum as it might have appeared all those years ago. Connie Nielson gives the wily and brilliant Lucilla a majesty reminiscent of Cate Blanchette in Elizabeth. Bringing added depth to the movie are three older actors - Richard Harris, Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi. Harris and Reed were major stars in their own right in the early 1960s and early 1970s. Sadly, Reed died just after completing his role, and Gladiator is dedicated to him.
Director Ridley Scott is one of the best, bringing elegance, style and substance to most of his movies. He had directed such diverse pictures as Alien, Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise.",1016409600,,2989,4.794573643410852
1280287,5,B00003CXE6,"Summary:
A general becomes a slave, who becomes stronger that Caesar.
Solid script writing with good cohesion, great acting from a deep and solid cast, great (and eerie) music, fantastic sets (a real coliseum, and surreal special effects), great directing, great Director's Commentary by Ridley Scott and great DVD special features includes a short documentary on gladiators.
Review:
Movie mixes some history with good story telling and truly great special effects - the creation of an accurate Rome and the Coliseum.  Good intrigue, and twists, along with some robust (bloody) gladiator fights.  This movie makes Russell Crowe, and he makes the movie.  Joquin Phoenix delivers a great performance being a demented Caesar (Comodus) who gains audience sympathy with his sick and twisted weaknesses (his search for being loved).  His sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) is exceptionally regal, without being overly affected.
Richard Harris does a surprisingly great job and his short performance sets the stage as Caesar Augustus - the great leader and empire builder whose failed fatherhood (to Comodus) leads to the conflagration between Maximus and Comodus.
Story:
Rome's greatest general Maximus (Crowe) finds himself thrust into slavery when he narrowly escapes being murdered on the orders of Comodus (Phoenix). Maximus' personal mission is to avenge the brutal deaths of his wife and son against Comodus; then to join his family in the hereafter.  Fearful for the life of her young son Lucilla (Nielson) gains hope in staging a revolt through Maximus when she finds him alive in the Coloseum.  Because of his fierce fighting style, Rome loves the slave Maximux and Comodus cannot directly kill him.
Negatives:
Some of the gladiator fights are detailed and therefore gory, so be careful who you see this film with.
Also, the pagan concept of death and the portrayal of the ""hereafter"" feels spiritually empty.  But, that was Rome",1016323200,10,1929,5.284313725490196

1280290,5,B00003CXE6,"Every summer there's at least one blockbuster movie.  Usually it's a complete no-brainer, but 'Gladiator' proved otherwise.  The premise is basic as Maximus (Crowe) battles his way through the gladitorial arenas to win his freedom and avenge the deaths of his wife and son.  Ridley Scott is one of those directors that every so often really hits the big time with his movies such as 'Alien' and 'Thelma And Louise', and 'Gladiator' is one such movie.  It manages to drag up the old gladiator epic and breathe new life into it without resorting to camp.  Using state of the art computer graphics you'll believe that you're actually seeing ancient Rome and this is definitely a highly cinematic film that loses something on video.
The acting is fantastic as well.  This burst Russell Crowe into the big league, something that anyone who had previously watched 'The Insider' or 'LA Confidential' already knew to be inevitable.  As loner Maximus he is perfectly cast and manages to bring to his character what is perhaps left out in the script.  As the villainous emperor, Joaquin Phoenix is genuinely creepy and actually quite unconventional as well.  The emperor's sister Lucille is also played with vigour by Connie Nielson and Oliver Reed turns in a last performance as a gladiator owner.
Unfortunately 'Gladiator' does tend to modernise the premise, with a few politically correct characters thrown in as an afterthough.  Over anything else this is a blockbuster and as such can't be viewed as anything truly revelatory.  Yet viewed simply as a movie it is a stunning breakthrough: utterly breathtaking and compelling in equal measure.",1014854400,,1636,5.044609665427509
1280291,4,B00003CXE6,"Being a champion of the Sticky Rice, Ridley Scott (who made the seminal RiceRunner and the haunting Black Rice) embarked on the true history of the Rice in Europe.  And he didn't disappoint.
It tells of a head chef, played with great aplomb by Russell Crowe, who is part of the Roman empire's quest to spread pasta throughout Europe. After banishing the upstart Germans and their sausages, Russell wants to return home to and start up a hawker store and introduce the Sticky Rice to his local community (and Laksa as well - he loves his chilli).
However the young upstart emperor, played with a maniacal hongkie zeal by Joaquin Phoenix has other ideas.  He wants to open up a new chain of restaurants where waiters are put into a ring and have to cook up a plate of pasta while dodging drunk lions, belligerent Zulus and other restaurant competitors who want to steal their recipe.  And so Russell is thrust into it!
There are great waitering action sequences here.  Witness Russell and his band of waiters cook up a plate of Fettuccine Bosialoa while dodging fish and chips from the English and tacos from the Mexicans.  However the supreme moment is when Russell is near death and what it looks like,to be maggots festering in his wound.  For all aficionado's of the Rice, we know that it was actually sticky rice pouring out of his body to heal the wound.  Full marks must go to Ridley for daring to reveal the secrets of the Sticky Rice sect and exposing the trials and tribulations of the first hawker food owners in Europe.
Just a side note, while filming in Morocco, Ridley Scott actually
introduced the Sticky Rice to the local cuisine.  The community devoured it.  They now have developed their own Sticky Rice - has a dash of sand in it.  Believe me, might sound a bit funky but it gives it a nice
crunchy flavour.",1013644800,,1824,4.567484662576687
1280292,4,B00003CXE6,"I wanted to see Russell Crowe in his other movies after seeing him doing such an AMAZING job in ""A Beautiful Mind"".  Joaquin Phoenix did a AWESOME job as a manipulative, deceiving, sickening jerk. The special effects and the sets was pretty amazing too.
Russell Crowe did a good job too. The scene where he found his son and wife crucified and burnt just broke my heart. It seemed to me that the character of ""Maximus"" was stoic(sp?) most of the time. The only thing that disappointed me was the ending. I could've lived without the ending. It was also difficult to find a plot. I'm NOT bashing the movie at all!!! Like I said, I think I need to watch it more than once. The more I watch it, the more I like it.
The DVD features are cool. I like to watch the montage of unused scenes with the beautiful music playing in the background and the ""Making of"" featurette.

1280293,1,B00003CXE6,"It is most sad that so many people wasted their time on such a vapid film. They tried very hard to make it seem ""deep"" through the use of dream imagery and excessive computer whizzery. It was impossible to ignore the phonyness, particulary in the coliseum battles with tigers and the giant in the gold mask. It was way too obvious that extreme closeups, swirling camera movement, and overly zealous Foley(sound) effects were intended to disguise the truth, which was that nothing real was happening.
As for Russell Crowe, I am still waiting to find out whether he can act. In this film, his mutterings tapped into all the emotions he could express from A to B. Perhaps with a script, he might do better. Maybe when I see ""A Beautiful Mind"", I'll find out.
I have always been a fan of action films, but this one, alas, was so contrived and obvious in it's use of two-bit trickery that no matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to believe in.
If an audience doesn't require more than this film delivers, then how long will it be before movie-goers just salivate and shout their approval just because a film was overhyped to the maximum extent possible.

1280294,4,B00003CXE6,"Yikes! With over 1200 customer reviews about `Gladiator' (as of this writing) posted, I think I'll hold off on reviewing the movie proper. I seriously doubt that anything I'll say about it will sound any different from what many of the others have written, so I'll let my fellow Amazonians try to wow you with their insights on how good, bad, or indifferent this flick is. Instead, I'm going to review something that most folks have neglected to mention in their prose critiques: the DVD extra features! And off we go...
Being the high-tech, big-budget box-office champion that it is, one would naturally assume that `Gladiator' would have a pretty wide array of bonus materials. And sure enough, that is indeed the case. In fact, there're so many extras, the studio devoted an entire second platter to `em. But first, let's start off with the feature-length commentary. Director Ridley Scott and a few of his filmmaking cohorts go into the details of how each particular scene was devised and filmed, how they tried to make the movie historically accurate in some ways, and other things regarding the making of this film. Throw in a few amusing anecdotes here and there, and you have pretty much your basic commentary track that doesn't particularly stand out from others I've listened to before.
Okay, now we can get on to the bonus disc. There's the obligatory teasers/trailers/TV spots section, as well as a half-hour behind-the-scenes doc where you see the director and principal actors get a bit too involved and in describing their roles, and taking things a bit too seriously. I mean, I like the movie and all, but sheesh-lighten up a little, guys! Also thrown in is an hour-long documentary that goes over the history of the original Roman gladitorial contests, which I found both entertaining and informative. True, it was likely included as an attempt to appease the more nitpicky moviegoers who demand historical accuracy, but I liked watching it none the less.
Then there's the gallery of deleted scenes, all of which include commentary from the director. After seeing these bits of trimmed footage, I thought it was a shame that Mr. Scott didn't see fit to restore them to the movie... oh well. There's also the interview with composer Hans Zimmer regarding the scoring of the film which I found less than exciting. I like the movie's soundtrack tunes and all, but it doesn't exactly make for a compelling interview.
Also thrown in to fill out the package are several storyboards and behind-the-scenes photos. You know, a little something for the cinema uber-mavens to drool over. Personally, I would've preferred a blooper reel, but that's me...

I didn't get it. It was like they ran out of money and couldn't pay the army, so they had to slap together a quick ending. And Russell Crowe's acting? Please. He plays every single role the same: the self-proclaimed inner hero, but with a hard outer shell. So now all of a sudden he's this artist?

Russell Crowe's performance is worthy of the Oscar he received as the honorable general Maximus, who is betrayed by the scheming and evil, Commodus, son of the dead emperor of Rome, played perfectly by Joaquin Phoenix. Scott takes us from the low point of Maximus' existence in slavery and shows us how he battles his way back to confront the man who took his family and life away from him. Through honor, his strength brings him the respect of the citizens of Rome, who eagerly watch the bloody sport in which he is forced to participate. Connie Nielson is also good as the sister of Commodus, and former love of Maximus, who has to deal with the incestuous advances of her brother and his maniacal treatment of the citizens of Rome.

The emperor, on the other hand, was also acted well. One could sense the cunning behind the eyes, and his ephemeral whims spoke of a psychotic demon. A man to be feared and despised for his weak-willed nature.

1280344,2,B00003CXE6,"More recently, the critics took aim and fired collectively at Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor.  One of the criticisms was the film's (alleged) lack of attention to historical fact.  Indeed, Michael Bay took some liberties with Pearl Harbor.  He altered history.
With Gladiator, history was not altered, but put through a  paper shredder and completely re-written.  Early in the film, the audience is asked to go along with the most ludicrous of propositions.  It goes like this.
Caesar, (played by Richard Harris) is weary of war and conquest.  He would like to die knowing that Rome will be reformed.  Thus, he makes known his desire to make Marcus Aurelius, (played by Russell Crowe) the new Emperor.  He would rather have a soldier be Emporer than his own son.  Why?  Because he wants to give power ""back to the people.""
Anyone who knows anything about Roman history ought to be ashamed for swallowing this whopper.  The real Caesar didn't give a rat's behind about giving power to the people.  One has to get past this ludicrous idea from the get go, or spend the rest of the movie scratching his head.
And the battle scenes?  Well they  are so obviously computer animated,  I felt l as though I was watching  Rogger Rabbit vs. Ben Hur.
And what's more, the basic plot seems stolen straight from the Mad Max movies and placed in an Acient Roman setting.  The hero's family is murdered, and so our hero must rise up against seemingly unstoppable forces to get revenge.  Sound familiar?
I can agree that Russell Crowe is a fine actor, as are the other players in this film.  But I don't understand how that  excuses all of the other flaws.
Even still, lots of folks out there liked it, so I guess its just a matter of taste.  Check it out, but be ready to seriously suspend your disbelief.",1012089600,5,1786,4.6210191082802545
1280345,5,B00003CXE6,"Many years ago, Hollywood mass produced epic movies that were not only monuments of spectacle, but also contained meaningful messages that gave films moral magnitude as well. There are several reasons why Hollywood stopped making epic movies and just a few short years ago the great movie epic was said to be dead.
Well, the great movie epic is back. It began with BRAVEHEART in 1995 and reached new and different heights with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN in 1998. The tradition coninues with GLADIATOR.

GLADIATOR is the story of Maximus, a fictional Roman general. Maximus is the greatest of all Rome's generals. A dying Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, chooses a reluctant Maximus as his heir. However, the Emperor's son, Commodus, has different ideas. Therefore, instead of the Imperial Palace in Rome, Maximus soon finds himself as a slave sold as a gladiator fighting to stay alive on the fringes of the Empire. Maximus is chosen to fight in Rome and from there he plots how to revenge himself against Commodus and make Rome a republic again.

Russell Crowe plays Maximus and one word need only be said: amazing. After stellar performances in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR has cemented Crowe's place with the top echelon of Hollywood's elite. Other noteworthy performances include that of the late Oliver Reed, who plays the gladiator owner/trainer, and Djimon Hounson, who plays Maximus' gladiator friend.

Director Ridley Scott has revived the ""Roman movie"" with this awesome epic. The melding of great performances, visual scenery, special effects, and sound story is a testimony of Scott's skill as a filmmaker.

GLADIATOR also contains a moral message. Maximus is a religious man; yes a pagan, but a religious one nonetheless. He is tossed around the wheel of fortune, yet ends the film as he began: a man of integrity and honor. All must die. Yet, it is how we live our lives that makes a difference. That's a lesson, especially in our current troubled times, that's worth hearing (and seeing) again and again.",1012089600,,2020,5.020895522388059
1280396,5,B00003CXE6,"There are good movies and there are great movies.  A great movie has the ability to transport the audience from mere spectator to participant.  Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR thrusts the viewer into ancient Roman history through the character of General Maximus Meridius.  He is a storied hero, a man with integrity and values, honorable to his lord, Emperor Marcus Aurelius.  Although the film is not completely accurate in its historicity, Scott gives enough fact to send the audience back in time to ancient Rome, during the reign of the Caesars.
The film begins on the battlefield with Rome engaging in one last conflict.  A victory will further expand the Empire and secure its quest for world domination, a worthy achievement for a Roman emperor.  Led by Maximus, the powerful Roman army overcomes the opposition in a bloody war scene, which is not for the meek and timid.  Victorious celebration follows, but Marcus Aurelius, aging and dying, is not completely satisfied.  He summons Maximus to his quarters and shares his feelings and wishes with him, as a father would a son.
Marcus Aurelius: There was a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it.  Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish, it was so fragile.
Marcus Aurelius: You have proven your valor once again, Maximus. Let us hope for the last time.
Maximus Decimus Meridius: There is no one left to fight, sire.
Marcus Aurelius: There is always someone left to fight. How can I reward Rome's greatest general?
Maximus Decimus Meridius: Let me go home.
Marcus Aurelius: Ah, home.
These words set the tone for the remainder of the movie for indeed this would not be Maximus' last fight.  Marcus Aurelius' son, Commodus, would soon take over the reign of the great empire and almost instantaneously, the dream that was Rome would disappear.  As for Maximus, he would suffer through many a hardship, and find himself fighting for Rome, not as a general, but as a gladiator.
GLADIATOR is a great movie, and one of epic proportions.  It is so good that it can be watched repeatedly, with the audience standing in awe, learning something new with each showing.  This is a film with plenty of action thus satisfying those with a lust for bloody fight scenes.  Men especially will enjoy watching Maximus in his gladiator battles, but women will be enamored with his softer side.  He is a loyal family man, honorable, and a man of integrity.  It is also an educational movie for history lovers or anyone interested in ancient Roman history.  Scott paints a vivid  picture for audiences as he is acute to historical detail, such as the scenes from the Roman Colisseum, which give the audience a real sense of being there.  Moreover, Scott touches on some philosophical and sociological issues that will appease the intellectual mind as well.
GLADIATOR is a great movie, because it has a fine cast of actors, beginning with Russell Crowe (Maximus) in the lead role.  Crowe is perfect for the part, having lost around 40 lbs. to play the muscular general, his New Zealand accent adding a touch of a classic quality to the role.  His performance was outstanding and the success of the film depended on it.
Playing the part of the antagonist was Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus) who was equally sensational.  He was definitely in character as the evil ruler, but also excelled in his alter-ego, a very frightened little boy who could not live up to his father's wishes.  Moreover, the supporting cast was wonderful from top to bottom, but add two seasoned veterans like Richard Harris (Marcus Aurelius) and Oliver Reed (Proximo) to this list and you get a great movie.  On a sad note, Reed passed away soon after shooting the movie, but the film was dedicated to him in the credits.  His role as Proximo, the trainer of gladiators, was excellent as his character was both tough and funny.
In conclusion, many different qualities must come together to distinguish a good movie from a great one, and Ridley Scott has hit on all eight cylinders.  GLADIATOR belongs in every family's movie archive, yes, it is that GREAT.",1011484800,2,4069,4.827089337175792

The movie has many good parts in it, like in the beginning when there's a big battle.  All the battle and action scenes in the movie are good too, but the opening one is my favorite.  This is all I really liked, though, the action.  The other stuff -- the acting, dialog, and ending -- wasn't any good.  For those who've read 'Hamlet' you'll know the ending was unoriginal.  I vaguely remember reading 'Hamlet' in high school, but I know it ended with poison, like 'Gladiator' does.  So the ending's no good.  The acting and dialog is pretentious.  So many looks and words are exaggerated or embellished for effect.  R. Crow's performance is good, and he's a good actor, but I think he's almost too good, to the point where he's unbelievable.

I certainly did not feel any sympathy for Maximus in his time of sorrow. Derek Jacobi's senator was a waste of screen time. Commodus came off as a whiny cowardly brat.

1280403,5,B00003CXE6,"I recieved the movie ""Gladiator"" for Christmas this year. This is a very good movie but I warn you it does take a few times to really understand and grasp the whole plot and fully appreciate this movie. This movie is full of digital effects, but they are not overused as they are in some movies. The digital effects are perfectly excecuted. The main character ""Maximus"" is played by Russell Crowe, who in my opinion did a good job of acting out the illustrious personality of Maximus. He did a good job changing the personality of Maximus as he was in different situations. There where points in the movie when Maximus was a reverant man, and other points where he was a cold blooded killer.
Joaquin Phoenix, brother of River Phoenix, played the evil Roman emperor Commodus. Joaquin did a good portrayal of the emperor, who is known in the history books to probably have been insane and obsessed with gladatorial sport. He bankrupted the Roman treasury by spending all his money of uneccesary things having to do with sport. Some also say he was the emperor who started the downfall of the Roman Empire. Joaquin did a great job in my opinion, and his portraying of the Commodus was mostly accurate to the history books.
Now some naysayers have said it was impossible for the Emperor to have ever fought in the Colosseum. Well, I have researched  the Roman Empire and Commodus often appeared in the Colossuem to fight poorly armed gladiators who had only wooden weapons and no armor, while the Emperor has metal weapons and was well armed. There where many other stipulations in the Emperors favor, and I am sure he would get a little ""help"" if the battle was not going his way. The real Commodus also appeared in chariot races, but he never raced in the Circus Maximus because he did not like to do it in public.
There where a few small plots in this movie that did not conform with history, such as the fact the Marcus Aurelias probably did not have any problem with Commodus becoming the new emperor after he died. However, this is a great movie, and it is well acted and has a great plot. It might not be able to satisfy the regular history buff, but it can satisfy the normal American, which is what has made this such a great film. The directing, the acting, the digital effects, it is all here in this one, so I would reccomend you buy this DVD immediately.",1010188800,,2363,4.521028037383178

An unbelievable circumstance is made highly believable primarily because of his performance.
I took the opportunity to rent a similar story, Spartacus, recently. I expected that the thing that would make me like Gladiator more would be the special effects and exciting battle sequences.

Gladiator is a megaproduction that you have to watch a few times to really appreciate, with the exception of Ridley Scott's direction. Some criticise it as being too dark, the dialoge stilted and uneventful, or a very jaded representation of Rome, and they're right.
As an epic, Gladiator falls far short due to it's narrow-scope and jumbled pace, making for a rough and confusing ride, which leads up to a somber, anti-climactic end that leaves you with the same pervading unease you had throughout the film. Suffice it to say, I didn't really enjoy watching Gladiator at first. Even grand-scale recreations get boring if there is no substance behind them. The performances from Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix drew me in at times. The two DVD set is excellent and packed with a variety of features, and the picture clarity is about the best I've seen.

1280478,5,B00003CXE6,"Best movie ever, it's about Maximus Veridius, who in the words of Commodus, ""The general who became a slave, the slave who became the gladiator... the gladiator who defeated the Emporer!""
Is very dramatic, yet not over or under-acted. Has a great story line, and wiked sound track by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard.
I accedently found out while on ask. Com that this film is actually based on a true story.
In fact- this movie is so good, i have decided to make a computer game about the life of a gladiator.
You can learn a lot from this film, with facts about the Romans aswell as important morals. But you have to see it to know it!!!",1009324800,,634,4.336134453781512
1280479,5,B00003CXE6,"The plot of this movie had the potential of being a very, bloody, gory, stupid, and meaningless movie if it landed in the wrong hands.  Thankfully that didn't happen and Rob Ridley did nothing less than a spectucular job on this movie.
The movie starts with the main character, Maximus leading his troops to victory.  After the war, the king tells Maximus that he would perfer that he become king over his son, when he died.  Of course the King's son, Commodus, did not like that and after the king dies, orders Maximus be killed.  Maximus escapes his assilants, is found, and becomes a slave.  As a slave he is forced to fight as a gladitor, and he eventually fights his way to to appearing in the famous Roman colliseum.  He gains the supports of other slaves and even his master, and he vows revenge on the new king, Commodus.
The action scenes in this movie were perfect, nothing was overdone or underdone.  There was alot of blood and violence in this movie, but they were ALWAYS in the right place and fit perfectly in the current scence.  Maximus was not a cold-blodded killer, until he was in the ""ring"".  In the ring, his skills, ruthlessness and sometimes arrogance were very pleasing to watch.  He knew that no one could beat him even if it was not a fair fight.  And the creator of Gladiator did an excellent job in getting these facts across without actually coming out and saying it.
The acting of this movie was also superb.  The two main charatcters played by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix did spectacular jobs with there roles.  Crowe had a very convincing performance assuming the role of Maximus.  Phoenix also did a very good job in betraying the cowardness of Commodus, and also betraying the flat out ""jerk"" (since I can't use another word) that he is.
This movie shows that there are still people out there that can produce quality action movies.  Alot of action movies these days are rushed and thrown together and bombard the audience with meaningless overdone action scenes where they are not appropriate.  Not the case with Gladiator.  This movie is easily in the top 5 of my all time favorites.  I rarely give 5 stars on a review, and usually when I see a very good movie I give it 4 stars as I would feel much better giving a movie 4 stars when it was actually a 4.5 rather than just giving it a 5.  However I did not want to give gladiator just 4 stars because it is much better than that.  If there was one movie I would feel good about giving 5 stars, then Gladiator is it.",1008806400,,2509,4.4605263157894735
1280480,5,B00003CXE6,"I was not immediately taken with this film but after repeated viewings I have become a huge fan. The cinematography is dazzling. Russel Crowe is perfectly cast. The script is well written. To the reviewers below who have pointed to the historical inaccuracies, I simply say..this IS NOT a documentary. Many good films about ancient Rome have taken artistic license to make themselves entertaining. Even PBS' ""I Claudius"" took such liberties. The imagination required to create a spectacle like Gladiator is justification enough to watch and enjoy. Historical accuracy be damned.
In addition to the many other merits of this film the action sequences are riveting though quite graphic.",1008806400,2,684,5.284403669724771

I saw it on the premiere and not many people believed my comments, but afterwards most of my relatives and friends agreed with me, this is a G R E A T movie, for years we had been expecting, or at least I had been expecting a great movie, and after the Titanic disappointment, I though it would never come, but oh boy Ridley Scott did a terrific job in accomplishing this, making a both emotional and exiting and visually alluring film, then he went on an made another amazing movie, Hannibal, not as great, but sure a great movie to spend 2 hours and 20 minutes of your time watching Anthony Hopkins do what he does best, be Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lecter. But lets talk Gladiator, Russell Crowe is great, no wander he won the Oscar for his performance, I would have lost all my respect to the award if he didn't. Joaquin Phoenix should and I still complain about it, won the Oscar, sure, Benicio was good, but if you see Phoenix and compare it to Benicio you will see my point, the role of Commodus was much more emotional, had more screen time, the character for me was better and I think played greatly. The rest of the cast is also wonderful, specially the late Oliver Reed, too bad we lost this great actor, he may had won the Oscar for this performance. And the soundtrack is another proof that Hans Zimmer is a genius. To sum up, buy Gladiator, is a great movie, and a great DVD, it has great sound, picture, and special features, a must have. 5 stars are not enough.",1008720000,,1746,4.183976261127596

I was simply amazed at how beautiful this film came out. The photography was breath-taking and Russell Crowe was perfectly cast. This is no-doubt the film he'll be remembered for as this one did for him what Titanic did for Leonardo DiCaprio. The real star of Gladiator however was Joaquin Phoenix. He was one of those villains that makes you almost want to root for the bad guy. This film was a breath of fresh air. See it as soon as you can unless you can't stomach violence. Hollywood proved it still can combine entertainment with art if it really wants to bad enough.,1008288000,,701,4.358778625954199

With all the hoopla made over this film I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. The acting is one dimensional, the story is not original (but drawn out and plain boring) and when you watch this film see if you really care about Crowes character. The answer will be NO.
I gave it 2 stars because it was mildly entertaining. However NOT oscarworthy!!!

Great costumes, AWSOME score by Hans Zimmer, (i have the cd). This movie has everything: action, revenge, gore, romance, great CGI... well worth buying.

You might have heard some discouraging remarks such as Gladiator not being historically acurate, but it isn't supposed to be.  It's FICTION... its BASED on history, yes, but so is Braveheart...which is pretty unacurate, and you don't see people chasing down randal wallace with torches...

That's because anyone who might have,has seen every lame trick in this movie used again and again. I don't know where to begin as the list would be too long. I prefer the real life action like Ultimate street brawls at least thats real.
I liked Russell in LA Confidential and that's about it. The mere thought of him having a Best Actor trophy makes me shudder. I mean, come on-all he had to do to prepare for this role was cut out 5 hours of sleep every night. His routine with the scowling and talking raspy got so old after the first half-hour, I still ask myself why I didn't leave the theatre at any point thereafter. My bad.
I will give the movie credit for the few fightscenes that came across as very brutal and somewhat epic, but these moments are basically few and far between. Sets are pretty much flawless and the costumes are well done, both of which create total believability in the environments. Ok, enough with the compliments.",1007251200,2,1063,4.401015228426396

  The Emperor Commodus probably did not have inner child issues portrayed here, but they are well done.
  The Gladiatorial arena is very vividly and accurately portrayed.  Also the battle scenes are the best ever done.  I think a Roman legionary watching this movie would think that the Roman Army in was for real here.
  For lovers of history and tragedy, gladiator is your movie.  Take a trip back to the dark side of Rome and the dream that Marcus Aurelius had for it and the nightmare his son Commodus made.
  For lovers of old movies, this is sort of a redoing of ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" with Alec Guiness and Steven Boyd.  It follows a similar story line, but at the same time it is a different movie.

1280524,4,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator was one great epic, but I didn't think it deserved the Oscar. Why you ask? Because I thought Traffic was a much more important and much more interesting. I'm not into the movies set back in midevil times, so the appeal was little if any, until I saw it. The film really takes you by suprise, especialy the Oscar calibar performance of Russell Crowe. (Which still didn't measure up to Don Cheadle's or Michael Douglas' performances in Traffic).
The film tells the story of how a King, (or was suppose to be a King), went from being a King to being a Slave, and then turning into a Gladiator!
The story really strikes a cord as the special effects are really some of the best of recent memories. But it did last a little too long. Quite a few scenes were un-neccesary, and totaly uncalled for. But that aside the film really did good in the box-office.
The DVD has tons of special features, and the 2 disc set makes a great addition to a DVD Collection.
If you're really into the knights and kings and things of that nature, you're in for a treat. Otherwise I would avoid this movie

Russell Crowe excelently plays the general maximus a simple minded yet important man to the emperor of Rome. Forced to fight in the arena after the emperors son commodus kills maximus' wife and kid Gladiator doesn't run out of action. Joaquin Phoenix superbly plays his role.

1280590,1,B00003CXE6,"This is one of the worst movies to come out in years. The history is appallingly bad. It's down right offensive to anyone who knows anything at all about the Roman Empire. The costumes (which won an Oscar!) are even worse (note that the emperor's sister is wearing a Victorian corset, complete with busk, over a sari in one scene!). It's criminal that Hollywood gets away with such travesties, and is rewarded with praise and adulation for them, especially when these so called ""historical"" movies end up in our children's classrooms as study aids. Why can't the entertainment industry spend the extra five minutes to check their history, or hire a consultant? The ONLY reason to see this film is if you're a die-hard Russell Crowe fan (and even then in falls into the same group as the quick and the dead: Watch the Russell scenes, and fast forward through the rest).",1005264000,5,868,4.717105263157895
1280591,4,B00003CXE6,"At this point, I haven't even begun to pick out the innaccuracies of this film. But, of course, there are, inevitably, the justfiyable comparisons to ""Braveheart"". A blue-eyed Australian-raised actor playing a warrior avenging the death of his family, a tall, willowy noblewoman (and probable victim of incest at the hands of a power-mad ruler)supporting the wronged warrior and visting him in prison, a profiteer helping to bring about the lead character's downfall,the foriegn-born friend who acts as an encourager to the hero, the wise old ruler who dies leaving unresolved issues...Yes, indeed, folks, the Best Picture winners are starting to look too much alike, especially since both "" Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"" feature scar-faced Tommy Flannagan as an ill-fated supporter of the hero.
 As Maximus, Russell Crowe, is staid, stoic, and stocky looking. He has a beautifully thick neck and fine muscular build like the expatriated American Aussie who paved the way for other actors from Down Under. But,while he evokes sympathy when mourning the murders of his wife and son, he lacks Gibson's passion and expressiveness.
 Whoever cast Joaquin Phoenix as the evil Emperor Commodus must have seen the large sculpted head of Constantine the Great that is in the Capitoline Museum in Rome, for with his large, deep-set, but rather sickly-looking eyes, Phoenix certainly resembles it.
 Frail-looking Richard Harris is the ever-wise Marcus Aurelius. Despite his fragility, he is still elegant of voice, and clear of mind as he wisely chooses Maximus to succeed him. Harris is still impressive to watch onscreen because in the body of this frail-looking old man is a lot of charisma.
 In his final role, we have the sullen Oliver Reed as a profiteer who enslaves the grieving Maximus and places him in a life-threatening situation. Anyone who saw him in ""Oliver"", ""Tommy"", ""Condorman"", etc., knew he was good in such roles.
 Danish-born Connie Nielsen, who bears enough resemblance to the Danish Queen, Margarethe in real life, plays the Emperor's sister, Lucilla in this movie. Her ""Braveheart"", counterpart, of course, is Sophie Marceau. -A statuesque natural beauty, who can play very strong-willed characters with aplomb, and comfort the hero during his final hours. The way Ancient Roman jewelry hangs on Ms. Nielsen is very graceful.
 Djimon Honsou's Juba is the foreign-born supporter who comforts Maximus after the loss of his family and is still standing at the end of the story.
 I didn't see as much of David Hemmings as I would have liked in this movie. But considering his relationship with Richard Harris in ""Camelot"", it's interesting to see the two work together again.
 The arena scenes are fast-paced and graphic. But Maximus' warrior skills are extremely helpful in keeping the number of casualties of his men to a minimum, whether on a battle field or in the arena. The scene where a female charioteer is cut down at her midsection is particularly startling.
 The camera visuals are exhorbitant, as Maximus the Spaniard feels his time on Earth ebbing and his reunion with his wife and son imminent. We can feel his pull towards the afterlife slowly gaining momentum, until he finally wanders through golden fields of wheat towards his loved ones on his way to eternal happiness.
 Whether or not the costumes were accurate, the colors were regal, rich, and splendid, and the overall statliness and grandeur that was Rome was magnificently recaptured. Humming through it all is an exotic score with a certain mysticism about it.

1280594,4,B00003CXE6,"The DVD version of ""Gladiator"" is very good, especially the director's commentary on the deleted scenes (some of which would have made the movie better, and in my opinon should have been left in the final version).
""Gladiator"" is overall a fine film, with good actors, good dialogue, and a nice screenplay. The visual recreation of the Roman world of the 2nd century is thoroughly convincing and sometimes breathtaking, especially the opening battle sequence, which alone is worth buying the DVD for. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, as always, is excellent.
Seen as the struggle of one man, Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls from Roman general to gladiator and slave, the plot is quite strong and moving, apart from the many excellent action scenes.
From the historical point of view, the movie is very flawed. Its starting point is a momentous event - the death of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the accession of his unworthy son Commodus, which was seen by ancient and modern historians as the beginning of the empire's long decline. This same starting point had already been used in ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" in 1963, hence the similaraties between both movies, already noted elsewhere.
But, while ""Fall"" did its best to remain at least partially faithful to historical events (getting ever less so towards the end), ""Gladiator"" uses the historical background but messes it up considerably.
The main problems I have with ""Gladiator"", historically, are:
- the characterization of Commodus. The historical Commodus was a sports fanatic and a superb athlete, who wasn't too bad a gladiator himself. He was an eccentric tyrant, possibly even mad, and devoted himself to pleasure while his minions governed the empire - but he was a very different person from that portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, who's more of a ""problem kid"". The real Commodus is not known to have incestuous designs on his sister Lucilla - he banished her to Capri and had her killed there afterwards, fairly early in this reign.
- the idea that Marcus Aurelius might have thoughts about removing Commodus from the succession is probably wrong, but not too implausible. The idea that he might have planned to restore the Republic is preposterous. Any such attempt would almost certainly have plunged the empire into civil war, which is also why the historical Marcus actually did what he could to ensure that Commodus's position would be unassailable (since a rumor that Marcus had died 5 years earlier did indeed start a short-lived civil war), even though he was only 19 when Marcus died.
- On this subject, someone says ""Rome was founded as a republic"". No, it was founded as a monarchy ruled by kings; only some 250 years later did it become a republic - and some 480 years later an ""empire"".
- Maximus is portrayed as a ""general"" of the whole army in Germania, but who had never been in Rome. In Marcus's reign that would have been impossible - anyone in such a position would also have to belong to the senatorial class, and therefore have spent at least part of his career in Rome. ""Generals"" in the sense that Maximus was did not exist. However, people like Maximus did appears a few decades after Marcus's death.
- Finally, the real Commodus was murdered in a palace conspiracy, strangled in his bath by his sparring partner, after 12 years as emperor. After 2 short-lived successors, the empire plunged into civil war, after which the victor, Septimius Severus, emerged as sole emperor.
What I mean is that ""Gladiator"" is a very good film, but bad history. Which is fine - if one is aware of that.",1004745600,3,3566,4.857142857142857

1280652,5,B00003CXE6,This movie is great. It has great action and Russell Crowe fits the role of Maximus perfectly. The special effects are sweet! This is a MUST SEE MOVIE!!!,1003795200,,153,4.5
1280653,4,B00003CXE6,"This film is fortunate in that it is built round the very strong central performance of Russell Crowe. Otherwise its credibility would have been compromised by a series of blunders inexcusable is such a big budget undertaking from such an experienced director. To make a list seems churlish, so I will do so.
1. The sounds of the battle scenes are so obviously dubbed on afterwards. The battle scenes are very ambitious, full marks to Scott for 'having a go' at showing what it is really like in battle, but the dubbed soundtrack, invasive music and good grief, even dialogue out of synch just make this look silly.
2. The plot is predictable. it is obvious the son will kill Caesar, obvious that Gladiator will spurn the new Caesar, obvious he will escape execution, and obvious his family will be killed
3. The characters are ciphers, the same few people we have seen in every Roman Empire film from Ben Hur to the present day - you almost expect Lurcio to pop out and begin the prologue!
4. The scene where the boy is trampled by horses is predictable and it looks like they are using a dummy
5. The opening battle scenes somehow have the speed tampered with. they look a bit like a Ray Harryhausen battle scene only not as good. There's odd little bits of CGI used here for no apparent reason.
6. Richard Harries (presumably fatigued from holding down his weekend job as the Bishop of Oxford) gives a rather camp 'by numbers' performance of the exiting emperor. This is his last chance for him to give the world his King Lear and he's obviously determined to make sure we get it!
7. Joaquim Phoenix's diction is at times unintelligible.
8. The obvious CGI work on the flock of crows flying past the coliseum
9. The inclusion of Derek Jacobi. He's a fine actor, but his presence merely reminds us that the BBC has done Rome before, and better than this in I Claudius
But there are some merits to this film. Despite being long, its pace never flags. Crowe does some of his best acting when he is silent. As any actor will tell you, this is the most difficult type of acting, and it is unusual for the lead character in a film to have so much of it. But Scott shows great sensitivity in lingering on Crowe's expressions for just long enough to convey the emotions, and credit must go to the editor for this.
Oliver Reed is just superb. What a shame he was killed before the film was finished, because it could do with a bit more of him. I am certain Russell Crowe's Gladiator voice was modelled on Reeds. Compare them and I think you will agree.
The feeling of the bloodiness of battle and the empire is so well conveyed that you can almost smell the blood.
The staging of the battle scenes and the skill of the stunt men is unquestionable. But the camera is in close up for far too long and it's confusing. You only really know the outcome of a skirmish at its end. Some close-ups are needed in this type of film as it's tempting to let the big budget sets and crowd scenes leave you with only long shots and huge pans, but this isn't the right place for close-up work.
The scenes with the Gladiator riding cross country are good, reminiscent of the best scenes from Blackadder. If you don't believe me, watch it!",1003795200,,3215,4.4324324324324325

1280718,5,B00003CXE6,"when i first saw this movie in theaters, i was dazzled.  i knew it would capture the Best Picture award in the Oscars, and i was right!  a winner of 5 Academy Awards in cluding Best Picture for 2000, Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" is truly a masterpiece.
  set in about 300 A.D., ""Gladiator"" tells the tale of Maximus (Russel Crowe), a victorious Roman geneneral returning from the battlefield to his peaceful, loving home.  he is obviously very special and loved, because the sickly Emperor Marcus wants Maximus to be the next ruler of Rome.
  but trouble arises when Commodus, Marcus's evil son, murders his father, then blames Maximus.  he sends soldiers to execute Maximus and orders his family killed.  Maximus, being a skilled fighter, escapes his killers and flees to warn his young wife and son, but he is too late - Commodus' troops have horribly slayed them.  Maximus weeps and blacks out.
  when he awakens he is a common slave.  his master forces him to become a gladiator, but then we find out that his masters may not be the cruel man we take him to be.  Maximus makes friends with the other gladiators and sets out on a personal quest to avange his murdered family.  he doesn't mind if he dies, because he will be with them.
  with beautiful directing, acting, cinematography, special effects, and costume design, ""Gladiator"" is truly a winner in all respects - forever destined to become a classic.",1003363200,,1410,4.7366255144032925
1280719,3,B00003CXE6,"I suppose my expectations of this movie were a bit too high. I expected a revival of the Roman Epic such as embodied by Quo Vadis and Spartacus. Unfortunately Gladiator does not quite reach that level. The plot is not strong enough and personnaly I found the use of computergravics to generate a crowd, or even a sky a bit annoying at times. This said, the movie fulfills it's most important task: It is entertaining. There is a lot of action, which looks good, (although again, the scene with the tigers features to much CGI at times) the acting is okay, with a splendid last performance by Oliver Reed and the costumes are a feast for the eyes. All in all, not bad, but a bit pretentious.",1003276800,,690,4.440944881889764
1280720,5,B00003CXE6,"The signal that a movie will become one of my favorites is that ten to twenty minutes into my first viewing of it I whisper the unbidden word: ""again.""  Again.  I must see this again.  There is so much happening that is beautiful.  There is so much happening that provokes thought.  I cannot take it all in in one sitting.  I will enjoy this first viewing for what it's worth, and then I must see this again.
""Some people just don't know when they're conquered""--said by a Roman centurian in resplendent battle dress about a barbarian war lord's defiant flinging of the severed head of a felled Roman into the middle of the advancing Romans' camp.  Then followed the volley of fire and the hefting of bladed steel and the snapping of German Shepherd teeth.  Then flowed the rivers of blood and fire and brightly colored banners.  The glory and pomp of war, the horror.  But who are the real barbarians?  Again.
A general who loves a king, a king who loves his sister, a slave who defies his heart and his master, but keeps his promise.  Again.
An African, a German (Germanian, anyway), a Spaniard, banding together to slay the sweetly charioted Amazons.  The devil is in the details.  Look closely and quickly, for it goes fast.  See?  The black Amazon has only one breast!  As a teacher of English and a student of the language, I love this one.  The word ""Amazon"" comes from the Latin words ""A"" (no, or without) and ""Mas"" (breast, as in MASectomy).  So ""Amazon"" means literally ""without breast.""  The legend is that each Amazon warrior cut off a breast so that it would not interfere with her shooting of arrows.  Again.
Maximus versus the undefeated gladiator.  Maximus de""feet""s him.  Ouch.  Watch out for the tigers!  Again.

1280721,2,B00003CXE6,"Really, I don't understand its appeal. Its plot is moronic: in case you didn't know, the emperor names a general (Russell Crow) as his sucessor. But then, suprise, the emperor's son takes the throne anyway. If this wasn't foolish enough, the general is then sent to be killed, but instead manages to escape, and then becomes a gladiator. I won't say the rest because I don't want to spoil it (not that there's much to spoil.) But really, based on the plot alone this movie didn't deserve ""Best Picture."" Next there's the cardboard cut-out characters and mediocre acting.
I guess this movie is ok as far as action is concerned, but I've seen much better action direction and special effects than this movie has to offer. The decent action scenes are the reason this thing got 2 stars.
Anyway, if you're looking for plot, Spartacus would be a better choice. And if you're looking for action, Saving Private Ryan (although calling that movie an action movie isn't totally accurate) or The Matrix, would be wise choices. Just don't see this film because of all the hype its been given, it doesn't deserve it.",1002844800,3,1104,4.725388601036269
1280722,5,B00003CXE6,"The three best movie depictions of hand-to-hand combat with edged weapons are ""Ran,"" ""Braveheart,"" and ""Gladiator.""  ""Ran"" is most lyrical, ""Braveheart"" most personal, and ""Gladiator"" most panoramic. Each captures a different feel for masses of men madly hacking at each other.
I'm certainly no expert on the subject, but ""Gladiator's"" weaponry and armor seem to be as accurate as possible.  Roman field pieces included both onagers (rock throwers) and catapults (arrow shooters).  The gladius (short sword) was right on.  The pilum (javelin)looked authentic enough.  The helmets and body armor match up pretty well with illustrations from the history books.  The array of the Germanic troops seemed accurate enough, but I believe some liberties were taken with Roman battle array and maneuver.  I'm not so sure that Greek Fire was used as early as Marcus Aurelius.
As for the story itself, Maximus proved the perfect hero: competent, courageous, and committed.  He had physical strength, skill with weaponry, and was a sagacious commander.  He had the martial courage to face an enemy in mortal combat, the material courage to fight through physical adversity, and the moral courage to say ""No"" to a capricious, all powerful Emperor.  He was committed to his family, his moral code, and his country.  The mix of courage and commitment lead him to murderous conflict with the mad Emperor Commodus, resulting in a dramatically satisfying but historically inaccurate denouement.
The story would have been greatly improved with a little more judicious use of the scissors.  It needed to be about 30 minutes shorter.",1002672000,,1612,5.2784313725490195

I liked Russell in LA Confidential and that's about it. The mere thought of him having a Best Actor trophy makes me shudder. I  mean, come on-all he had to do to prepare for this role was cut out 5 hours of sleep every night. His routine with the scowling and talking raspy got so old after the first half-hour, I still ask myself why I didn't leave the theatre at any point thereafter. My bad.
I will give the movie credit for the few fightscenes that came across as very brutal and somewhat epic, but these moments are basically few and far between. Sets are pretty much flawless and the costumes are well done, both of which create total believability in the environments. Ok, enough with the compliments.

The movie looks great - it is literally (how I hate that word),
....spectacular.
But so were the games themselves - pure spectacle. And I am
afraid that I want something more than simple visual thrills
( even though you get those in spades ).
The movie is weakened as soon as Maximus reveals his identity to
Commodus - which happens way too soon. Then the movie becomes
completely incredible from that point. Because all the Emperor
would have done on learning his old enemy was still alive is
have him killed. No one would have questioned that. He was
Emperor. He had the Praetorian Guards. No one would have
publicly questioned the poisoning of a lowly gladiator.

1280811,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is a one-of-a-kind movie, not to be missed for ANYTHING!!! Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix put on a tale of epic proportions. Two men desperately struggle for power as they try to tear each other to apart. Ridley Scott and crew do an outstanding job in recreating the shear power of the Roman empire and it's beginnings to an end. Connie Nielsen is stuck rite in the middle of the intense rivalry, brothering Phoenix and loving Crowe.
Maximus (Crowe), the loved general, is finished with war in Germania as his valiant army finishes off the last of the opposing threat. Maximus seeks a peaceful return home to his farm, where he left his wife and son 4 years ago. Times change as the current emperor passes onward into Alesium. Phoenix orders the death of Maximus and his family. To bad only part of his wish is carried out as Maximus escapes just in time to see the aftermath of his family's death. Forced into slavery Maximus becomes a basically a target for killing in the arena. Maximus does not stay in the arena for long. The new emperor has decieded to host a series of games in his late father's honor. Maximus is flushed right into the center of Rome, where he gains the peoples respect. Using that as his only defense from Phoenix killing him, Maximus manages to become the Savior Of Rome.
Gladiator is a force not to be reckoned with. As each second passes a chill will race down your spine and then a warmth will race back up it, as you are thrown into the sand of the Colleseum.

1280813,5,B00003CXE6,"This extended version is a lot denser that what I remembered of the 2000 commercial version. The politics of Rome are explored in a lot more detail, particularly that strange power the Roman Emperor had because of his own praetorian guard that was doing absolutely everything he ordered, and took orders only from the Emperor. At the end, when the Emperor is dead or nearly dead because he is defeated and disarmed, they refuse to obey their own officer. They will obey him only when the sister comes down and legitimizes Maximus. You only meet servile people and even the Senate and the Senators are just as servile out of fear for their welfare. That could be extended to today, even if today in our democratic countries this manipulation of people is less obvious, less direct, less based on the fear of the leaders but on the fear of an external danger propped up and exploited by the leaders. Fear is still the main nerve of the crowd, and then provide them with some bread and good circus entertainment and they will follow your fears to the end of the world. The film is also extremely clear about two barbaric practices of this supposedly civilized Roman Empire. The conquest war that is not, far from it, always justified by any offensive aggressivity from the ""barbarians"" from beyond the frontiers of the empire. It is brutal and unequal. The advanced technology of the time is on the Roman side. Easy to win when you add to this advanced technology the military professionalism of the Roman Legion. And even so it is shown as what it is: an unclean inhumane and inhuman practice. Worse even the film shows the slave trade and the total reduction of these slaves not even to animals but to objects, properties, commodities you deal with and dispose of the way you want. What the film does not say is that the vast majority of this Roman society is composed of slaves, house slaves, garden slaves, hard work slaves, sex slaves and of course the famous gladiators, the fighting slaves. They all end in death, these slaves, a vast majority premature death imposed onto them by their masters or circumstances, but always to satisfy the desire of a free Roman citizen. The particularity of gladiators is that their end is to die in public from the hand of another gladiator or just mangled by a wild beast or some technical trap. At the top of the ladder of that death is the death decided by the Emperor himself. The film is of course extremely precise about these circus entertainments though concentrating only on the gladiators. There were many other ways to entertain the populace in the Coliseum, true entertainment always bringing death to some people down there in the arena for the real pleasure of the public. This has not changed at all, I mean the pleasure of being the witness of some gross, violent, repulsive dying process imposed onto the dying person by one or many other human beings. The only change is that it does not happen in circuses any more, and with real live, if I can say so, performances of the death of each victim. We have invented in the meantime a machine that enables us to give the illusion of seeing that and yet that does not happen for real. That is called the cinema. In the old days, the Greeks had dramatic productions for that cathartic function, but the Romans did not want anything illusionary, they wanted the real thing and they got it for several centuries with these gladiators and later the Christians, and all the time the executing in public places of all discontents, and even, when you could afford a slave, the real torturing and killing in all possible variations of your slave. We seem to forget, and this film reminds us of it, that the Roman Empire, and before it the Greek or Hellenistic empire was just based on the inflicting of death to any kind of people as the very justification of the social order, the political order or plainly your own prestige or authority. And some speak of this empire as a great period of civilization. Due to these slaves some inventions like watermills devised in the first century BCE were only exploited in the 10th century CE by the Benedictines, hence in the middle of what some call the dark ages (sorry no capital letters). A great film in this extended version.

By such a standard, 'Men In Black' could at least have scored a Best Supporting Actor. ""Epic"" it is not. The tendentious movie reviewers of this country are all about as laughable as Columbia Pictures' ""David Manning.""
Apart from the great effects and visuals, and well-planned arena scenes, the laughable factor is greatly increased by how seriously the movie takes itself to be. The most boring, two-dimensional dialogue keeps happening over and over. Whiny-pants Russell Crowe's monotonally incessant, ""I don't want to be a slave anymore,"" spiel is constantly shoved down our throats in lieu of any content; it is certainly no ""CINQUE MAKE FREE!"" Crowe's glottal delivery is strangely reminiscent of the manic-depressive Marvin the Paranoid Android from the 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.'
The interaction between Crowe and the princess is so hammy one's fast-forward finger just begins to itch out of embarrassment. The loopy emperor-guy is so evil, and so pale you're thrilled when his purple-clad guard comes stomping in so that there is something interesting to watch. The incest line is supposed to be creepy, but all it does is help convince everyone that THIS CREEPY MO' IS GOING DOWN BLOODY-STYLE. If you want to see an exquisitely acted bad-guy, watch John Huston in 'Chinatown;' your skin will crawl.

Of course, Maximus had to be the adult, white male, accepting of all other colors, creeds, and genders (and he loves those innocent little kids). Good stuff, for today to be sure, but that's what makes this movie fiction and not historical fiction.

1280921,4,B00003CXE6,"Some movies get hyped into 'greatness' - this is an excellent example  of the kind. I'm not saying it's not good, but make no mistake, this  is no 'Ben Hur' or even 'Braveheart'.
  The 'epic scale' is more or less achieved, aided considerably by some  impressive Computer Graphics, and the action sequences are mostly  well done. However the storytelling could've been better ........  and in a strange way, the movie lacks soul. It doesn't really shake  you up when it supposedly should.
  Russell Crowe is competent as the chief protagonist, but his role is  not emotionally demanding. I believe he's given finer performances,  eg in 'Insider', without winning any awards so i guess it's some  kind of poetic justice that he must win it for this.
  Phoenix Joaquin is more impressive as the villain, even though his  character has no shades - he's just evil through and though.  Connie Nelson as his sister & Crowe's ex love interest is fair. Most of the support cast do their job well.
  The technical aspects of the movie, like cinematography,  graphics, etc and the score all quite good.

I liked it well enough when I saw it in the theater, but I immediately began to grow a distaste for this movie when I came to school on Monday and suddenly everyone is messing themselves over what a great film _Gladiator_ was.
""It was, like, better than Braveheart!"" ""Dude, that was the best movie I've seen in years!"" ""Russel Crowe's gonna win Best Actor!  And that Commodus guy was great!""
These were a few of the many comments that triggered a boiling resentment deep within the bowels of my intestines for this film which I still carry with me today.  It will now be like that permanently, thanks to the Academy's ridiculous presumption that this was the best film of the year.  First of all, the winner of the Oscar should have been either _Traffic_(which, thankfully, Steven Soderberg got Best Director for) or _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_(which, thankfully, won for Best Foreign Film).  Both of these films were twice as well-acted, twice as well-written, and ten times more satisfying to look at.  Gladiator, all gore aside, is one of the most grainy and ugly films I've seen in years.  The actors seem to be walking through an endless haze, which is easy to ignore during the battles, but annoying when a conversation is happening.
As for Joaquin Phoenix, his character of Commudus is cartoonishly and inexplicably evil.  Ebert & Roeper used a word I particularly agree with: ""transparent"".  He is transparently evil and insane and not enjoyable to watch.  And Crowe does an acting job that Schwartzenegger could have pulled off, but for some reason won an Oscar for it.  It could have gone more deservedly so to more eccentricly difficult roles such as Ed Harris in _Pollack_ or even Tom Hanks' half-silent yet emotionally accurate part in _CastAway_.

Ridley Scott put together an awe-inspiring film of epic proportions.  The recreated Rome is stunning, especially the Coliseum.  If there is a downside to this movie, its that the action sequences are just too exciting, leaving the audience a little bored with the dramatic aspects of the film.  But no worries; there is always an action sequence lurking around the corner.
Russell Crowe puts in a great performance, and he handles the action sequence with the same ease as he handles the dramatic sequences (Anyone who's seen ""The Insider"" knows this man can act).  Lesser-knowns Connie Nelson and Joaquin Phoenix put in solid performances as well.  Joaquin Phoenix seems especially well suited as the evil emperor Commodus.
Historians are bound to have problems with the inaccuracies of this film, but ""Gladiator"" isn't meant to be a lesson in history.  It's meant to excite, and it does that extremely well.
The DVD edition of the film is exceptionally well done, featuring a documentary of the history of the gladiators (that's where you can get your lesson in history), and a great assortment of parts that were cut from the film with director commentary.

1281105,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is a richly textured, well-written, and most of all truly spectacular film, powered by Russell Crowe's superb, Oscar-winning performance. Filled with epic battles, striking scenery, and first-rate acting, Gladiator is certainly not to be missed.
 The story begins in Germania, where the Roman Army is preparing to vanquish the last of the barbaric tribes there. The opening battle scene is a harrowing, masterfully crafted piece of work, thanks to fine editing, brilliant cinematography, and of course, Hans Zimmer's excellent music. The battle footage is dark, vivid, and grisly, bringing out the horrors of war in a truly gripping fashion. The film shifts to a camp after the battle, and two of the most crucial scenes in the movie take place here, involving Commodus, Maximus, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius, who is also the father of Commodus. After Marcus Aurelius names Maximus his succesor, Commodus kills his father and has Maximus arrested. Yet the general manages to dispatch his executioners and is taken with a slave caravan and is sold to Proximo, a slave owner. After winning battles in Africa, the group travels to Rome.... and you can guess the rest.
 Crowe's performance is so good really because of his charisma, the way he looks and speaks. His powerful screen presence enables him to capture the audience's attention, and Maximus is really a character you can root for. Joaquin Phoenix is convincing and in telligent as Commodus, having an authoritative, commanding presence. The fact that Commodus has done and tried to do such sick and evil things makes you really hate him. Roger Ebert said that a quirkier actor might have been more fun in the role. But if there was, you probably wouldn't be able to hate Commodus as much. The old pros Jacobi, Reed, and Harris are all great, but Reed stands out in the trio, giving a splendid performance and since he appears in the film longer, his character is fleshed out more. Nielsen is fine as Commodus' sister Lucilla.
 Ridley Scott's direction is well done, keeping the story moving along at a reasonable pace. (My only complaint: What the heck is some cheesy fart joke doing in this film?!) The screenplay is full of memorable lines and keeps everything in a classic tradition. John Mathieson's cinematography is terrific, with breathtaking shots and exquisite lighting. I really like how most of the beginning sequences are dismal and gray, and the scenes in Rome are sunny and bright, (Maximus says that Rome is the light). The production design is elaborate and and Rome is visually stunning, thanks to some seamlessly crafted computer work. Hans Zimmer's score is terrific and diverse, at some points rousing and at others somber, overall extremely effective and beautiful.  The battle scenes are dazzlingly shot and edited, the standout being where Maximus and his fellow gladiators battle Roman charioteers. Still the others are eye-popping, graphically impressive pieces of work. And the ending is unforgettable.

This is without a doubt the best DVD I own, not only because the movie itself is outstanding, but because it's more jam-packed with fascinating extras than any other DVD I've seen-- only Disney's collectibles come close.
What you're getting here is a two-disc set, one containing the nearly three-hour film (in widescreen with Dolby 5.1 and DTS audio tracks, plus English subtitles), and the other containing numerous Gladiator extras. You'll get some outstanding deleted scenes that, unlike some other films, add quite a bit to the Gladiator experience. You'll get a full filming journal written by one of the movie's stars throughout the course of the filming of Gladiator. You'll get a number of ""making-of"" featurettes-- one for the movie itself, one for the creation of the music, and more. You'll also get some sub-features about the continent on which Gladiator was filmed and the history of the Roman empire. In short, there's enough extra material here to bust a couple of togas, and it's of extraordinary quality.
And then there's the movie itself. A better film than Gladiator I have not seen since 1994, the year of Braveheart-- a movie to which Gladiator can and rightfully should be compared. Both are epic in scope, both center on one man's quest for vengeance at the dawning of a new era, both are beautifully directed.... and both films contain some of the most outstanding battle scenes ever shot. Gladiator's opening battle is perhaps the best I have ever seen. Yet I won't say that one film is better than the other; they complement each other. Suffice it to say that if you liked Braveheart, you will like Gladiator.

In all honesty, this is a slick production and the DVD was excellent.  Unfortunately the story was so lame and the acting so weak that the best I could rate it was 2 stars, primarily for the quality of the picture and the extras.
The characters are one-dimensional (which is not a pan on any of the actors, you can only perform what's written).  The story is worse than weak, it is not believable.  At least in Ben Hur, there is an explanation as to how the character becomes a galley slave and then later wins his freedom.  In Gladiator, Rome's greatest general becomes a slave, then a gladiator who later fights in Rome and no one wonders what happened to him and why the transformation.
If you want to view a great ""Gladiator"" DVD, check out Spartacus, it doesn't have nearly as much action but the story has some substance and the characters are much better acted.  If you are interested in a period piece, I would suggest Ben Hur.
I have only bought two DVDs without seeing the movie first.  Gladiator is one of the two and I am now firmly convinced that I will never purchase another DVD without seeing it first.  What a total waste of money and time.",995328000,5,1272,4.337552742616034

And the viewer's mood parallels Maximus' throughout the movie: there's agony and despair all along the way with doom at the payoff. The first twenty minutes of this film earn it its one star. The opening battle scenes are truly thrilling, but only serve to highlight the stupefyingly boring nature of the remaining two hours.

Dangerous and gory swordfights against man and beast inside a splendidly recreated Colliseum, itself inside a Rome brought back to the old grandeur of the Empire, pomp and pageantry and cheering Colliseum-goers and all. These are just a few of the arresting images to be found within Gladiator, the epic story of Roman general Maximus (Russell Crowe), a man whose incorrigible integrity and honesty display themselves at the wrong place and time, namely stepping on the toes of soon-to-be-Emperor Commodus's (Joaquin Phoenix) ascension to power. Set to be executed, Maximus manages to escape, only to be captured again, this time sold into slavery. Fighting his way up the ranks so to speak, he fights for a chance to enter the Colliseum, and strike back at Commodus, for vengeance, for honor, and for Rome.
Sound like the stuff of epics? It is indeed. Some have chided its simple storyline, forgetting that a movie with a simple storyline, if it's well-acted (Phoenix's Commodus was especially good, just the perfect combination of whiny dependence and power-mad incestous insanity necessary to create a believable, and quite hateable villain) , well-directed (by the brilliant Ridley Scott), and well-scored (by Hans Zimmer, currently of Pearl Harbor fame), is a good movie nonetheless.
Some have chided its historical inaccuracies, forgetting that the intent here was not to make a History Channel documentary. And this is not an attack on History Channel documentaries (they really ARE fascinating). But Scott's intent was obviously not to make such. His intent here was to tell a rousing, romantic, one might say ""old-school"" epic of a hero fighting for love, honor, and country. And at that he succeeds splendidly. So if you can overlook the historical inaccuracies, and the relatively simple storyline, be prepared for an unabashedly heroic film done with all the splendor Hollywood can muster. And hopefully you too will join the cheering of the countless Gladiator fans shouting ""Maximus! Maximus!""
A sidenote: the DVD version is wonderful. Two discs, one with the movie (done with excellent visual quality, especially when viewed on a quality widescreen), one with fascinating extra features on the making of the movie, and the history of the Gladiatorial games, make this a package worth owning.",994118400,,2358,5.2407407407407405

1281298,5,B00003CXE6,"This movie is great and there are some similarities to BraveHeart, but they are not the same movie.
Gladiatior is a movie about Maximus a great general played by Russell Crowe. The ceasar is on his last legs and asks Maximus to become next in line, but when the Ceasar's son (Joaquin Phoenix) finds out he kills his father and becomes a Ceasar with which no one likes even his sister, whom he has a very strange relationship with.
The new Ceasar has Maximus' family hung and burned along with his plantation. He is then picked up and becomes a slave that has to fight for a sport and gain the respect of the crowd.
To avenge his family's death he becomes the best Gladiator of them all and being a General for the Roman Empire helps as well! They make it to Rome for a festival and he can reunite with his army and take Rome back. He gains the respect of the Ceasar, but little does the Ceasar know just who this Gladiator is!

Russell Crowe's acting is very good.  Connie Nielsen's unfortunately isn't until the final scene.  Joaquin Phoenix does ok as the unloved and immature son, but isn't buyable as a ceasar.  the editing and directing and lighting frankly were subpar - it's like this movie wanted so badly to be a Simpson/Bruckheiemer production, but couldn't master the tricks of that genre.  the editing was choppy and intrusive.  the fight scenes were good, but the directing in final night scenes was difficult to follow.  perhaps this was in part due to the measures they had to take to cover for Oliver Reed's untimely death.  it's too bad this movie didn't have a more leisurely pace and a little better acting, character development and plot development.  but this movie was geared toward being a summer blockbuster, not a classic.",993427200,,1046,4.914285714285715

Now I want to point out that this is not a bad movie, it just dosent excell in any area, the story line is okay, the action is okay, the charachters are okay, everything is pretty much okay.  The music is the big part of this movie, although at first glance it just sounds like a women humming and singing although it really helps set the mood.  The action sequences for this movie are okay but are really violent and should not be watched by anyone under 15.  In conclusion this is just another okay movie that is worth a rental and a purchase of the soundtrack and that is about it.

If you remember studying western civilization, the movie greatly overexaggerates the actual fighting methods devised by the Romans, Romans fought in legions not in cascading style; and greatly overexaggerates the actual fighting that took place in the colosseum, nobody really got killed-this is a myth propogated by Hollywood. How about how he took 2 horses to race home against the Preatorians who were going to kill his family? Wouldn't both horses get tired? A lot of scenes where cut out which would have explained some lines in the movie better...maybe you can find them. I found a bunch of ""why did he say that"" type lines through the whole movie, like why Crowe was called ""the Spaniard""? The movie never mentioned that he lived in Spain. Too many incomplete things in this movie. Something telling of the weakness of the director. This is another one of those movies who took on a span too much than could be made into a movie. Russell Crowe didn't have a long enough monologue in the entire movie worthy of the praise gratuitiously bestowed upon him by critics. No Gordon Gekko performance here. Crowe had some of the easiest lines in the whole movie. Phoenix on the other hand had some great lines. The fight scenes where thrown together in disarray, scenes which should have been the staple of the movie, stood empty and disappointing. Just because a movie takes on a huge cinematic scale like a Ben Hur doesn't make it great. This movie was very disappointing. Joaquin gave the best performance. Crowe gave a mediocre performance.

Some of the moronic things about this horrible movie that drove me up a tree follow.
The opening scene shows the Romans using something akin to napalm against their enemies. I thought napalm was invented by Dow Chemical in WWII! The main character rides from Germany to the Mediterranean coast of Spain on a horse - in one day. Did you know that tigers live in Africa? The Roman gladius (the sword they used) could not be used for hacking only for stabbing due to its fragility because of the metallurgy of that day. A Roman emperor entering the Colliseum to fight a gladiator??? Sure. Reed gives a truly horrible and cadaverous (fittingly I guess since he died during production) performance. There are continuous nauseous flashback sequences of Crowe's son that made me ill. There's absolutely no evidence that Marcus Aureleus decided to make anyone other than Comodus emperor!
Did I mention that the plot is totally boring and predictable, being a typical Hollywood formula with no surprises?
The only good thing in this movie was the historically accurate reproduction of the Colliseum. I admit to being impressed with that.
For the rest of the movie: feh! I'd give it no stars were that possible.
This loathsome movie could only appeal to morons who have no grasp of history, plot, acting, geography (I still can't get over those tigers in Africa), or metallurgy, and who have taken a dramamine to combat the nauseous flashback scenes.",992908800,5,1622,4.859205776173285

I was wondering if i had seen the same film as everyone else. So I took another look at it, and its flaws were more present than ever. It was just too standard a film. Nothing special about it. There was the typical plot of the protagonist losing everything unfairly and then having to get it all back himself using whatever means necessary. The visuals were very good, but that's about it. Russel Crowe won the Oscar, and it made up for his loss in the previous year, but this was in such a bad film that he won. The golden age of Roman Movies is long gone.

The action opens with a battle scene, filmed in the woods near Farnham in Surrey, England, which is so wrapped in gloom and haze that it tells us precisely nothing other than that the Romans had a more advanced armoury than their Germanic foe.

Anyway, lots of noise and fire - looks like a good old-fashioned epic, right?
 Wrong!

To cut a long story short, there's a really hunky good guy - whose main problem is that he can't speak clearly, so most of the time we don't know what on earth he's talking about.  But I suspect this doesn't really matter, because even when he does stop mumbling he never says much of any interest anyway.
 Then there's a bad guy, and he's a patricidal creep of the first water who, amongst other things, has the good guy's family killed - so you can't wait for him to get what's coming to him.  Only you do have to wait - for ages, and ages.

Oh yes, there's also a heroine - but this is a real ""mano a mano""-type film, so she never gets to be anything more than incidental set dressing.

Now, you're never going to guess how it all turns out.
 The good guy kills the bad guy.  But the good guy dies as well, so he can rejoin his family in the great bye and bye.  Then the film ends.
 Bet that surprised you, didn't it!

Actually there is one highlight in the film - Oliver Reed, proving what a very talented actor he was when in the right mood.
 Even so, that Ridley Scott felt it worthwhile to drag this pretentious drivel out to nearly two and a half hours simply beggars belief.

I truly admire the film, the writer, the director, and the crew -  They've done a superb work. Reviving a distant history tale to life is an admirable achievement I will always salute to.
  The thing that seized me most of all is the model Mister Russell Crowe portrayed. This is certainly not a surprise, for he was meant to do just that, being the good hero, nevertheless, the core of his being still stands out, maybe more for people like myself than for others.
  I'm trying to express here that the Gladiator is unique for representing the survival of the is right and honorary in a world that is crumbling apart, and that is running out of all the things people consider as good, true and justified. Despite the horrible world surrounding him, Maximus (Crowe) manages to survive - But not by completely becoming a ruthless beast. He does develop and uses dreadful skills of an animal - but only to survive. Whenever he can the man of honor in him evokes to show that he isn't completely corrupted, and forward, to show that this good side is his true self.
For that I'm humbled. I want to always remember this in spite of the world where living in, which tends to drag a man down a slippery road of corruption and acts that lack all honor. Our culture is degrading in a one-way direction toward decadence, and I think that anyone who objects this mainstream should stay true to what he believes in no matter what the rest do or think. It's a hard task, very hard; there are so many temptations out there, and obstacles to pass through. In here, Maximus give us an example of endurance - and for that he deserves all the credit we can give him - in return.
Maybe a moral of the story could be that if you fight hard you will eventually win . I'd like to believe it is true. Russell Crowe has created in me one more sincere hope it is achievable, and it's a great sucess for itself.
In the end, he did win the Oscar price, he earned respectively. In all the other aspects this film is magnificent . I'm glad the film has won all those Oscars, evidently, the best film of last year ,and of course - not one to be missed.",992649600,,2313,4.357308584686775

The direction by Scott is breathtaking i have never been a fan of his due to the fact in almost all Scott's movies outside of Thelma and Louise all the characters seem under developed and the main attraction is the violence but here there is a brilliant balance! Scott still treats the fight scenes as cold and haarsh as ever giving them a rev of heart pulsing urgency! But thanks to great acting by the ENTIRE cast never once is the fighting or personal strife unnatural. The cinematography is also great.

1281492,2,B00003CXE6,"My respect for Oscar Awards received a jolt watching the movie. The jury has probably been carried away by the exotic subject matter, the inherent brutality or by the purportedly grand spectacle of the Roman Empire. Or may be some unknown consideration has influenced their decision. To be impressed by grand scale only, without caring a fig for storyline, characterization, smacks of childishness. Even in that parameter `Gladiator' will get a thumbs down from me. Richard Attenborough recreated a grander scale in `Gandhi' and handled more people on the sets, without sacrificing order and coherence.
Haste seems to be the bane of the movie. So much has been squeezed into so little-both in terms of space and time. Both the opening battle scene in Germania and the fighting scenes inside the Colosseum present such a medley that even someone with 6/6 vision will be left groping for sense. And the murky shots will help compound his woes.
Speaking of time, the narrative and characterization get a raw deal on that account too. Ultimately the movie comes out as a smorgasbord of disjointed visuals replete with blood and rage. This story of chivalry, velour, revenge, Roman politics, intrigue and not forgetting incest deserved a slower pace and more gradual development.

1281544,5,B00003CXE6,"When one hears the name Ridley Scott, movies such as Alien, Blade Runner, Legend, and even Thelma & Louise instantly come to mind. Time to add a new classic to that list, one of the biggest movies of the year 2000 - Gladiator.
Gladiator is the story of one man, Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe). Maximus is a general of the Roman Empire, one who has never even been to Rome yet he controls the respect of the entire army and the people.
The movie opens with a huge battle in Germania led by the great Maximus. You see the respect the troops give him, and you see him in midst of the battle. When the smoke clears, the Emperor Marcus Aurelious comes in to congratulate Maximus, which leads to him asking Maximus to take on the mantle of Caesar when the time comes.
Of course, Marcus Aurelious has both a son (Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix) and daughter (Lucillia, played by Connie Nielson). When Commodus learns that he will not be Caesar, he murders his own father and takes on the job of Emperor. Naturally, Maximus knows that the Emperor was slain and did not die of natural causes, so he does to submit to the rule of Commodus.
The new Emperor orders Maximus to be executed, but he didn't count on Maximus' ability to single handedly wipe out his executors and escape. Maximus rides through the desert as his family is executed by the Roman legion, and he eventually is taken into slavery and sold off as a gladiator.
Maximus' owner is Proximo (Oliver Reed, in his final performance), who was also once a gladiator and won his freedom in the great coliseum of Rome. After Maximus proves himself in many battles, and becomes respected among the other gladiators (and something of a celebrity among the mob), Proximo packs him and the other top gladiators in a carriage and makes his way to Rome to find fortune and glory.
All of this is going along exactly as Maximus wants. He wants only one thing - to face Commodus and get revenge. That single focus on revenge is really the core of the movie, as it centers mainly on Maximus.
Gladiator is a huge story, and the description above only covers the first half of the movie. That is one of the problems with it, as it seems not trimmed enough. If they cut it down another fifteen minutes or so, it may have turned out a little better...but that is only a minor quibble with the film.
Most of the performances are great, especially Richard Harris, who was nearly perfect as a Caesar in the twilight of his life. Russell Crowe simply rocks, Joaquin Phoenix pulled of the totally evil Caesar well, but the whiny little boy act gets kind of annoying (possibly some trimming in the movie would have solved this).
Once Queen Amidala is gone...I will rule the Naboo.
The CGI work that was done to recreate the Roman Empire toward the end of its life span is excellent. Streets teem with people, the coliseum roars, and everything looks amazing.
The action scenes simply rock. These are gladiatorial battles as scene through the lens of no holds barred. They are intense, gory, and loud. The Battle of Carthage scene is awesome and worth the price of admission alone. In terms of action, this movie will rock you!
Overall the movie has amazing action sequences, but a story that could have used a little trimming at the sides. Then again, most people don't go into a gladiator movie to critique it for a deep story - they want to see bones break and limbs fly. And then you look at Gladiator that way...it rocks.",992131200,2,3469,4.5342902711323765
1281545,1,B00003CXE6,"In an interview prior to this film's release, Russell Crowe disclosed that when asked to read the script he found it to be only '70%' complete - a friend of his advised him to do the film anyway, on the strength of Ridley Scott's past record.  Some 8 months later, with the shooting about to begin, Crowe looked at the script again, and much of it had been discarded, leaving only about 30% intact.  Somewhat apprehensive, Crowe took his concerns to Scott, who consoled him with a confident, 'We'll make it up as we go along', or words to that effect.  This attitude betrays the cynicism with which Hollywood treats its own products and, in particular, its screenwriters.  If the budget allocated for, say, the rather fake looking CGI tigers had been allocated to script development, then (who knows) a good movie might have been created.  Instead we have this.  The deficiencies of story not withstanding, it was surpising to see the film fail on many technical levels.  Firstly, the editing deserves to be singled out for special condemnation.  Clumsy abrupt cuts, gratuitous effects, poorly compiled battle and fight sequences: the list could be extended.  Secondly, the short cuts required to computer generate a colloseum (only some 30 degrees of the entire 360 were rendered, the illusion created by repeating this segment) see a distanced (and surprisingly small) crowd of Roman onlookers - the gladiatoral 'spectacle' seems less exciting than your typical weekend football game, the arena itself often appearing artificial and quite 'empty'.  Thirdly,...well what is the point of going on...  While George Lucas and Speilberg at least try to learn from masters such as Kurosawa, Scott appears happy draw upon his earlier experience in television advertising - and, hey, we all know advertising works, it's often clever and entertaining, it's lots of things, but it's just not great cinema.",992044800,10,1897,5.067524115755627

After escaping captivity, Maximus joins the Gladiators of Rome, and becomes an undefeated champion, awaiting his revenge upon the Emperor, for the murder of his family.
MY REVIEW:
""This movie is powerful and emotional, is action packed, and is a true epic with great story telling. Russell Crowe earned his BEST ACTOR oscar well. This is a real career turn-around for him. GLADIATOR won BEST PICTURE of 2000, and it deserves it! The movie has great special effects (which it won an Academy Award for)and marvelous battles! The music is the best part! Hans Zimmer is top notch at his music which really sets the tone for this film! This movie deserves far more than all five stars! See GLADIATOR, as being the BEST MOVIE of 2000! Films don't usually get this good! We finall have a BEST PICTURE that is worthy of the oscar! THE ENGLISH PATIENT, AMERICAN BEAUTY, and SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE- they weren't BEST PICTURES in my book!

1281548,3,B00003CXE6,"This is my second review of Gladiator.  Why?  Because I am that disappointed that it got the award for best picture.  This movie was typical summer fodder for American film-goers.  A story that was akin to Braveheart with a predictable plot.  Yawn.  Oh, the action sequences were great - though they were too few.  The subplots were under-developed.  This movie was just okay.
If you want to see the real best picture of 2000 look no further than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Also much better is Traffic.
American movies are so self-absorbed with big budget over the top CGI than bombard you and leave any resemblence of story to waste.  Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Gladiator....when will the litany of pomp and circumstance end?",991785600,5,728,4.89344262295082

And despite the overly familiar plot, I was roped in and found myself rooting like a little boy for General Maximus.  I've also observed that people who've seen ""Spartacus"" are less enamoured by ""Gladiator"" than those who've yet to experience the Kubrick sword & sandal epic.  Another quibble with ""Gladiator"" is that I wished the actual fighting sequences in the coliseum weren't so disjointed and muddled.  I couldn't follow much of the fight sequences, and they made me really appreciate the talents of, say, Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan, whose choreographed action sequences are always displayed fully on the screen, sans quick-cut editing and camera trickery.  White folks still have a bunch to learn from us.",991785600,2,805,4.977611940298507

1281551,5,B00003CXE6,"Winner of 5 Oscars including Best Picture, Gladiator is an astonishingly engaging epic spectacle with a grand action-drama genre. The action is brilliant; you get everything from gruesome killings to leaping tigers in some visual effects that look truly real, you won't even notice they are computer-generated or CGI. The drama is the heart of the movie however, the back-story is the story of a man, his love for his family, his strong abilities and his will to escape. This man is played to perfection by Russell Crowe in one of his most gritty roles to date. There is also a fantastic supporting cast - Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen and Amistad's Djimon Hounsou - all give life to interesting roles. Okay, so there are lots of flaws in the editing, Joaquin's scar changing from right to left and an aeroplane crossing the arena, but, this is a movie you watch for enjoyment, not to diss the mistakes that come up, even though they do. The film also has an amazing DVD with great stills, a brilliant making of feature and a 2-disk special. Enjoy!",991440000,2,1063,4.720430107526882

A little long, and some of the dialog was a bit too melodramatic, but you can definitely waste a couple hours on worse fare.",991267200,,384,4.746268656716418
1281631,5,B00003CXE6,"This is by far one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  Russel Crowe definitely earned his Best Actor award in this movie.  Joaquin Phoenix is also excellent in this movie, his performance was underrated.  The story itself is moving and gripping, you actually feel something for the characters.  Many 'historians' criticise this movie because of the innacurate events that take place in the movie.  It is clearly stated at the end of the movie that it is based on events in history that have been altered, and it is a work of fiction.
Ther story itself does not drag, and is very moving.  Maximus Desimus Meridias, a general in Emperor Marcus Aurrelius' Legion is betrayed when the son of the Emperor finds out that he wants to pass his powers to Maximus when he dies.  Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix) gives an exemplary performance as the son of Marcus, who in jealousy kills his father to prevent him from announcing the passage of power to Maximus.  When Maximus refuses to pledge loyalty to Commodus, he is ordered to be executed, but escapes.  Afterward, a horrific chain of events leaves Maximus with no more than a quest for vengeance, when he is picked up by a slave trader and turned into a Gladiator.  Describing the movie does it no justice.  It must be seen through your eyes to be fully appreciated.  Ridley Scott once again directs a maserpiece.
The acting is great, and this can definitely be the movie that made Russel Crowe.  Joaquin Phoenix also gave a memorable performance, and it was very disappointing not to see him win the award for best supporting actor.  Wonderful movie, do not miss this, whatever you do.  You will NOT be disappointed.",991267200,6,1663,4.705882352941177
1281632,2,B00003CXE6,"I have read articles where it is mentioned that Director Scott first wanted Mel Gibson as Maximus, but Mr. Gibson, feeling his years a bit, replied that he was to old and recommended Crowe as the best person for the job. So Mr. Scott lost Mad Max, But stole so many plot and scene ideas from Gibsons 'Braveheart', that if Gibson had appeared, this Hollywood pap festival might have been considered a sequel.  How Crowe snared the best actor award for his gutteral, mono-syllabic General/Slave/Gladiator is beyond me. The myriad computer effects are so poorly done, that almost all the generated landscapes look like a childs water color. The fast/slow motion moments, the the realing camera work, all make for virtual indigestion. Crowe, after being enslaved, becomes even more reticent, and is the least impressive physically of all the would be Gladiators. Joaquin Phoenix plays the new Cesar on the Pax Romana block, and plays it very poorly. Scott seemed to want him to come off as a wicked, evil, back stabbing, incestious dog. Instead Phoenix is more a sniveling, cringing annoyance than a mad tyrant. The plot ,which is hackenyed and thin, is also incongrously slow. I think Rome was Built and conquered in less time then it takes for this dud to complete.  Save your money, time and patience, because this movie isn't worth any of those.",991094400,5,1345,4.868995633187773

Gladiators main movie peer would obviously be Braveheart which a think is a better all-round film, although allot of my friends disagree.

What it proved to be was a TYPICAL epic with the basic plot of every other epic ever made.  The acting is done fine but was not superb by any means.  Aren't we getting a little tired of revenge as the main theme for movies?  It's time to expand our minds.  Movies such as Traffic accomplished this goal.  It was an original film.  Gladiator won because it had ""cool battle scenes"" which were not the greatest ever made.  They were poorly designed and the speciall effects were not as well thought out as the special effects in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Gladiator proved to be typical in many respects.  The plot was obvious to begin with.  It's heartwrenching that his family was murdered but give me a break.  Let's talk about ultimate movie cliche.  My family was killed, I must avenge their death.  Gladiator follows the Last of the Mohicans pretty well, differing only in the time period it takes place.  The Academy needs to become more true to the nature of their awards.  The BEST movie of the year should be chosen, not the most typical.",990921600,10,1142,4.579207920792079

However, Russel Crowe is superb and Phoenix is just plain evil.  It's easy to love and hate the right people here and the action sequences are pure eye candy.
The opening battle sequence--especially the Romans' interlocking of shields--is a fairly accurate depiction of Roman battle strategy.

1281757,5,B00003CXE6,"As I've watched and rewatched this movie, I find myself more convinced that this movie was chosen correctly.  The acting was superb, by the leading actor and actress and also the supporting actors.  This type of movie has not been done in a great while, so it was great to see it's kind, once again, brought to life on the movie screen.  ""A general who became a slave; a slave who became a gladiator; a gladiator who defied an emperor""  As the plot can be summed up into a simple phrase such as that, the story told at hand was far from simple.  This was a movie which I consider epic.  The battle scenes were gruesome, yet not just thrown in there for the sheer meaning of violence.  The conversing between characters truly draws you into the movie's tale.  And the ending, while it was not extravagant, was well done and complimented this movie perfectly.  To reitterate, Truly an Oscar winner.
As for this DVD itself- well done.  The video transfer was beautiful as I saw no types of transfer flaws, specs, or grains.  The musical score along with the rest of the audio department of this dvd was very, very satisfying.  DTS ES track really added to this DVD.  While hearing both of the tracks (DD and DTS), they were both stunning to say the least.  The DTS, however, had more of a spatial sound to it, more crisp, and more well-defined and deeper low frequencies.
The Supplemental DVD is wonderful.  A lot of deleted scenes and a compilation of other deleted scenes compiled into a short music video.
Buy this DVD, or even just rent it. Eitherway you can't go wrong and will NOT be disappointed when you do.",990576000,3,1612,4.491408934707904
1281758,2,B00003CXE6,"I must admit that I really liked this movie the first time I saw it on the big screen. I liked it so much that I saw it again. I bought the DVD when it was released way back when. I popped the DVD in the other day to watch it again and I could not watch more than 20 minutes of it.

The opening battle scene is impressive and exciting along with the excellent score. But the dialogue was too much (or too little) -- corny, pretentious, SHALLOW, and outright ridiculous. Every word that Maximus says is sooo politically correct and he's so gooder than good. Every line that Commodus utters is so nefarious (in the shallowest of ways) and he's presented as the epitome of evil. But the character development doesn't cut it -- like the 95% of all movies made today. Watch the movie. These guys sit around and try to say the most meaningful and insightful things in as few lines as possible. But it doesn't mean anything. The scenes involving the two senators talking about the games and any conversation between Commodus and Lucilla are perfect examples. They try to pass these conversations off as deep and revealing, but they make me gag over how stupid they are. I noticed these things when I watched it the first time, but I overlooked them because I wanted to enjoy the movie and not critique it too much. I can't do that anymore. It's not in my nature.

The special effects are so overdone. They're impressive in the fakest sense. I watched Spartacus again before I watched Gladiator again, and there is no comparison. Gladiator ripped off so much from Spartacus, but the result is so cheesey. Spartacus took its time to develop the characters while Gladiator just introduced some traits and assumed that the audience would accept the rest--I don't think so. Spartacus is complex and straightforward at the same time. Lawrence Olivier, Kirk Douglas, Peter Ustinov, Jean Simmons, and the rest of the cast were excellent. There were good good guys, mean good guys, so-so guys that were both good and bad (Peter Ustinov's Batiatus), and bad guys that were still somewhat good if you understood them (Lawrence Olivier's Crassus). I could go on and on. Watch the movie. The end scene between Olivier and Simmons is worth the price alone -- beautiful acting and moving drama. Then watch Gladiator -- MERCY!",990576000,,2303,4.656019656019656
1281759,4,B00003CXE6,The worst of all is the notion that a man who can go single handed against 10 or so other gladiators and slice them all down (or to pieces) one after the other in a small arena on the outskirts of the empire - would so calmly allow himself to be re shackled at the end of each performance by a minimum security force belonging to a merchant/slave trader. High Plains Drifter was a much more realistic scenario.,990489600,,410,4.269230769230769
1281760,5,B00003CXE6,"I'm going to keep this somewhat short, and sweet.  Gladiator is absolutley brilliant.  Ridley Scott directs this Roman epic, and he enlists the talents of Russell Crowe as the lead character, Maximus, a General in the Roman Army.  Alongside Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix is the Emperor, after his father passes on.  This film grips the viewer and holds them intensely right from the beginning, with a battle scene so fierce it will draw comparisons to the scenes from Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  Right from there the viewer expects sheer brilliance for the rest of the film, and that is exactly what they get.  Crowe's performance in Gladiator is the best performance given by an actor since, once again, Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in his classic, Braveheart. Crowe's dialogues are just perfect for delivery, tone, volume, everything.  Body actions match precisely to his words, and much is the same for the rest of the characters.  Phoenix, the Emperor, makes you believe that he really is a mean S.O.B, with a real evil look to boot.  Although I'd have to say the best performance given by any actor ever would be Al Pacino as the Great Tony Montana in Scarface.  Now, Scarface is my favorite movie of all time, and after that movie, few have been able to list as classics on my all-time list.  In order (1-5) my favorite movies of all time are: 1.  Scarface, (Al Pacino)  2.  Braveheart,(Mel Gibson) 3.  Gladiator,(Russell Crowe) 4.  Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, 5.  Juice, (Tupac Shakur). To put Gladiator into this position, in my opinion, is a testament to the movie, its makers, and its actors.  So in all, this is the best movie in years, and well worth buying as a permanent fixture in your collections.  Oh, and see if you can spot WWF's The Rock as one of the Gladiators.

1281762,5,B00003CXE6,"Not for a long time have we been spectators to an epic film... Gladiator brought us back into the realm of our past, and I loved it for that.  It brought us back to the tremendous Roman Empire, to the command of a General, fighting for his Ceasar, his Empire, his Rome... However, like always things take a turn for the worst, and the General is outcast by the Thrown's heir, mourns for loved ones past, forced into slavery and regains a sword to revenge, in the form of the crowd.  The story is a moving and stunning one, providing a good backbone to the film.
The backbone is supported with an incredible array of images and scenes, (for example the breathtaking flaming arrows flying high over the battle field, in the opening scene) with amazing special effects transporting us back into the world of Rome, the world of an Empire... its lavish and ornate theatres, games and lives.
Russell Crowe had caught my attention in 'L.A. Confidential', but secured it with this.  As the General, slave, and gladiator, Crowe stands his ground next to some true cinema legends, and I was impressed with his performance.  Joaquin Phoenix also delivers well, and brings our attention back to the whinny, creepish badies, thursty for power and unattained glory.  The British legends are drawn upon... with the likes of Richard Harris, as the aging Ceasar, who I'm pleased to see back on the big screen likewise with the late Oliver Reed, as the freed Gladiator, following a distinctive absence of their work.  To me this will always be Reed's film, and although not his finest hour (with contenders like The Three Musketeers), it is certainly up there with the best; Harris said that this would have revived Reed's career, he may have been right... I will always remember him for this, the crowd will remember.  Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner/Alien) adds a rung to his ladder with this masterpiece of cinema, reaffirming him as one of Britain's best directors.
The film can boast a multitude of awards under its belt, especially in regards to the Oscars, which I must admit being disappointed that it didn't carry away a few more...
The Gladiator DVD 2 disc, is among the top ten DVDs of all time, in terms of its picture and sound quality.  With superb extensive extras to match, the likes I have not seen since the DVD release of 'Bridge On The River Kwai'.

From a historical point of view, this movie drives me nuts. Being a historical buff on the Roman Empire, I can't help it. The historical accuracy of this movie ended with the short blurb of text that appeared on the screen in the beginning of the movie.

It is about a roman general who was about to become emporer when the emperor's son killed the emperor and attempts to kill Russel Crowe(The roman general Maximus) Maximus then becomes enslaved after his family is crusified. He becomes a gladiator for his owner Proximus and earns his way to the Collesium by defeating everone in his path. I won't tell you the rest. The movie has a good plot and keeps you on your toes. The battle scenes are great and so are the backstabbing liars in this movie. The battle scenes are also very gory and bloddy. Many people have their heads cut off and you can see their heads laying on the ground. So its a bit gross for your kids. The one thing I did not care for was some of the actors. I believe that some actors could have done a better part. Russel, old Caesar, and the slaves do well acting but some other actors do not. I watched this movie on VHS and its sound and picture was ok. Although watching this on DVD would be a lot better. This is another reason I rated it four stars. It was hard to hear and understand some conversations. All-in-all I would reccomend that you go and rent the movie first and than buy it because with this movie, you either hated it or you loved it. There was no middle.",988502400,,1297,4.233870967741935

When I sat down and watched this movie with my dad and brother (please don't crucify me for watching it on VHS)I was afraid the script wouldn't be all that great and it may be too bloody. But this film left me awestruck by its power. Its grand sense of dignity, honor and passion, from the great Ridley Scott made for great entertainment. The script by David Franzoni, William Nicholson and John Logan was excellent, using old poetic dialogue to readily convey the proper feelings (By the way, John Logan is writing the script for the next Star Trek movie, so I'm sure it will be great). Other pluses were the beautiful sets and costumes, the great cinematography and special effects, a grand, moving musical score and the fabulous performances of Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Djimon Honsou, Spencer Treat Clark and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe, whose brilliant performances highlited this film. I was very glad to see the movie win Oscars for Best Picture, Actor (Crowe), Costumes, Sound and Visual Effects, though I would have liked to see it win more. For anyone who likes action, drama, good dialogue, visual splendor and good characterizations, I highly reccomend this film. Strength and honor!",988329600,,1330,4.995495495495495

I've rarely seen a movie with a real budget that was more poorly written.  Every line made me wince.  And the historical inaccuracies are so widespread that it's really not possible to talk in any meaningful sense about this movie being a tale of ancient Rome.

1281940,4,B00003CXE6,"Okay, let's get the facts straight: GLADIATOR is a really good movie that had been very overhyped. The background of the film was specatcular, though I do think they went a little overboard with the setting, and the special effects/sound effects were amazing, too. After all, when my parents rented this video (they had turned up the volume, of course), I could hear the sound perfectly and clearly all the way upstairs in my closed bedroom! Talk about excellent sound effects.
The acting was pretty supurb, too. Especially Russell Crowe. And I think he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor. Well...it's actually kind of hard to tell (especially that ""affair"" he had with actress Meg Ryan!). The action is awesome, too. But some of the Oscars I don't believe this film should have won. Sometimes, I believe the only reason this film won all those Oscars was because it was so overhyped and it hit big in the box office. But flat out, good film and definitely one that shouldn't be missed. I really enjoyed it and it gives accurate historical events and the setting and costumes make you feel like you've actually traveled back in time during the Roman Empire.
Still, this film doesn't top my list of favorite films of 2000. Some of the other 2000 films that I enjoyed a lot more were ALMOST FAMOUS, BILLY ELLIOT, and CAST AWAY. It would probably be in my honorable mentions list. But GLADIATOR is definitely worth your money and you definitely have got to see this film!",988070400,,1467,4.689922480620155

Russel Crowe does such a superb job that I was quite happy when he won the Oscar for Best Actor. I really thought Ridley Scott would finally win an Oscar for Best Director, but again he gets the shaft. My friends come over all the time and this is the only movie they want to watch over and over. Of course this is more of a guy movie. My wife and her friends like it, but didn't love it. The second DVD has some really great deleted scenes that I thought should have been included.

1281942,4,B00003CXE6,"To my detrement I did not see this on the big screen where I think it must have looked spectacular! The gladiatorial combats are a treat. I think that this must be one of the best representations of what it must have felt like to be a gladiator at the Colloseum. It had a profound effect on me and I was thinking about it for ages afterwards. In the scene where the gladiators are waiting to enter the ring, you can really feel the fear of these poor souls. It is comparable to the first scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"" where you really get inside the fear of the soldierd aboard the landing craft. But, even though there is some gore, it is not as ""in your face"" as in ""Ryan"". I do have some complaints about it though. In one scene Maximus is in germany and in the next he is in Spain, having evaded capture and having ridden the same horse all that way! Also in the last fight scene, why should the general (I forget his name) suddenly tell his men to sheath their swords and let Comodus die, after all, he has betrayed Maximus throughout by not supporting him. it doesn't ring at all true. Also, I was sorry to see that Hollywoods original departure from history is stil the norm for gladiator films. The thumbs up/down thing to indicate whether you want a downed gladiator to live or die is actually THE OPPOSITE WAY ROUND! Thumbs down means SHEATH your sword. That is where the 4 stars comes in. It is interesting, though, that they used Derek Jakobi, star of the 70's multi part I Claudius. Maybe it was somewhat of a tribute to him. Also, most of the actors are English, which makes sense because, on the whole, English actors really ARE actors.  Some great filming though, and Ridley Scott's obsession with darkness and varying shades of orange is ever apparant. Worth seeing.",987984000,,1784,4.422492401215806

The story of a General's fall and rise to Arena champion in his pursuit of vengeance is powered by Russel Crowe's great performance and Ridley Scott's impressive direction.  This 2 Disc set does the film justice.  Another impressive effort from Dreamworks.
The video transfer presented in anamorphic widescreen is extremely impressive.  With vibrant colours to the bleak greys and blues of Rome this transfer never ceases to impress.  The opening battle is also complemented by the earthy tones present in the transfer giving the film a gritty and realistic look.
The sound on the DVD is extremely impressive.  The Dolby Digital track is very impressive.  The clarity is there and it makes an impressive use of the surrounds.  However the DTS-ES 6.1 Discrete soundtrack is amazing.  I consider it reference quality.  The sound is absolutely amazing.  If you have a DTS capable amplifier don't even bother with the Dolby Digital Track.
The extras are not as plentiful as some other DVDs on the market yet they are of very good quality.  The 3 documentaries are very interesting.  There is an extensive deleted scenes section.  As well as plenty of storyboards and trailers and TV Spots.  The Spencer Treat Clark journal is actually quite interesting so give it a read.  Lastly the commentary with Ridley Scott and the Cinematographer and Pietro Scalia is very interesting and entertaining.

The visuals of Rome and the Colluseum were breathtaking.  Russel Crowe...Best Actor 2000...he's the man.  Joaquin Phoenix SHOULD have won Best Supporting Actor...

Gladiator is an adrenaline rush from start to finish.  It's simply wonderful.

This movie's script is the perfect story and as far as the acting goes, Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were brilliant.  Crowe, well deserved his Oscar and Phoenix should have won ""Best Supporting Actor"" in my opinion.  By the closing scene of the movie I absolutely despised Phoenix, so his task as the evil emperor of Rome was succesfully completed.  The DVD itself is full of special features as a second disc is included with the feature disc to better contain all of the extra footage.

1282117,3,B00003CXE6,"The more I think about this movie, the more I think Ridley Scott deserves to be dope-slapped with a bloody sandal.  OK, for the record, I have seen both the DVD and the cinema version and I agree with all the technical praise heaped on the movie. Like Blade Runner (a much better all-round movie), the Matrix and Brazil this is another great mood-piece.
On the down side, this was a movie that had many many massive logical flaws in the plot, some of the dialog was dreck and the depiction of Roman society, Roman army weapons and tactics and Roman politics ""Gladiator"" offered was less accurate than Asterix the Gaul. Actually, that's an insult to Goscinny and Uderzo since they genuinely had affection for those times.
The following are my pet peeves: Why does it only take Maximus a few days to get from Germany to Spain on one horse?  Realistically it would have taken at least two weeks (no airbus in those days guys).  Why do the slavers take him to Morocco (Another long land trip, a sea journey and valuable water resources on the walk through the desert?)  Was that the only place in Ridley Scott's ancient world where you could sell an anonymous guy?  The list of annoying inconsistencies goes on but I will only bore you with a deconstruction of the now-famous battle scene at the beginning of the movie.
If you just wanted to watch a bunch of guys hack at each other in the mud, then the opening battle scene was great. As I said, it was beautifully filmed and produced, but why did the commander of the entire army place himself (with no staff, bodyguards or signallers) at the head of a cavalry unit which was supposed to outflank the enemy and attack downhill from the rear?  Hello? can any one say ""chain of command""?  Why did the Germans obediently line up on the edge of the wood so the Romans could mow them down with arrow-fire?  Germans were renowned for sneaking up on people through the woods and then ambushing the pursuit (e.g. the destruction of Quintillius Varus' three legions in Teutoberg Forest in 9 AD). Why did the Romans fire all those fire arrows and flaming siege-engine bolts at the Germans?  There was nothing to set fire to (no houses, defensive works etc).  Why did the Romans not follow standard battle practice and obliterate the first ranks of the Germans with their heavy javelins (pila) before the Germans closed?  The answer to all these questions is the crux of my complaint against ""Gladiator"" and why I think it only deserves three stars:
Historical accuracy and dramatic integrity were sacrificed at every turn so the movie would ""look good"".  This is OK if you are doing fantasy, or a NIKE commercial, it's even OK for dramatic licence if it aids the story, but the needless underlining and heavy-handed plot structure(Roman Army general, good, evil emperor, bad) totally reduced Gladiator from what it could have been (a thoughtful look at power, war and charisma) to a simple-minded WWF spectacle in Roman Drag.  Those ""Nubian"" charioteers were also extremely hokey and stupidly ""exotic"".

He took a role which could have been one-or-two-dimensional and from the moment we meet him, he encompasses everything Maximus is supposed to be: a leader, a fighter, a farmer, a man who loves his family, a man of honor,  and a spiritual man. It's so hard to actually put your finger on it, but his facial expressions and the way he delivers such lines as, ""what we do in life echoes in eternity"" and especially the speech where he states his name, ""loyal servant to the true emporer, Marcus Aurelis, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife,"" -- I defy anyone that hears Russell deliver that speech to not feel something. The music swells up, the crowd is cheering, the gladiators yell ""Maximus"". A definite favorite movie moment for me. I do think Gladiator an average story and it is; but Russell, and Russell alone, takes a film with some great filmmaking and lifts it up to a point where we feel we've seen a great film.  I really believe this would have been a summer blockbuster ignored by the Academy at the end of the year if it hadn't been for Russell Crowe. I do have a lot of respect for Tom Hanks and Ed Harris, but I must say I cheered when Russell took home the prize.

The film is in the tradition of the Count of Monte Cristo, Les Miserables with its human suffering, and Audie Murphy's story with its incredible courage in the face of the seemingly unconquerable odds.  It also gives a side of the Ancient Roman army that provides food for thought - it may well be that the army was more courageous than the politicians and their followers (does this seem to parallel modern times?) who misused it and sent it to fight their battles.  I also like the idea that you need to live in other people's shoes so to speak in order to understand them - the slavery of Rome looked very different when seen from the inside than from the outside.  The inconsistencies that some reviewers have noticed in the story seem to me less important than the consistencies and the similarities with our times.

The movie was too slow at times, like after the battle in the beginning. The whole time afterwards I couldn't wait for Maximus to become a gladiator because I heard so much about those Colesseum fights. Too much talking, and I really was not interested in the story at all. I do have to admit, the fight sequences were very well done, and the technique Ridley Scott used to give the film that look of quickness ( I don't know how to descibe it) works extremely well. Gladiator is nothing but an action movie. I really did not care for the characters, and it certainly did not deserve best picture.

The acting is superb, Crowe just eminates ""suffering talented guy"" and although he does nothing totally mindboggling he really does an overall fantastic job, better than any other this year. But the biggest surprise is Joaquin Phoenix. I'd never heard of him, as many people probably had never heard of him, till this movie. Then you leave saying ""who IS that guy?"". He's good everyone, and he makes you love him and really, really hate him. He emotes through entire movie, whether its hatred, lust, or this anonymous feeling that makes you pity him. Then there are the supporting characters that make this such an ensemble piece, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris, they all do their part and make is superb.
The cinematography is good;  the score has some high points and low points; the plot twists in a way that would make Shakespeare proud.
There are aspects of this movie that are new to the movie scene, such as some of the themes, acting styles, and plot twists, and overall it has this power to it that nearly blows you away. It sucks you in from the first scene and doesn't let go till the very last , very intense, scene of the movie .

A lot of people loved this movie and it's easy to see why:  an underdog lead character and loads of action.  I would have loved it too had it been as carefully crafted as Ben Hur.  However, it isn't, and the story is about as strong as wet tissue paper;  the sub-par story alone tries to support a new-era Hollywood epic and obviously turns to shreds.
The whole of the movie is filler with some action sequences to break the monotony:  There's the ""driving factor"" of Maximus trying to free the slaves and restore the glorious empire, but who really cares except for Maximus?  Not me, and probably not most people.  And don't forget the tacked on love story, which seems obligatory for any Hollywood movie these days.  The pure and simple truth is that, sadly, no extra care was taken to ensure this movie's claim to greatness.
When you put all these elements in a blender and hit ""puree"" you come up with a thick dark sludge that's as appetizing as raw liver, but which people will shell out money to taste nonetheless.

The Academy made one of their worst mistakes this year.  They gave Gladiator an oscar for Best picture, and it should have been given to Traffic.  And Russell Crowe won the award for Best Actor instead of Ed Harris for Pollock! ( the Academy was probably making up for when they didn't give Crowe an Oscar for ""The Insider"")  Ed Harris was excellent in Pollock, the story of Jackson Pollock a painter who was really crazy, and had a pretty bad life.  Traffic was so much better than Gladiator, it makes you wonder how the Academy sleeps at night.  Traffic is about the war on drugs.  I would tell you more about Traffic, but I want the film to intrigue you from beginning to end as it did me.

Upon Aurelius' death Commodus becomes emperor.  This is the point in the story where Maximus' livelihood takes a turn for the worse. The action scenes in Gladiator are outstanding.  The performances were Oscar caliber.  Russell Crowe has the best screen presence of any actor I've seen.  His academy award was well deserved.  Joaquin Phoenix was riveting as the scheming Commodus.

She pretty much hit the nail on the head.  KAWHAP!
I found this film to be good for its special effects and costumes and mediocre to above average in storyline.  The former for the costumes, wonderful renditions of the colosseum and city of Rome . . . but not so good story as there were a few plot holes.  I don't want to give anything away but look for these elements:
(1) the opening battle scene (anticlimatic);
(2) self absorbed Emperor Commodus who slowed down the pace of the story;
(3) overly slow flashbacks and dreams;
(4) atrocious Historical accuracy: there was an Emperor Commodus but he wasn't slain in the ring; one of his competitors had a wrestler slay him;
(5) one word gets out that a Roman general is alive, his troops tended to march upon any city to free him.  This was typical in Roman History when the leader was well loved as Maximus was . . .woops! . .. of course, we never hear much about it.
(6) If Commodus wanted to win the love of the people, there are better ways than matching swords with some ex general who hates your guts.
The GOOD PARTS OF THE FILM WERE:
(1) wonderful colosseum fights; kudos to the Battle of Carthage in the middle;
(2) Russel Crowe did a great job (anyone notice how surprised he looked to have gotten best actor in the AA?);
(3) wonderful cinematography of the city, colosseum, tigers and the seven hills of rome; the birds; the sunlight; etc
(4) great and realistic looking costumes; believable extras; and
(5) some pretty good backstory with the minor characters, as well as the main character.
While I don't feel this deserved best film, Hollywood has always had a soft spot for big epic pieces (look at TITANIC).",985910400,13,1819,4.466867469879518

The Visual Effects and sound, are the best ones I've seen and heard. It's not only a 12 oscar nominee and 5 oscar winner including Best Picture, it is the best epic movie ever made. You are taken to Rome, into the battles, the politics and the Coliseum. This DVD is simply one of the best. The DTS Surround Sound, (for those who have a DTS Surround Sound DVD), is awsome, the movie sound effects are so good, that when you combine it with them, you really hear every single movement of the sword, just like if you were a roman having fun in the Coliseum, and for those who don't have a DTS Surround Sound DVD, the Surround Sound is still excellent. But appart from the movie and the sound, this two DVD disc set gives you the Barbarian extras. The Commentary by Ridley Scott is worth of your time, and the HBO First Look Making Of, is more than interesting. But the parts I most enjoyed were the 25 minutes of Deleted Scenes and 7 minute montage of additional unused footage extras. Althogh the movie is not as deep as it could, Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent performance as the Cesar, and gives the sense of Politics in such a way, that you enjoy the story of power that comes between him and Maximus. The scene where Comodus confronts his father is amazing, and the Am I not Merciful? scene provides an amazing feeling of madness surrounding Comodus. The Batlle scene, the Coliseum scene and the City of Rome scene proves that Ridley Scott is one of the best directors ever.

But even after watching it (twice), I steadfastly stick to my conclusion that Gladiator is not a great movie...not even a good one.
Gladiator holds promise for a heroic story with a liberal dosing of medieval battles. In the end, I am left with a feeling that the film is a blatant retread of Braveheart and other more successful varieties of the ""hero fighting for freedom and revenge"" plot. Our hero, Maximus, spouts several turgid speeches that sound as if they were ripped directly from Braveheart, and his lack of emotional power render his recitations tepid and uninspiring. Maximus' forgettable dearth of emotionalized feeling when his family is mercilessly slaughtered is nauseating. Crowe's entire role is too halfhearted (he won Best Actor!?!?), helped little by the mimetic script. Don't even get me started on the implicit affection between Maximus and the emperor's sister, which was retch-inducingly contrived.
The battle scenes are ambitious in their orchestration, but ultimately they are filmed poorly thanks to erratic camera movement that forsake clarity or the exhilarating involvement of, say, Saving Private Ryan. Admittedly, the chariot battle is stunning, with its breathless sense of urgency that the filmmakers captured here. But why didn't they do it for the rest of the movie? It doesn't help that the different battles seem like disparate events unforgivingly adhered to an existing story line to add violent physical conflict. What Maximus is fighting for becomes unclear amidst the series of battles, which lack fiery emotional intensity that SHOULD be present when someone is fighting for freedom and revenege. One area that deserves accolade is the incredible sound. All around, you can hear arrows whiz by, the cacophony of clashing steel, and anguished screams. Very impressive!
And then comes the big kick in the face: the woeful anticlimax. I won't go into detail, but prepare to be disappointed. Suffice to say, Maximus becomes a martyr, but what did he accomplish? Bad, regurgitated speeches? Passionless action? Great work!
Gladiator may have been a better movie if it had been thirty minutes shorter, cut out the sordid insinuations of romance, and had more chariot battles. But when you're making a big Hollywood blockbuster, you've gotta have reams of dross to guarantee it sells.",985737600,5,2493,5.266331658291457

1282412,5,B00003CXE6,"A Roman epic, a Loyal Roman's Odyssey, a movie that makes you cheer and cry for the good guy.
A great and respected General, Maximus (Russell Crowe) helps Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the Roman Emperor, win another battle.  This battle was against the last enemy ""of the time"" to oppose Rome.  Marcus Aurelius, tired and old, is concerned for the future of Rome.  He decides that Rome's future would be better of it were run by a Senate instead of an Emperor.  He confides in Maximus and his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) that he is going to declare Maximus his successor to work with the Senate instead of making his heir apparent son, the Emperor.  Commodus kills his father before the announcement and, when Maximus will not pledge his allegiance to Commodus, has Maximus executed.  He also crucifies Maximus' wife and son, who Maximus loves dearly, but hasn't seen in almost three years.  Maximus narrowly survives the attempt on his life, but ends up a slave to an ex gladiator (Oliver Reed).  Commodus had admitted to his father that he is neither brave, respected, nor righteous, like Maximus, instead he exclaimed that he is ambitious, smart, and cunning. He knows his role as Emperor is tenuous at best, as many believe the senate should be the governing factor of Rome.  The gladiators are brought to Rome by Commodus as a ploy to entertain and thus gain allegiance of the people.  However Maximus the Gladiator ""known as the Spaniard"" gains the good will of all that watch the games.  Once Commodus finds out who the Spaniard really is, Maximus needs to be saved by his one time love Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) Commodus' sister, and a loyal Roman Senator.
While the sound track will not be on the top ten hits list, it works well with the story line and helps build suspense and mood.  The grandeur and reality of the landscape, especially the coliseum (albeit noticeably digitized) is noteworthy.  The script makes the characters and plot believable.  The acting of Crowe and Phoenix make it come to life with the help of director Ridley Scott (Hannibal, G.I Jane, Alien, Thelma and Louise, Blade Runner and Someone to Watch Over Me, to name a few).  Crowe, after making numerous movies involving Australia where his acting, looks, masculinity and horsemanship where propelling him to bigger and better roles in more recent films, such as LA Confidential and last years film The Insider.  Crowe leaves his suit coat and whistle blowing scientist role in The Insider to go back to the rugged look, which he can obviously play.  Crowe shows us his macho side in this movie, much as he did in LA confidential where he played a police detective that takes on the mob and dirty cops.  In contrast to his macho side is his sincere love for his wife and son, once you see him light the candles and hold the little wooden figurines of his family to help get through the time away from home, you can sympathize with him when they are killed.
While I am not a big fan of Phoenix, (The Yards, 8MM, Clay Pigeons, and To Die For) in this film he convinced me he was truly cruel and off of his rocker. Nielsen (Mission to Mars, Soldier, Devil's Advocate and Voyage) is beautiful, loyal, and convincingly sincere in her fear of her brother and in her love for Maximus.  Reed, who died during the production, stars in his final role after over two dozen movies since the early 1960s.  He played and looked the part of a retired Gladiator that shows the ""Spaniard"" how to win the crowd's favor.
When this movie came out I couldn't decide if I wanted to see it, so I asked someone who had.  My secretary, I'll just say she is over 50 years of age, ""said I loved it!  Russell Crowe's eyes are to die for!  You and your wife will both like it.""  I like action movies but my wife does not; yet we both enjoyed the movie very much.  We felt the battles, scenery, and roles played by the actors were very realistic.  This movie is not unlike Braveheart and The Patriot, both of which have there bloody scenes but they are offset by intensity and captivating roles of the characters.  The Gladiator, rated ""R"" due to the fact that it also has graphic violence and bloodletting as the war between the Germanic tribes and the Romans comes to life.  Of course the battles that the gladiators have also let a head or two roll.  Don't let this bit of realism scare you off, much of the veracity is subdued by the grandeur and speed at which it happens.  Beyond the blood, the acting is good, the scenery and the coliseum are beautiful, but can't be appreciated on TV like on the big screen.  The politics involved with running Rome at the time is realistic, much like today where politicians play one group against another to get their way and/or where they want to be.  The plot is well thought out, and the story moves along making the two and a half-hour movie seem much shorter.  It gets five stars.",985651200,4,4890,4.571100917431193

Commodus finds out about this, kills his father, takes control of the empire and orders Maximus to death.  Maximus escapes and ends up being sold as a slave.  Maximus' new master sees him as a gladiator and he is forced to fight in the arenas.  These fighting scenes are what make this movie so great.  They beautifully choreographed and the action is filled at a breakneck speed.  The fights are a bit gory and violent, but the violence is never gratuitous.  The technical wizardry of the day allows director Ridley Scott to recreate the Roman Coliseum in stunning detail.  Eventually Maximus and Commodus face each in the arena and the film comes to a surprising conclusion.  Mr. Crowe is superb as Maximus.  He has a commanding presence on the screen and he nicely balances the certain degree of pomposity and arrogance that the role requires with a subtly that make Maximus seem real.  The late Oliver Reed is great as the slave owner and Richard Harris has a fine cameo as the emperor.  As great as Mr. Crowe is, it is Joaquin Phoenix who steals the movie as Commodus.

Score: 87/100
When you make a movie about gladiator's, there is a good chance it's going to be great, since gladiator's are an easy premise to make a good movie out of. But there hasn't been an excellent movie about gladiator's in a long time. Well, Gladiator, probably 2000's most praised movie, is going to change the fact, this is actually better than excellent.
Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a powerful Roman general, loved by the people and the aging Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge.
Gladiator is tremendous filmmaking done in a superbly Old-Hollywood-Meets-New-Hollywood way, and although it's historically inaccurate, you won't really care because you'll be having so much fun. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both Oscar-worthy as General Maximus and Emperor Commodus, and both hold the screen with such pure force that you can't rip your eyes away from their terrific expressions and heartfelt emotions. Ridley Scott's direction is full of effort and should be praised, and the set decorations are terrific.

1282421,4,B00003CXE6,"The scenery and sets were magnificent ... The Coliseum and Forum, as related to their original models, were extremely well done.
In checking my historical references, some historical facts and people were not correct though ....  Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, born in 161, was emperor from 177-192 (15 years, becoming emperor when he was 16 years old - not reflected at all in the movie).  According to the texts, Commodus accompanied his father on the German campaigns and shared in the triumphs and victories.  After becoming emperor, he fancied himself as Hercules, even depicting him as Hercules on many of his coins, and frequently joined gladiatorial fights in the Coliseum.  He eventually became a megalomaniac and considered himself the reincarnation of the god Hercules.  He was actually assassinated on the night of Dec. 31, 192, by the Praetorian Prefect Laetus.  Upon his death, the Senate selected Pertinax as the next emperor, since the Aurelian dynasty was at an end.  The return of the Republic was never contemplated.  Annia Lucilla was actually one of the 13 children, of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger, and the sister of Commodus.  She was born in 149 and married to co-emperor Lucius Verus in 164.  After Verus death, she was re-married to a senator, Pompeianus.  My texts don't mention any children.  In 182, 10 years before Commodus death, she was implicated in a plot against Commodus and exiled to the island of Capri, where she was soon executed.  The movie never introduces and doesn't mention Bruttia Crispina, the wife of Commodus.  She was married to Commodus in 177, and was exiled the same as Lucilla, in 182.  She was executed in 183, nine years before Commodus' death.  It was a touching story and a good performance by the leading actor -- maybe he WILL get an OSCAR, but to a historian, the story is was a little confusing.  I guess if I went back and reviewed ""The Robe"", ""Quo Vadis"", ""Ben Hur"" etc., I would probably notice the same historical irregularities though.

The glories of ""Gladiator"" are superficial, but the principal players do turn in fine thespian performances.  No amount of good acting can conceal the limp plot structure and the basic  sensationalism of the director's ""artistic"" vision.  The premise of the film -- that a popular gladiator could become a contender for the throne of the Roman Empire -- is ludicrous and reveals a profound ignorance of reality.  The director's commentary explains how Ridley Scott and his crew avoided dealing with authentic history in order to make this picture.  To ""experts"" who point out that this or that never occurred, or could not have occurred owing to the nature of things in that era, the filmmaker's response is ""how do you know?  were you there?""  So they used ""logic"" to recreate Rome ""as it must necessarily have been.""  The logic here is that of the director, the script writer, the set designer... in two words, HOLLYWOOD LOGIC.
Where actual fact would interfere with the plot, the filmmakers chose to simply ignore the fact, as with the facts that Commodus ruled for over a decade, was not accused of murdering his father, had no erotic designs on his sister, fought in the arena over 700 times against men and wild beasts and styled himself ""The Roman Hercules.""  All the film takes from this interesting history (much more interesting than the formula melodrama that is ""Gladiator"") is the fact that Commodus liked attending the gladiatorial games, and the rest is simply swept under the rug.
I enjoyed ""Gladiator"" in the theater and despite what annoys me about the movie I actually enjoy every minute of it.  The story moves along rapidly, like a river breaking through a dam, and the sister of Commodus is unusually beautiful, i.e. not a cookie-cutter Hollywood bombshell.  The fight scenes are suitably convincing, though edited so aggressively that it's hard to follow who's hitting who and where the fighters stand in relation to one another in the arena.  The CGI work stands as a marvel of modern filmmaking.
The musical score is appropriate and really helps to energize the story.
Finally, the 2:30 running time is hardly noticeable; Scott & company must be doing something right to keep the film from seeming overly long.
If you want to learn something about Roman history, read some books (Edward Gibbon's ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" tells the story of Commodus -- it doesn't resemble ""Gladiator"" at all).  If you want a gory, expensive-looking action film in which the good guys win, ""Gladiator"" isn't a bad way to kill an evening.",985305600,,2778,4.920770877944325

Like alot of epic films that get nominated for Best Picture at the oscars, Gladiator is long and a bit boring.

1282553,2,B00003CXE6,"As reluctant as many people may be to admit it, this movie wouldn't have been made if it weren't for ""Conan"", not to mention Hollywood's earlier Roman extravaganzas ""Ben-Hur"", ""Spartacus"", and the others. The problem is that all the testosterone has been drained away: in our enlightened age, it won't do to have a man beat and hack the life out of another guy without getting the opportunity to show us his softer side.
As a ""revenge"" movie, it works on a pretty superficial level. There simply isn't enough background for the audience to identify all that deeply with Crowe's ""Maximus"" - his family dies off screen without us ever really seeing them, and frankly, I didn't think find him a sympathetic character anyway. The entire plot was contrived - I felt thoroughly manipulated: wind up Maximus and let him buzz through all those bad old gladiators on his way to his eventual (and totally inevitable, entirely predictable, and wholly inconsequental) fight with Commodus. Ho-hum. Top it all with a big Hollywood-style happy ending (""Rome the Republic&quot... ...It was over-the-top feel-goodism.
Crowe is pretty darned hammy, there's just no getting away from it. When he shouts to one audience, ""Do I entertain you?"", I wish they had shouted back ""NO, you hambone, bring in Commodus!"" But I guess he fills out a skirt nicely, so the ladies have something to look at. (There sure isn't anything for the guys, 'cause female lead Connie Nielsen, as Commodus' sister Lucilla, is draped chin-to-toe throughout, even when her brother is pawing at her.) Oliver Reed does well as the ex-gladiator running the team, but Richard Harris's Marcus was exhausted to the point of near incomprehensibility. And are we going to be stuck for the next decade with red-lipped, downy-cheeked little boys instead of kids who look like they actually play outside and skin their knees?
Digital tomfoolery. Feh. The opening scenes in Germania were simply awful. Totally inexcuseable. For crying out loud, when will the ninnies in Hollywood learn that only SNOW looks like SNOW? I guess it comes from never having seen the stuff themselves, but in this flick, you get feathers and down. That's right - feathers. It is SO obviously filmed through a blue filter on a bright sunny day with feathers drifting about that you wonder who's raiding the henhouse. (By the time the first 30 minutes was over, I wanted to take every filter in Ridley Scott's kit and make him eat them....) Look, at least TRY to film SOME stuff on location if you have a budget like that. But I forget - you're paying for auteur Scott and actors like Crowe and Reed and Phoenix and Harris, plus all the digital scenery - can't afford anything like realistic LOCATION shots. Hell, why bother - why not make it one big cartoon and leave ALL the real world behind? The rest (the Colosseum, Maximus' villa, Rome itself, etc.) - think ""Perfect Storm"". NOT convincing. You know, it would be preferable to have painted backdrops (which in effect is what we DO have, only digitally) with better shots of the actors than big screen-filling matte shots. Count me underwhelmed.
I didn't bother with all the extras. Go for it you want them - I just don't care enough when you have something SO self-important, over-hyped, and at it's heart hollow and shabby. No kidding - I think Ed Wood *cared* more about his movies than the folks associated with this bloated blintz.
SO - no sympathetic characters; hackneyed, trite, cliche-ridden plot; hokey digital effects; emotionally overwrought and JARRINGLY anachronistic soundtrack, plus a large dollop of 1990's-style political correctness, and you have the mediocre mush of ""Gladiator"".

1282665,4,B00003CXE6,"One has to hand it to Ridley Scott, it took some major balls to make a film like this. And the biggest surprise is that he actually pulled it off. And only Russell Crowe could have played a General turned Gladiator without a hint of vanity. If nothing else, Gladiator is simply a visual masterpiece -- overflowing with grand palaces, spectacular battles, fearsome gladiatorial contests, and a massive re-creation of ancient Rome that only an army of slave laborers or modern computer graphics could achieve. The story, concocted by a team of screenwriters including the literate William Nicholson, is pure potboiler. The great hero Maximus (Russell Crowe) is destroyed by a young, degenerate emperor called Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who slaughters the general's wife and child. Maximus escapes the blade but is enslaved, made a gladiator, and eventually returns to fight in the Roman Colosseum, where he will of course exact revenge on Commodus. The best parts of the script are the wry comments on the nature of ""entertainment"" and politics, and the way public opinion can be manipulated in either arena. This is a nice sardonic touch, although with millions of dollars on the line, Scott is busy rattling his own sword.
Gladiator's literary narrative is perfectly balanced by the strength of its visual style. Whether in squalid pits under the Colosseum or the blazing sun of its magnificently recreated battleground, the burnished light gives every composition a dazzling, painterly quality. Computer-enhanced shots of the virtual Roman landscape are full of detail, from the statuary and columns of the Forum to the retractable velarium sun roof over the freshly minted Colosseum. Ditto the actual interior sets where bedchambers and Imperial throne rooms sparkle with authenticity. There are a few cracks in the film's magnificent faade. John Mathieson's herky-jerky camerawork makes the otherwise masterful opening battle look like Saving Centurion Ryan, and a nonsensical moment where Maximus and Lucilla kiss seems to exist only to spice up the trailer. Scott makes a few other missteps - including too much Commodus/Lucilla dialogue, and failing to make Phoenix as menacing (a la Tim Roth's foppish swordsman in Rob Roy) as the film's final scenes require. But such complaints are mere quibbles. It may bear some flaws and familiar elements, but Gladiator's script is a great story well told, evading the clichs one might expect (facing your best friend in the ring, etc.) and staying completely one-liner free. Scott also adds spiritual resonance to Maximus' journey, elevating a simple quest for revenge to a Homeric search for inner peace via surreal dream sequences and subtle motifs. The most affecting symbol is the very first the audience sees - a gauntleted hand gently caressing a wheat field. Though initially inconsequential, by the film's end, this image becomes one of the more haunting in recent memory. Such touches give Gladiator a soul, placing the film in the lower pantheon of cinematic greatness.
And not that I place any importance on the Oscars (how could anyone?), but Gladiator, with its epic scope and execution, easily deserves the 'Best Picture' nod over the smug amd self-important 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.",984787200,3,3254,5.235632183908046
1282666,2,B00003CXE6,"I don't know what all the hooplah is with Gladiator. The fight scenes? COuldn't have been the fight scenes, the camera was shaky, much of the deaths were off screen, and, did I mention, the camera was shaky?
The story? Umm, seems to me just like your typical revenge type story strung together with the Gladiator battles to keep your attention along with some incest.
Ah, the lovely scenery. Nope, just bland dark muddy colours here. They don't reflect the theme much either, even good events take place in front of hideous backdrops.
Maybe, Russel Crowe's acting. Some of his lines are compelling, while others are bleak, empty and hollow.
I nearly fell asleep between action scenes, which ultimately diminished into hand to hand battle. I didn't care how the movie ended, all I cared about was when. I yearned for another battle like the chariot one, but it never came. I yearned to see an umpredictable ending, but didn't. This movie failed to deliver in almost every category.
But it did have an ample amount of gore...is that why people liked it? Blood may keep some people held, and blind them from a boring story and 1 dimensional characters, but not me.",984700800,10,1161,4.724137931034483
1282667,4,B00003CXE6,"As much as I love the opening battle sequence of ""Gladiator,"" the jerky camera movements and strobe-like appearence made me dizzy to the point of almost falling out of my chair. Blood and guts are strewn across the screen like confetti on the first day of the millennium and right in the middle of it is one of the more compelling (and depressing) characters of the year 2000. Russell Crowe is one of the best things about the movie ""Gladiator,"" because with all of its spectacle and grand battle sequences, it lacks in the dramatic sense and its special effects are so video game-ish at times, I thought I was watching a medieval version of ""Final Fantasy VII."" Some of the sequences involving the colosseum are so see-through and fuzzy that I was tempted to laugh, but the truth of the matter is, a movie like this isn't measured on the quality of its visual effects and dramatic highpoints (it actually does have a few). A film like ""Gladiator"" is graded on the superb nature of its art direction, cinematography, battle sequences, the courageousness of its hero, and the length of the venomous fangs of its villain. On those levels, it succeeds as well as any Roman epic ever made. Russell Crowe does make the perfect hero, and Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Commodus. The dramatic highpoints, which we always know are coming, but the payoff is worth the wait, are very well written. The battle sequences are plentiful, and when they don't look like they were shot with strobe-vision, they are extremely intense. The art direction is fabulous. We are actually stepping back in time with this film. It looks and feels real as we watch it, despite the bad special effects. And of course, a film like this, on such a grand scale, needs a director who has directed many influential films over the years. ""Gladiator"" has Ridley Scott, who has directed such films as the 1979 sci-fi horror epic ""Alien,"" which was only surpassed by James Cameron dynamically intense ""Aliens."" He has also directed ""Blade Runner"" and ""Thelma and Louise."" There are more, but these are the true heavy hitters.
The basic plotline of ""Gladiator"" is Rocky on a series of downer narcotics. Russell Crowe is the leader of the Roman armies, General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is the ""father to a murdered son, husband to the murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance in this life or the next."" (Those lines are delivered with such power that I slammed my fist down with a ""hell yeah"" in the theater) And it is true, Maximus was betrayed by the newly crowned Emperor Commodus, after Commodus killed the rightful leader of Rome, his own father, Marcus Aurelius, the last of the good emperors. Commodus is one sick puppy. He kills his father to make sure Maximus does not take the throne from him, which was the wish of the dying Aurelius, plans to take his sister as his queen (yuck), and instead of dealing with the plague proposes a series of games to keep the people of Rome occupied. (""He'll give them death, and they'll love him for it."") Commodus has it all worked out, until the supposedly dead Maximus removes his helmet and announces his resurrection to the entire empire. Commodus thinks he can deal with this by arranging a series of unfair fights that he believes will end up with Maximus as the loser - meaning dead. But Maximus isn't so easily taken down. He can fight. OH MAN, CAN HE FIGHT! The plotline moves like a convential fight movie, with the scarred hero and the fiendish villain, and we know that by the end of the movie, Maximus and Commodus will fight. This much goes without saying, but ""Gladiator"" does have its fair share of surprises, and those pleasant events make the movie worth watching.
""Gladiator"" doesn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar, that honor, I believe, belongs to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but it is truly heroic filmmaking of the highest calibur. I just would've liked to see something with better visuals and a better handled sense of drama. Not that I'm knocking ""Gladiator"" for its faults (I own the movie).

It shifted from good action sequences (although they were over edited to almost incomprehensibility on the big screen....again better on the DVD) to lifeless passages outside the arena.  Russel Crowe, as usual, was very good.  Joaquin Phoenix was a joke (and I don't give a damn if he was nominated for an Oscar).  The story became more ridiculous as it went along...that an emperor of Rome would allow a man sworn to kill him to live for 10 minutes past discovering his identity was laughable.  And wound up with this Hollywood clap-trap ending where all the Romans are going to join hands and march into the sunset and restore ""The Republic"".  This is junk writing and popular hooey. So, I give it the good rating for action & production values and a good cast giving okay performances.

It is a well thought-out action movie (yes, it really is technically an action movie, as one would say Fugitive is an action movie) with great acting (particularly from Jaoquin Pheonix), add an honor theme, great scenes, and a thrilling plot, and you get a movie that feels like an epic and is a wee bit more than  an ""action movie.""  As I'd say, and lots of Hong Kong movies realize this, action shouldn't feel like action more than an extension of character, which I think works here.  Movie sure seem to know how to make the Maximus character seem heroic. As for the DVD itself, I'd have to say this is a very excellently composed DVD.  It has lots of great extras such as extra videos and interviews and storyboards.  The audio and video quality is quite excellent.

I must admit, however, that my favorite part of the DVD experience is all of the extra material on special editions.  When I watch a DVD that has no featurette, no outakes, no deleted scenes, no interviews, I think to myself ""What's the point of putting the movie on DVD?""  With that said, Gladiator is one of the best DVD's I have viewed.  I purchased the DVD for the movie, not knowing what kind of extras were on it, and I was very pleased with the product.  I am a music fan, so I enjoyed the focus on the music on the second disc.  There are a couple of deleted scenes with the late Oliver Reed that are worth watching.  There is so much on the DVD, that I have not yet been able to see all of the extras, which makes me anticipate the next time that I am able to watch it.

The part of Ceaser's Death almost made me fall sleep not to mention I still don't get it. And after Ceaser died the story is only about a man fighting well as a gladiator-which is very predictable.

I didn't care too much for the always-weeping sister to the antagonist, but that's just a minor problem.

1282775,5,B00003CXE6,"When I first heard that Russel Crowe was playing a gladiator in his new movie,I was a bit disappointed because I didn't think it would be anything original,and that he only did it for the money it would bring. Obviously I was wrong..
Probably this movie will for a long time be compared with Braveheart,since both are epic movies about historical heroes,but I don't think it is fair to say that the Gladiator imitates Braveheart.
It's the story of a Roman general,Maximus,who is very much appreciated and loved by both his soldiers and the emperor. The emperor's son though,doesn't share those feelings and when he learns that the emperor likes Maximus to replace him,instead of his son,he decides to get rid of both Maximus and his family. Maximus manages to escape,but can not save his son and wife from death. He is capured by the merchants and is sold to a gladitator trainer. From then on,it is :""the general who became a slave.the slave who became a gladiator. And the gladiator who defied an empire.""
Russel Crowe is amazing. He adds so much to the character he is playing,an ideal human figure,a Roman soldier who is all about honor. Joaquin Phoenix is also veru successfull in the role of the villain,so to speak. The music is also great,I highly recommend the soundtrack.
There is no reason not to like this movie. Although the level of gore is a bit high,it is inevitable I guess for a movie about gladiators.
The dvd extras were very good,and the picture and sound quality are among the best I have ever experienced.

One of the strongest attributes to the movie, besides the character of Russell Crowe, is the cinematography. Ridley Scott is a master at creating a unique ambience. The DTS track is especially powerful for those with Home theater and makes the movie seem that much more dramatic.

I had to turn it off half way through to take a break before returning to the tripe.  I was hoping that somewhere along the line it would get better. The only saving grace of this movie was Joaquin Phoenix.  Russel Crowe's couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.  Only epic movie I have seen where I actually was hoping someone would kill the ""hero"" and put me out of my misery. With all the money that was spent on the movie I would have thought the computer generation would have at least been good, but even that was poor - the scene with the tigers was comical.  As for the historical inaccuracies, using archers or saddles is minor, but a complete distortion of historical fact takes creative license too far.  Did Scott bother to read any Roman hisory at all?  First Aurelius - what the hell was Richard Harris doing in this movie - was not killed by his son Commodus, Aurelius had made Commodus co-emperor several years before he died, Commodus had his sister Lucilla executed after a failed assination attempt, and Commodus was strangled while taking a bath after a failed poisoning attempt by his mistress.  The most amusing thing about the film was that with all the British, Irish, and Australian accents I started to think that the British Empire started long before it actually did.

First, the film is reasonably compelling and is certainly well-acted.  But I suspect most of us have seen the film.  Thus, what exactly is offered in addition to that?
There is a grand making-of documentary that shows how the action and CGI are melded together, what influences went into the script and set design, how set and shots were conceived, and what the director was seeking to accomplish.
There is also an incredibly interesting (perhaps since I'm a former music major) documentary on the composer, how he goes about creating films scores and the Gladiator score in particular, how the concepts of the film influence what he wants his music to communicate and how he managed to recruit a couple of hard-to-locate musicians for the pieces.
There are tons of other extras as well: Deleted scenes with optional commentary, a hour long documentary (actually educational!) about the real Roman gladiators, production notes (a very interesting read--it all started with a painting!), etc.
Not only is this a fun (not great; very good but not great) movie, you'll get the satisfaction of truly getting a sense for the whole creative process behind the film.",983318400,3,1283,4.985981308411215

Cliche after cliche - horrible acting - every scene stolen from another film or 19th century painting - every storyline stolen from every salacious thing you ever read about Roman History.

1282861,5,B00003CXE6,"As I'm writing this Gladiator's nominated for twelve Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and already critics are crying foul.  This from a movie that upon it's May release opened to three and four star reviews across the board (or at least for the most part anyway).  I assume the reasoning behind this is that a movie with such commerical appeal can't possibily be the best picture of the year.  And while I favor Traffic to walk away with the top prize, Gladiator would be a more than worthy recipient.*  It would be especially refreshing given the Miramax stranglehold that's pushed such mediocre films as The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love to Oscar status.  I'm not saying this movie's not without it's faults, just that in the context of an epic of this size they're so miniscule that they seem almost nonexistent.
Russell Crowe, fresh off his career best performance in The Isider, stars as Maximus, a Roman general whose influence over his men threatens the ascension to the throne of emperor-in-waiting, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).  So Commodus does the natural thing, in Roman times anyway, killing his father and sending Maximus out to pasture to be killed as well.  But Maximus escapes death only to discover his family slain and himself confound to slavery.  After his capture he's sold to an ex-gladiator in search of fresh meat to be wrung through the proverbial shredder.  And upon their intial battle Maximus, known as ""The Spaniard"" to his fellow slaves, shows that he has some life.  He and a handful of others scathe off death merely to find themselves fighting for their lives once again, this time in front of a blood thirsty crowd at the Roman Coliseum.
Motivating him is the opportunity to stand in front of the emperor and claim vengeance in his family's name.  Standing in his way ia an ex-flame (Connie Nielsen) who also happens to be the emperor's sister.  She persuades him to use his celebrity (as gladiator's were in those days) to attempt to root out the corruption in the Senate and turn the reins of power back over to the people in the form of a Republic.  Grand aspirations for a general turned slave turned gladiator, but Crowe's magnetic, larger-than-life performance sells us on the plausibility.
It's true, this is a sword and scandal picture and it's violent themes are undeniable but to liken it to the World Wrestling Federation (as one particularly highly regarded critic did) is asinine.  It's story is just as strong as it's action, which is at times so dizzying that it seems more graphic than it actually is.  The characters are strong, independent and propel the plot.  This is not a popcorn flick or a guilty pleasure that you should feel embarrassed for liking.  It's a profound film with subtle, meaningful messages that can at times be overlooked because of all the eye-candy congesting the screen.
This is a recurring theme for Ridley Scott, whose film credits include Alien and Hannibal.  But in Gladiator he's found his most mature material to date and, besides, it's kind of hard to hold that against him when you see the grandeur of the world in which he's created, and in which we inhabit for it's two and a half hour running time.
Still, despite it's length, it breezes by faster than many of the ninety minute dogs we've been subjected to over the summer of 2000.  Now admittedly it was a bad year for movies, but that's not to suggest Gladiator wins by default.  It's a superlative achievement and I'm sure it would have been recognized as such in any year, no matter how competitive.
I can only hope that this is a start of a promising trend in Hollywood, a substance-based summer blockbuster that can connect with it's audience without having to skimp on the plot.

This seemingly endless film gets two stars only for the presence of the late great Oliver Reed (who has played much better roles), and decent costumes and fighting sequences.
Gladiator tries to be a Ben-Hur or a Spartacus but instead succeeds in being only boring and laughable.
Comodorus's character was particularly inane, and it is impossible to believe that all those soldiers couldn't bring down Maximus-great soldier or not.
The film's plot, if you can call it that, is totally uninvolving. I found myself completely uninterested in the plight of Maximus, and the killing of Maximus's son and wife was just predictable and lame.
I kept checking my watch to see how many more interminable minutes were left. Avoid at all costs, if entertainment is your aim. If you enjoy plotless films with lots of fighting and strange incest subplots by all means pick it up.",983059200,2,973,5.006172839506172

1282926,5,B00003CXE6,"Goodbye, to another hard hit-negative review. Here is the revision of a review written months ago. Gladiator is a delivery of a story told in the form of many movies, but not in character. Maximus is a man troubled with loves past and desires nothing but to go home once the barbarians are destroyed. Before granting his wish the Emporer asks him to take rule of Rome, Leaving his own son without a throne. Joaquin Pheonix plays a terrific sadistic maniac that would do anything to claim the throne, even kill his own father. What starts out as a terrific victory, Gladiator follows Maximus' decent from the heights of high protector of Rome, to a slave in chains. Gladiator was the #1 movie of 2000 at the box office, which shows that many people were drawn to the story. Many viewings later on my own dvd, I say it is a good movie. Catch the scene when Maximus prays to God. We need more scenes of humility like that in todays cinema.",982886400,,936,4.4476744186046515
1282927,4,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is a good movie (although not as great as some would have you believe), and I highly recommend it.  However, I take issue with the idea that it is at all historically accurate.
In reference to Trevor Cook's review (see below), there is little actual history in this movie.  Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor who died in the beginning of the movie, did not die at the hands of his son, Commodus.  Rather, he caught a dangerous infection (possibly plague) and died at his camp at Vindobona (Vienna).  And the Emperor had named his son Commodus his heir several years before that.
It is not known if Commodus went mad.  However, he was known for his cruelty and he did fall victim to his physical vices.  He often appeared in staged lion and tiger hunts in the Coliseum, where he liked to call himself Hercules.
Because he enraged many of Rome's senators, they tried to assassinate him with the help of his sister, Lucilla.  But the plot failed.  Commodus naturally became paranoid and therefore launched a campaign of terror against his enemies.  Eventually, an assassination attempt against him was successful, and he was strangled in his bath (and not, as the reviewer below would have you believe, in battle as a gladiator).
So, while Gladiator is a good movie and I have nothing against it, do not mistake it for history.  It is a fictional account based on historical people.  Nothing more and nothing less.",982800000,,1421,4.735772357723577

1282929,3,B00003CXE6,"there are many pluses to this 2-disk set. the entire second disk is full of extras, like behind the scenes featurettes, the making of, etc. the sound is crisp as is the movie. i absolutely agree that the recreation of the Coliseum is very impressive and Ridley Scott, as he's done so often, conveys a seemless sense of style and scale. the battle sequence with the volleys of fire arrows was exceptional.
i agree with some of the other reviewers that if this were strictly an action flick, i would probably rate it five stars but with the stigma of a picture of the year, i find it overrated; the story is a bit abreviated and disjointed. perhaps it's nitpicking but there is a real lack of motivation in the Russell Crowe's character: why does he fight? in fact, there is more compelling reason for him NOT to go on.
'I will always serve Rome' -- well, not really. we're not given any vision of Rome except maybe for Marcus' but that was to give Rome back to the people. well, wasn't Commodus on his way to getting the mob to come around with the games? it is really unclear how badly Commodus would have ruled (there is no benchmark left by Marcus to judge) except for that one insensitive remark about the Greek quarters and that he brought back the games (ok, regicide/patricide is bad). wasn't Marcus worse by his conquests of 'barbarians' and taking over them?! Rome is the light? maybe but i'm sure the 'barbarians' would disagree. only the victors write histories.
'Let me go home' -- even more reason for him not to fight. staying alive meant being apart from his family. there is no home for him among the living. sure, revenge is an issue but was that a realistic thought in the beginning?
for me what kept him alive was his loyality to Marcus and his need to be able to return home. both were taken early on. he decision not to fight initially as a slave was consistent; the crowd doesn't even motivate him (killing everyone in record time and screaming 'Is this what you want?!' and throwing the sword away in disgust.)
finally, the duel at the end was trite... Maximus winning despite being injured and drugged. i have a lot of problem with this, as the feeling throughout the movie was that he will never lose a fight and therefore there was no suspense or expectation. Maximus was barely hit by Commodus despite the fact that early on we see Commodus training and being quite good. (a better executed duel was the way Rob Roy ended -- it was in doubt and he won only in a desparate manner).
i don't hate this film; it is a good movie but just not exceptional. the extras on the disks and the cinemtagraphy makes it worthwhile but i couldn't seriously give this five stars.",982713600,2,2688,4.4765784114052956

1282931,5,B00003CXE6,"Based loosley around the film 'Fall of the Roman Empire', 'Gladiator' is a brilliant epic from director Ridley Scott, bringing the glory and bloodshed of ancient Rome back beautifully. Whether its the gorgeous visual effects, moving story and music, gritty battle sequences, or superb acting that gets you, one thing is for certain: Gladiator is an epic adventure, worthy of all its hype.
Russell Crowe's explodes into the spotlight with his role of Maximus, the greatest soldier and general in the Roman army.  When Marcus Aurelias is murdered by his son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the role of the 'evil' emperor to its limit), Maximus is sentenced to death.  His family is murdered, and he barely escapes execution with his life.  He is picked up, sick and weak, by slavers, where he travels to Africa and becomes a gladiator.  With the help of his new found friends, Maximus eventually rises to Rome, where in the Coliseum, he prepares to take his revenge on Commodus, and free Rome and his once lost love, Lucilla (Connie Nielson).
The story itself is beautifully crafted around actual historical events.  For example, Marcus Aurelias was murdered by his son Commodus.  Commodus did go mad.  Commodus did fight in the gladiatorial battles of the coliseum.  and Commodus was killed in combat by a gladiator.  By using these true events to act as connection points, the story flows together, with love and war and revenge all into one.  The music, by composer Hans Zimmer, is absolutely outstanding, though the Celtic feel of it sometimes seems out of place.  The special effects are impressive; never before have we seen Rome or the Coliseum like this.  And acting is excellent from all.
The movie is not perfect.  There are minor plot errors, as well as historical aspects that are fictional (the Roman army did not have archers at that point in time; Roman swords were meant only for stabbing; Romans did not have saddles on their horses).  But these are minor in the grand scene.  And grand it is.  Gladiator is by far one of the best movies to come out in quite a while.  It easily ranks up with BraveHeart, El Cid, and other historical epics, and deserves every award it has gotten and will get.  Don't miss this one.",982713600,10,2236,4.793733681462141

1283015,5,B00003CXE6,"Don't be distracted by the nanny school of movie critics; this movie will take your breath away.  Gladiator has it all (well, not quite--there's no sex):  a truly powerful--and appealing--lead performance by Russell Crowe, stunning cinematography, the superbly paced direction that made Ridley Scott famous, and a moving soundtrack.
Crowe's brute magnetism powers Maximus, a heroic figure that Crowe manages to make entirely believable.  The supporting actors are strong as well, particularly Connie Nielson (although she does hit one slightly off note at the end of the movie).
Folks, this movie is BIG; it's ambitious, and it succeeds.  Gladiator isn't quite perfect: the special visual effects are a mixed bag, some fabulous, a few slightly hokey, and the performances from Oliver Reed and Joachin Phoenix, though generally impressive, are just a bit over the top.  The necessities of keeping the movie a reasonable length (it ended up at about 2:20) meant the deletion of some scenes whose absence hurt the plot line.  (You can see many of the deleted scenes on Disc II of the DVD set, and I think most of us would have elected to keep most of them in, even if it meant a 3 hour movie.)  But the movie's strengths dwarf its few weakness, and the overall effect is undeniably powerful.
Most movie critics are cynics, which predisposes them to dislike heroic epics.  Gladiator is not cynical; Crowe's Maximus, like the real-life Maximus described by Marcus Aurelius in ""The Meditations,"" is an example of strength, courage, and honor.  Still, the propulsive force of Gladiator is so potent, it managed to win over a substantial body of critics.
Note to parents:  while I strongly recommend this movie to those mature enough for it (and it includes neither sex nor profanity, for those who care about such things), its violence will frighten young children.",982368000,,1858,5.042483660130719

Well I have it now, and have probably watched it 15+ times.  The acting is very good for an epic-action movie, and the special effects of Rome are surrealistic.  You don't have to be a fan of Ancient Rome to enjoy this movie, in fact students of Med civilizations may chafe at the idea of a Roman General turning Slave to Gladiator to killing the Emperor.  This movie makes that idea work though.
The drama between characters is thick enough to cut with a knife. To my immense surprise Joachim Phoenix played the part of Commodus to perfection...His contribution to the movie surpassed any of the other actors/actresses in my opinion.
I would recommend this movie to anyone, and if you have a good surround system it's all the better, the musical score blends very well with the action, and the drama.  The cinematography has been very well done, especially the scene where Commodus is riding into Rome for the first time to the Senate building...the use of a slightly blue filter adds to the effect so well.

If it comes down to talent, I must say Phoenix did a wonderful job and he is a much much better actor than his brother ever was. I think Hollywood should keep an eye on this man ~~ he is talented. Between the two of them, I can see why they took over the world by a storm. One classically noble and one pathologically weak.

I have to agree that the movie thrived on violence what with the war at the start of the film & the games at the Coliseum, but it also reeked of reality & had some few good lessons to learn.  It glaringly pointed out on man's greed for power, the dirtiness of politics, the blind obedience of the army, man's refuge in entertainment to forget their own dismal existence even for short a time.  But it also gave hope to people knowing that there are still a few good men out there with unquestionable dignity, a true leader, living with principles, honor & justice.
I'll always remember Maximus' line re ""Stay with me.  If you see yourself walking alone in an open field, don't worry, you're already dead!""  This may sound too morbid but it also shows you a part of his character.  An encouraging & suportive general to his followers, a person who manages to exhibit humor at the scariest time of their life, a person who gives you hope to stay together & see the worst through.

Joaquin Phoenix also gives a powerful performance as the corrupted Ceasar of the Roman Empire.

1283272,4,B00003CXE6,"Russel Crowe is Maximus, the Spanish-born General who has brought the Roman empire its final victory against the barbarians. Now with Roman rule stretching out across the world, and knowing of Ceaser Marcus Aurelius' desire to return the rule of gov't to the Roman Senate, Maximus seeks only to return to his family. Everybody has other plans however. Corrupt Senators who prefer the old way, and the emperor's amoral son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), want the popular general to support their plans for Empire, while the sage Aurelius (Richard Harris) tags Maximus to head an interim government with the aim of restoring the supremacy of senatorial rule. Dispatching his father and naming himself Ceasar, the evil Commodus orders the deaths of Maximus and his family. Escaping, Maximus reaches his family in time to witness their brutal murders at the hand of Roman soldiers, before he is enslaved and sold to Proximo (Oliver Reed). Once a gladiator, Proximo now trains other slaves to fight in the crumbling arenas of the empire's fringe-provinces. Not revealing his identity at first, Maximus bides his time, knowing he will eventually reach Rome and revenge himself. Distinguishing himself in the arena (he brings teamwork to the other gladiators who are supposed to fight for themselves), Maximus has his wish and returns to Rome where he gives Ceaser Commodus a rude shock. Winning the hearts of the Romans (if spectators of the brutal games can be said to have any heart), Maximus becomes a larger figure in Roman society as a slave than a general, looming larger than the emperor himself. Becoming desperate as his subjects begin to idolize the gladiator, the ever grim and demented emperor resorts to ever more severe measures to undermine the ex-general both within and without the coliseum.
I didn't want to see ""Gladiator"", but Russell Crowe and Director Ridley Scott won me over. While Scott gets a lot of mileage out if his charachters, none of whom are really defined, it's his vision of the Empire (c. 180) that makes the film. Sure we know it's all CGI, but Scott's trademark touches (smoky light, bustling crowds, and constantly having something - whether smoke, garlands, rolls of bread or snowdrifts) create an ambient setting that is either cold, or hot, dry and sandy or swampy, but lways enveloping. Like the spanish general, Russel Crowe conquers the film as the brooding Maximus, the husband of a murdered wife, father of a murdered son and redeemer of the enslaved empire of Rome.",981331200,,2505,5.009592326139089

First of all, this movie is pretty gory.  Most of it happens so quick that you won't have time to look away, though, so it's not that hard to take.  But make sure you tell the kiddies to go play with their barbies or something.  This will scare the wee ones out of their wits.  They'll cry to you hours into the night, you won't get ANY sleep. and your day will be lousier.
The best part of the movie is how it truly captures the terror of being a gladiator.  That must've been a horrible job.  But those are also the most gory parts, so be warned.
I though the movie overall was a good experience.  I was satisfied when it ended, but I wasn't all that emotionally touched.  Just satisfied, basically.  Also, the movie is sort of long, which I felt it was just so it could say it was ""an epic.""

I even almost forgave that dog Crowe for messing around with a married woman (believe me Dennis, you're better off without her).  Crowe is close to perfect in the title role (if a bit flabby - Arnold would have been too big).  Richard Harris makes even over acting look good.  And Oliver Reed is a joy to watch.

1283504,5,B00003CXE6,"""Gladiator"" is a film that should suit all tastes. It is an expertly mounted and eye-filling event; the blood and gore, delivered in split-second imagery (allowing your head to fill in the rest) should satisfy the most blood-thirsty movie goer; and the story is a superb tale of good vs. evil, power vs. honor, and ""Might for Right"". I was reminded of ""Camelot"" many times during this film, especially by the almost unrecognizable appearance of Richard Harris as the wise and noble Marcus Aurelis. Joaquin Phoenix gives a bone-chilling performance as the evil and cowardly Commodus, who inherits the title of emperor upon his father's death. But the sole weight of this overwhelming piece rests on the shoulders of the magnificent Russell Crowe. If one doesn't believe in him, then one doesn't believe in this epic costume drama. Kudos to the rest of the cast as well, and hand over heart for the late Oliver Reed. But back to Crowe--he is an actor to contend with.  His work in ""Gladiator"" is a tour de force performance; he very nearly sprays testosterone from the screen. It's what was exactly demanded from him in this role, and he exceeds expectations in that regard.",980640000,,1172,4.830845771144278

From a happy, loving father who only wants to return to his son and wife, to a gladiator bent on getting his just revenge. Seeing a general who has just one a huge battle cry at the burned bodies of his wife and son is particularly jolting. How can any sentimental person not like him after seeing him cry? From the actions scenes with sword and tigers to the visual affects of the coliseum to Russell in a skirt, this movie is pure eye candy. One of my favorite details is the use of rose petals throughout the movie.

1283507,4,B00003CXE6,"Action!  Action!  Action!  That sums up this thrilling movie.
The opening battle scene sets the stage for this intense film.  It grabs your interest and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film.
Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a once-wronged soldier now fighting for justice.  Ancient Rome was nicely replicated in this film, as I truly felt like I was one of the townspeople during the movie.  The background setting and props used were fantastic, and they all added to the overall feel of the movie.
Crowe was exceptional.  Not only did he look the part, but his acting was wonderful in this role.  Joaquin Phoenix was downright scary in his excellent role.  His evil, incest-loving character was portrayed perfectly, and frankly he made me hate him, so he did his job well.  You could feel the intensity between the two every time that they were on the screen together.
The plot was a little shaky at parts, but it flowed rather nicely during the the long film.  Throw in an amazing musical score by Hans Zimmer, and you have one complete film.  The fighting scenes alone are worth the price of the video.  These exciting scenes are tremendous and you won't be able to stop yourself from cheering Maximus along.
This film is exciting, action-packed, and yes, it is quite graphic.  However, the thrill more than makes up for the gory details.  Gladiatior will not disappoint.",980553600,,1395,4.754166666666666
1283508,4,B00003CXE6,"The recent dramatic epic ""Gladiator"" has already won two golden globe awards for it's stellar impact on the public. The idea of the plot seems to be an age-old one: a rags to riches biographical look at an innocent civilian who wakes up every day feeling very grateful to have that day. Named Maximus, he is nothing but one of the hundred slaves being held captive in a dome in Rome, forced to face bloodthirsty ravenous beasts topped off by tyrants swinging massive, sharp ""spikeballs""(?), with only a common, everyday sword and shield supplied to him for protection.
Russell Crowe's character, Maximus, fully understands the danger that he is facing, but the stage isn't set for the product of what a warrior Maximus was. His appearance was a very quiet and unrelinquished one, he wasn't the sort of fighter who would talk and then try to walk, contrary to all of the other individuals who were faced with the same dangerous predicament and were killed off within an instant. He was afraid; he just didn't show it because, unlike other slaves, he knew that it did no help to show he was afraid. It was one man for himself; it was not a team effort. For this reason, Maximus not only was a physical gladiator, but he was a rare mental genius. This wasn't technically addressed in the movie: that he used brainpower to pull himself through what he did and not just reaction. Maximus soon gave himself an appearance that distinguished him from others after defeating some ten humans and several large cats. Once this happened and he was in the spotlight, he did not want to be any more well-known than he already was. Even when the emperor demanded that he identify himself, he hesitated.
Because of this, a tension builds between the emperor and Maximus, the fans beginning to favor Maximus' side more than the emperors for a change and even more emotion is thrown onto the shoulders of Russell Crowe. As he battles and battles for his life, no one is able to stop him and he becomes what Doug Weight is to professional hockey: feared and respected. Eventually, the emperor himself decides that he has had enough with Maximus and he decides to battle him to the death in a gripping and close fought dual.
Russell Crowe's performance seemed to be very ""Oscar-worthy"", showing a significant amount of emotion and feeling in his role as the gladiator that overcame all odds that were set against him. The battles in the movie settled out to be very intricate, where one mistake could and usually did cost you your life. In the dome, where lions were an added element, it was particularly entertaining to see them come out of compartments that had to have been activated by a warrior. The lions came at everyone like a shark in a puddle of blood. With the acting job done by Russell, it is a believable story, but it really could only ever happen once.
It went more in-depth with the weapons than it did with the gore, thankfully (not to imply that there is no gore at all). From the catapults to the flaming arrows to the lion contraptions. The transition of the time periods was just exceptional, bringing back the time period just as it was said to be. ""Gladiator"" really grabs you and pulls you in, and makes the unbelievable a reality.",980467200,,3236,4.629565217391304
1283509,4,B00003CXE6,"In the year 2000, when movies seemed emotionless and stale, thousands of movie-goers cried out for one movie, one that would satisfy their long-parched taste for something on a large, epic scale. Ridley Scott's latest film, ""Gladiator,"" takes a stab (literally) at this need, and succeeds for the most part. In terms of scale and wonder, the film is a very impressive and awe-inspiring achievement, one that leaps onto the screen with a roar instead of a whimper.
In terms of keeping audiences involved in its plot, there is something left to be desired. While the movie aspires to be like such epics as ""Braveheart,"" it doesn't have the same emotional pull as that earlier film, nor is it as engrossing. You will drop your jaws over the spectacle of the film, but its soul will leave you untouched.
Taking historical time periods and working in a fictitious storyline can have its ups and downs. Here, the result is mostly a success, supposedly based on records from the actual days of Rome, about a man who started out as a general and went from being enslaved to being the most renowned gladiator to ever fight in front of an audience.
That general is Maximus (Russell Crowe), who, after a satisfying defeat of a Germanian army, earns him the role of successor to the emperor's throne after his forthcoming death. That death is expedited by the conniving Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), whose jealous rage over the emperor's decision leads him to having Maximus murdered. Of course, what kind of movie would allow that? He escapes, becomes the property of a man who puts his slaves into the arena for gladiator challenges.
Maximus sees this as a window back to Rome, where he may once again face his rival. But it is here that the story begins to place unneeded subplots and contrivances, and as a result, it loses its touch with the audience.
One of those subplots is a love relationship between Maximus and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus's sister, which doesn't really take effect until his return to Rome. There was never any real reason to believe in a spark between the two of them in the beginning: Maximus had a wife and child to return home to (though they were later murdered), and Lucilla seems too devoted to her brother to be involved with anyone else. It seems as if the movie needs more emotional strings in the final third, and tries to throw something together, hoping for success.
An overabundance of fight sequences seems to drown the movie in testosterone, lessening any emotional impact we may feel at the end. Two sequences is enough for us to gather in what the days of Rome were all about, and each sequence is beautifully choreographed and staged for some very authentic and intense battle images. You may hold your breath in the beginning, but after a while, it tends to become redundant.
That's not to say the movie is a flop. By all means, no, for it is a breathtaking period piece that showcases just exactly what Rome was all about in the past. When I hear the word ""Rome,"" one word comes to mind: colossal, and the film portrays it as such, from the stunning visual effects used to create the Colosseum, to the overall spectacle embodied in the costume designs, and even the score from composer Hans Zimmer, which, standing alone, could create the film on its own.
The cast also fits nicely into their roles. Russell Crowe is perfect as Maximus, the ideal hero for one of those roles that the actor is born to play from day one. Connie Nielsen is honest and convincing in her role as Lucilla, even if her character has little to do but watch as her hero faces certain death (and even then, her performance is high-caliber). Joaquin Phoenix is chillingly effective as a cold-blooded tyrant who is unconcerned with the welfare of his empire, but more involved with what their opinion of him is.
""Gladiator"" is not completely heartless, but it lacks the same emotional intrigue of past epics that possess that same scale and scope of events. It's battle and fight sequences become a way of life by movie's end, but they are, nonetheless, visually stunning, as is the overall design of the film and the equally impressive acting. I was not moved to tears, but was left with a look of wonderment.",980380800,,4224,4.6940700808625335
1283616,4,B00003CXE6,"GLADIATOR is riveting cinema, the kind of movie that grabs you by the throat.  The stakes are high, the ancient Roman Empire stunningly recreated, and the body of Maximus is . . . well, buff Russell Crowe.  Because of the fast-paced sequences, you won't find yourself bored, or even with enough time to ponder the sometimes confusing details.  (For example, if Maximus had never seen Rome, how did he know Lucilla and Commodus as children, as Marcus Aurelius states early in the film?)  But this is not an intellectual movie, so why bother to figure things out?  This is pure entertainment, as much gory spectacle as the Roman gladiator contests in the Colliseum.  Add a wronged Roman General (Crowe), an effeminate, incest-craving, and slimy new Caesar (Joaquin Phoenix, who portrays Commodus so well his screen presence gave me the creeps), his beautiful and scheming sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson), and a bunch of slaves who band together behind the mysterious Spaniard to save their lives on the largest life-and-death stage, the gladiator arena, and you have Ridley Scott's Gladiator.  You will be rooting for Maximus to exact his revenge no matter how peace-loving you thought you were.
I found it ironic - and a little self-referential - when a Roman senator declares that people will love you if you bring them death. This film thrives on slaughter, from start to finish, as it portrays the brutal side of the Roman Empire.  Although the butchering is not as graphic as in some films, avoid this film if you can't stand violence.  Children, too, should be steered clear of this one.  Take the rating seriously.",980294400,59,1619,4.919117647058823

That ought to tell you everything you need to know.  I will never cease to be amazed at the amount of praise that was heaped on this movie.  The story dragged on and on; historical verity was pure Hollywood, so far as I could tell; and nothing seemed so important as pretty scenery and luminous cinematographic effects.  Finally, the dialogue was nothing short of embarrassing--towards the end, my friend and I gave up all efforts to conceal our laughter.  Neither Crowe's bedrock solidity nor Joaquin Phoenix' Fiennes-like homoerotic flamboyance could save this film (check out the latter's 'busy little bee' tirade).

1283620,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator, like Braveheart, is about 90% untrue. The Senate wasn't democratically elected (I just discovered this from another review!), it never gained power from the emperors again, Maximus probably never existed in any form, 'thumbs up' meant death, etc.
However, for some undefinable reason, unlike Braveheart I was able to set such considerations aside and just enjoy the spectacle. The incredible battle scenes, music that blends really well with the action, Turneresque vistas of Rome, great costuming (it's probably all wrong as well but I for one don't really care).
I'm not qualified to give judgement on the performances, but I thought Russel Crowe as Maximus was pretty good. Joaquim Phoenix as the incestuous, patricidal, spoiled-brat Emperor is just fun to watch and quite chilling in his callousness. His use of the Colosseum to keep the people happy has echoes of modern-day propaganda.
Definitely up there in my Top 10 films.",980208000,,942,5.245033112582782

The only thing I did not like about the DvD was the 2 cd set; one CD is the movie and the other is the extra scenes and director commentary. I would have preferred them be on 1 CD.
Russell Crowe plays Maximus Desmus Meridius, the Commander of the Roman armies of the North. After a successful campaign in Germania, Emperor Marcus Arellius (played by Richard Harris) tells Maximus that he wants him to be Emperor of Rome after Arellius' death for a short time, only to proclaim the Senate will rule Rome, making it a republic. This news is not good for the Emperors son, Comidus played by Joaquin Phoenix. So what does the son do? Kill the father and ask Maximus to join him. Maximus of course refuses and Comidus commands Maximus' execution (as well as his families). Maximus escapes and races towards his family, but he is too late. Maximus collapses due to his grief and is acquired by a travelling caravan as a slave. He is quickly sold as a gladiator to Proximo (I forget the actor's name) and the games begin. After an intense victory in the Colliseum, Emperor Comidus wants to meet this incredible gladiator (Maximus has a mask on while they re-create the battle of Maxia). Comidus demands Maximus to remove his helmet and after he does, Maximus tells Comidus that he will avenge the murder of his son and wife. There is political intrigue and action gallore.

1283622,5,B00003CXE6,"First off, everything about ""Gladiator"" is big: the sets, the plot, the cast of characters, the battles, even the dialogue.  Everything about this movie harkens to the classic epics of Hollywood.  Don't mistake admiration for theft though, this movie is pure 21st century and very original.
Through the lavish use of computer graphics, as well as masterful costume work, the viewer is vaulted back to ancient Rome.  Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix both offer Oscar caliber performances, and the supporting cast is likewise excellent (of particular note is Djimon Hounsu of ""Amistad"").  The film is packed with action, but also relates a tale of political intrigue, and also deftly deals with issues of love and faith.  Finally, the soundtrack is outstanding; in particular, some of the vocal arrangements are nothing short of haunting.
As for the DVD, it offers some outstanding feautures.  I particularly enjoyed the TLC documentary on gladiatorial games, which does much to ground the movie in some historical fact.  I also enjoyed the deleted scenes with commentary from the director.  I enjoyed them all for what they added to the film, but I really liked the insight into the editing process that Scott's comments provided.",980208000,4,1230,5.1767676767676765

As a computer arts major, I pride myself on being able to critique the cg, beind able to tell when they haven't used enough layers to make it the CG look real, or whether the peopl in the background aren't quite as smooth as they could be. Gladiator stuns and mazes you with not just a brillant story , but Ripley Scotts legendary amazing viewpoint and telling of Maximus' story and the landscape surrounding him- reminiscant of Bladerunner's majestic run down dark city it's run down hero, Decker.

1283772,5,B00003CXE6,"Make no mistake- this is Russell Crowe's movie. His performance as a Roman general-turned-slave carries this movie over top and makes its script flaws forgiveable. It also helps this movie avoid the laughable ""men-in-skirts"" syndrome that befalls so many Hollywood epics set in Classical times.
 Crowe begins the film as heroic and victorious Maximus, Emperor Marcus Aurelius' favorite. Maximus leads his legions to victory in a battle sequence that simply must be seen to be believed- many aptly compared it to ""Saving Private Ryan."" It trumps Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus"" finale for terror and realism, if not for scale and spectacle. Within a few short scenes after Maximus' triumph, Joaquin Phoenix, as Commodus, usurps the throne and Maximus escapes and flees to Spain to find his beloved family murdered. Wounded, he ends up in Africa (a confusing transition that would've benefitted from at least one image of a ship) under the care of Oliver Reed. Maximus becomes the greatest gladiator of them all, which leads him to Rome and a showdown with Commodus.
 In between are some amazing scenes of gladiatorial combat, where dust and blood mingle. One scene in particular stands out: Maximus isn't interested in putting on a show; as a soldier, he killed out of necessity. Now, he must kill for the pleasure of debauched crowds. After dispatching his foes, he angrily hurls his sword into a luxury box and taunts the crowd, then throws down his other sword and angrily spits into the sand. This is Russell Crowe at his finest, in a brutal action sequence with emotional content, where his character's pain and loss coalesce with the crowd's bloodlust to produce a dramatic and utterly believable gesture of contempt.
 Joaquin Phoenix manages to convey a man driven to excess by his father's indifference towards his existence, and his slide into insanity, without sacrificing all sympathy for Commodus. Never mind that the movie's story owes more to Caligula and that the political scenes can't match those in ""Spartacus"" for veracity and labyrintine plotting- this is a rousing, gut-wrenching spectacle with a human center and plenty of emotion. Not only that, its recreation of the Colosseum is awe-inspiring.
 The DVD provides a neat bundle of extras (storyboards, commentary, a documentary on gladiators and deleted scenes among others) that greatly enhance a marvelous, action-packed film. This is one of those movies for which this technology was created.

Spartacus had great actors, relevant political themes and had several powerful philosophical ideals running through the story.  I loved the scene where Spartacus and the man he was going to fight to death in the arena were sitting together while 2 other gladiators fought outside their holding pen.  No dialogue and none was necessary, but you could really sense the fear and tension the 2 characters were feeling.

1283776,1,B00003CXE6,"I saw this movie five years ago.  It was called  *Braveheart*.  (And it wasn't much better than this tripe.)
There's so much to dislike, I'm not even sure where to commence.  OK, the music.  Laughably portentous rot by someone named Hans Zimmer.  Tragic violins.  Arabesque singing.  World Beat bongos.  The idea was to elevate the sophomoric material.  It failed.
Number two -- the notions of the Roman Empire.  The screenwriters seem to think that Senators were, rather like Hillary Clinton, ELECTED by ballots to their posts.  This made me chuckle.  A sad-looking Derek Jacobi, in a conversation with Joaquin Phoenix, proclaims at one point that the Senate, as opposed to the Emperor, is CHOSEN by the  ""people"".  May I interrupt? -- No.  They were not.  It was a hereditary right.  Speaking of the people:  where are they?  I've never seen a movie where the populace is discussed so much without actually getting to KNOW any members of said politic body.  Perhaps the gladiators are meant to stand in for the  ""people"".  If this was the screenwriters intent, they are again wrong.  Gladiators were celebrities, usually beginning their career as captured prisoners of war or common felons.  Hardly representative of the Roman  ""people"".  At any rate, the movie's ideas of the Roman people are obtuse.  The word  ""mob""  is given quite a workout.  Again, Derek Jacobi:  ""He  (meaning Commodus)  will give them DEATH . . . and they will LOVE him for it,"" re:  the apparent resumption of the gladiatorial spectacles.  This a rather sweeping statement.  If true, why's Commodus a bad guy?  Hell, he's giving them what they want.  The movie seems to believe that the Senate would represent the  ""people""  better than the Emperor.  In other words, the screenwriters don't know from Imperial Rome.  The Roman Senate, from its inception, was a venal, aristocratic body who lived off the labor of Rome's slaves and poor tradesmen.  Julius Caesar was killed by SENATORS because he wanted to reform some of these indignities.  But the screenwriters believe that Rome's Senate musta been like the USA's Senate.  At last check, our Senators haven't owned slaves since the 1860's.
Number three -- the story.  Or what there is of it.  Synopsis:  *Braveheart*.  If ya seen that hullabaloo, you don't gotta see  *Gladiator*.
Number four -- performances.  Russell Crowe looks mightily unhappy.  Heck, the dude's grim even before his family gets hanged 'n' burnt to a fine crisp.  All the  ""Oscar""  talk in these many Amazon reviews is wishful thinking, because not only did he get into some fisticuffs with Matt Damon but he also violated America's Sweetheart.  In other words, Hollywood don't like him.  He was better in  *L.A. Confidential*, anyway.  Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius and Oliver Reed as Proximo bring in some of the old professionalism and canniness.  Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus is an unplayable part, so the disastrous result is not really his fault.  The screenwriters saddle the Emperor with Freudian hang-ups.  It's the same old song.  Daddy doesn't love me . . . blah blah.  Who cares.  Not only that, Mr. Phoenix steals from Ralph Fiennes'  Amon Goeth in  *Schindler's List*.  At one point, he even says of himself  ""Commodus the merciful . . ."" -- recalling the scene where Schindler tries to persuade Fiennes to not be such a wacko.  Well, that's typical of this movie's lack of originality.
Number five -- the production.  Dusty browns and reds.  Also, unaccountably, a stainless-steel blue atmosphere when we first see Rome guaranteed to make you squint your eyes.  Same applies for the first battle scene in Germania.  Dark blues and blacks.  Not much is visible; you gotta take the victory on faith.  The Germania scene was done better in  *Braveheart*, anyway.  Also, the gladiatorial fights are, as one reviewer wisely pointed out, done in the manner of an Oliver Stone production:  the camera whizzes around, shakes, convulses into time-elapse . . . all the modern goodies.  I think there were tigers in the ring at one point, but the camera wouldn't sit still long enough for me to be sure.  I'll take Kirk fighting against the net-and-trident dude in  *Spartacus*  on any given Sunday.

During his odyssey he is transformed into an entertainer for the masses who crave the blood and guts arena in which he performs. An overlooked screenplay is blanketed by the unreal vivid action scenes. These seat gripping scenes are ultra violent, but fit well within the context of the story. So, I feel comfortable attending this movie with a mature twelve year old. If you have the chance, I suggest you view this movie in a wide screen DVD environment to capture the true essence of this great movie!!",979862400,,970,4.993827160493828

1283851,5,B00003CXE6,"Not being a fan of overly violent movies I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this film.  There is an excellent story line here.
However, I will caution you, I left prior to some of the easily anticipated violent scenes.  I just can't take the gore.  I really can't say how bad some scenes were.
The movie is about Russell Crowe's main character Maximus who gets majorly shafted after many years of good service to the Roman empire.  He resurfaces after being thought dead to right some wrongs. I'd rather not say why or how as this may ruin the story for you, however, Russell Crowe was a perfect pick for this role.  He does a wonderful job.  Having first seen him in ""The Insider"" I did not know he was an actor who had many action films under his belt.  His range is amazing.
The rest of the cast is equally impressive
Joaquin Pheonix oozes psychotic behavior in his role as Commodus son of Caesar Marcus Aurelius, another perfect pick.
Richard Harris was an excellent pick to play the role of Marcus Aurelius and plays the wise leader with great finesse.
Connie Nielsen plays Lucilla sister to the evil Commodus and displays the careful demeanor of one who is under the power of a maniac.
Oliver Reed is Proximo the ""owner"" of the Gladiators and brings his exuberance last seen in the Three Musketeers to his final role.  He is a former Gladiator and longs for the ""old"" days when that meant something.
The set design and special effects were wonderfully done.  You can see the horror of war and the spectacle of the arena.
I can see why this film was so well applauded when it first came out.",979776000,,1606,4.472602739726027
1283852,5,B00003CXE6,"With this film Russell Crowe cements his place amongst the elite of the world's top actors, a group he was on the verge on joining after stellar performances in LA Confidential and others. He plays the Roman general Maximus, a man of principle in an empire of corrupt politics, who falls afoul of the jealous new Emperor Commodus (a great Joaquin Phoenix) who kills his father Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) upon learning he plans to hand the Empire to Maximus.
An attempt is made on Maximus' life but sadly the men sent to Maximus' family succeed in killing them. Whilst captured by slavers and sold into the arena, Maximus finds himself unable to let go and die, and victory after victory leads him back to Rome and closer to a revenge on the man who destroyed all he had. Director Ridley Scott is a sure hand on the tiller, delivering the years most magnificent spectacle. The multinational cast deliver superior performances, including a final swansong from Oliver Reed.
In response to Tokyo-dude who found some things hard to swallow I would point out that he is in error for most of them. Maximus never witnessed Aurelius' death though he suspected Commodus of murder. He was arrested by Praetorians Commodus brought along, not his own troops, when he is about to be executed he addresses one as Praetorian. The Romans swore loyalty to Rome not their general, mutineers were routinely decimated (10% of them killed by drawing lots) by scourging and beheading, Maximus' own troops would have known this risk. Maximus' family were in Spain not central Italy and the terrain is the Massif Central in France and The Pyrenees. And the Praetorians assumed Maximus dead which is why the troops weren't waiting for Maximus to show up. Commodus was shocked to find Maximus still alive. It's the missing out of the sea-crossing to North Africa that left me puzzled but the film was so good it didn't spoil my enjoyment and nor should it spoil anyone else's.",979776000,,1955,4.804154302670623
1283853,5,B00003CXE6,"Although it seems it's been the most reviewed movie of 2000, I can't refrain from saying a few words in its praise. If you're not blind or from Mars, you must have seen this epic ""how a general became a slave, the slave became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".
The movie has been compared to Ben Hur and Spartacus (from which it drastically differs, having in common only historical background and costumes; as Star Wars of 1977 differs from Phantom Menace 1999; it has been compared to Braveheart (the latter being much more steeped in patriotism and historical inaccuracy). It has also been blamed for being theatrical (and it is) and pathetic (oh, thumbs up), and illogical (indeed, flight to Spain over hundreds of kms to save his family and this abduction of Maximus by slave-traders are, well, unconvincing.
Its success has been cemented by three ingredients: R Scott's director's genius and talent ""to create worlds"", R Crowe's colossal charismatic performance that as magnet glues your eyes to screen whenever he's in frame and CGIs. However, so much has been dwelt on their grandeur in creating the world of the Ancient Rome, that I'll skip this part. All the CGIs prove once more that still (and thank God), movies are held together and brought to fame by actors. R Crowe fits in perfectly (imagine someone else in his place now? Impossible!), he's of the new actors whose talent comes from within - you can rewatch some scenes for a dozen times only to catch change of emotions on his face or expression of eyes (exhibit 1: Maximus scraping off Pretorian insignia from his shoulder - mixture of choked up pain, hatred and wry humor; exhibit 2: last conversation with Commodus - mixture of hatred, defiance and surprise and many others). Well, I like him so much I'd spare you and save the extra-space of this site. Watch for him, he'll get his Oscar if not this year, then the next.
The supporting cast is harmonious as well: especially J Phoenix: although his Commodus is a capricious spiled brat, but watch his royal profile and gait, contempt in cold eyes and hidden fear. C Nielsen as his sister is not less ambitious and powerful, only in a more subtle way (I'd bet she was the one to jilt Maximus, not the other way round). The music is opera-suiting, sounds in your brain long after the movie is over.
The finale is ... well, the best you can expect from Hollywood. Pathos is towering to heaven, but still sends shivers down your spine and mist into your eyes. I'd ask happy DVD owners: has there been any alternative ending in mind?
To sum it up, although I'm a VERY BIG movie fan, it's the first movie EVER that I've watched for 4 times during last 1.5 months. It's a treasure for your home collection.
PS: My greatest fear now is that R Crowe will squander his newly minted stardom and huge talent on some brain-dumb movie. Greatest hope - maybe someone will dare to revive Spartacus or come up with story of Alexander?",979776000,,2957,4.645038167938932
1283854,5,B00003CXE6,"This is an extraordinary epic which takes place at the end of the reign of the Antonine emperors.  OK, so they do fudge history, but so what?  It's a magnificent story of a fictional character (a Roman General named Maximus, played by Crowe) who comes into contact with historical characters, such as Marcus Aurelius and his ignominious son, Commodus.  There are also allusions to the great Roman orator Cicero (his name bequeathed to Maximus' servant) and the Gracchus brothers (Gracchus is the name of a benevolent senator in the film).  There are also some nice references made to the Battle of Zama (in 202 - defeat of Hannibal), Antony & Cleopatra and Cladius Caesar.
Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the film lies in its depiction of Aurelius & Commodus.  Aurelius is seen as a magnificent and magnanimous leader;  history remembers him as the closest anyone has ever come to Socrates' ""philosopher king.""  Commodus is just as accurately portrayed as the vile, corrupt ignoramous that he was.  During his reign, there was a rumor which spread thru all of Rome that Aurelius' wife had had an affair with a sailor.  According to the scuttlebut, Commodus was the result of the episode;  the Romans simply refused to believe that a man so despicable as Commodus could come from the loins of the noble Aurelius.  The presentation of his character in this movie brings that out exceptionally well.
This is yet another instant classic directed by the creative genius of Ridley Scott.  The film is well done & the sets take you back to the height of the Roman empire.  For background information on this period, I would recommend reading Marcus Aurelius' stoic ""Meditations"" as well as  Michael Grant's ""The Antonines."" The latter book covers this epoch of Roman history.  These are not essential, but do offer a nice backdrop as to what's going on during this age. They could very well increase the viewer's enjoyment of this marvelous visual spectacle.",979689600,,1958,4.926829268292683
1283855,5,B00003CXE6,"This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. It tells the tale of one Maximus Decimus Meridius, a Spanish General of the Roman Army in the year 180 A.D. After winning a great battle against the barbarians, the old king, Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris), decides to make this brilliant general the Caesar of Rome upon his death. He says that he will be ideal because he has not been corrupted by Rome's politics. However, Aurelius's son, Commodus, Maximus's friend, is jealous at the Spaniard and kills his father, and thus he seizes control of the Roman Empire. He orders Maximus and his wife and son killed. Maximus kills nearly half a dozen soldiers and escapes, but his family is crucified. After he escapes, he is captured by a man who organizes gladiator fights to turn a profit. Maximus was to participate in one of these events; he won. Not only by staying alive did he achieve victory, but he also won over the crowd. Then he is sent to Rome, where he has his chance to fight back at the emperor who killed his wife and son. The acting is excellent all around, especially Crowe and Phoenix. The scenery and costumes are all outstanding, bringing the Roman Empire to life. The DVD is simply amazing, with great sound and picture quality, plus deleted scenes. This movie is nothing less than a classic; an epic. It is definitely worth purchasing here.

1283856,4,B00003CXE6,"This is one of those rare moments when Hollywood makes an attempt at self reflection. The narrative depicts the rise to power of the ""General who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied the Emperor."" One gets the sense, though, that the film is not just talking about General Maximus but is really a loose allegory for Hollywood's political influence.
This well told story is about a General who (unwillingly) becomes the Roman equivalent of a Hollywood actor (albeit without the perks).  From his new position as an entertainer, Maximus is able to carry enough political weight with the people to ultimately defeat the corrupt ruler.  To say it another way, the central motif of the movie is this: Because entertainers have access to the masses, political power is most effectively wielded as an entertainer.  And so Hollywood, as embodied in Maximus, ultimately portrays itself as the savior of democracy and presumably, therefore, the savior of mankind.
Interestingly enough, Gladiator's examination of the relation between entertainment and political power comes near the end of the term of a President who has had more than the normal amount of connections to Hollywood.  One can't help but wonder about the real life connections between politics and entertainment. Perhaps the arena is not far off after all.",979689600,,1325,5.12037037037037
1283984,1,B00003CXE6,"How about this: General Maximus has just concluded the last significant campaign the Roman Empire will fight for a long while, succesfully. His men adore him, and so does the Roman populace. He is a hero, and at least out there in the field he should be untouchable. On the eve of his victory, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, out to supervise the campaign in Germany himself, is murdered by his own son (for obvious reasons), and Maximus notices that. Instead of launching an investigation, he, the victorious general, at the orders of the emperor's son, is abducted by the very soliders who adore him, for an attempt to assasinate him. He escapes, and travels back to Italy to protect his wife and children from the new Emperor's wolves. He finds them crucified (after a journey thru lands that do not exist anywhere between Germany and Italy) at his own estate. Now, no soldiers have been waiting to intercept him there (which would have been the obvious thing to do) and he feels free to collapse from despair and faints (or takes a nap). A slave trader who happens to pass by picks him up right there while he is still in coma, and without interference from the authorities, abducts him to Africa. Note that this happens in central Italy, right in the heartland of the Roman Empire (for Christ's sake!)
Does any of this strike you as odd?
The plot goes on in this manner. Some people have critized the historical inaccuracy of this film, and that may be as it will. But the plot in its own inherent (il)logic is already so bad that worrying about historical facts is vain. The plot is so bad that despite spectacular fights and CGI-type reconstructions of old Rome, I was tempted to switch off. This film is a disgrace, and an insult. How stupid do you think your audience is, Mr. Ridley? With a gigantic Hollywood budget at hand, you had a chance to resurrect old Rome in all its glory, and offer a satisfying and plausible story along with it. You have completely wasted that chance.
For those still considering watching it, here is my recommendation: do so at your own peril, and only if all you care about is action and - admittedly - breathtaking reconstructions of the eternal city. Otherwise you will end up one upset ticket-buyer.",979603200,11,2235,4.632241813602015

Although there are some of those ""I think I'm gonna hurl"" moments, there is a lot more to this movie. Reason #3: Ridley Scott & Co. do a good job of recreating Rome as it might have been back in 180 A.D.

1283989,5,B00003CXE6,"Few movies come along during our lives that make us stop in our tracks and take notice.  The star-loaded action movies always grab attention but that is to be expected.  Gladiator doesn't fall into that genre.  Ridley Scott's epic of Roman General, Maximus (played by Russel Crowe) is a movie that commands attention.  From the intricately detailed by battle sequences at the beginning to the monstrous recreation of Rome (albeit computer enhanced), Gladiator is every bit as good as the critics and media have praised it to be.
Since buying the DVD version shortly after Christmas, having seing it when it first came out in theaters in May, I've only enhanced my appreciation for it.  As it says on the case "" The General who became a slave.  The Slave who became a gladiator.  The Gladiator who defied an emperor.""  That is really all of the story that you need to know if you have not seen this film.  To give any more away spoils the movie.
On the musical side, Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard composed a score that is as moving as it is dramatic.  Nearly of the score coincides directly with key points in the film and add just that extra touch to the scene.  I don't think there has been a score quite to match it in the last few years.
Comparisions with Braveheart and other movies like it are evident but this film stands on it's own.  Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix (as Commodus) and Scott give their all in the movie of the year for 2000.

1283991,5,B00003CXE6,"With the era of Roman Empire movies gone for so long, the public was aching for this movie so bad, but they didn't even know it, until they saw it.  Thank god Ridley Scott has made an incredible movie that is not just something to fill that aching void.  This movie is as epic and glorious as they come.  The Roman Empire was built on brutal force and conquering of lesser civilizations.  It is made abundantly clear in the beginning as the Roman army, in full force, take on the resisting Germanians (German Barbarians), with one commander stating 'People should know when they are conquered'.  Russell Crowes character, The General Maximus, replies, 'Would you?  Would I?'  This sets the tone as Russell so skillfully plays a Military Hero who desperately wants to go home to his farm and spend the rest of his days with his family.  In true Roman loyalty though, he is asked by the Ceaser to take his place, played very well by Richard Harris, who could easily leave this as his final role.
Maximus' journey from here is not a pretty one.  Typical Roman behavior ensues.  Murder, betrayal, lies, politics....Crowe plays his charater so well in placing Maximus' desires so close to reality.  He is the one grounded personality in a pit full of snakes.  It seems this movie takes place at a time closer to the fall of the empire.  With that comes much political intrigue as well as bloody violence as the games get started.  Vengance is the driving force behind Crowe's character.  He plays it so well that for once, the villian, Joaquin Phoenix finally doesn't outact the hero.  Nonetheless, everyone plays their roles so skillfully and the direction is still incredible.  Ridley Scott hasn't had a project this juicey in years and he seemed to master every detail.  The recreation of Rome is awesome, especially the Colliseum. A feat attributed to the incredible advancement of computer graphics.  The atmosphere is almost that of any modern day sporting event, only more blood and no multi-million dollar contracts.  Scott stays clear of Roman stereotypes like fig leaves and togas and gives a more realistic look at the Roman society.  Dangerous, bloody, deceitful.  Gladiator succeeds on so many levels that it was no wonder Scott was granted the job of bringing Hannibal Lecture back to the big screen.  This timeless director of such great movies like Alien and Blade Runner seems to have found new motivation.

The editor is Pietro Scalia, who won an Oscar for Oliver Stone's ""JFK,"" he creates some great, gritty, bone-crunching action sequences.

In AD 180, the death of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius leaves a void at the height of Roman rule. Aurelius had told Maximus (played by Crowe) who is Rome's greatest general, that he, Maximus, should hold the emperor's power in trust after the ruler's death until the Imperial Senate can take the position of command. Aurelius relied on Maximus because he is a simple soldier, unskilled at lying and uncorrupted by politics. And Maximus, who loved the emperor like a father, agreed, but even said that all he really wanted was to go home to his wife and his young son. But the emperor's son, Commodus , takes control before Maximus even knows the emperor is dead, and the son has very different plans for the empire than his father did. He wants to save Rome from the politicians so he can rule Rome. Maximus escapes his own execution and then is captured by slavers and trained gladiator in a distant desert city, Maximus is then sent to fight in the Colosseum in Rome, where he at last has the opportunity to avenge both his emperor, Aurelius, and his family, slain by Commodus's troops.

This would easily make my list of 10-best movies. As much as I enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I think Gladiator surpasses it at every point. It is a movie that will cause you to pause and think weeks after you see it.",979171200,,656,4.7631578947368425

Extras are a large part of the amazement, and Gladiator delivers is like only a few other DVD's have in the past (ie - Criterion Collection Armageddon, or The Abyss Special Edition).  This two disk feature provides top quality sound and picture, behind the scenes featurettes, detailed cast/crew bios, deleted scenes and oh so much more.  The film itself is a fantastic production, well acted and produced, and serves up healthy portions of action and politcal intrigue.  This is hand-down, one of the best films to come out of Dreamworks.  I highly recommend it as an addition to any DVD enthusiast's collection.  Happy viewing!",979084800,,702,4.906779661016949
1284117,4,B00003CXE6,"This is a sand and sandals gladiator epic with flair and intrigue. The plot is just a little too trite, the picture just a bit too long and the often pretentious dialogue is just so-so but the acting in support, the grand cinematography, the totally enveloping big sound and the magnificent battle staging, along with great computer special effects, all combine to make this one of the best action movies of the year! You get sucked in in spite of its flaws. Crowe is quite good as Maximus but I feel he was better in L.A. Confidential a few years ago. Here he nobly struts around as a killing machine with the right amount of angst and honorable rage.  However, the supporting players really make this movie work. Joaquin Phoenix pouts, sulks, lusts, romps and schemes his way through his juicy role as Commodus, Maximus' evil foil (Academy members take note!). Wthout Phoenix, Crowe would be just another well-built dirty slave waiting to nobly die in the gladiatorial dust. It is true here that the star brings the masses in but the villain actually makes the movie work as entertaining art. Connie Nielson projects just the right air of conniving, jaded  sadness as the Emperor's sister and Maximus' former lover. Oliver Reed as the cynical former gladiator who saves Maximus for the battle pits is convincingly world-weary, waiting for his redemption to come. Richard Harris is also fine in a small but integral part as the failing Roman emperor whose murder by Commodus acts as the catalyst for the subsequent machinations of the main players. Finally, Crowe's adoring gladiator buddies provide excellent redemptive ""backup"" for him at the proper times later in the picture. I saw this movie for the first time in the big screen theater and I was not all that impressed at that time. It took a second and even a third viewing on my home theater screen to really appreciate the fine work and detail that went into making this a superior entertainment. Comparisons to Kirk Douglas' Spartacus are inevitable. In many ways this picture is better made and has more to say about life, love and honor than even that old classic. Perhaps the extreme budget differential between the two plays a major role in that assessment but the bottom line for the discerning viewer is that this picture can stand alone against the best of its peers and still come out on top as an entertainment with a message. This is enjoyable escapist fare and comes highly recommended!",978998400,,2458,4.794811320754717
1284118,5,B00003CXE6,"I loved everything about the movie - but I will mention a few highlights that I found truly enjoyable.
I loved the acting in the movie - Joaquin Phoenix puts on a show and is extremely convincing even when the plot gets unreasonably melodramatic at the end. And Connie Nielsen as the frightened mother and sister embroiled in palace intrigue is unforgettable. Ofcourse, Russell Crowe deserves every accolade heaped on him.
What impressed me most about the DVD (and movie) was the soundtrack. From the opening sequence to the last, the music was simply mesmerising. Note how the music shifts moods and genre in keeping with the sequences playing out on the screen. Watching the hour-long special on the music and its composer on the accompanying second disc is a must.
The quality of sound was amazing - I could have sworn I heard a horse neighing in my front-yard as Aurelius was conversing with Maximus in his tent after the battle!!
The little touches to the script, to portray reality 2000 years ago, are admirable. The sewage issues being discussed in the Senate, the bloodthirstiness of the crowds at the Colisseum, the adoration for the gladiators, were all deftly portrayed without ever getting to be a heavy dose in history.
Finally, the movie makes one realise why Rome was the greatest civilisation in Europe (inspite of its culture of arena violence and its deviation from the original political ideal that Maximus fights to restore) when the rest of the continent was dark and sinister.",978998400,3,1498,4.87843137254902
1284119,4,B00003CXE6,"__________________
I saw this twice in the theater and wanted to see it on DVD, curious about the performances. Were they as magnificent as I remembered, or was it the spectacle on the big screen? The film was a spectacle, but the impact is only slightly reduced on the small screen.
The performances are towering, and the cast is excellent. This is a movie most will enjoy, particularly those who enjoyed Braveheart. I'm not particularly a Ridley Scott fan, but when the performances are great, it's the director. This is quite an achievement, particularly since it is a genre picture. While I like historical dramas, few are of this high quality, and I hope that lesser lights don't try a follow-on to the success of Gladiator.
The companion disk has a behind the scenes or making of video which didn't interest me. I didn't want to spoil my experience of the movie by seeing the fakery. There is also an hour long historical supplement that is very educational. The child actor contributed a diary of his time on location, and although it took some time to get through all the pages, I found them to be amusing. The deleted scenes have alternate sound tracks provided by Ridley Scott, which was an excellent idea. It's easy to see that something needed to be cut due to the sheer length of the movie, but the story is further illuminated by viewing them, and the ""betting"" sequence is quite amusing.
Before you read any more of this review, or any others, I strongly suggest you buy and view the film.  If you still have doubts, check your local library -- many of them stock the VHS or DVD version, and will lend it to you more cheaply than a typical neighborhood video rental place.  You may find that the local library doesn't stock it, but can get it from another nearby.  Some libraries have online account management which allow you to request a check out of a book or video from a more convenient location.  Everyone loves the selection at the video rental chain, but everyone should also try to support their local library.  You are after all paying for it.
This movie recently won the Academy Award for Best Picture (2000) which has tinkled off a number of people (including about one third to one half of the subsequent reviewers here on Amazon).  Since there are 735+ reviews.... it seems like a good time for everyone to find a new hobby than reviewing ""Gladiator"".  Since we no longer have live bloodsports (at least, not in the US) we engage in endless debate on trivial subjects, such as whether this or that Oscar was deserved.  Two words -- WHO CARES?
""Gladiator"" is visually stunning -- less so that it was on the big screen -- has an excellent and integrated sound track, believable characters, great performances throughout, and the companion disk has a one hour documentary on the life of real Roman gladiators and the history of the ""games"".  Other features of the companion disk include scenes that had to be cut, a making of the film diary of the child actor who played Lucius, as well as a behind the scenes documentary I didn't have the heart to watch.
The movie is a work of art, and therefore, despite the fact that historical background was used, the plot is fictional.  On the other hand, the emperor Commodus was suspected of murdering his father; he had some sort of physical ailment that lasted throughout his adult life; and the real Commodus was murdered by a slave who was employed by the emperor's political enemies to do so.
That said, the historical accuracy of various details -- battle tactics and equipment, the names of the emperors and their families, the simulated city skylines -- is magnificent.
Tigers were used in the real Roman games, as were orangutans (which were rediscovered in their SE Asian habitat in recent centuries), Indian elephants, and other Asian species imported for that purpose.  The monsoon trade route to and from the Far East has been known for thousands of years, and in Hellenistic times became well known -- probably not for the first time -- in the Mediterranean basin.  There are still those who think that no one sailed beyond the sight of the shore prior to 1400 AD, but those people are a pack of landlubber ninnies.
""Spartacus"" was a better film only in that the title character was loosely based on a real historical figure.  But that movie was also a work of fiction, no less so than ""Gladiator"".  ""Ben Hur"" I've not seen, but know that it was similarly fictionalized.  I do hope that any historical blockbuster films which follow in the footsteps of ""Gladiator"" do as good a job of virtual time travel.

In fact, the title ""Gladiator"" reminds me of a line from the first scene of the earlier film, where Christopher Walken says, ""Hey, did you hear about the happy Roman?  He was . . .""",978912000,,312,4.183333333333334
1284290,5,B00003CXE6,"Many critics of the year 2000 have stated that there really weren't any good movies this year. They were wrong. Gladiator is an exceptional exception to the rule! Having watched several Russel Crowe films previously, I was unimpressed initially with the fact that people were raving mad about it and yet it stared Crowe. So I went along to watch it for myself.
The film begins with a battle scene more realistic than any other film before (that I've seen anyway). When you think about a battle, you think knights in shining armour with glory charging down the mountainside to slay all the enemy, almost without loss. This battle was grim reality. In the heart of a German forest, amidst the oncoming winter, the mud and the grime, rank upon rank rank (excuse the pun, if you get it) are standing bravely waiting for the barbarian attack. The battlescene is horrendously gruesome with many killed and wounded on both sides. How the directors managed such realism is beyond me and shows the potential for the cinema in future films.
The storyline continues, Crowe (the general in the aforementioned battle) being exiled by the cruel new emporer to become a circus gladiator. The rest of the movie follows his extremely melancholy life, in which wife and child are murdered, and he earns a reputation as one of the greatest gladiators in the arena. The film ends with Crowe fighting against the emporer in the arena. The emporer secretly wounds Crowe before the actual fight to give him an advantage. I won't say who won, or it would spoil the ending, but I will say that the Gladiator is
A MUST SEE!

1284294,4,B00003CXE6,"Ah ""Gladiator.""  What a film.  The execs at Dreamworks said that it was going to be ""bigger than Titanic!""  While that was a bit of a stretch, the film was still a big deal.  It brought sandal and sword epics of the fifties and sixties back in a big way.  It made Russel Crowe an overnight success.  It brought Ridley Scott back in a big way.  And it brought big bucks into the box office.
""Gladiator"" is a really good film.  It's only problem is that ""Braveheart"" already came out.  It's hard not to draw parallels between the films considering they both revolve around characters who are avenging the deaths of their wives while they fight political persecution in their country.
But what ""Gladiator"" tackles head on that ""Braveheart"" ignored is the issue of identity, speciffically in Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus.  Here is a great film villain that we almost sympathize with because what makes him tick is so clearly portrayed to the audience.  Phoenix is fantastic in this role, but, then again, it would have taken alot of hard work to mess up a character so well written.
Along with a refreshingly original score, beautiful cinematography, a star making performance by Crowe, and amazing battle scenes, Gladiator has become one of the top contenders for Oscar this year.  Does it deserveb the top prize?  No of course not.  The material isn't freh enough.  But its better than alot of other films this year.",978825600,,1412,4.753086419753086

1284296,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator chronicles the story of Maximus, a Roman general that serves Rome itself, and not merely the person holding the reins of the great empire. The story is an epic tale that reminds me of the great classic, Ben Hur. True, this movie, reminds me of the modern films, the Patriot and Braveheart, this one surpasses both of these in both story telling and action.
While the scenes are at times a little bloody, it is done tastefully, and it does not remind me of some of the gore fests that I have seen. I feel that this story although not totally original, is a very compelling and stirs one's emotions. Maximus is a reluctant hero, and merely wants to be left alone, but his wrath is provoked by the son of one whom he trusted, and he is unjustly dishonored. Through valor and his own abilities, he survives as a gladiator until one day his skill and ability puts him in a position to gain both vengeance and an assured future for Rome.
Masterfully directed by Ridley Scott and wonderful acting by those in the movie will make this a classic that will endure as has the classic that this reminds me of, Ben Hur.

His acting is extraordinary and the story line allows us to look a little bit into the past.

More than the movie, the bonus material is fantastic.  If you have read any of my other reviews, I am mainly a fan of DVD's because of the bonus materials.  I like to know what goes on behind the scenes and to learn a little more about the actors involved.

Without recycling the same ideas already stated some 500 times before me, I'd like to add that what is wonderful about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in particular is that he doesn't simply make his character fall into the typical villain stereotypes, but rather provides his Commodus with a depth and resourcefulness that make him truly understandable.  Treacherous and menacing he may be, but the new Emperor is also wounded, emotionally, perhaps more deeply than any other character in the film.  His character might have been the focus of a movie which aimed at creating Shakespeareanesque tragedy rather than heroic epic.  The plot, of course, demands resolution in traditional style, but Phoenix does not allow the complexity of Commodus' character to be lost.  Bravo!",978652800,,861,5.255474452554744
1284369,4,B00003CXE6,"There's a series of scenes about halfway through ""Gladiator"", when you realize the filmmakers have pulled off a neat trick.  Commodus has reinstated the gladiatorial matches at the Colosseum.  Proximo, a slave-owner gives this advice to Maximus, a gladiator intended for the ring of battle: ""I was the best because the crowd loved me; win the crowd and you will win your freedom.""  He's talking of the power of spectacle, as a means to an end (i.e., Maximus' freedom).  It is easy to see how this applied to not only the Gladiators of ancient Rome, but its politicians as well; Commodus is desperate for the love of the people (a.k.a. the vulgar mob) and the spectacle of combat shall bring that to him.  Taking this strain of logic further, it most definitely applies to politics in contemporary society.  Witness the ""style-over-substance"" approach of modern political campaigning.  But nowhere does spectacle reign supreme more than... Hollywood blockbuster movies!  Of which ""Gladiator"" is most definitely one.  Neat trick, no?  Kind of a gutsy move, biting the hand that feeds and feeds and feeds you.
So how do we judge this movie as spectacle?  Pretty good, I'd say.  From the opening bloodbath in Germania (""Unleash Hell,"" Maximus says, coolly), to the multiple battles in the Colosseum, director Ridley Scott handles the action with great style.  The sheer size of these battles is impressive enough, and the action does its very best to measure up.  If you are a fan of watching appendages sliced from bodies, or ever wondered what sound a sword would make when plunged into the torso of a Roman, then you won't be disappointed.  And except for a dubious decision by one of the characters that sets up the film's climax, the story was handled well.  Sure, it aims for Shakespearean and misses.  But what summer blockbuster even gets this close to the Bard?  It's a poor man's mixture of `Julius Caesar', `Antony and Cleopatra', and even `Hamlet'.
Ridley Scott seems to have taken a cue from Jerry Bruckheimer (who's produced five movies directed by brother Tony), by casting a boatload of quality actors to read from a script who's main function is to quickly deliver the audience to another action sequence.  All of the actors make the best of what they're given.  Joaquin Phoneix as Emperor Commodus is suitably creepy, whether he's visibly lusting after his father's power or his sister's body.  Richard Harris as said father is majestic as the dying Marcus Aurelius.  Connie Nielsen as said sister is cunning and thoughtful as the daughter who, if she'd have been born a son, would have made a fine leader.  Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, and even Derek Jacobi show up in small, but pivotal roles, lending authority to the proceedings.
But there would be no spectacle, no ""Gladiator"", with out Russell Crowe.  I am ever amazed at the amount of visceral intensity this man burns on screen.  I tried to picture someone else in this role, but couldn't.  Who has his combination of physical power and grace, charisma, and quiet dignity?  I wouldn't have been surprised if the filmmakers had mounted the Colosseum itself on his sturdy shoulders, in one last fit of Apollo-like spectacle.  It would definitely be a fitting end to a fine piece of entertainment such as this.",978652800,,3279,4.891304347826087
1284370,5,B00003CXE6,"""Gladiator"" could just as easily have been a bad film. When was the last time we even heard of a movie about gladiators? Hadn't it become a joke? ""Do you like movies about gladiators?"" Isn't that what Peter Graves, playing a perverted airline pilot, asks a ten-year-old boy in the first reel of ""Airplane""? Sword and sandal epics had become a Hollywood terror. There was ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"", but then Italy stuck their profiteering fingers in the pie and gave us a parade of terrible films that would forever disgrace the genre... Until now.
Ridley Scott, though skeptical at first, decided to take upon himself the challenge of crafting an old-fashioned epic that would enthrall audiences in the same manner that those aforementioned classics did. And he succeeded. ""Gladiator"" is, honest to God, Scott's best film since ""Blade Runner"". It's also his first major blockbuster.
And, man, does it DELIVER! It offers a grand spectacle as well as a classically structured tale about honor and heroism. Few films can get away with being so, well, masculine. Scott's handling of the battle scenes is terrific. They are electric, exciting and oh so very bloody. Egad! What a thrilling mess! Shot with elegance and adorned by a wonderful musical score (by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard). And then you have the cast. Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, the ailing Caesar of Rome, about to appoint a successor to his throne. But it won't be his rather amoral and conniving son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). There is also Oliver Reed in his final performance as the slave trader Proximo. Reed brings such flavor and character to his supporting role, that he nearly walks away with the picture. It's a grand and eloquent swan song performance that reminds us all of what a great actor he was and how much poorer we are for losing him. It's really too bad that he had plummeted into near obscurity before this. ""Gladiator"" would have made for an exquisite comeback.
In other key supporting roles - BBC favorite Derek Jacobi as a just Roman senator, Connie Nielsen as Commodus's benign and stronger-than-she-seems sister and Djimon Hounsou (who made such an impact in Spielberg's underrated ""Amistad"".) as a noble gladiator.  This is a very well-rounded cast. And at the center of it all is the star- Russell Crowe, one of the most exciting actors to appear in the last decade, proving once and for all that he can carry a picture. As Maximus, he delivers a performance of great richness and depth. This is a classic hero that you really want to root for, and Crowe has a gift for communicating his inner pain. He has been disgraced, his family has been murdered. He wants vengeance, but he also wants to set things right for Rome in the process. I love the little nuances that he brings to the role. The way he rubs sand in his hands before each battle (a detail that was not in the script). All great stuff. With his ruggedness and everyman qualities, Crowe could end up being a Harrison Ford-type role model for a whole new generation of young moviegoers. But, in difference to Ford, Crowe has proven to be more of a risk taker. Playing diverse roles in less commercial films.
You really can't ask for a meatier and more satisfying blockbuster. The screenplay gives its characters plenty of grand melodramatic dialogues. Particularly the scenes given to Phoenix. If Crowe is the star, then Phoenix is the breakout success of this film. Here we have a young actor who walks in the shadow of his late brother River Phoenix. But you want to know my opinion? Joaquin is a richer, more complex actor than his brother ever was. It isn't easy to portray a villain like this. Instead of going for the easy way out and making him an out-and-out baddie, he makes him a complex and tragic figure. An ambitious young man who is riddled with insecurities and deep down only wants to be accepted. And his whispery delivery of key dialogues makes him menacing yet sympathetic.
""Gladiator"" may not be perfect. I mean, that melodrama can get a bit overbearing at times. And it makes for a couple of unwanted lulls when the film should just keep moving. But overall, Scott has put the whole package together so well, that one way or another you get caught up in this little Roman soap opera whether you like it or not. One might want to argue at the complete historical accuracy of it all. But it feels pretty real. And watching those battles, I couldn't help but make a connection to Wrestlemania... Think about it. These gladiators were in fact star athletes weren't they? The film's way of handling that aspect of the story is so infectious, that by the time Maximus shouts at the coliseum: ""Are you not entertained?"" one almost feels like cheering right along with the crowd.
The spectacular box office success of this film makes one think that there just might be hope out there for quality enterainments. I mean, vapid idiocy can be good for a laugh sometimes, but movies shouldn't always be mere products.",978652800,3,4984,4.728735632183908
1284371,5,B00003CXE6,"Forget the comparisons to ""Braveheart,"" this film should be judged on its own merits.
If you want to find fault with this movie, there are certainly opportunities to do so, but, in my opinion, this movie is a rare gem with only minor flaws.
Regardless of what critics might say, if a film has a lasting emotional and visceral impact on me, then I will strongly recommend it to others.
The combination of stunning visuals, a moving musical score, and top-notch acting are the reasons why I ran out to buy the DVD (get the 2-disc set) when it was released. There are few movies that I would want to watch more than one time. Two examples are ""Braveheart"" and ""Boys Don't Cry."" Both excellent films, and very moving, but once is more than enough.
By contrast, I can never get enough of Russell Crowe (""Maximus"") or Ridley Scott (the Director) who are the real stars of this film.
Ridley Scott is a genius for transporting the viewer to alien worlds whether they are in the far future (""Blade Runner"") or the distant past, as he does here in Gladiator.
If you are guy and the opening battle sequence does nothing to get your blood pumping, then you are, as Maximus exhorts his soldiers in that scene ""...already dead.""",978652800,2,1214,4.5479452054794525

The soundtrack like in most masterpieces completes this film giving it the added reoccuring nature of the plot. It was inspiring and certainly led me to believe that this movie would not have been the same without Zimmer on the project. He was masterful and certainly many scenes became epic with his help. I believe the calming nature of the vocals and background music blended into the time and certainly gave the aspect of reality of music to the film. I need this soundtrack as I feel it can take me back to the imagery of the movie and certainly can intrigue many minds.

1284377,5,B00003CXE6,"Very few movies in the past ten years or so have caught more than my attention to want to review them with so much praise for director, actors, and yes (something that is quite overlooked and muddled in some of today's Hollywood blockbuster extravaganzas) the STORY !Gladiator is one of them (sorry Titanic or Phantom Menace, you were close runners up in my list) Where Ridley Scott was once ridiculed for directing such cult sleepers like BladeRunner or being coined as a sci-fi director only associated with Alien he has outdone himself with this astounding piece of cinematic art. As an Arizona native I, too, like Scott saw the gladiator painting in a Phoenix, Arizona museum that inspired him and his sense of direction for the ""look"" of the film. He captured it magnificently ! The only minor annoyance was the shaky and jittery camera work during the battle between the Romans and Germanians;I soon understood the overall effect and purpose of this. It was very symbolic that in time of war nothing is perfectly still or ""aesthetically"" balanced or pleasing to the eye;It is all chaos and destruction without any sense of focus. Ridley Scott put the viewer in the middle of the battlefield with this technique!...Also, while maybe Ridley Scott might have been influenced at all by such other gladiator classics like Spartacus, he avoided using typical Hollywood golden era movie star images (the good looking chiseled chin American actor witht the stylized 1940's or 50's slick haircut to play a Roman soldier in ancient times). Yet, as stated in the 2nd dvd disc he also avoided making Gladiator a typical historical time piece that read like a world history lesson in highschool from a text book ! Scott knew how to balance his directorial means...
Actor Russell Crowe has definitley cemented his bonafide great actor status with this role. Had a stereotypical Hollywood pretty boy played the role it would not have had a very profound and credible overall effect to draw interest to the main chartacter Maximus. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla also proved herself very worthy ! Joaquin Phoenix played Commodus with every bit of flamboyant evil verve (almost melo-dramatic) but it worked. Actor or Sir Richard Harris gives a very fine and strong performance that does bring some classy ambiance to Gladiator when the heartwrenching story is anything but;He is a powerful presence in the film as well.
The Hans Zimmer soundtrack is one of the most haunting and evocative scores that will stay in the viewer's mind for quite some time. It is both compelling and ethereal in nature that exquisitely expresses every nuance, emotion, and motion of the film and characters precisely...
The dvd bonus material disc is every bit a treasure and wealth of information on the making of the film and the history of the the ""real"" Roman gladiators. The day by day diary of filming by one of the actors is an enjoyable read (if your eyes don't strain from reading your t.v. screen).

In part, the film is a tremendous success because it conveys the notion of what it means to be a good person. Russell Crowe as general Maximus shows the viewer that a man (or woman) must act from integrity, and not from self interest.  In the film, Maximus has the opportunity to return to his beloved family, so long as he will endorse the depraved emperor Commodus.  Maximus does not act from self-interest, but rather from integrity by rejecting the murdeous emperor.  As a result, he loses everything, but not his dignity.
The film notes how words like 'honour' and 'trust' had lost meaning in the Roman Empire, and similarly poses the question of whether those words have today lost meaning for the viewer.

Maximus (Crowe), a general in the Roman army, has been slated by the reigning Emperor to lead Rome and return it to the people, removing it from the hands of the senate, which has ruled with duplicity. He finds himself betrayed by a pathetic, power hungry man. No longer a favored soldier, he is sold into slavery, where as a gladiator, his need for revenge grows strong, keeping him alive as he wins over the crowds in the gladiator's arena.
The schemes and intrigue that takes place in the darkness of the night, along with the subtle threats that initiate the treachery among family members keeps you craving that justice which is robustly delivered by director Ridley Scott. The final showdown takes our hero to the infamous coliseum, where he faces an array of weapons and opponents. What a satisfying pleasure it will be to witness justice at its finest hour.
This Academy Award nominated film is certainly a 5 star production and a movie that will stand the test of time. The surround-sound alone leaves you feeling like part of the crowd as they stomp and cheer for the Gladiators.

1284578,5,B00003CXE6,"It amazes me that movies about Roman Gladiators are so few.  All the attributes that movie-makers long for; adventure, romance, action, heroism - can be found in a good Gladiator story.  This is why my surprise at the success of Gladiator is somewhat muted.
If anyone could put together a modern day epic such as Gladiator it would be Ridley Scott.  Through films such as Bladerunner, Thelma and Louise, and Alien, Mr. Scott has been revealed as one of our foremost storytellers.  His ability to take a conceptually challenging story and make it almost universally accessible, must surely be enviable amongst his peers.
Gladiator follows this tradition by taking what was once considered ""old news"" and pumping it full of modern day movie steriod.  The war sequence well surpasses anything that Mel Gibson (Braveheart, The Patriot) has yet put together and the gladiator fights are brutal but not distasteful in their depiction.
From the first frame to the last, I found myself enthralled at this story of a famous Roman general who, when unjustly disgraced, falls into a life of slavery.  His rise through the ranks of the Roman gladiators to a point where he can finally face his nemesis, although bloody, is treated decently.
Russell Crowe, who plays the part of General Maximus, is superb.  Indeed, his performance is somewhat reminiscent of Kirk Douglas's Spartacus in that the personality of the character overshadows his physicality.  Russell Crowe was a relative unknown when this movie was first filmed and if Mr. Scott ever considered this casting decision a risk then I believe he hit the jackpot.  I believe we may be watching the creation of a new superstar.
Other stellar performances are provided by Joaquin Phoenix, Richard Harris, and Oliver Reed (Who sadly died during the making of Gladiator).
Mr. Scott did not skimp on his use of technology in this movie, although this is not entirely apparent until you review the bonus features on the DVD.  In particular, the digital recreations of Rome and the Colussium are stunning.
I would suggest at this point that you grab your credit card and order this movie right away.  It will be one of the most welcome additions to your DVD collection this year.",978393600,15,2217,4.932795698924731

Unfortunately the movie too often slips into passages of such extremely grotesque violence that my enjoyment of the film was diminished.  Also distracting is a storyline which lacks depth and originality.
This is not a bad film by any means.  It is certainly an accurate depiction of what life may have been like for a Roman Gladiator.  I'm just not sure it's something I needed to see in such gory detail.

1284581,5,B00003CXE6,"This film is probably the best blockbuster of the summer. It has grisly and rousing action, wonderful technical direction from Ridley Scott, and masterful performances from Crowe and Pheonix.
Flaws always first. The opening battle sequence is confusing, and tries to be chaotic, when it is just incoherent. However, the rest of the film justifies Scott's technical brilliance (more on that later). The screenplay isn't as much a story told with action sequences but a string of action sequences with some connecting thread. However, it allows for some great acting. The script introduces a startling relationship between Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) and his sister Lucilla (Connie Nelson), giving Pheonix and added dimension to chew through.
And does he ever. One of his three films this year, Pheonix proves that he can act in several diverse roles. This will probably garner him on Oscar nomination. His snivelling, ambitious emperor provides a fine foil for Crowe's Maximus. Crowe finally cements his star status with this film, after amazing turns in The Insider and L.A. Confidential. His performance is brutal and intense. In fact, the screenplay spares nothing on his character, giving Crowe several powerful scenes (the climax, his prison conversation with Lucilla, and his earlier conversation with Marcus Aurelius). He'll probably get an oscar nod as well.
Now, the direction of Ridley Scott. I am a huge fan of his, so I was pleased to see him handle both the technical and narrative direction with equal aptitude. His technical direction is superb, ranking with Blade Runner, Legend and Alien. For the balance, he has paid attention to the story (as in Thelma and Louise and Someone to Watch over Me). And it has paid off handsomely. Look for Gladiator to have the most nominations at the academy awards this year",978307200,,1823,5.141414141414141

Essentially it's the same kind of plot as Braveheart, but set in the Roman Empire.  While it is visually and musically stunning, the movie is extremely brutal.  It's major flaw was the weakness of the plot and the lack of character development of some of the players, despite some great acting.  It's worth renting, particularly if you have a really large screen tv, but I don't think that your collection will be lacking if you leave this off of your buy list.

This might be because this 2.5 hr movie only has 1.25 hrs of plot. Even with all this extra time, nobody thought to add a little dialogue to clean up all the loose ends. For example, after the early battle, he says he wants to go home to his farm & family. If he had said his farm was in Spain (easily done)then it would make sense that he was called the Spaniard when he was a slave. This is just one of many examples of this films many failures.

Its very acurate at showing Rome at its peak, it has awesome fight/battle scenes, and shows that everything in the Gladiator games does inspire modern sports entertainment like pro wrestling. Russel Crowe displayed acting chops and sheer screen presance through out the film, and doesn't appear to be to overly physicly developed for the time it takes place in. My only problem with the movie is that several key plot points seem to have been lifted right out of Braveheart.

1284681,4,B00003CXE6,"This is a very good, well acted movie. The story centers around a general in the Roman legion who is enslaved and becomes a gladiator of reknown, called the Spaniard.
The general, Maximus, esteemed by all the legionaires that he commands, is a favorite of the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. The Emporer has a son, Commodus, and a daughter, Lucilla. While Lucilla is clearly the worthier of the two to inherit her father's empire upon his death, she cannot by virtue of her gender. The Emperor knows his son to be unworthy to rule in his stead, as Commodus is totally devoid of character and craven. So, Marcus Aurelius, knowing that his health is failing, tells Maximus of his wish to declare him protector of Rome upon his death, in hopes of returning Rome to the people, as a Republic. Unfortunately, Marcus Aurelius makes the mistake of telling his son the same, thereby bringing about his death at the hands of Commodus.
Commodus, now Emporer, extends the olive branch to Maximus who refuses, knowing that something unsavory has happened to Marcus Aurelius, for whom he had great affection. Rebuffed, Commodus has Maximus arrested with an order for his execution, as well as the ravaging of his lands and the slaughter of his wife and small son. Maximus escapes execution, but does not make it home in time to save his family. Captured by slave traders, he is sold and becomes a gladiator known as the Spaniard. This is all I will tell you about the plot. Watch the movie and see for yourself.
Suffice to say that Russell Crowe gives a masterful and powerful perfomance as Maximus. Yet, I think Joaquin Phoenix gives an extraordinary performance as the the evil and sinister Commodus. His role is not a majestic, heroic one, but for that reason alone, his performance is, to my mind, the more compelling one, as it is stangely moving. If there are any Oscar recognized performances to be eked out of this film, he should certainly receive strong consideration for best supporting actor.  As to the special effects, I was disappointed because, at times, the special effects were noticable; that is, you could occasionally tell when special effects were being employed. It does not necessarily detract from the film; it is just a little jarring to be aware of it.

This beautifully executed, gorgeously photographed and wonderfully acted film is also (unfortunately) almost totally unoriginal. Avid filmgoers have already seen this again and again, even down to the tiresome clichs like the perplexing convention that all nefarious despots seem be a tad effeminate. There will be few surprises for those who have seen such films as the two versions of Ben-Hur (1926, 1959), The Robe (1953), Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954) and Spartacus (1960), not to mention Anthony Mann's equally sprawling The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) of which this is very close to being a remake.
Ridley Scott makes it all palatable to modern audiences who have come to expect large doses of snazzy computer graphics and frenetic action scenes (with the concomitant sprinklings of realistic gore). Here Scott brilliantly employs the ""strobe effect"" photography which Spielberg put to good use recently in his Saving Private Ryan. Alas, some of these scenes are completely over-the-top, with Crowe easily disposing of five or six heavily armed opponents without even breaking a sweat -- glaring incongruities, and often unintentionally laughable, in an otherwise beautifully detailed and painstakingly accurate treatment.

1284769,3,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is a dark and violent tale laced with some very cool action sequences. Like Spartacus, it tries to be an old-style sweeping epic, while on the other hand, it tries to be a dark story of revenge, not unlike the very cool Conan the Barbarian. Strangely, it's not a great example of either of these things. As impressive as the scope is, the plot of Gladiator is both dull and familiar. Part of the problem is that the character of Maximus has no complexity. He's a one-note hero, a generic good guy on a noble mission. Crowe does a lot of contemptible sneering at the bad guys, but doesn't have enough material to shape a 3-dimensional persona. You never doubt that Maximus will triumph because he's clearly set up to; he lacks the even the slightest sense of depth, so there's no reason for him to be in the movie except to triumph. Another problem is that, while the action scenes are good, the rest of the picture is painfully slow. I'm talking ""Masterpiece Theatre"" slow. Characters talk in cliches or give laborious soliloquies. I believe that it's hard to write or perform characters from Roman times because it was so far back in history; the primary source material for writers or actors feels like it comes only from other films.
At its heart, Gladiator wants to be the next Braveheart. You know, the period epic that obtains a loyal legion of fans and goes on to win a handful of Oscars. The difference is that Braveheart was more strongly conceived; it knew what it was about and what it wanted to say. Gladiator, meanwhile, serves up some amazing bits of action, but begs you to take it seriously the rest of the time.",978048000,,1638,4.555932203389831

1284772,5,B00003CXE6,"This is probably one of the best movies I have seen lately. After seeing it, it lets you wondering, full of wishful thinking and wanting for more. Although ""Gladiator"" is a movie where no expenditure was cut short, the true heart of it is the way it projects the timeless values of the betrayed, incredibly charismatic hero who fights until the end to avenge the death of his loved ones, with a past, unforgotten love lurking around all the time. We get a taste of life in Ancient Rome as well, with its vices and abuses and, above all, its ""grandeur"". The animations of Rome are so accurate, one almost regrets having missed it for 1800 years. Russell Crowe in the role of Maximus gives an award winning performance for which he will be remembered forever as the ""actor of Gladiator"". He gets deep into the emotions of Maximus, his character, showing us not only his bravery but also - and this is very important - his vulnerability. Moreover he has the gift of a fantastic, deep voice, which adds to the drama of the story and wraps it up spectacularly with a soundtrack that is both glorious at times as well as morose.
The scenes are shot with great care and realism. The one with the tigers is fantastic; but I find the one where Maximus' rage has no limits and kills everyone in the arena by himself the most intense.
After Russell Crowe's marvel of a performance I second Oliver Reed's and Richard Harris'. Both masters of their task, they also give award winning performances; Reed as the wise ex-gladiator who helps Maximus with his tactics; and Harris as the last Great Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Sadly, Oliver Reed passed away close to the end of the movie and the last scene in which he appears is an animation of his character.
I commend everyone in this film, especially the director, Ridley Scott, for giving us the opportunity to enjoy an epic of timeless values in our modern world, so much devoid of them.",977961600,,1927,4.572254335260116

1284884,5,B00003CXE6,"Too often Hollywood presents charachters that we don't get to understand and if we do we wish that we didn't. While the last Gladiator spectacle (Spartacus)was released some forty years ago both movies share development of charachters that interest us and make us want to know more.
Most of the roles in Gladiator are interesting and in every case we want to know more about these people. The Director allows us to learn the good and bad of people. It is easy to like Crowe's charachter as he stands for most of what we would like to think is right with people: noble, honest, loyal, etc.
The characterization of Phoenix in the Commodus role is powerful as while he is clearly not a good person we can feel his pain and his need to be accepted by both his Father and his People. That he turns to such violence when he does not receive that love and approval makes and the manner of the performance by Phoenix all the more special. It is always easy to hate a ""bad guy"" but the depth of the emotions generated by him makes us pity him as we might a wounded animal.
A superb movie at all levels which really breaks new ground in the epic genre. A special salute to Hans Zimmer for one of the most exciting and thought provoking musical scores in years. Also to Oliver Reed in his final role. This movie is destined to become a classic and should do quite well at the Golden Globes and Oscars in 2001.",977875200,3,1398,4.3396946564885495

I missed the opportunity of going to see it at the theatre (either that or I did not want to sit for 2.5hours in a uncomfortable chair :)  Anyway, I was amazed at the quality of the DVD.  I am even more impressed that it is better quality then the theatre version. They fixed the colours and what not.  The story itself was simply astonishing, it followed true Roman history and even incorporated various historical battles such as the remaking of the battle of carthage, which I thought to be a nice touch.

I was so impressed with the story, cinematography, acting, and special effects that when combined witht the action scenes and the attention to historical detail in Roman culture...I was blown away.  It is a powerful movie too.  Not to ruin the ending, but after a heroic battle, a few lines by Lucilla brought tears to my eyes.  It is a wonderful story about love, honor, revenge, and betrayal.  It is not short of political intrigue nor unfulfilled romance.
Gladiator will not disappoint.  The bonus disk that comes in addition to the movie is superb and very insightful.  I would not recommend this movie for children as there are scenes that are quite graphic and there are incestuous overtones as well.

The DVD is excellent as well.  Russel Crowe (Maximus) does a great job convincing us he is moral man with values, fighting  against a corrupt government and emporor.  However it was Jaoquin Phoenix (Commodus) who really caught my attention.  His role as a tortured soul, who never felt loved by his father (Marcus Auerlius) even in his youth, echoed throughout the film.  He is extremely convincing in his hatred and jealousy for Maximus.  This film greatly parrelled the earlier epic ""Fall of The Roman Empire"" starring Sofia Loren (who played Lucilla).

1284892,4,B00003CXE6,"Overall, Gladiator was a good movie, though it did have it's problems.  For one, it passed itself off as an action flick and turned out to be more or less a drama.  With a title like Gladiator, you'd expect more than 5 good fighting scenes over the course of two and a half hours.  The fight scenes were good, except the camera wouldn't say on one spot long enough.  It was very dizzying and jumpy.  The veiwer got the idea of what happened, but missed out on a lot of detail.  The conversation with his friend about each other's families was just a tad too much foreshadowing for the ending.  The ending was very nicely done, one of the best parts of the movie as he's making his way into the Elysium Fields.  Between fights, it was just a lot of dialouge.  Not unnecessary dialough exactly, but presented in a rather bland manner.  Commodus shouldn't have been written so whiny and cowardly, and Maximus should've showed more of the emotion that was obviously present in him.

It takes place in ancient Rome, during Marcus Aurelias' rule.  The movie begins at the beginning of a great war scene.  Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the general of the Romans, and he and his army triumph.  The opposing side has their soldiers sent to crucify Maximus's son and wife.  When he returns, he finds his family dead, his house burned, and he just falls to the ground.  He is later captured, and turned into a slave, thrown into fights to the death only to please fans.  These fight scenes that Maximus fights in are AMAZING and very real at the same time.  No Matrix-esque effects here.  All real.  Very violent, but entertaining nonetheless.  Decapitation, dismemberment, etc.  It's all here.  It's what makes Gladiator a great movie.  I won't tell any more of the story, you'll have to see it yourself.  Make it a must.  The acting is superb, the storyline/script is amazing and is actually TRUE, and it perfectly delineates what went on in ancient Rome.  Gladiator will make you laugh, cry, fear, etc.  It sends you through endless states of emotion.  It's THAT good.  Although the one part I found disgusting was the fact that Commidus was in love with his sister.  But it follows the true story, so I'll let it slide.  Note: This movie is not for the queezy!

From all angles it is superb, from costume design and musical score to special effects and the sets, and the cinematography as well. The acting is fantastic. Even lesser characters turn in finely tuned performances. Russell Crowe deserves an award for his portrayal of Maximus, the honorable ex-general who must fight his way to freedom and revenge. But Joaquin Phoenix steals the show as the insecure, shiftless emporer Commodus. He makes the new emporer a complex, multi-layered character that is very interesting. In less capable hands the part would have become a mere campy run-of-the-mill villain that would have been an insult to a movie as good as this.

Then I actually saw it and thought to myself, what a waste of money (I'm talking about the film, not my six bucks).  In the first battle, the film takes a decidedly ""Hollywood"" turn.  The battle is shot in a mixture of slow motion and blurred shots that leave everything to the imagination and leaves you hanging before the movie's hackneyed plot even begins to unfurl in its oh so predictable manor.  Compared to Braveheart, Gladiator's battles are nothing more than campy and predictable fight scenes ala John Woo films.  The acting and the characters are paper thin.  Rather than come across as a mean-spirited monarch, Juaquin Phoenix (who's bad in any movie) simply acts like a whiny baby and spends the whole movie trying to get into his sister's pants.  Russel Crowe (pure window dressing) acts like a typical Russel Crowe and spends the movie rather void of emotion.  In Ben Hur, you could see and believe the anger and fury in Charlton Heston's face when he was framed by his best friend.  In Gladiator, Crowe looks like he's trying to remember whether or not he left the oven on.  The best performance in the movie by far comes from veteran actor Richard Harris.  Unfortunately, he's not in it for too long.  The film is basically a carbon copy of oscar winning epics such as braveheart.  Man loses someone close to him and is forced into a position he doesn't want to be in.  He goes up agains tremendous odds, triumphs, earns the respect of his people, and dies in the end, and right before he dies, Crowe sees a vision of his deceased family (Braveheart anyone?).

1285052,2,B00003CXE6,"When I first saw the battle scene and heard the battle cry of the Germania barbarians, I had to replay that scene a couple of times to make sure of what I was hearing. I thought that somehow a soundtrack from another movie made in 1964 had been accidentally included with this film. The 1964 movie I'm referring to is called ""Zulu"" and is based on an actual battle in January of 1879 between British troops and Zulu warriors in South Africa.
So based upon this ""historically inaccurate"" event, what are we to deduce? That the Zulu nation of 1879 used the same war cry as the Germanic tribes of 180 A.D. because they were somehow descendents and migrated from North Central Europe to South Africa?
I wonder if the same people responsible for this gaffe had worked on ""Zulu"", if they would have had the Zulu warriors yelling ""Banzai""?
""Gladiator"" was OK. I probably had preferred that Commodius had been dispatched as he actually had been from the historical point of view, and that Maximus had escaped, been reunited with his army and returned to Rome to battle Quintus and then found out he had been cheated out of his revenge with Commodius.
Another point between ""Zulu"" and ""Gladiator"" - in 1964 there were no computer enhancements done for ""Zulu"". What you saw was real, not digitally done to show the overwhelming force of Zulu warriors. Also the battle scenes were more ""stable""....shot in real time....not done in 3 different speeds then spinning from here to there and back again.",977184000,7,1487,4.7011494252873565

Most of the movie is a bunch of dialogue and more than half of it has no significance to the story. The special effects are OK but not spectacular. Some of the more ambitious shots look about as realistic as a CG cinema from a video game.  I don't see how a lot of citics think it's one of the best movies ever made. It's not a perfect film. I seem to be the only one who agrees with Ebert who gave this film 2 stars out of 4.

Russell Crowe did a fabulous job portraying the main character, Maximus, and all the supporting actors were absolutely fabulous. The plot was somewhat captivating and easy to follow. However, it seemed to be on the same gore level as Braveheart (but, then again, what can you expect? Ancient Romans had a pretty sick sense of entertainment. I mean, who likes to watch people die gruesome deaths?). Though the actors and writers did an above average job, the directing could have been done better by a junior-high student. The camera was constantly switching positions, and except for a few longer speeches, mostly made by Maximus, the camera never stayed in the same position for more than five seconds. Secondly, throughout the movie, the director always goes to this overly-symbolic, confusing, unmentioned, unimportant scene with Maximus running his hand through a field (what is that supposed to signify?).

1285057,3,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator wants to be Ben-Hur, really.  There's no denying that the costumes, sets, visual effects, and gore are spectacular, but that's where the glory ends.  Russell Crowe is powerful and convincing in his role as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful as the sniveling coward Commodus, but the talents of these men are nearly overshadowed by the film's incredible length.
Many of the scenes involve, of course, the gladiator contests, and it is in these that we see Maximus' power as both a survivor and superior fighter.  But in all honesty, about an hour into the movie, you feel as though you've been watching it much longer.  The film moves slowly and never seems to gain any real momentum.  You can fall asleep at many points in the movie, wake up, and be completely caught up in a few minutes, as I did.  The slaughter of Maximus' family doesn't quite pull at your heart like I think the director wanted it to.  I found myself more annoyed that Maximus wouldn't assume the power that Marcus was bequeathing him.
That said, the extra DVD that accompanies the film is wonderful!  There are interviews, behind-the-scenes trivia, and a section of clips that ended up on the cutting room floor.  I really enjoyed watching the short segment on the costumes and special makeup required for the battle scenes.  The extra DVD has all sorts of goodies that are a DVD-owners dream!  If you're a big fan of the film and you own a DVD player, then this will be a great addition to your collection.

But I cant help but think the makers of this film were trying to give the viewer the same feel and intensity as Braveheart, which to me will go down as the best epic movie ever.  This film is good, but it is no Braveheart.",977097600,,500,4.413043478260869
1285178,3,B00003CXE6,"Looking at the sheer no. of reviews generated by this movies indicated that the movie is popular, at least in the commercial sense.  I always suspect everyone talks about this movie just because there has been no such kind of movie released for a long time. But it actually reminds me of ""Spartucus"" played by Kirk Douglas 40 (wow!) years ago.
Same as Spartucus, Maximus represents the figure (or was he a hero?) struggling against the established regime.  The story portrays Maximus (played by Russel Crowe) as a tragic person rather than a hero.  As a noble general (he has a closed relationship to Ceasar and an affection of Caesar's daughter Lucilla), Maximus lacks the same charisma as Spartucus, though he may be fiercer.  He can fight and win battle after battle.  But fate determines that he is the enemy to the heir of the dying Caesar, Emperor Commondus (played by Jaoquin Phoenix).
The movie does convey the good and evil between the two persons vividly, not unlike Ridley Scott's prior movies (Aliens). But then again, this is somewhat simplistic in Scott's world: there is only two sides, good and evil, and the good will always win the eternal battle against the bad in the end.  Not many would agree this in summation.
In the 60's, a movie like this would be called ""epic"", ""grand"".  Nowadays, everybody knows everything ""grand"" in the movie is digital: the Germania battle, the Arena, the people..... You won't really get the feeling that you were there.  You are just watching a movie, if not a cartoon.
Gladiator is not a bad movie, but certainly not one of the best. You know this movie lacks something.  It is sometimes superficial, sometimes intrigued.  You have a mixed feeling and you are not sure whether you like it or not. To the Lisa Gerrard's fan, the soundtrack may be a consolation.  To the Scott's fan, they may look the ""Aliens"" again because Emperor Commondus is no Alien.",977097600,2,1905,4.742424242424242

The DVD is way above average when it comes to features.  It is also equipped with Dolby Digital sound that can turn any home entertainment system into your personal movie theater.
The movie is great!  Russell Crowe gives a stellar performance.  The movie is action packed and full of graphic fighting scenes.  It's funny to see some of the trailers on the DVD, because they try to make this movie out to be some kind of sappy love story.  This movie is about love, but the love that the trailers are refering to.  The love in this movie is Maximus' love for the old emporer and for his family.  It isn't sappy at all.  The violence in the movie is extremely graphic, but the story line is terrific and it is wonderfully done with terrific acting and a great musical score by Hans Zimmer.

  This film has grand special effects that transport us back to Ancient Rome. We are able to see the splendour, the atrocity, and moral decay that was Rome.

1285182,5,B00003CXE6,"If every DVD included the extras that this version of Gladiator contains, there would be at least one DVD player in every American household within 6 months. It's beautiful to see a package that puts it all together.
As for the movie: There are a lot of flaws, but the upside is too far up to rate it lower than 5 stars. The main flaws are in the script, which includes far too many canned soliloquys and too much informational dialogue. Other problems crop up in the area of logistics (for instance, how did his hands get untied? isn't it illegal for a Roman citizen to be enslaved? etc.)
But the numerous strokes of genius far outweigh these problems. For one thing, the movie utilizes ""scenes from the collective consciousness"" to great effect and give the movie a sense of dignified closure that I've never seen elsewhere. Stunning. Honest, my favorite scene in the movie is the brief opening shot of Maximus with his hand running through the wheat. Beautiful idea. The use of such visual tokens keep the emotional tension in the movie going until its perfect release at the end.
Also very notable were the performances of Crowe & Phoenix. Crowe's facial expressions told more than most of the dialogue in the movie combined. Phoenix was incredible as a tormented, unloved, and even pitiable tyrant -- he was perfect in this role.",976924800,,1334,4.705128205128205

Not only do you get Dolby Digital, but you also get DTS on the same disc! In the past everyone has said that ""You can't put both on the same disc! There'll be no room for any extras!"" And they would be right. So DreamWorks piled all the extras, and there are a lot of them, onto a second disc, in an innovative package that is the same size as a single disc box.
The extras disc is packed! Deleted scenes, storyboards, a making-of documentary, some gladiator history, a feature on the score, stills, a ""diary"" written by the young actor who plays Lucius, and much, much more!

1285384,2,B00003CXE6,"Somewhere in Ridley Scott's grandly engineered epic, hammered on and tinkered with by a horde of writers and rewriters, is a flesh-and-blood story that gets lost in all the bread and circuses.
Crowe plays Maximus, the most-trusted general serving the aging Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), leading troops into battle against Germania in 180 A.D. But Marcus Aurelius wants Maximus to fight a tougher opponent -- the corruption of Rome -- by taking power after the emperor's death and restoring the republic. Maximus is reluctant, preferring to return to his wife and son, but he agrees to serve his Caesar. But his Caesar doesn't last too long, thanks to Marcus Aurelius' snotty son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Daddy and takes the throne - and orders Maximus and his family executed. Maximus escapes, only to be captured by slave traders who train him as a gladiator. Maximus gets a chance at revenge on Commodus when his owner/promoter, Don King, er, Proximo (Oliver Reed), gets Maximus the big gig at the original Caesar's Palace - the Colosseum. Maximus is a hit with the crowd, setting him against Commodus in a battle for the hearts and minds of Rome.
Gladiator is pretty to watch but doesn't have enough plot to be a Roman epic (and what plot it has is pinched from Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus), and too much plot to be an action movie (even with the 2-1/2 hour running time). A few things get muddled in the course of things, like the relationship between Commodus' sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and Maximus (or, Lucilla's relationship with Commodus), and some intrigue with the Senate (led by Derek Jacobi, who knows his way around a toga after starring in ""I, Claudius""). Also, there is the distraction of Phoenix, who plays Roman villainy like a very weak John Malkovich.
As far as the DVD itself goes - It's awesome - Better than the movie itself. Presented in an anamorphic 2.35:1 transfer, the visual presentation found on the Gladiator: Signature Collection is an almost flawless recreation of the film as I saw it theatrically. The jerky visuals of the war sequences come across as faithfully as the polished exteriors in Rome. The varying degrees of color saturation are rendered amazingly well, from the drab, washed out exteriors in Germania to the earthy tones of Zucchabar, and the vibrant cityscape of Rome. The print is almost completely free from any debris or other imperfections, and appears to have suffered only very slight edge enhancement in a few scenes, making for a wonderfully clean, sometimes polished, but always film-like image. The DVD includes a full-length audio commentary by Director Ridley Scott, Editor Peitro Scalia, and Director of Photography John Matieson. This is a great commentary track that appeals to the more technically oriented film fan. The topics range from Scott's views on historical accuracy, to motivating the actors, to the challenges of making a film of this nature, and more.
There is also a section aptly titled From the Cutting Room Floor. Included here are 11 deleted scenes, playable with or without commentary by Director Ridley Scott, that range from 30 seconds to 4 minutes. The 2.35:1 non-anamorphic scenes look quite nice, but have obviously not been through the same postproduction processing as the main feature. In addition to the deleted scenes, there is a 7-minute montage of deleted snippets of footage that is accompanied by the music of Hans Zimmer...this is, for all intents and purposes, a music video. The Making of Gladiator is a 25-minute feature that is pretty much the typical ""cable television promotional making of"" that we've all come to know and love. The use of Zimmer's music throughout this featurette lends a certain charm to the piece that some similar programs lack...and if nothing else, the antics and charisma of Russell Crowe make this one worth watching even if such material isn't normally to your liking. A nice, and somewhat surprising inclusion is the 50-minute TLC program Gladiator Games: Roman Blood Sport - Very informative. Along with other very cool extras, this DVD is simply a must purchase.",976838400,6,4125,5.023357664233576

The action of Ben Hur and fine writing of a great epic film screenplay combined with up-to-date, understated digital technology and a wonderful ensemble cast - this film is a  visually spectacular and sonically intoxicating.  Ridley Scott manages to put the viewer in the middle of the Roman Empire the way George Lucas hurled his viewers through outer space - but with Gladiator I didn't even suspect half of what I was seeing was digitally generated background scenery and backdrops until I saw the ""making of"" featurettes on the DVD.
In addition to Russell Crowe's great performance, both Richard Harris (Camelot) as Marcus Aurelius and Joaquin Phoenix (Parenthood, 8mm) as Commodus, his son and heir to the empire, turn in Oscar worthy performances.  The late Oliver Reed (Oliver, Tommy) also does a wonderful job.  The costumes, the special effects, the cinematography, and the sound are something to be experienced at home, in DTS, on a good surround sound system.
This 2 DVD set is PACKED with special features, including quite a few ""Making of"" featurettes and an interview with Hans Zimmer, the soundtrack composer.
My only criticism of the film - and I am a Lone Ranger on this point - is the musical soundtrack to the film sounds to my ears like other soundtracks (Bram Stoker's Dracula, for instance) and classical pieces (Mars from the Planets by Gustav Holst) that have been thinly disguised and re-arranged by the composer.  I honestly don't know if this is coincidence or intentional, but only devout ST and classical music fans will notice this.  Thank God it doesn't detract from the film, and in some places the ST is quite effective.  It is a shoe-in for an Oscar nomination.  Sonically - the film is superb.

Joaquin and Russell work amazingly well. It is hard to distinguish a better performance between them. They are two actors at the top of their game. It is amazing to me the transition Russell Crowe made from his last role (in the Insider) to the role of Maximus in this film. Richard Harris is brilliant as Marcus Aurelius, and Djimon Hounsou is incredible as Juba, one of Maximus' allies in the gladiator ring.
The special effects are unnoticable, which is the highest compliment a special effect can receive.
The script, although somewhat predictable, also had some tricks up its sleeve. The pairing of Commodus and Maximus in the final bout was unexpected, yet perfect.
The battle scene, and some of the bout scenes, seemed to tear a page out of Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, as the cinemtography, and general feeling reminded me of the first battle in Saving Private Ryan. However, it worked well with this film also.

Most obviously, this is Braveheart, but it is as well numorous other recent films, including borrowing the bizarre spirituality of Messanger.  Did I mention that the movie was set in a dark, miserable time?
Besides the tiring plot, the pretentious, silly, third person dialogue and myriad accents nearly draw laughter.  Third person works for Shakespeare, particularly when the production doesn't try to produce accents.  In this film, we have New York, Australian, California, English and Nordic accents.  It is painful -- particularly in light of the fact that most of these areas were not known to the Roman empire.
Still, the visuals are Scottian.  And, that we expect from his great films and commercials.  Still, it is not enough to remove this movie from its misery.
Perhaps most troubling is the disclaimer at the end of the film stating to the effect that great care was taken to protect animals from harm.  It does not, however, say that no animals were in fact harmed.  That is truly sad considering that this film is no leap forward in art and that Tigers and Giraffes have their own problems in the wild.  The horse scenes were brutal and, I suspect, it would be difficult to train any of these animals without some degree of abuse.

1285581,5,B00003CXE6,"You really get yor money's worth with ""Gladiator""! This is a DVD lover's dream come true --- an epic movie loaded with tons of extras. First and foremost, this two-disc set features a beautiful widescreen print of one of the most visually stunning films in Hollywood's history. Director Ridley Scott and crew bring Ancient Rome to life in a grandiose fashion not seen since ""Ben Hur"". The images are so crisp and 3-dimensional that it's hard to believe so much of this film is computer generated. The DTS sound really delivers. Crank it up during the intensely  thrilling Roman Coliseum battles. It's like being front-row and center as the heroic Maximus (Russell Crowe) slays both man and beast during some of the most riveting fight scenes ever filmed. Of course, all the visual effects in the world are worthless if the movie itself fails to deliver. No worry here. The tension between Maximus and Emperor Commodus (a wonderfully evil Joaquin Phoenix) carries ""Gladiator"" from beginning to bloody end. Phoenix is one of the creepiest bigscreen villains of all-time-- a snide, backstabing traitor. Crowe, however, is as heroic as Phoenix is evil. I guarantee you'll cheer Crowe's every move during their imminent showdown. It's a battle of pure bloody vengeance which, in terms of thrills, is unsurpassed.
Just as satisfying as the film itself is the second disc which is packed with extras. Included are a ""making of"" mini-documentary, and a pair of ""behind the scenes"" featurettes which provide a lot of interesting insight. Director Scott provides an informative audio commentary which I found to be nearly as good as the movie itself. And if all this isn't enough, you get a ton of deleted scenes (complete with commentary) and a gallery of still photos from the set of ""Gladiator"". Overall, this is a first-rate DVD. It's not often that a film of such epic proportions is packaged so well for the home theatre crowd. In fact, the extras alone are worth the price of admission. Highly recommended for action fans.

If a movie like American Beauty can win Best Picture, Gladiator will walk away with it this year. Even though it has been a bad year for quality films, that really wouldn't have made a difference because Gladitor, in my opinion is the best overall film made in decades and it would've taken alot to beat it. Perhaps the business knew this and are waiting until next year to release the better quality stuff.
Hats of to Ridley Scott for what will be a long awaited and deserved Oscar for Best Picture and Director. What can I say, it has potential for Best Actor: Russell Crow, Best Supporting Actor: Joachim Phoenix or Richard Harris, Best Actress: Connie Nielsen, Original Score: Zimmerman (that's a guarantee), Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Cinematoraphy and the list goes on. This movie has the potential to win the most oscars of any single film to date because it will grab the special effects awards traditionally given to sci-fi movies.

1285584,4,B00003CXE6,"I have always loved gladiator films, and it has been a really long time since one came along, so when I found out they were making this particular film with Russell Crowe(sigh!) and directed by Ridley Scott who is always interesting and many times just a little bit bloody which is perfect for a gladiator film, I was thrilled to bits.  I had the opportunity to view this film on the big screen and then recently on DVD, and the contrast was informative.
The battle scenes on the big screen seemed to me somewhat chaotic, a criticism that sometimes has me rubbing my forehead, because in a way it added a realism to the scenes; I am certain battle is much like that most times.  It did, however, take me out of the movie a little because it made me wonder if Ridley was getting too artsy-fartsy with it or if the guy in charge of editing was drinking way too much coffee.  I loved the ash falling like snow.  It added a sense of immediacy and realism that put me back into ancient Rome.  The computer graphics were breathtaking; clearly there was someone in charge who really cared about how ancient Rome really looked.
As for the acting, as much as I love Russell Crowe who always does a good job, and as moved as I was with the knowlege that this was the last we would ever see of the late and talented bad-boy Oliver Reed, the performance that wowed me was Joachim Pheonix, in his almost perfect portrayal of Commodus, whose rule many scholars agree pretty much signaled the beginning of the end of the Roman Empire.  What a wonderful job Joachim did!  A true monster, terrifying and yet somehow sympathetic as well.  In fact, I personally believe he nearly stole the whole show.  Very talented actor.
The story-line I found very touching.  It takes a fine hand to make tragedy appealing; to underscore the sadness in such a way that one feels they gained something in the telling of the story, instead of being dragged down by it, is a technique that in this case should be shared by the creator of the story(I'm sorry, I immediately lent it out to friends and so cannot check who that was), Ridley, and Russell.  Scott and Crowe show in this film what professionalism really is--the play's the thing, didn't Shakespeare once say?--and that is what both men focussed on.  What all of them focussed on, in fact.
I've gone on too long.  I think you'll like Gladiator if you liked The Thirteenth Warrior or both Cleopatra movies(Elizabeth Taylor and the more recent one starring Billy Zane as Mark Anthony); also anyone who enjoyed the brilliant mini-series I, Claudius may enjoy this film.  Plus those of you who have read Colleen McCullough's incredible series of roman books, starting with The First Man in Rome to her most recent, Caesar, will most likely enjoy this movie as well.

But the reality and facts of ancient history, is a constant reminder of brutality and no empathy towards one self and others. Previous movies made about Roman Empire and other places in the ancient world, always portray the personality of a hero with no credible knowledge of his/her livelihood. In this case - Gladiator - we feel what a strategic man is experiencing in a brutal environment. We see his dreams, honor and struggle in balancing the rationale of right and wrong. At the same time, unlike other movies, we feel sympathetic towards the bad guy too. Most of us feel happy when the bad guy looses the battle. But in this case the director cleverly portrays the personality of the bad guy by revealing his articulate thoughts, fears and the dreams of grandeur. It makes you feel sorry that he chose a twisted path in life.

The cutting room scenes are excellent!  I don't know why they had to take them out, but they provide real insight into the depth of the story.

1285670,2,B00003CXE6,"If films were judged by looks alone, then this one would truly be a classic. The film is Ridley Scott's attempt at a post millennial sword and sandals epic akin to SPARTUCUS or BEN HUR though the final product bears a closer resemblance to CONAN THE BARBARIAN plus some added pretension. With GLADIATOR it's obvious that Scott really wanted to make an important film rather than an exploitive action yarn like CONAN, though his expository scenes are dull and lacking in the charge of his spastic action sequences. Still, even those sequences really don't work on quite the level they're supposed to.
Thus begins our B-movie epic: Maximus (Russell Crowe in what would have been the Jean-Claude Van Damme role had this film been made a mere 10 years ago) is picked (for very hackneyed political reasons) by the emperor of Rome (Richard Harris, seething with Shakespearean glee) to be his replacement, but the emperor's son Commudus (Joaquin Phoenix) will have none of that. He's a greedy, whiny brat who wants to rule so badly that he kills his own father, takes his throne, then orders his guards to lead Maximus out into the woods and have him killed. The plan goes awry for Commodus when the mighty Maximus (I smell a HERCULES spin-off waiting in the wings) escapes in a rousing and appropriately brutal getaway. He races on foot back to his picturesque commode hoping to be greeted by his family, only when he arrives they've already been killed by Commudus' minions. Our hero passes out and is eventually picked up by slave traders--the kind of slave traders who roam the countryside searching for unconscious victims of those corrupt Romans. You know the kind. He's sold to Proximo (Oliver Reed, sharper than ever in his final performance), a former gladiator and current trainer. After Maximus endures some qualifying bouts under the reluctant guidance of Proximo, he makes his way up to the much-dreaded Coliseum.
My biggest caveat with the flick is how hollow its script is. No emotion feels true; it's as if the screenwriters poured over BRAVEHEART in an attempt to transport that story to the time of the Coliseum. And with no help from Ridley Scott who seems to think that he can compensate for that lack of depth by giving us lengthy expository scenes and making his characters overly gloomy. Those expository scenes are akin to the political trial scenes in STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE, which virtually everyone will agree were dramatically inert, passionless, and, well, boring. GLADITOR's expository scenes are just as tedious, and while the dialogue is mostly decent and the performances are above par, there's nothing behind it all, no subtext, no character.
The battle scenes are easily some of the worst edited in some time. The very first fight (meant to establish Crowe as a fighting man's general of war) begins with nightsky-scraping flaming arrows that dash across in the twilight emitting a magically-lethal orange glow. As the conflict rages, the camera angles become increasingly narrowed and the screen full of flames and blurred soldiers in slow mo. But the effect becomes over-digitized in a strobe reminiscent of a consumer camera, subtracting from the realism and gravity of the fight. And instead of continuing the ever-tightening angle to personalize the savagery, a few mid-wide shots are tossed in. It breaks up the direction of the sequence and ruins the hypnotic effect.
Nevertheless, people are eating this film up. There is a ton of extra features on the DVD and no doubt it will go down as a classic for generations to enjoy -- *sigh*",976060800,4,3576,4.932006633499171

Everything about this movie clicked.  The casting is superb.  The classic story of revenge is well written into the time period, and superbly acted out.  The action scenes kick butt and leave you hungry for more, particularly those in the Colosseum.
If the Academy doesn't give this film the Best Picture Oscar next year, I will be highly disappointed.  I think Russell Crowe equally deserves at least a nod for Best Actor, although he will have some tough competition in Tom Hanks (Castaway) and Mel Gibson (The Patriot).

1285672,5,B00003CXE6,"I still don't understand why most people who review DVD's only talk about the movie itself.  If you're like me, you already have seen a DVD before you buy it, right?  So I'm going to tell you about what you really need to know:  How does this DVD sound?  How does this DVD look?  Are the extra features any good?
First things first.  If you haven't seen this movie, you need to go out and do so.  It is THAT good.  Okay, now that that's out of the way, we can get to the other stuff.  We'll start off with the picture transfer.  The picture in this DVD is great.  I can't say that it's as clean as say, A Bug's Life or Toy Story (which are pretty much transferred straight from the hard drive to the disc with nothing in between), but I can say that the picture is great.  As a matter of fact it's among the best.
Next: the sound.  Now the sound is simply AWESOME.  Not only does it have 5.1 Dolby Digital, but it also has DTS 6.1.  Both sound great.  The opening battle scene alone is great for showing off that killer sound that you have in your high end system.  Even if you don't have a receiver that decodes 6.1, you can still get a great 5.1 DTS sound using the 6.1 sound option that the disc offers (you'll just be missing the one extra rear speaker) and it still sounds great.  So as long as your receiver or DVD player decodes DTS and 5.1, you can get great DTS 5.1 sound.  You'll literaly hear, feel, and see the sound of flaming arrows fire from left to right and vice versa.  If you're an audiophile like I am, you'd buy this DVD just becuase of the great sound alone.  While on the subject of sound, I must also mention that this movie has one the best muscial scores/soundtracks of any movie.  The music just adds an entire other dimension to the movie, and suits the movie so well.
Finally, there are the extra features.  This DVD has tons.  Deleted scenes, documentaries, behind the scenes, etc.  It's got so much that there is an entire disc devoted to it.  I thought it was interesting to see how Russell Crowe really was outside his Gladiator character.  This DVD scores VERY high marks in this category.
So all in all, this DVD is worth EVERY penny and then some.  It has everything you can ask for!  Now even if you thought the movie was only decent (there are actually a few that might think this), the other areas are so great that you still have to pick this DVD up.  The only thing that I thought they could have added that they didn't think of?  I think it would be cool to have an audio option where you can just watch movie with only the music and nothing else (the Matrix DVD has this option), but that's only becuase I love the soundrack so much.  Now if this is my only complaint, how good can this DVD be?  This DVD is that good, and then some.  And more.  Whatever your last DVD purchase was, well, I'm confident enough that I'd bet that it wasn't better than this one.",976060800,17,2902,4.195652173913044

Then comes the great story line.  It was just good writing and scripting.  The characters are all very interesting and likeable and pitiful.  Joaquin Phoenix put on a performance that is probably the envy of many actors.  And of course Russell Crowe is great to cheer for.  I don't think there is quite perfection here,  but I have yet to see a film that is perfect.  In many ways,  this one comes close.

There's a feeling after a very short while into the film, that it might never end.  The screenplay, its characters, the actors who portray them are entirely gratuitous, and serve no purpose than to justify the choreographed violence that takes up two thirds of this very long film.  This is a movie that Ridley Scott made because he could, not because he should.  The whole thing seems designed merely to show off the (art) director's flamboyant, and shamelessly artificial vision of a high-tech antiquity.  The plot is nonsense.  Why is our hero allowed to live past the first thirty minutes of this movie, for example?  The digitalized cinematography is gaudy and overwrought.

""GLADIOTOR"" is the story of Loyalty, Betrayal, Deceit, broken love, and the demons that haunt a young man as he go's thru life having no choice but to murder innocent people, at the command of his master.  Russel Crowe is very convinceing in the title role, and the supporting cast adds to the overall effect as well.

However, the pagendry and scope still prevails, alowing moviegoers of all generations to appreciate a work of art.  The Cinematography is excellent, never have I seen the city of Rome photographed so well.  Set designs are again flawless, buetiful.  It is difficult to turn away from Ridley Scott's latest epic,who, by the way, hasn't fallen victim to the ravidges of the modern movie, which use sex and violence to lure their audience in.

To his credit Ridley Scott has taken the simplest of stories and, aided by modern technology, has produced a thundering good movie in the best tradition of Ben Hur.
It is a long time since moviemakers visited this genre but it has been worth the wait.
If the box office success is any guide then, quite clearly, the events portrayed in the movie have not lost their appeal. We may lay claim to civilization but find the prospect of recreational bloodletting just as appealing as 'the mob' which frequented the Circus Maximus.

1285812,5,B00003CXE6,"""Gladiator"" is one of those rare blockbusters that actually lives up to the hype.  Produced in the mold of old fashioned Hollywood epics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra and Spartacus, this film was every bit as spectacular as they used to make them in the heyday of the studios.  With a lavish budget and an eye for detail, director Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""GI Jane"") combines the splendor of ancient Rome (brought to life in stunning detail through awesome, computer generated visual effects) with a human story of gripping intensity, to create one of the most complete entertainment experiences I can remember in quite some time.
The story involves the fall from grace of Maximus, a famous general of the Northern Army whom Marcus Aurelius favors over his own son for succession to the throne.  When Marcus dies before making this wish known, his son Commodus is elevated and orders Maximus killed.  Maximus escapes his executioners, but is taken as a slave and turned into a Gladiator.  This sets up a dramatic confrontation between Maximus and Commodus in the Roman Coliseum.
This is an ingenious meld of fantasy and reality that plays fast and loose with historical fact.  Marcus Aurelius was, in fact, a roman Caesar during the period in question.  His portrayal as a kind and thoughtful leader was accurate.  He would come to be known historically as the ""Philosopher King"" and the ""Benevolent Dictator"".  He was also a great military leader and conqueror.  Commodus was altered considerably from historical accounts, but the essence of his evil and egocentric personality was well represented.  By historical accounts, Commodus was fair and blond.  He was not the sniveling brat who avoided battle as he was portrayed.  In fact, he fought by his father's side for the last five years of Marcus Aurelius' life.  Nor was he passed over by his father for succession.  Marcus was proud of Commodus and named him Caesar at the age of five.  He publicly named him as his successor at seventeen.
It is universally accepted that Marcus Aurelius died of plague in March of 180 A.D. and not as depicted in the film.  There is no historical record of any general named Maximus.  Commodus died in a carefully planned coup d'etat, strangled in his bath by a gladiator named Narcissus.  This is also at odds with events depicted in the film.
Despite these inaccuracies, much of this film maintained a great deal of historical authenticity.  Commodus did indeed cease the conquering wars and focused on gaining favor with ""the mob"", a derisive term used by the Patricians to describe the masses.  He would give away food and other gifts and hold extensive games to keep them amused.  He was also wildly popular for personally fighting gladiators in the arena, just as depicted.  He was a ruthless dictator, who had numerous attempts made on his life, and he routinely had Senators and other enemies executed.  His was a reign of terror and debauchery that rivaled that of Caligula.
The most impressive feat of historical authenticity was the computer generated views of Ancient Rome.  These were done in meticulous detail and consistent with what is know from records and ruins.  The costumes were also precise and authentic, as were the battle tactics seen in the opening battle.  This film brings Ancient Rome to life in a way that is more realistic than ever before.
The story was a cross between the story of Commodus and the story of Spartacus.  Spartacus was a roman soldier who deserted and who was taken into slavery, later becoming a gladiator and then the leader of a slave uprising against Rome.  (For those who enjoyed ""Gladiator"" and have never seen ""Spartacus"" starring Kirk Douglas, I highly recommend that you dig it out of the rental stacks.)
This film was a directorial masterpiece.  Though the battles were intense, the graphic violence was understated without losing effect.  Scott uses strobe photography to intensify the battle scenes rather than showing a great deal of gore.  Scott chose to emphasize the human story, binding us to Maximus emotionally through excellent character development.  This is a classic struggle of good against evil that turned the viewer into a devoted member of the Roman mob.  It is a story that hooks you and doesn't let you go.  Scott understood the importance of this and made sure that the human story didn't get lost in the spectacle.
The acting was superb.  Russell Crowe is becoming bigger than life as a box office attraction, and with good reason.  His performance was awesome, offering both physical and emotional prowess.  Joaquin Phoenix was also deliciously evil as the self tormented Commodus.  This breakout performance for Phoenix is Oscar worthy in a supporting role.  At seventy years old, Richard Harris dusted himself off for yet another powerful supporting role as Marcus Aurelius.
The sound on the DVD was excellent and it included an entire second disk of extras, including an interesting featurette on the making of the film.  It was enjoyable to have an opportunity to see another side of Russell Crowe.  He always plays such dour characters that it is fun to see him continually mugging for the camera and telling jokes.  It is refreshing to see that after all the fame he has enjoyed, he doesn't take himself at all seriously.
This film was off the rating charts.  I deducted two points for historical inaccuracies and still gave it a 10/10.  They don't make films like this anymore.  Don't miss it.",975801600,16,5479,4.919389978213507

1285816,5,B00003CXE6,"It shouldn't be necessary to say that Gladiator is a terrific epic movie. Sales continue to be high for one very good reason: it is a thrill to watch. Ridley Scott (who also directed Blade Runner, arguably the greatest science fiction movie in existance) remembers how effective a slow panning shot of a hundred flaming arrows streaking towards the enemy, or a close shot of a tiger's single swipe, can be. Crowds and long-shots of the Collesium are often computer generated, but Scott maintains a near-understatedness by focusing on a thousand extras chanting ""Maximus!"" or a recurring shot of a field of wheat for those moments of emotion. And he does it well.
The acting is also above reproach. Russell crow is a powerhouse in every shot, and Joaquin Phoenix does well as an ""evil"" emporer whose faults seem at times motivated by such personal weakness (rather than cold malevolence) that we can almost sympathize with him.
With a second disc of very entertaining extras, Gladiator is a must for anyone who genuinely enjoys movies. Watch it with the sound turned up.",975628800,3,1069,4.8791208791208796

1285818,5,B00003CXE6,"In Gladiator, Commodus says he will show the people a vision of Rome - and that is exactly what this film gives us, a vision.  Do not watch this film (or any other Roman epic, for that matter) expecting historical accuracy, watch it for the vision of Rome, which is the best that we have yet witnessed, from the bustling city streets to the torn up forests of Germania.  At the film's core, of course, are the massive spectacles of the Collosseum, which are captured quite faithfully.  There is a wonderful deleted scene on the DVD where Maximus witnesses Christians being fed to the lions between gladiator contests.  This scene shows the horror and depravity of the Roman mob through the eyes of an innocent child, clutching his mother on the sandy floor of the arena.
In addition to grand spectacle, this is probably the best DVD I have ever purchased with regard to technical detail.  The deleted scenes and documentaries are a very novel touch.  Some films have a few deleted scenes, but 25 minutes' worth!?!
If you have a DTS setup for your home theater, BUY THIS DVD.  I watched it with my parents at their home over Thanksgiving and had major reservations about the big screen spectacle's translation onto video, and then I got home and popped it in my DTS system.

Director Ridley Scott adds his touch with exquisite dream sequences and breath-taking scenery.  Along with slow motion fight sequences where you can really see the brutality of war.

Although the combat sequences are riveting, Scott deftly delivers a profound message of anti-violence, and exposes the corrupt, barbaric nature that belied the outward civility of the Roman Empire.  This film operates on several different levels, and does so effectively.
And anyone who tells you that the story is completely devoid of historical accuracy certainly doesn't know his or her Roman history.  The real Emperor Commodus did, in fact, participate in the games at the Coliseum.

I'm not going to ramble on to praise Ridley Scott and his talented production crew, or Russell Crowe and the excellent cast; I see that there are a couple hundred other people who have already done so. I wanted to post this review to chide the film's detractors. Everyone is a critic, but some of the comments that I have read are petty, ignorant, and unwarranted:
One person wrote that the film is too long to be properly compressed onto one DVD. I assume that this gentleman is a digital engineer who designs and manufactures DVDs.
Several reviewers complained about the lack of realism and unsatisfactory computer-generated effects. I understand that George Lucas' ILM company is looking for their resumes, as they must certainly know how to produce superior results.
A reviewer of the movie's soundtrack on another site derided both Hans Zimmer's majestic score and Lisa Gerrard's exquisite vocal work. With a combined output of 65 film soundtracks, other successful projects, and numerous awards over thier respective 20-year careers, you think they'd be able to get it right by now. Undoubtedly, this critic's worst composition must be much better than either Zimmer's or Gerrard's best work.
Some individuals were unhappy with Russell Crowe's performance. One in particular felt the need to comment on the actor's excessive body hair. Assumably, this person is not only a respected acting coach, but also runs his own salon.
Several patrons of the arts flexed their critic skills by blasting the director's camera work and choice of shots. Perhaps these professionals can give Mr. Scott some pointers on his next project, after they've finished dusting off thier Oscars.
Numerous observers found the script insubstantial, lacking complete story elements and character development. As far as I can discern, there is a beginning, middle, and end, conflict and compromise, well-defined characters, and resolution of the plot. Perhaps these reviewers might impart their years of film school education and scriptwriting experience to improve this weak fable.
Then there are the Rhodes scholars who found the film's story to be implausible and historically inaccurate. They might not be aware that this is a work of fiction designed to entertain people, not a documentary.
And let's not forget all those comparisons to ""Brave Heart"", ""The Patriot"", ""Spartacus"", ""Ben Hur"", and even ""Titanic"". I look forward to these reveiwers' analyses of apples and oranges sometime in the future.
Thankfully, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, regardless of accuracy or relevance. ""Gladiator"" will probably not garner the industry accolades that it deserves at the 2001 Academy Awards, but it will forever stand as one of the most impressive productions in motion picture history.

Scientists and historians alike have dedicated themselves wholly to the project of determining where we came from, and how we got to where we are now.  The empire of Rome helped build foundations both in the social and economic fronts that remain prevalent even today.  Further, all ancient civilizations which endured powerful, lenghty reigns-- the Incans, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans.  The era has fascinated me so much that I have choosen to dedicate a substantial amount of my time to the study of classics, and the Roman language, Latin.
 For me the film was a wonder.  The special effects are incredibly well-done, if not a bit too gory.  Partially inaccurate, yes; unbelievable, naturally... it's Hollywood.  But to me the key that makes a movie great is its ability to suck you in.  Can you imagine yourself right there in the action?

Gladiator was a generally good movie that could have been better. I saw two major problems: Action filming style and number of sentimental moments.  The action scenes were shot at two close a range and in most of the battle scenes used blurring affects that detracted from the viewers immersement; outweighing any artsy motivation. Toward the middle and end of the movie more of the action was seen from a distance; but often cut from one strike to another making it hard to realize the choreographing.  About the sentimental moments; the acting was wonderful and did pull on those heartstrings. My complaint is that there were just too many of those ""Powerful"" moments instead of building to a few main moments.

Every shot is beautiful, and the movie does a wonderful job of recreating the feel of the period, with wonderful recreations not just of Rome but of the Roman world.  Throw in a jaw-dropping opening battle that stands as one of the great movie openings of all time (and is the first movie to accurately recreate a Roman fortified camp) and you have a fantastic movie.

Director Ridley Scott did a wonderful job of telling this fabulous story. The first battle scene of the movie, where Rome is ready to end it's long battle and defeat and concur Germania is absolutely beautiful.  Mr. Scott leaves you is aw as the archers launch hundreds of flaming arrows through the sky on that cold winter dawn.  It was one of the most beautiful scenes of this movie.  The presence of leadership in Russell Crows character as well as his love for his family is definitely felt through out the entire film.
Ridley Scotts' performance in selecting Hans Zimmer as the composer of the score for this film must be commended.  Music is definitely one of the most important keys in the telling of any story.  Hans Zimmer has composed for many films, but the music in this particular movie touches the audience and completes the task the director set out to do. The audience will absolutely loose them selves in this fantastic story.
I rated this film with five stars for many reasons. The cinematography, the music, the story line, and the acting. I am completely satisfied.  If you are a fan of Mel Gibsons ""Brave Heart"" you will not want to miss this movie.

And the last shot of Russell Crowe walking toward his wife and son reminded me uncomfortably of that idiotic walk into the clouds at the end of another preposterous Roman epic,'The Robe.'  Kubrick's 'Spartacus' is nearly 40 years old, but it's infinitely more advanced than 'Gladiator.'",975196800,6,679,5.419047619047619

But I must say that I didn't like the ending.  I like history, and I do not like how Hollywood is re-wrirting history.  First ""The Patriot"", and now this.  When people come out of the theater, they really think that Commodus was killed by a slave, general then slave sorry.  Hollywood is filling people's, espically kid's, minds with flase information that they think is true.  I mean, come on, where were the historacal adviors in these movies?",975196800,3,622,4.54954954954955

1286074,2,B00003CXE6,"I got a laugh watching this movie times simply because the actors didn't even attempt to hide their true accents or try sounding Roman.  And if you watch the fight scene that includes Tigers, you can see the Tigers lying down (and sleeping) in the background. I doubt that this was intentional humor.
Overall, the movie was kind of a blur for the action scenes then slow and plodding during the drama.  I predicted the final outcome 20 mins into the movie and was sadly correct.  The script just didn't have any life to it.
On the positive side, Russell Crowe has a great voice and the non-incestuous sister was very attractive.  Although the computer animation was obvious, it was impressive to see Rome in all it's glory.

1286075,5,B00003CXE6,"First off, this is a great movie.  Its not necessarily revolutionary in any way, but it is simply pulled off so well.  The cinematography, majestic sceneries, excellent special effects and emotionally stirring music combine to create a very heartfelt and poetic film.  Its one of those films that can just totally immerse you from start to finish.  Gladiator has been accused of having a conventional storyline, but in my opinion it simply proves that the traditional formula of the hero epic can still make a great movie, as long as it is done the right way.  The actors do a superb job with their characters.  Russell Crowe wins the audience's heart with a very multi-dimensional portrayal of Maximus.  Maximus has the noble heart and steadfast strength of a true hero, yet his pain and quiet humility prove that he is still human.  The well filmed and choreographed fights convey the cruelty and chaos of battle without overly emphasizing graphic bloodshed.  Gladiator isn't ground breaking, but it is the best epic adventure film to come out in a long time and it keeps you enthralled and truly stirs your emotions.  This is what film making is all about.
The DVD is definitely worth buying.  The great picture quality and sound are essential in order to make the viewer truly appreciate a movie such as this.  There are also a ton of interesting extra features such as behind the scenes looks at the making of the film, production notes, TV spots and a number of deleted scenes.

1286166,4,B00003CXE6,"Russell Crowe does an admirable job portraying Maximus, a general serving Marcus Aurelus, one of the last Ceasar's in Rome sometime around 180 A.D. Maximus is betrayed and ultimately ends up as a gladiator. A gladiator was a slave who was required to fight to the death against other such slaves. Sometimes it was possible to win your freedom.
The overiding message of the film is that maintaining the virtues of strength and honor sometimes requires sacrifice and may ultimately lead to death. There is much graphic violence and I suggest you guard your mind because the movie presents a worldview full of ancestor worship, and 'all roads lead to heaven' philosophy. If you are searching for Truth you will not find it here. Also, I commend the producers for making a movie without even the briefest of nudity or unneeded sex scenes.
For a movie extolling the virtues of strength and honor as well as being full of adventure I highly recommend this film. No movie, including this one is worth over ... so I would wait for the price to drop and rent it until that day.
'The Gladiator' deserves a ten out of twelve on my rating scale and will soon, when the price drops, have a place on my top ten shelf.

Gladiator had the ability to meld every human emotional theme imaginable through sight and sound and keep me riveted to the screen for the whole 2 1/2 hours.

Very much look forward to seeing more of Russel Crowe and Ridley Scotts films in the future. The music score is awesome.",975110400,,367,4.492537313432836
1286169,3,B00003CXE6,"The theme is familiar.  Good guy sold into slavery as gladiator in ancient Rome.  I was weaned on these movies as a child -- Ben Hur, Sparticus, Samson Delilah.  These epics still echo in my memories.  And I hold similar films to a very high standard.  Alas, though, the director of Gladiator is no Cecil B. DeMille or Stanley Kubuck.  The Gladiator doesn't even get on the playing field against those giants.
That said, the Gladiator does have some good points.  Richard Harris as the dying Caesar is wonderful, and Oliver Reed as the gladiator slave dealer is great.  This last film of his is a great legacy to his talent as I understand he died during its filming.
Russell Crowe, cast as the hero Maximus is all machismo and righteous anger. Undoubtedly this role will spark his career.  It might have been the weak script or it might have been his one-dimensional portrayal, but I just couldn't get into his character.  I wanted to care and I didn't, which is a shame because it is his performance which was supposed to carry the story.
Joaquin Phoenix as the villain does a better job.  As the embodiment of evil, he is easy to hate.  The female lead, Connie Nielsen, while attractive, also played her role with a constant angry tone, which limited her appeal.
The action scenes were done with the best of computer graphics.  There's blood and gore and heads being lopped off.  Some of the scenes are done well, such as when Maximus turns the gladiators into an army and they fight against several teams of chariot fighters.  Other scenes, such as the opening one where the Roman army is conquering an enemy, are so confused that I rarely knew who the participants were.
Basically the film is 2-1/2 hours of action, with some long talky scenes in between.  Mostly, it held my interest.  But I couldn't help thinking of the good old days before computer graphics, when the epics were fueled with star power and great directing.  I'd like to see some real passion along with the violence. But perhaps I'm just getting too jaded.
However, not all movies have to be all things to all people, and the Gladiator does succeed as pure entertainment.  There's good guys and bad guys and lots of battles.  There's a feeling of history and ancient Rome. And its a way to escape from our own personal stresses.  I can recommend it on that level.  And I'm personally glad I saw it myself.",975110400,,2380,4.590047393364929

1286171,3,B00003CXE6,"Thwarted numerous times from seeing this in the theatre, I happily scooped up ""Gladiator"" when it came out on video.  The reviews were uniformly good, friends who had seen it rated it a solid thumbs up, and I'm a huge Russell Crowe fan, so I settled in with my popcorn, ready to enjoy.
And . . . I liked it.  I didn't love it.  Visually, it's a very striking film, although at times Ridley Scott lays on the effects a little too thick.  The performances, most notably by Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, are good, although Connie Nielsen's presence in this otherwise male-dominated drama seems to be superfluous (her costumes are great, though).  But what keeps this in my mind from becoming the masterpiece some claim is the screenplay--or lack thereof.  Crowe said in an interview that they essentially started shooting with no script, and it shows.  The dialogue is often stilted, despite some good lines (""At my signal, unleash hell"" is already a catch phrase of sorts), and the plot turns can be seen coming for miles.  As for the history, well, Hollywood's never been a fountain of accuracy, and they certainly aren't going to start with ""Gladiator.""  Crowe looks tremendous in a breastplate and tunic, by the way.
Many have put ""Gladiator"" on the same level as ""Braveheart"".  I will too, but for a different reason--like ""Braveheart"", ""Gladiator"" is a very heavy-handed historical drama that came out in a kind of a down year for good films.  Not that ""Gladiator"" isn't entertaining--it is, most definitely--but it isn't Oscar-caliber filmmaking.  That doesn't mean it won't get some Oscar nods when the time comes, though.  Enjoy it, but don't elevate it to something it's not.",975024000,,1679,4.869718309859155

1286281,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is a worthy successor to the great sword and sandal films of the past.  With a classic story, great acting, spectacular cinematography, and an incredible score, Gladiator is a true epic in every sense of the word.  Russel Crowe's and Joaquin Phoenix' performances are exceptional, and you find yourself despising Commodus(Phoenix) and actually cheering for Maximus(Crowe).
It is hard to watch the film and not be moved by the story, which at some points can drag, but is more than made up for by stunning batte and single combat scenes.  The larger political story gives flesh to the main arc of the film--vengance.  The film is fairly accurrate in its portrayal of the Roman gladiators, and the characters of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus are based on real emperors.
The DVD version which I am specifically writing about is excellent.  The chapter segmentations are done very well and you are able to skip to every major scene without any fast forwarding.  The bonus CD has many nice features, including all the trailers, cut footage, and a history of the gladiator games.
All in all, this is the best movie of the year, and if you are going to buy it, I highly suggest the DVD version, and if you don't have a DVD player, buy one to see this film...truly an instant classic.",975024000,3,1285,4.739910313901345
1286282,4,B00003CXE6,"You wouldn't expect gladiatorial combat to be worth watching. It's been the subject of thousands of one-panel cartoons, sportswriting allegories, and pedophile come-ons (Remember the pilot in Airplane asking, ""Jimmy, do you like gladiator movies?"")
So it's a bit of a surprise that most of the combat scenes in this film play pretty well. Oh, there are quibbles: the lions and tigers look like they've been given Xanax-laced burgers, and despite fitful attempts to invoke real Roman custom (Crowe's prayers to his ancestors) the American nuclear family is still the basic unit of pathos.
But most of it is beautiful, in an uncanny way. The great battle scene at the start of the film is like a pre-industrial Apocalypse Now shot, as the Roman catapults literally napalm the treeline. It's an interesting way of reimagining the Roman way of making war, and it's not actually such an implausible one. They were a fearsomely adaptable and ruthless people, and the film deserves credit for making them, and their bloodsports, something more than a tired punchline.
One thing, though: Oliver Reed. Aaaiiee! The man is magical: whenever he appears onscreen, suspension of disbelief collapses. I await the day he and Keanu Reeves play opposite each other; the very fabric of the Universe may well collapse!",975024000,2,1299,5.103286384976526

1286358,5,B00003CXE6,"(Updated for Blu-ray remaster 8/19/10):

Although the plotting is a bit uneven at times (with some minor plot holes due to the numerous writers who worked on the project), ""Gladiator"" is a brilliant looking spectacle which allows director Ridley Scott to excel. Scott's brilliantly shot and edited film over comes its slight narrative flaws due to terrific, strong performances from a Oscar caliber cast and the epic production.

The Blu-ray looks positively stunning and is a huge step up from the original DVD and the previous Blu-ray which looked better than the DVD (particularly for the extended version sequences)but failed to live up to the potential for Blu-ray due to the use of an old HD master prepared for TV broadcast. Colors are richer, image quality is crisp, sharp and absolutely stunning at times nicely capturing the theatrical presentation in high definition.

The biggest problem with the previous edition was the overuse of digital noise reduction which worked for the HD broadcast of the film but the higher resolution of Blu-ray betrayed all the extra noise reduction and elimination of textures. Universal (which actually mastered this for Paramount since they own the negative and Paramount only has North American distribution rights) has done a marvelous job. Textures and a high level of detail have been returned to the film taking it back closer to its theatrical presentation.

We get the same special features as the previous Blu-ray and DVD editions of the film with the bulk of them on the second disc. Paramount is running an exchange program as previously mentioned for those who have the previous edition (like I did) and if you mail the original transfer disc to them they'll return the new Blu-ray disc. You will probably need to call them to confirm if which version you have however. The phone # is 888-889-9456 and the address is PHE MKT c/o Deluxe Media Mgmt PO Box 801464 Valencia, CA 91380-1464.

1286359,2,B00003CXE6,"I really can't see why this film became so popular. It's basically the same story as Anthony Mann's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, with the thematics of SPARTACUS added to it. This should have been a good idea for a great entertaining as well as powerfully emotional movie in which the audience engage themselves in spite of the fact that the story is 2000 years ago.
SPARTACUS is still a powerful film because it's also a story about humanity and idealism; the equality of all humans, freedom, etc.,. It's also has a lot of strong visuals and fine performances through out the entire film; the subject matter is so engaging the actors should be good.
THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is a flawed film perhaps, but still is a great one in the way it investigates the corruption of power, which is also a very contemporary theme. (by the way, SPARTACUS was also partly directed by Mann).
Now comes GLADIATOR, which is a recent film, but I find it quite obselete because the thematic matter is reduced to one over-used stereotypical idea; the guy wants to fight against a poweful but corrupted empire because he wants to...see his family who are already dead? This mutilated hero doesn't even have the guts to revenge that precious family of his. Come on! Is that a bad joke or something?
How an actor, as good as he may be (and Crowe is a terrific one) can put his emotion in a character like this? Well, obviously he couldn't. All that remmains is the fact is that he is still good looking... The other actors are horrible. For instance, just compare the portrayal of the emperor as Anthony Mann envisioned him and the shallow vilan in this Ridley Scott version.
This film made me think again that Hollywood now has a lot to learn from its own history. Scott is basically a good, very skilled and inovative director I can't see why he could be satisfied with such an empty, uninteresting script.
Okay, I admit, the first 20 minutes battle sequence is quite interesting visually, and that's my reason for the one additional star. I hoped the filmmakers could keep that tention through out the film.

Once his son, Commodus got word of this, he immediatly killed Aurealis and attempted to murder Maximus and his family.  Eventaully escaping to become captured and throne into the colloseum, Maximus must play the deadliest game of all in Rome.

The Battle tactics They us at the Start of the Movie against the Germanic Tribe looks like an actual startegy they would use at that time and the acting was convincing. All of this is really impressive, But When you will see this movie you will think imediatly of Brave Heart, without breaking the story to others, similar events in the main characters life happen. Which you will find decieving. They should of added different twists, and fixed the plot to be Different. Then Everyone would of Enjoyed it Much More!

1286478,3,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is a big budget film with great actors and amazing special effects that falls just short of the mark.
Russels Crowe is one of my favorite actors and I was hoping that he would come out swinging in this movie.  Unfortunately, he did a far better job as a psychotic in Virtuosity or a mean cop in LA Confidential.  Unlike Mel Gibson in Braveheart, he does not carry the role of an inspiring leader credibly.  His impassioned speeches lack punch and you never build up enough respect or empathy with his character for him to have sufficient emotional appeal.  Part of it was bad dialog and part of it was his raspy voice (he sounds better when he tries to be menacing than he does trying to be grandiose).
One area that is hard to fault are fanastic visual effects.  Each scene is well conceived and laid out beautifully.  The fight sequences are superbly choreographed and exhilarating to watch.  Too bad there are so many interuptions between them.
One area that they apparently skimped on the budget was the script.  It appears that they just recycled the Braveheart script with some minor updates.  One of the driving forces behind Russell Crowe's character is his desired to avenge his wife and son.  In Braveheart this was an effective device because you got to know his bride beforehand.  However, this portion of Gladiator was rushed and ineffective ... leaving the rest of the movie a little dry and unmoving.
Overall, you will spend a lot of time bored during this movie waiting for the next great fight.
For those that like the film, the DVD is a pretty good buy.  The commentaries are interesting if you want to know how the film was conceived and the two additional features are more than the standard pre release commercials, they actually talk about some of the more interesting aspects of the movie.",974851200,6,1822,4.677115987460815

1286482,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is everything that a modern epic film should be. This film is a towering triumph that will not soon be forgotten. It features a very well-written script, amazing visuals, incredible moments of both action and drama, as well as absolutely stellar acting performances from the entire cast. Russell Crowe established himself as one of the best actors in the world today, with his commanding and emotionally powerful portrayal of Maximus, who is a hero in every sense of the term. Crowe deserves every accolade that he gets for his marvelous performance, which was by far one of the most commanding and heartfelt performances I have ever seen in a movie. Crowe's work in The Insider and L.A. Confidential made him a legitimate star, while his role in Gladiator cemented his position as one of the most prominent leading actors in Hollywood today. Crowe, an avid horseback rider, even did many of his own stunts in the movie. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a breakthrough performance as Commodus, the emotionally conflicted son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, played by veteran actor Richard Harris. Phoenix's performance demands sympathy as well as hatred from the viewer, with gripping emotions as well as an ever-present sense of jealousy and spite. The late, great Oliver Reed(who died shortly before filming wrapped), put the finishing touch on a storied career with his performance as Proximo, the slave ower who helps Maximus regain his freedom. Connie Nielsen, a relative newcomer, also delivers an excellent performance as Commodus' older and wiser sister, who has had previous involvement with Maximus. The visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning, as ancient Rome is brought to life like never before with some absolutely amazing computer-generated visuals, as well as painstakingly crafted sets. Scenes of battle in this movie are graphic but never overindulgent, and convey a sense of the brutality that must have existed during this time. This movie is grand in both story and scale, and visuals serve to reinforce the strong acting by providing an unbelievable backdrop for the story. Ridley Scott, who is a master of skillful character filming, does not disappoint in what many people consider his finest film to date, as his skillful camera work gives a deep insight into the emotions of every character in the film. Gladiator is truly an epic achievement. Dreamworks did an excellent job with the Gladiator DVD, with some of the cleanest audio and video transfers I have seen on the DVD format. This movie was meant to be watched on DVD as the enhanced picture and sound really serve to heighten the experience of watching this movie. The DVD also contains nearly 4 (yes, four) hours of bonus materials including 30 minutes of deleted scenes, an HBO first look special, several commentaries, as well as a 50 minute documentary from the Learning Channel called: Bloodsport of a Gladiator, which examines the lives of actual Gladiators in ancient Rome. The inclusion of a journal by young actor Spencer Treat Williams, (who plays Lucius, the eventual heir to the throne of Rome)is n especially welcome addition. The DVD actually devotes a second disc solely to the special features.  The Bottom Line is this: Gladiator is a true modern epic, one of the best films ever made. It features incredible acting, a gripping storyline, and absolutlely stunning visuals. This movie is a must-have for any DVD collection. Movies just don't get much better than this.",974764800,,3472,5.080560420315236

The soundtrack happens to be also my favorite CD, with memorable songs that complement perfectly the feel of the movie. The movie starts off in 180 A.D., in the finale of the wars in Germania. Russell Crowe is Maximus, the legendary General who wins the war for Rome and its caesar, Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius is old and has to choose a heir to the throne; but, instead of choosing his own son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix in an excellent performance) he decides to elect Maximus as his succesor. This isn't seen well, obviously, by Commodus, who kills his father before he's made his decision public (Maximus had made it clear that he would refuse, anyway) and proclaimes himself new Emperor of Rome. Maximus doesn't support this new Imperator, and Commodus orders him and his family to be killed. The attempt on Maximus fails (else we wouldn't have a story), but his family's killed, and he vows revenge. After burying his wife and son, he's so beaten that a group of slave traders easily captures him, converting him subsequently into a gladiator. His combat skills are so good, he soon becomes a superstar among gladiators and is sent back to Rome, to fight in the Coloseum. He's in Rome, so is the Emperor...you can imagine what comes next. Although the movie's a little too novelesque at times, its all done so well that you can't do anything but like this movie. The bonus features of this DVD will entertain you on their own, even without the movie itself. All in all, its a great buy.",974764800,,1574,4.625
1286596,5,B00003CXE6,"To be honest I was shocked and then disturbed when I read that the critically acclaimed Gladiator would be for sale on VHS for $111 dollars.  Don't get me wrong.  DVD is the newest trend in movie technology, and I support its amazingly low price for two very valuable discs.  However, most of us can't afford DVD, let alone the cost of a full-priced movie.  I paid full-price for Gladiator when it first was released because I was so impressed with the trailer.  I continued watching the movie, though, at the dollar theaters because seven times seven dollars would equal a smaller checking account.  Besides, one of Gladiator's themes is that everyone deserves fairness and dignity, whether slave or free, white or black, man or woman.  The enormous video price for this film insults this value, allowing the few to enjoy this film just in time for Christmas.  We can do better than this; Maximus died for a nobler cause than movie sales.  This is a film which needs to be enjoyed by everyone, on both VHS and DVD.",974764800,,1015,4.625698324022347

However, it seems to have fallen foul of it's own misconceptions that films of this genre need to be long to be artistic. Truthfully, the running time could have been shaved by about 30 minutes, and little would have been lost in entertainment value.

1286601,5,B00003CXE6,"An powerful empire,a new ruler,and a man worthy enough to  change a dynasty,a slave who would become a gladiator, a man who become legendary to his people. Ridley Scott's epic so beautiful so intense , so gripping , and so dramatic that it can only be  called truly epic. Academy Award nominee Russel Crow gives this  Roman epic life in his role as Maximus the brave slave general who is betrayed by his empire for not complying with the wish  of his new ruler Commodus (Joquin Pheonix) who has forced him  self as the new ruler of Rome by killing the previous Ceaser  for not giving Commodus rule over Rome. Commodus is a pitiful  ruler that is calculating , benevolent , pathetic , hateful  when Maximus refuses to take Commodus's hand in rule he finds that he pays the price when he looses everything dear to him and is forced into slavery to become a Gladiator , when he  becomes a great Gladiator he is given the honor to fight in  the colloseium when he becomes a hero amongst the people he is forced to give his identity as Maximus the general gaining  the support from his men , he devises a plan to escape and join his soldiers to build an army to overthrow Commodus from power when Commodus finds out the plan of Maximus he gives  the people of Rome a chance to see the great fall of the  great Maximus by challenging him in one on one combat to  the death , Maximus see's this as a chance to bring Rome  out of chaos and give it the order and freedom it deserves
for it's people in doing so he will risk his life to be the greatist hero Rome has ever known.
  Russel Crowe is an even more fitting potrayal of a  Gladiator then even Kirk Douglas he gives his charachter  more depth and a human side , it's evident that Crowe is one the best newcomers hollywood has ever seen he is very versitle in films and Gladiator only shows that to an even greater extent. Joqiun Pheonix is a great match for Crowe  giving Commodus depth and making us feel pity the he is  the way he is and his hatered for Maximus and his uprising. Ridley Scott has an imaginative veiw to detail as some of  the set's are detailed to what Rome would have looked like in this time the costumes accurate and the cinimatography is astounding. This may be an action movie but this movie  is worthy of it's predeccesors Sparticus , Ben Hur ,  Cleopatra they don't even near as get close to the vison of Rome the empire then in this movie. So people invest  in a DVD player cause this one is well worth the money  a truly epic film.",974678400,,2508,4.260593220338983

After years of loyal service to Rome, heroic Roman general Maximus (Russell Crowe) is awarded to become the next emperor of Rome but the emperor's jealous son (Joaquin Phoenix) betrays Maximus and sentences him to death. After escaping his execution, Maximus returns home and finds his family brutally murdered. Alone and broken, Maximus is enslaved and forced to the life of an arena gladiator. With his courage and skill, Maximus earns the admiration of the Roman public and rivals the authority of the new emperor. ""Gladiator"" is an astounding action-packed movie spectacle that ranks as one of the best movies of 2000. ""Gladiator"" contains a powerful story, moving performances and a rich music score.

Well, I was right about the blood and wrong about everything else.  Ridley Scott's epic vision of a wronged and enslaved Roman general, of political corruption, of revenge and honor is a prime example of what a good movie ought to be.
Russel Crowe (L.A. Confidential, The Insider) plays Maximus, the Roman Empire's greatest general, who is betrayed by the dead emperor's son (played by the film's only flaw, Joaqin Phoenix) is first enslaved, then by becoming a gladiator he gradually works his way back to Rome to find his family murdered, which only throws salt on his wounds.  The story of injustice righted is highlighted by spectacular action sequences that are extremely violent and realistic (which is what initially kept bringing people back to see the film in theaters) but the story is involving (thanks to Russel Crowe's brilliant performance) enough to warrant repeated viewings.  All in all Gladiator is the best movie of 2000, period.  Nothing released this year will match the beauty and grand scale of this film.  So if you like good movies make sure you get your copy of this wonderful film.

Yeah we don't get to chop each other up in public but we're still all turned on by the same things.  And the politics of the Roman empire have an erie resemblance to the politics of the US.  With WWF/WCW and professional sports so popular these days you can see how we're not far off.  So on one hand the film is entertaining.

1286797,5,B00003CXE6,"This movie is nothing short of magnificent.  It captures both 'the glory that was Rome' as well as the relationship between a fighting commander and his troops, both used to hardship and victory, and attempting to finish the job and go home.
This is also undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen.  It is reminiscent of the spectacles of the late 50s and early 60s, such as Ben Hur, El Cid, and 55 Days at Peking, but much more intense and certainly more realistic.
The characters are greater than life, such as Maximus (Russell Crowe), the Roman general who was like a son to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (masterfully played by veteran Irish actor Richard Harris, whose facial expressions tell more than his diaglogue), and who was betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Marcus' feckless son, who 'was not a moral man.'
Director Ridley Scott has captured many things in this film: the timeless relationship between veteran soldiers and their commanders, Rome in its last spurt of greatness, evil and corruption of the Roman upper classes, the seeming hopelessness of good being overcome by evil, innocence of the young, and the recurring theme that evil will fluorish if good men do nothing.
Lavishly filmed, and with better special effects than either Titanic or last year's Star Wars Episode One, it shows the Rome that may have been, with all the dirt, grit, and corruption that never showed up in the other epic films about Rome and its Empire.
Music is also superb, and undoubtedly brings out the violent action of the film, from rousing fighting in the Coliseum to savage combat on the Danube frontier between the indomitable Legions and the German barbarians.
Lastly, this was Oliver Reed's last film.  Remembered for his portrayal of the one of the Three Musketeers in the mid-70s and in the film Oliver, he is superb here, dying of a heart attack while the movie was being filmed.  The final product is a tribute both to him and his ability in front of the camera.
This is a film for the ages.  It covers valor, cowardice, loyalty, love, hate, betrayal, and brings it in a story that is enthralling, exciting, and relevant to modern times.  The Director and cast, and the rest that contributed are to be congratulated.  If Scott, Crowe, the movie itself, cinematography and music are not awarded with Oscars by the Academy this year, it will be a great injustice.

1286798,5,B00003CXE6,"This is going to be the first big hit of the spring/summer movie season.  It has all the makings.  Action, intrigue, romance, huge battle scenes, betrayal, vengence, and death. This was a good one.  Had a great cast.  Russel Crowe played Maximus.  A general,  turned prisoner, turned slave, turned gladiator, turned hero of the Roman Empire.  Richard Harris played the Roman Empereor whom  Maximus was a general under, and who was like the son, whom he wished his son was like.  Joiquan Phoenix, played the Emperors son who killed his father when he found out his father was going to make Maximus Emperor instead of him, and then he orders Maximus killed. Maximus gets away, but not in time to save his wife and son from being murdered by the same men he had been in control of when he was General.  He is sold into slavery, and becomes a Gladiator, and vows revevge on the new Emperor. Oliver Reed, in his final performance before his death, plays the owner of the Gladiators.  He agrees to give Maximus his freedom, if he can get the crowds to love him and see him as a hero.  This is how Maximus keeps the Emperor from killing him.  The Emperor will not kill him since he is so loved, 'cause that would make Maximus a martyr, so he has to find a way for the people to either hate him, or have him die ""fairly"" in the Gladiator ring.  That's all I'm going to tell about the story, because I don't want to give anything away.  This is one you need to see in the theater.  This picture is great. THE GOODThe acting, the sets, the cinemetography, the battle at the beginning was excellent, the fight scenes, the ending. THE BADNothing, though some people may not like the length.  But as I have said before, you're getting more for your money. THE BOTTOM LINEGreat movie.  Go see at least once if not more.  And definitely see it at least once in the theater.  The sets, and everything deserve to be watched on the big screen.  This is one both men and women can enjoy.  There are elements for both genders.

1286799,5,B00003CXE6,"I've taken the time and gone through all the reviews of this film, and for the most part, their all great.  But some are by far measures taken to be different.  Now if you didn't like the film, than fine, that's your opinion.  We're all entitled to that.  But first know what your talking about before you verbally bash something unknown to the context of your mind.
My review of the film is simply this:  an unmistaken masterpiece.  Why?  first off, the acting is worthy of the salaries paid, particularly Crowe, Pheniox, Richard Harris as Marcus Aurilius, and Connie Nielson as the troubled sister.  The emotion between young Commodus and Maximus is completely different, as their characters are DIFFERENT!  Hence, one will act different in given situations.
Second, Ridley Scott's direction is spot on perfect, balancing the importance of storytelling with eye-popping spectacle.  Some people have forgotten that this is the man who brought us THELMA & LOUISE, and is only capable of ALIEN or BLADE RUNNER.  This is not true.  His use of visuals to convey an emotion put him in a category with Hollywood's greatest.
Third, John Mathieson's cinematography is near flawless for the effect intended.  Some reviews attack he and Scott of 'stealing' from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, because of the look of the battle scenes.  Well, when a new form of sneaker comes onto the market, is it now safe to say that everyone who buys it 'steals' from the last.  No.  This system is called an Image Shaker, and it was also used in ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.  And resetting the shutter speed on the camera has been used for years, just not to the great effect in PRIVATE RYAN.
Lastly, the storytelling may not be accurate, but who the hell cares?  Really, does it bother you that much that someone has creatively changed the use of history?  History is what it is, it's not going anywhere.  Don't bash the historical accuracy of the film, if anything at all, bash the film itself.  Does the film work with what it uses?  Then let it be.  The script is tight, and taught, and chock full of emotion, never confusing the moment.
Oliver Reed, a character actor from the 60's and 70's, who passed away while shooting, has done some of the best work of his career here.  Yet nary a person mentions this, only daunting a film that deserves it's praise.
I could quote several catch phrases, but I'm not going to.  Take what you will from this, I personally loved the film, and will buy it on DVD.",973641600,16,2461,4.654292343387471

There is never a dull moment thanks to the outstanding direction of Ridley Scott.  The cinematography is equally amazing as is the performance of Russell Crowe.  The story is rivetting, thrilling, captivating - yet plausible.  It has all the ingredients of the perfect guy movie: a villian that you develop a seething hatred for, and a hero with such courage, strength and conviction that you can't help but feel his every pain, share his every emotion, and admir... him.

1286804,2,B00003CXE6,"I'm still quite surprised at the praise heaped onto ""Gladiator"" - even film critics I admire seem to believe that it represents the second coming of epic filmmaking. I could not disagree more - ""Gladiator"" is a terrible movie, a lumbering dunce of a film parading around like the next ""Ben Hur."" Russell Crowe is appropriately sinewy as Maximus and Richard Harris makes a fine Marcus Aurelius (if he were from the British Isles, that is), but everything else is so contrived as to be suffocating. Everything in the film is big and dumb and loud, and the producers apparently believed that an utterly abysmal script would be compensated by scenes of surprisingly dull, clanging combat, usually consisting of two armored men slinging swords around until somebody gets stabbed and falls over (and maybe a computer generated tiger is thrown in from time to time). I would have expected more creativity from Ridley Scott, but ""Gladiator"" reminds me most of ""Braveheart"" - it desperately wants to be a great film, but it simply doesn't have the script, talent, or purpose to be anything more than a glorified popcorn movie. I'm absolutely amazed that everyone I know worships this film...but to me, beneath Russell Crowe's charisma, the mock historical lesson, and the earsplitting battle scenes, there is absolutely nothing of consequence.",973468800,8,1334,5.068181818181818

Russel Crowe does a magnificent job, as does Joaquin Phoenix(brother of River)in the role of Commodus.  Now that we are on the subject of Commodus, this movie is somewhat historically accurate, seeing as Commodus actually fought in gladiatorial battles claiming over one thousand victories in his lifetime, and was planning on moving into the gladiatorial barracks prior to his assassination at the hands of his family, though not Lucilla.  Lucilla had tried to have him assassinated, but he figured it out, and had her put to death.  But, this movie rocks, so, I encourage you to buy it.  And the soundtrack.  Very Sweet.

1286880,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiatorial combat is immortalized in this film, the only way it can be: through stunning action sequences and beautiful imagery. It also immortalizes, above all, director Ridley Scott.
Roger Ebert complains of people with short memory spans praising this film while forgetting that films like Spartacus have supposedly done this before. Well, I have a good memory, and I remember Spartacus. In fact, I kept on remembering that film while watching Gladiator, only in the context of, ""This is so much better than Spartacus. It goes beyond."" The action is better, the visuals are better, the story is better, and the acting is better. Sorry, Kirk.
Since this is an action film, the story isn't the most important element, but for an action film it is actually quite good. For one thing, I liked the disturbing under-the-surface incest element going on between Commodus and Connie Nielson. Furthermore, it was interesting to see how Crowe gained support among the gladiators until it became as if he were a general leading his army again. The plot itself needed to be there in order to fully create a sense of grandeur. With its insurrection story, the rise of the hero and his trek to the capitol of Rome, and the look at the people in power, the plot creates a sense of time-and-place necessary for an epic that couldn't exist with the visuals and action alone.
The acting is among the best one can ever seen for an action film, and there is plenty of fine dramatic work pulled off by the two main actors. Russell Crowe is now one of the best ""new"" (four or five films so far) actors in film. We believe, in his glances and the ways he delivers his many great lines, that he is Maximus. He is poignant, hate-filled, and sorrowful all at once. The praise he is getting is deserved. But why isn't Phoenix being lauded just as much? He carries the film in the second-largest role just as well as Crowe. His Emperor Commodus isn't a good villain and has no real character, but Phoenix adds so many layers to him and turns him into a great antagonist that that alone makes his performance excellent. He commands attention just as Crowe does. All by himself (no help from any great dialogue or development), he creates a villain that is prissy, whining, ambitious, pathetic, and malevolent, and worthy of our hate as well as our pity. It's a wonderful transformation. To sum it up, the characters themselves aren't really developed at all- but the acting is so good that it seems they are.
Now, onto the action, which, as I had hoped, is plentiful and intense. It has diversity and grandeur. All the fights were fast, hard-hitting, uncensored, and very bloody, which is what they should've been like. And every single fight sequence is unique from the others. There's the match where two men fought chained to each other, the opening war battle, Maximus vs. numerous other fighters, and the final sword duel, to name a few. This is so much more than just two half-naked men fighting with swords, which is what it could've been. The film also captures the feel and the motion of combat. Ridley Scott speeds up the film slightly during fight scenes to show the chaos and rapid reflexes necessary to survive. During the fight scenes, the camerawork is nonstop and covers the combat as one big blur to the fighters. (But we can still follow the fights themselves.)
This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image-driven action films I've ever seen. Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail, art direction, even distinct lighting (the Collosseum orange, other parts of Rome dark blue). Just look at the wide multitude (seemingly infinite number) of battle masks, weapons, and locales. Cinematography is skillful and impressive. There are tons of memorable shots, like Maximus entering the ring with rose petals coming down on him like rain from above, Commodus' pure white battle costume (when he's being risen up on the platform he looks like a demented angel ascending to heaven), and the images used to represent Crowe's home- the gentle hand carressing the wheat reeds, the door to his house, etc. They had a surreal quality and each were bathed in their own distinct color. Excellent work, Ridley.
A very impressive film. So why can't all summer movies be this good? We'd be spoiled.",972864000,349,4338,4.769946808510638
1286881,3,B00003CXE6,"This was a movie that didn't quite live up to its potential.  I think director Ridley Scott couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to shoot a guilty-pleasure toga flick with lots of pointless-but entertaining- fight scenes or an intellectual, historical epic on a grand scale.  What he ended up with were pointless-and only mildly entertaining-fight scenes stuck amongst plot re-treads lifted straight out of Braveheart (with none of the actual ""heart"")  As I've said, the story is one we've heard before...  Ruthless yet loyal soldier is double-crossed by the very politicians he has risked his own neck for.  Various members of the hero's family are offed by said dirty politicians (in one of the movie's few powerful and well-done scenes).  Hero then undertakes an against-all-odds campaign to overthrow/destroy said dirty politicians with the help of the common rabble.  Yawn.
  The one plus in this movie is the sublimely understated performance of Russel Crowe, who is able to deliver his corny pseudo-Shakespearian lines (why is it that every movie set in a time period before the 1800s contains Shakespearian dialect, no matter if the movie is set in Elizabethan England or in ancient Rome?) with a modicum of grace, imbuing the corny script with just a bit of decency.  On the other hand is Joaquin Phoenix, a usually fine actor, flubbing the role of the bad guy by playing him as an affected, simpering wuss-boy with an unhealthy (and entirely pointless) affection for his own sister.  His performance makes the final mano-a-mano hero v. bad guy scene at the end seem unbelievable and anti-climactic.  Had his character been outright ruthless and plain Darth Vader-style evil, this movie may have ended on a better note.  As usual, Ridley Scott's directing and accompanying cinematography is spotty.  The haunting battle scenes at the opening of the movie, and the gripping scene involving the death of Maximus'wife and son are (unfortunately) marred by the slow pacing and uninventiveness of the final duel.  The fight scenes, which showed so much promise in the previews and t.v. spots for the movie, are on the whole just good when viewed in that perspective-as advertisements, rather than good movie-making.  Filled with jump-cuts and inexplicable tracking shots counterweighted with jerky, almost hand-held-camera-looking shots ended up being more style than substance; half the time, you couldn't follow what was going on.  Also, some of the CG effects, especially the wide-angle views of Rome and the colliseum, were almost laughingly bad.  It's funny that these shots probably would have wowed me a few years ago; it's just that moves like Titanic, the Matrix, and Star Wars, Ep. 1 just raised the bar for large-scale computer effects so high, that Gladiator has to struggle just to perform a simple chin-up. Ironically, the small-scale special effects (in particular a battle scene involving free-range tigers)were pretty good, and the atmosphere of the movie probably would have been a whole lot more believable if they'd thrown out the hokey, look-ma-no-hands wide-angle shots, which really only take up about 10 seconds of the movie.  The movie is worth renting, and if you're a Ridley Scott or Russel Crowe afficionado, then its definitely worth clicking the ""buy"" button; if you don't fall into those categories, then maybe you should go with ""Braveheart"" instead.",972864000,9,3393,5.170018281535649

But, like a child, I was enthalled with the film and watched with wide eyed wonder.  The cinematography at the beginning of the film with the war scene was absolutely breathtaking.  It rivalled the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan"" though it was a little less disturbing.  Only a little less so.
What I was surprised about was the great plot.  Sure, it was about the super-human hero, the rugged male who stuck by his own morals no matter what.  His honour superceded everything, no matter what horror came to him.  Yes, it was a bit ""American"" and individualistic, but it was done so well, it captivated me.  I truly felt his sadness and his anger.
Ridley Scott of Blade Runner fame directed this film superbly.  I particularly loved the frquest flashes to the fields of heaven - it was this mix of beauty and action that captured my interest.  He was able to make me truly enjoy this film.  The acting by Crowe was a great compliment as well.

The big difference here to me was that they didn't mull over the bloody scenes and glorify them. But what really surprised me about this movie was the way it pulled me in and made me feel,mainly due to the very crafty way in which the scenes were composed, and of course, the talent of the main actor. Anyone remember how the first ""Mad Max"" movie made them feel? Small budget, big on emotion. Next came Road Warrior- bigger budget, less emotion, then they plopped down that feeble excuse Beyond Thunderdome- biggest budget, flat on emotion. What I'm trying to say here is that Gladiator and it's Director deserve a standing ovation just for being able to pull off a big budget film that still packs a heavy payload of emotion rather then just ""wowing"" you with a glossy package of special effects.

I think I never saw a historic epic like this before.  BUT: What's the matter with Hollywood, when it comes to find movie endings? Why does the so-called hero have to die in such a pseudo-ideolistic, melodramatic way, that a whole movie of about two and a half hours has to suffer and become actually nothing more than  a 08/15, 3 star movie just because of the final 15 minutes? These final 15 minutes - without them and another ending, The Gladiator would be a great 5 star movie - of The Gladiator are so full of senseless, completly overdrawn emotions, that you actually can only laugh or leave the theatre. It was exactly the same thing with The Matrix: Love is so great, love is so strong, it can wake the dead(Neo).  In The Gladiator, love, loyality and believe in honour is so strong that, although the hero dies, everything is good, great and beautiful in the end and after we shared a tear or too, because of the unfair way, his life has ended, we know, thta now the hero can be happy with his family in heaven...

The storyline is pretty straight foward and a little simple, with a few extra twists.  This movie shows the violence of the Roman past time a bit too many, but causes expense.  The emotion is pretty strong, as you follow the characters along and you're always thinking, ""Watch your back, he'll chop your dam* head off!""  A very few movies did that to me this summer.  Not only that, the actors fitted their roles perfectly.  Nobody else could play a better gladiator than Crowe, except maybe for Meg Ryan.

Gladiator is a good old-fashioned hero movie. It doesn't matter if its characters dress like real romans did or speak like them, which they obviously don't.
What is endearing about Gladiator is primarily embodied in the character of Maximus.  He loves his family, he is loyal to the king, he fights for his ideals, he brings the smack down when necessary.

Everything looked too easy for Crowe's character (I know I am repeating myself here).  It is just disheartening when a good director and a good actor get together and they make a mediocre film.  A similar film is Braveheart.  Braveheart is a much better film than this.  That film thrust you into the battle scenes and made you care about William Wallace.  That film had heart, while this film seemed cold and distant.  I am sure Scott and Crowe will bounce back with their next projects.",971827200,3,931,4.5636363636363635
1287078,2,B00003CXE6,"Five stars,  five stars,  five stars... yeah, yeah, sure.  GLADIATOR is as over-rated a movie as was released this year. While it's no BLAIR WITCH PROJECT in that respect, it still gets an insane amount of praise for so ordinary an effort.
Yes, Russell Crowe is magnetic (and I guess if you're inclined in that direction, sexy and hunky) and Ridley Scott can still pull off his usual hat tricks (he remains the best director making bad films in the business) but really, this is a hollow effort.
But, yes, the gladiatorial scenes are a sight to behold.  No doubt about it, Scott is a visual master and the combat scenes are intense and rousing.  If only the rest of the film were as vital and entertaining.  It's not just that we've seen it all before a million times, it's that it is so so ordinary about the whole thing.  The critics grousing about PHANTOM MENACE should have been doing double duty here and I bet they weren't.
So, for sure, if you haven't seen GLADIATOR yet, rent it, but buy it only if you, for some silly reason, really love it.
If you are looking for some great action scenes and rousing conflict on the field of battle, this is a place to look.  But, if you also want to see a great film to go along with it, I think you need to look elswhere.

1287079,5,B00003CXE6,"After experiencing this film for the first time I walked out of the theater with a huge lump in my throat. Such haunting glory, such subdued greatness....it was as if I had been in the Coliseum fighting along side Maximus (Crowe). One cannot begin to explain the pure genius of this motion picture. It brings you to emotianal, physical and pychological climax in less than the first thirty minutes only to bring you back again.  Crowe, Phoinex and Neilsen all act with Oscar worthy preformances. Neilsen with her absolute helplessness, Phoinex with his twisted, evil and ambitious potrayal of the emperor Commodus and Crowe with his heart wrenching character Maximus: Father, General, Gladiator, hero.  Not only are the actors stunningly beautiful, the visuals are likewise. If you have ever wanted to know what Rome would look like before Attila the Hun, before natural disaster, before collapes, this is your chance. ""Gladiator"" will take you from a quiet villa in ancient Spain to the over-crowded, energy-packed streets of the greatest empire on earth.  With visuals never before attempted and acting that of gods, what is left to stir your senses more? Music. ""Gladiator"" contains one of the most glorious soundtracks I have ever heard. Hans Zimmer amasses cellos, ancient mandolins and precussion instruments, latin vocalist and his already untouchable talent to create a spine-tingeling score worthy of any award. I especially loved the song played during credits, ""Now We Are Free"". It truly gave me goosebumps.  I don't recomend that you buy this, I command it. ""Gladiator"" is for anyone who loves action, adventure, romance and characters so deep with emotion you cannot help but watch it again. I have seen this movie four times and every time I come out feeling as though I should not speak or else the soft fog of the moment will break. Buy it.

1287080,1,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is far, far less entertaining than the big sword'n'sandal epics from the fifties and sixties. Russel Crowe's Maximus could have been far more imposing as a character than he is now (he spends most of the film as a brooding wimp). Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus is a weak, immature villain who never really poses a major threat to the hero. The story is full of illogical events, the CGI recreation of Rome is dodgy, and the historical context... well, the less said the better. And the fight scenes are shot and edited in such a way that they hurt the spectator's eyes AND it is nigh impossible to make out what is going on (with the exception of the final duel, where the freneticism makes place for more traditional camerawork; unfortunately, it isn't a very suspenseful or exciting one). I'm probably giving this movie one star less than it deserves, but nevertheless I was very, very disappointed. Anthony Mann's Fall Of THe Roman Empire wasn't perfect, but it treated the same historical subject matter in a much better way than this.",971827200,7,1045,4.779005524861878
1287081,3,B00003CXE6,"If it weren't for the rousing battle scenes and stunning locales, Ridley Scott's half-hearted epic Gladiator would've been a total flop.  Gladiator is by no means a bad movie, but as far as a great one?  Not even close. Russell Crowe delivers a star making turn as Maximus, a loyal Roman general whose loyality is put to the test when he refuses to follow the orders of the newest emperor (Joaquin Phoenix in a BORING performance).  Accused of treason, Maximus' family is killed and he sentanced to die.  Of course he escapes and begins his unholy quest for revenge against the new emperor.  Gladiator begins with a rousing battle scene and has many to follow, all of the acting credible and the story is undeniably interesting, but there are too many flaws for this one to be considered a masterpiece by any means.  Many of the sequences between the battle scenes almost exist solely for filler purposes, they serve to bring the film from one fight scene to the next.  There is nothing wrong with this type of film, if it weren't pretending to be something more.  Crowe makes for a great action hero, his enemy in this film, Joaquin Phoenix is annoying and sickening.  Phoenix is normally a superb actor, but his character in this film acts the part of the cliched Roman Emperor.  He kills his father, babbles on and on in scene after scene about NOTHING and even pointlessly lusts after his sister.  There is a lot that could've been removed from this film without damaging the story, audiences sometimes think that a long movie automatically makes for a good one.  That is not the case here.  Gladiator is not a bad film, just boring.  Director Scott thinks he's doing a film of more substance than he really has, proof of this comes in the pretentious ""death"" scene at the finsh.  Comparisons to Braveheart are unfair, this is a bloated Hollywood 'epic', not terrible, not very good, and very unmemorable.  Whereas Braveheart used gruesome battle scenes to move the story along, Gladiator seems to exist FOR the battle scenes, they are incredible, but to find something else of value in this film is the real challenge.  It's hollow, pointless and pretty limp.  Another case of Hollywood going through the motions.  Some will like it, others will agree with me, but in the end, it's all in the opinion.",971740800,4,2306,4.70573566084788
1287082,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator is one of those movies that doesn't just stun and amaze you, but adds something significant to its genre.  In Gladiator's case, it's in the action scenes.  Most action movies try to slow down the action (Braveheart, The 13th Warrior, etc.) for at least some of the battle scenes.  Not Gladiator.  Oh no.  Gladiator does the opposite.  Along with some camera techniques that I can't begin to describe, this makes for possibly the most visceral and engaging action sequences since, well, Seven Samurai.  As for the story, it is surprisingly well done, and while many discredit the movie for its ""historical inaccuracy,"" it is sure a whole lot more historically accurate than say, The Patriot.  Actors are generally strong from the indomitable, electrifying Crowe to the loasthome yet, admittedly, effective Phoenix.  A broad range of realistic characters is well represented here.  The musical score is stirring, ominous, and, when necessary, complements the action very nicely.  At over two and a half hours, this is one movie that really takes advantage of its length (seven battles makes for a long movie and a whole lot of head-lopping).  Not for the faint of heart.  Certainly for just about anyone else.  Definitely for those who have been starved for some really engaging swords-and-axes-and-arrows combat.
  But why am I wasting my time writing this?  Gladiator can be described in three words: SEE IT NOW.",971740800,2,1422,5.086580086580087
1287083,4,B00003CXE6,"Yes Gladiator is a good movie, and yes, it is epic, in story, scale, and performances.... But what seems to be overlooked here are the unmistakable parallels that can be drawn between this movie and Braveheart, the best epic in this genre.
Ridley Scott delivers a solid product that rivals his best work (Alien, Blade Runner, Legend, and Thelma and Louise).  It may in fact be his best work to date.  Nevertheless, while watching the movie I couldn't help but keep thinking about how it felt like Braveheart.... set in Rome.
Our hero is a reluctant soldier, who prefers to go home and run his farm and raise a family (sounds familiar?).  But instead the ones he loves are brutally massacred and he has nothing left to live for except revenge and justice (beginning to sound familiar yet).  As you would expect he ultimately achieves this, but with a tragic conclusion that when compared to Braveheart now begins to feel clichd.
Please remember, however, that this is a good movie... in fact its one of the best movies in 2000 (and yes this does not say much, because this has been a dismal year for movies).  The open battle is grand, but Scott films it in style that tries to hard capture the chaos of battle and this results in a sequence that lacks in coherence and lucidity.
Nevertheless, if you haven't seen this movie, and you love epics that play in this space, then WATCH THIS MOVIE! ... And if you still want more watch BRAVEHEART 3:  THE PATRIOT!

1287085,1,B00003CXE6,"*Gladiator*  is the story of Maximus  (awesome name, eh?), Rome's best general and heir to Marcus Aurelius'  throne, and his subsequent downfall thanks to the Emperor's sniveling, scheming son Commodus  (an even more awesome name, based on an actual guy!) . . . AND his subsequent escape from slavery via the gladiator trade.
The film attempts, I think, to be a  ""throwback""  to all those tunic 'n' toga epics of the 1950's, but with a modern sensibility.  The first question I pose is:  do we really need an update of those terrible films?  Here's my second question:  in a movie purporting to be about the horrors of the Roman sports arenas, why do we see so little of that horror?  The storytellers seem to want to say something about violent entertainment and the corrosive effect it may have on people, but the violence is obliquely presented and the  ""people""  the violence is supposedly coarsening are never seen  (except as CGI stand-ins).  Comparisons to  *Saving Private Ryan*  are bogus -- say what you want about the other film, there the gore was made explicit.  Director Ridley Scott, mindful of avoiding an NC-17 rating, chooses to IMPLY violence.  He does this by simply NOT HOLDING THE CAMERA STILL.  The camera whizzes, jerks, suddenly slo-mo's, goes all grainy, occasionally reverts to black and white -- does anything and everything but actually record what we're supposed to be seeing.  During the opening battle scene and the later fight scenes, I felt no sense of  ""being there"", or really witnessing anything . . . except the excesses of the latest motion picture industry's camera technologies.  Also, the LSD-inspired  ""dream sequences""  were over-the-top, to say the least, and some of the worst-filmed stuff I've seen all year.
Finally, the story had zero suspense:  you know what's coming every step of the way, and you know how it will all end -- with Maximus facing the nasty Commodus in the Colosseum.  Considering what an interesting lunatic the REAL Commodus was in history, the screenwriters'  pedestrian effort here puzzles me.  Oh well. . . .",971740800,7,2079,4.910662824207493

Crowe is good and the acting is decent but the story is just too long and the action scenes are done in a choppy slow motion style that takes away from any excitment we should be feeling.  Plus the ending is a total downer.  I just love these period epics like Braveheart, Titanic and Saving Private Ryan where the filmmakers decide to kill off the hero for the sake of nobility.  This film's ending is no exception only that it has none of the impact those other films had.  This film is disappointing.

It has everything an epic needs.  It has adventure, blood, intrigue (not too much to bore you), righteous hero, etc.  The movie is about honor and survival(and some other stuff that I couldn't remember since I watched it several months ago).  It's very touching.  The movie was realistic in that it got some of the less savory sides of humanity in it.  One of which is the fact that the prince is in love with his sister.  Incest does happen often in those days.  The other thing was that his family was killed horribly.  The ending was quite sad but appropiate in light of what happened in the movie.  You'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.

In revisiting an ancient civilisation, he has essentially regenerated the 'sword and sandals' epics of the 50s (Ben Hur, Spartacus in the 60s). Gladiator is astounding. The first ten minutes of the film are possibly the most awe-inspiring in any film (barring Star Wars), and this stream of adrenaline pumping action continues throughout the film. And the Tigers rock. And that's the good bit of the film.  The flawed aspect is the story itself, for although the idea of a vengeful Roman General fighting through gladiator 'school' and into the Colloseum is effective, and very cool, although not entirely original, it is when we are given this sub-plot of a secret Roman political conspiracy, and Maximus' role in disolving this conspiracy, that the film starts to slip a bit. The 'politics'of the screenplay detract from what we all want to see more of in this film-people getting chopped to bits. And that is what I think of the film. When it's good, it's the best action 'done in the old style' film in a long time, but when it starts to believe it has a well crafted, engaging story, it just becomes rather too Hollywood.",971395200,,1184,4.775609756097561

But what really sold the film for me was the star-making turn by Joaquin Phoenix, River's little brother. Taking what could have easily been a one-note, one-dimensional ""villain"", Phoenix absorbs the emperor in true pathos and mortality. His performance gives the film its emotional core, even though many would argue that that feat goes to Crowe. I believe that Scott's film is just as much about the emperor as it is the Gladiator.

The story follows Maximus (Russell Crowe, who is not exactly known for his action credentials) a Roman general who is deemed a traitor and made into a participant in one of the most brutal contests of all time. Joaquin Phoenix's performance almost makes you want to reach out and smack the living daylights out of him (which means he did a great job in his role). Ridley Scott's masterful work behind the camera is evident from the opening scene, eerily foreshadowing the rest of the movie. What this means I leave to you to find out. Worth the money for DVD?

He was one of the very small group of emperors that nothing good can be said.  2)  Rome didn't ""fall due to greed and spectator sports"" - the Roman Empire basically was mortally wounded by plague that depopulated huge areas of the empire, with the resulting economic and military downturns, and due to pressure from the nomadic barbarians and barbarization of the army.  If the two great epidemics (one during Marcus Aurelius's time) hadn't happened, it is very possible today's major language would be based on Latin.  Anyway, it's a GREAT movie - grab it.

Strangely enough the supremely beautiful scene where Maximus the general watches a bird alight on a branch is never mentioned by reviewers, considering its eloquence and almost zen-like aside as life continues in the most horror filled times. The battle scenes are incredible with the full might of the supremely trained and confident Roman army unleashing hell as Crowe put it in the film, such terror the barbarians must have felt being crushed under foot by the superior technological ability of the Romans. The film does not dwell on this but rather fully encapsulates the viewer within the fight scenes as man battles man. Maximus's decline as general in the political battles taking place for Emperorship fling him into slavery and to fight as a gladiator, at every moment Maximus remains human never becoming too much of a hero but staying vulnerable and yet noble and loyal with great strength of character, the sort of man other men would love and follow into battle or anywhere else for that matter.

Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as Commodus, and shows a strong range of acting ability.  Russell Crowe's character who is seeking only peace, must walk through a fire of life in order to gain it.  Crowe portrays a Roman Soldier and gladiator with a sense of honor that one would find in a Marine.  Crowe never loses faith in his purpose to do what he must do, and he honors his word, his family, and the former emperor Marcus Aurelius (Oliver Reed)in the film.  Dijon Honshu (Amistad) plays a good friend and confidant to Maximus.  It is truly a marvelous movie, and a masterpiece of a film.  It is a great story from an incredible and epic time.",970790400,,944,4.473684210526316
1287314,3,B00003CXE6,"Well photographed and engrossing, but fundamentally unbelievable.  ""Gladiator"" has the Emperor of Rome fighting in the colosseum.  Yeah, right.  Don't watch the movie for historical accuracy, or (come to think of it) believable storyline.  Just enjoy the first toga romp for many a year.  Then hire ""Spartacus"", which did it all better, but wasn't able to do some of the effects.",970790400,6,379,5.147540983606557
1287315,4,B00003CXE6,"For a complex film, ""Gladiator"" can still be taken for a simple heroic story. Russell Crowe manages to dominate the screen so well that I spent much of my first viewing anticipating his next appearance in the script. It is the sort of film that needs to be seen at least twice  to understand most of the sub-plots. To an extent, this is a flaw on the part of director Ridley Scott. It should have been possible to focus the narrative a little more clearly than he did.

The main theme of the film concerns General Maximus Decimus Meridius. The opening scenes show him as a competent, charismatic military leader during a battle where his legions brutally decimate the Germanic hordes. As fine a General as he may be, he is a deliberately poor politician. And so it is no surprise when the prodigal political creature, Cesar's son Commodus, played well be Joaquin Phoenix, takes the throne with the aid of a little poison and immediately sets about to secure his position. Maximus is quietly sent away, to be executed, and orders for his wife and children are on their way before he is out of sight.

Not only is Maximus a proficient General but he is also skilled at personal combat. These talents help him to escape his immediate fate but not without some serious wounds. Wounds that slow him enough to prevent any  rescue of his family. And so, we have a classic revenge scenario. The newly crowned Cesar, Commodus, is cast as the villain and Maximus is the hero, bent on revenge. This sort of plot can become laughably predictable but thanks to a decent script and Crowe's outstanding performance, we are forced into the cauldron of hate along with Maximus.

His revenge takes a less direct route than Maximus would have liked, since he is quickly scooped up by slave traders and, due to his imposing physique, snapped up by Proximo, a provincial games promoter. Killing for sport suites Maximus well, even if he would prefer a different face on his opponent. It is not long before Proximo realises that he may have something special. Despite the tempering influence of other fighters, specifically the Numidian Juba, (played with subtle appeal by Djimon Hounsou), Maximus is too efficient. He kills without any lingering flourishes, spoiling the crowd's fun.

All this changes when Proximo gives Maximus a glimpse of hope. The new  Emperor is reopening the games in Rome and needs Gladiators. Proximo tries to tempt Maximus with the freedom of the wooden sword, a symbol of the freedom awarded for truly spectacular performances in the arena. But freedom is not what fires the General's imagination. It is the fact that the Emperor himself presents the award in person, a clear avenue to consummation of his vengeful goals.

Once again the simple linear approach is not taken. Events turn murky as Maximus becomes, at first, a crowd pleaser and then a political power as he successfully and repeatedly defeats the Emperor's chosen on the hot sands of Rome. As his fame spreads, he draws the powerful to him; the Emperor's sister, (and Maximus' former lover), Lucilla, various Senators, and even the Emperor's heir. But in the end it comes down to two, Maximus and Commodus.

A lot of people have praised the special effects and cinematography of Gladiator. Personally, I was less than impressed with many of the scenes, as they seemed muddled and confused. Even the computer-generated work forgot the first rule, reality is imperfect. Everything seemed too newly minted; flawless in its grandeur and therefore slightly suspect. However, the action in the coliseum was breathtaking and some of the solo fights were particularly effective cinema. But at bottom, Gladiator is not a special effects movie. It rests squarely on Crowe's shoulders and he successfully carries it beyond the realms of mediocrity, raising it up to become a modern classic.",970704000,,3850,4.883614088820827

1287318,5,B00003CXE6,"This was a fantastic movie. I enjoyed myself very much watching it. However, a few things must be set straight. The writiers of this film paid little attention to history. Commodus ruled for twelve years and began his reign qite ausipiciously, listening to the advisors of his father. The murder of Marcus Aurelius by his son is pure unfounded speculation by people with little historical conscience. Knowing full well the many historical errors of Gladiator, I must once again reiterate that despite these I loved the movie. It is indeed a very Roman movie. The ancient historians had no qualms about changing things up a bit here and there to make a few heros. The imagery of the field and the wheat is taken straight from the spirit of Rome and the pages of Livy, a Roman historian. The Romans themselves would have agreed that the character of Maximus was excellent. Of course, the special effects and the acting were good as well.",970617600,2,935,4.742331288343558

In this movie, he brings the fanatic and edge of your seat excitement that Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart had to the epic roman battles.  This film had it all, from a great cast to wonderful cinematography and editing.  The only fault I could find was the somewhat anti-climactic ending, but I heard that it was due to some storm that destroyed the sets for the grand epic battle.

1287395,4,B00003CXE6,"The critics lovd it, and almost everyone who went to see it at the movie theater i worked at did as well: even I enjoyed it!  Gladiator was a film that actually took the heroic plot and turned it into a grand epic, that I would have to compare to my movie going experience when I saw ""Titanic"" in December of 1997.  Russell Crowe plays Maximus Decimus Meridius, a Roman General, who is at the command of Marcus Aurillius, an aging Emperor.  While Marcus's son (Joaquin Phoenix) is supposed to be the next ruler, Marcus wants Maximus to lead Rome to a new future.  But upon hearing this news, Marcus's son Commodus destroys him, and proceeds to have Maximus killed as well as his wife and son.  Maximus survives, but soon finds that he has been enslaved.  Wanting revenge for this deed, he uses his skills as a general to make it all the way to the great Colliseum, where he befriend several other gladiators, and with their skills, they triumph in the face of the evil Commodus; but that's not the end of the story;)  Mill films does a grand job for a European FX company in relaizing the Colliseum and shots of a city that no longer can be constructed in our world.  The shots at times cut short and seem to be filmed on separate kinds of filmstock, but the cinematography is much better than what John Woo did on MI2.  On a final note, there isn't as much blood and gore as most would think, but still, if you have children, I caution you to not let them watch this.  Even though Maximus is a heroic general and all, be responsible with what your children view.",970531200,,1563,4.358620689655172

There are only three things that are still bothering me. The first is when Maximus (Russell Crowe) is being brought to the slave market, I thought that the floating effect that they do goes on a bit too long and does not serve any greater purpose.  The second is at the end they showed the compputer generated view of Ancient Rome. That ""shot"" has always bothered me.  I felt that it is not needed and is not relavent to the story they told.  The story is of the Gladiator and his perils not about Rome at all, other than the fact that it takes place there.  The third thing is in the the final battle Maximus is wounded before hand and with a woulnd like he had he would have been much less alert than he was.

But I was very, very disappointed with this film.
First of all, this was a very beautiful film. This was a very well-photographed film, but not the right way. There are certain ways you shoot a film depending on its genre. Epics such as this film should be shot in a grand way such as THE LAST EMPEROR(which was probably the BEST photographed film[Vittorio Storaro])and it can't be shot in a way that films such as THELMA AND LOUISE was, for example, which was a Ridley Scott film. The murky look of the Roman Empire as well as the shot of the Roman city and the Colussium was shot in a way that closed off the grand view from the viwers. Were some shots grand? Yes, but the shots weren't edited right. Many shots in this film were shot in a way that closed off from the audience of what the Roman Empire, the full scale of Roman Empire might have looked like.
Also, the script. The script actually didn't have THAT many problems. But a little more character development for Djimon Hounsou might have been nice, as well as a little more look at what Joaquin Phoenix did after being the friggin Emperor of ROME might have been nice as well!
The music: HANS ZIMMER and LISA GERRARD RULE!!!! I loved the soundtrack. I bought it because I HAD to listen to this finely composed music as well as Lisa Gerrard's beautiful vocals.(especially the ending)
The cast was very very fine. Exceptional work by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and others have pulled off arguably the best ensemble casted in a film this year.
So why do I say ""So Close, but so far away...""? Well, all the ingridients for a very very VERY fine epic film are here: Ridley Scott, one of the most influential film director, Hans Zimmer, God of film music, cinematographer who can pull off beautiful images, and a very fine cast, but WHAT WENT WRONG???!!!! Well, I guess it was just bad choices by some of the people during the production, but I must say, this COULD have been an AWESOME film...",970444800,,2219,4.4950495049504955

From beginging to end the director never lost the guiding principle behind the Russel Crowes characters motives.

But it is the acting and story that really shine every actor and actress put in a good performance but both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix deserve best actor and supporting actor respectively. Crowe as the stalwart loyal General to his Emperor and how is betrayed and imprisoned to become a gladiator while yearning for Vengance for the death of his Faimly.

1287545,4,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator was a movie on a grand scale.  Sometimes this culminated in awe-inspiring vistas and sweeping scenes.  Sometimes it left the lesser characters behind.  The story of a Roman general become fugitive become slave become gladiator, it paints a picture of life in the Roman empire as seen from several social levels and explores the gritty life of the gladiator.
Crowe's character, Maximus, is oringal and a good mix of tough and tender.  Unfortunately most of the other characters are not written with such insight and come across as two dimensional.  This movie truly is carried by Crowe.  The plot is quite predictable at points but the end surprised even me (I have seen so many movies that I can easily spot a cookie cutter plot and usually know how it will end half way through).  It was a refreshing change.  The computer graphics were amazing, especially the shots of the Colesseum, and there was a good balance between the grand sweeping shots and the small private moments that really let the audience get to know the characters.  It would have helped if the moviemakers would have let the audience get closer to Phoenix's and Nielsen's characters but they seemed intent on making the first purely evil and the second a helpless victim.
One thing that the movie did eccel at was recreating the glory and spectacle of the Roman Empire.  Roman culture was well represented and history well meet if stretched at points.  Another triumph of Gladiator was the soundtrack.  It provided a beautiful counterpoint to the big events and subtly underscored the smaller moments.  Plus it blended perfectly with the action in the battle scene and the death scene and really brought Elysium to life.
Gladiator may not be on par with the other cinematic Roman spectacles but it is one of the better ones to come out of that genre.",969667200,8,1830,4.8083067092651754
1287546,5,B00003CXE6,"This is the first rated ""R"" movie I've seen that did not have one foul word or any gratuitus sex scenes and built its foundation on postive values even when confronted with such horrible, cruel power. Russell Crowe truly represented all those great things we would like to be ourselves. Joaquin Phoenix's acting exploration into the character of Commodus was artful.  The graphics were, of course, great and gave an astounding ""view"" of Rome at its height of beauty at its depth of immorality. Zimmer's music brought out the scenes with thought provoking melodies, orchestration and rhythms (e.g. waltzing during a battle) that helped carry the broad strokes of the story, the acting and the directing. Few movies compel me to watch it again and again, but this one is it!

When I saw it I thought it was a very good movie probably the best epic I have seen in a long time. The story was great and so was the acting. There was edge of your seat thrills and a tragic end but overall this movie tops my list of being the best movie this year.,969580800,,365,3.7532467532467533
1287617,5,B00003CXE6,"Gladiator was an excellent movie and has all the aspects required to be a true blockbuster.  Crowe is awesome as the General Maximus and provides an intensity and depth of character that truly makes the viewer emphasize with his trials throughout the film.  Tragically, Oliver Reed, who plays the owner of the gladiator camp, died during filming.  Apparently they digitized his face for the remaining scenes and I thought they succeeded.  However, I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can look for the cover-ups.  Getting back to the film, it appears to be pretty historically accurate.  Commodus did in fact die at the hands of a wrestler/gladiator, although I doubt it occurred in the Coloseum!  The opening battle scene is as intense as any on film, and I guess I was a little disappointed that no other large battles occurred during the rest of it.  In short, great cast, great plot and great cinematography.",969580800,2,917,4.7594936708860756

1287623,5,B00003CXE6,"I've always been a fan of the 'sword and sandal' epics of the '60s (Ben Hur, Spartacus, etc) and I was thrilled to see the genre brought up to date with 'Gladiator'. I don't think Gladiator can fairly be compared to the old classics though, as some have done; different directing methods, cinematography, and other aspects make it difficult.
'Gladiator' is an outstanding film in its own right. The visuals go a long way towards giving us some idea of what ancient Rome really looked like; I especially revelled in the overhead shots of the city and the Coliseum. The set pieces, the battle in Germania, all the fights in the arena are extremely well done and realistic. The attention to detail was amazing.
But the thng that makes the movie shine is Russell Crowe's portrayal of a man who has lost everything, and will risk all that he has left, for revenge. A simple story really, but Crowe as Maximus gives the character a lot of depth and I found his character inspiring. Leaders like Maximus are few and far between, and not always appreciated by those they serve. A man like Maximus inspires others to great things and helps raise them up. I'd follow him to hell and back!
The other supporting cast is also great. Joaquin Phoenix does a fine job as the evil Commodus. Sure, Commodus a lunatic, but in the opening scenes with Emperor Claudius, at least you can see where he's coming from. Oliver Reed is great in his last performance, and the actor who plays Maximus' African friend (can't recall his name) ads a poignant touch (I especially liked his last scene in the Coliseum at the end, when he buries the dolls of Maximus' family in the earth of the Coliseum).
Scenes like that, and others; the scenes with Maximus walking through the wheatfields, the German barbarians screaming their defiance, Maximus and his men refusing to die in the arena, make this movie a real blockbuster.",969494400,7,1891,4.664670658682635

But guess what, Gladiator has come out, and although hard to concieve, this movie is every bit as good as Braveheart, but the battle scenes and intensity of the plot are even better.  This movie is not for people with a weak tolerance for violence, but if you bring yourself to see it, you will understand, as many others do, why this movie is the most intense film ever!",969408000,26,470,4.329545454545454

The end of the story just has to be seen, so I will not reveal the end...

The movie mainly talks about Russell Crowe, (I forgot his name)  who starts out having a wife and a son, and is apart of a war, which he and  his men win. After the war, the king of Rome (Joaquin Phoenix) finds out  about this ""Gladiator"", and for some odd reason, that I forgot,  the king kills his wife and son. The Gladiator finds out that his family is  dead, and decides to go into a championship of fighting, along with other  men, to compete to be able to fight in the Coliseum. One of the fighters,  who is apart of the Gladiator's group, is Djimon Hounsou from the movie  ""Amistad"". Once the Gladiator wins the fights, he finally arrives  in the Coliseum, and does a lot of fighting against man and beast. The king  is very jealous that the Gladiator is winning all these fights, and  finally, at the end of the movie, fights him, and ofcourse, looses, and  dies.

But Ceaser Marcus Arillius wishes him to stay to lead the people of rome into a better  way of life but asking Maximus to become the next Ceaser in  hopes that rome will change , he respectfully declines and rests to begin his jorney home. But the feeble minded Commonus visits the Ceaser to talking and whining about why he should have been voted taliking about virtue and fortitude being  traits of a ruler and after all that suffocates him.
  When maximus recives the news he is troubled by it and is forced to rule with Commonus he declines and is taken by roman
soldiers to be killed. He fights them and charges to his family only to see everything he held dear to ruien. He is picked up by a former Gladiator along with other slaves to train to become a Gladiator and become one he will and one of the greatist he becomes until he gets the honor of fighting in the colloseium where he becomes a true champion among all and a legendary  Gladiator only going by the name spanyard until he reveals his true identity the banished General.

1287772,5,B00003CXE6,"When it comes to these kind of movies, we can not forget the Epics of the 50s such as 'Ben Hur' and 'Qvo Vadis'. But when a movie is filmed in your  homeland and is all over the press then one must see it.
It is a long  movie, so you will need to upgrade to a larger size popcorn for this one.  The storyline has some similarities to the 50's epic 'Ben Hur', but  'Gladiator' leaves 'Ben Hur' to eat dust. The advancement in technology and  special effects are in Gladiator's advantage but so is the casting. We all  remember the artificialness of Charlton Heston's performance but Russell  Crowe is one heck of an actor and he deserves an oscar for his role as  General Maximus.
And of course I still have not mentioned that the movie  was filmed in my beloved Malta. Although one must really work hard in  identifying the shots that where filmed in Malta there are quite a few and  the side of the bastions gives it in.

It combines  the values we are seeking once again of honor, duty, country, and to  family, with old-fashioned moviemaking once thought lost. Ridley Scott and  company have produced a classic of a film that will be enjoyed for years to  come.
Russell Crowe (Maximus) shines brightly amidst the backdrop of  ancient Rome. He brings to the screen a passion rarely seen in a main  character. Joaquin Pheonix(Commodus), is also superb in his role as the  spoiled Prince who takes over for his dead father. The rest of the superb  cast fill out the this epic drama.

The way that maximus was set up as the  protagonist the whole way through, even though he may have become a slave  made you rooting for him all the way up to the finale.

Vibrant without being artificial.  My player doesn't currently support Dolby Vision, but the HDR10 format was fantastic.  And my Sony A1E OLED avoided issues with ""banding"" (or ""artificial contouring"") that I've had in the past with Blu-Ray and DVD copies on other sets.  I'll need to try my standard Blu-Ray copy to see if the banding goes away because of the TV or the format of the movie.

The sound was also fantastic.  I did not play it on a system capable of handling the overhead sound.  But what I got was incredibly engaging, and better balanced with the dialogue than I recall from other copies.

I've watched this film many times, but never since the first time I saw it has it been so engaging.  My heart was actually beating pretty fast a number of times when viewing this copy tonight!  I don't know if it was the improved visuals or the sound that made it so incredibly visceral this time out.  Whatever it was, they've clearly finally addressed all the complaints over the years from reviewers saying they took a lazy approach with previous versions.  This one seems really cleaned up, as if a lot of time and attention was given.  But that's only fitting for such a popular film, and one so meticulously crafted.",1526342400,,1399,4.634146341463414
