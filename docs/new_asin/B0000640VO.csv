1698767,5,B0000640VO,"Amlie - like arisen from a fairytale, Amlie from Wonderland, no, Amlie Poulain from Montmartre in Paris, enchanting big brown impish eyes, lips so red and charming, always smiling, her saucy hair cut, a girl you're simply smitten with.
Amlie enjoys to help, surprise and bring good luck to her neighbours in the lovely area around SacreCoeur, but always secretly, hiding herself. Only once it almost went wrong for her, because our clever little hidden fairy fell in love with the man she'd just helped. But how could any romantic love story ever end sadly with tears in Paris? So go and see the end of the movie and you will wish to be part of it!",999129600,6,648,4.547008547008547
1698768,5,B0000640VO,"I studied abroad in Paris this past spring, and _Amelie_ (known in French as _Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain_, a much more creative title) was one of the defining experiences of my time there.  This film cannot fail to fill the viewer with joy, be it through its warm color palette depiction of Paris, through its haunting musical score, or through the heart-warming performance of  Audrey Tautou as a naive, sprite-like Parisian girl who decides to bring joy to her neighbors' sad lives and in doing so, finds love herself (the romantic interest is sweetly interpreted by Mathieu Kassovitz, distinguished director of _La Haine_).  The stylized performances of the cast together with Jeunet's meticulous cinematography, eclectic editing, and seemingly magical touch weave a spectacular and unforgettable film.  Don't miss it.",997660800,3,830,5.361538461538461

An unstable, frenetic stalker. Not a benevolent, naive do-gooder. Distasteful bodily functions too for those into that.

The movie gets buried under freaky twee. Tautou's gaminesque features were supposed to be enough to carry the show. But Instead of enchanting ingnue, read calculatingly bizarre.

Many have described the storyline, so I won't bother, but I will say that every American filmmaker should study this movie.  It is perfect across the board...impeccable directing, great storyline, fantastic cinematography and design, a charming and beautiful soundtrack.  But, what makes this movie really stand out is the performances.  This should be shown to film students as a superb study in well developed characters, and the entire cast is outstanding, but particularly Audrey Tautou.  This is the movie that made the world fall in love with her, and for good reason.  I don't think a character, (or actress) could be more charming or endearing, and Tautou plays it to perfection.

This is a French film, with English subtitles, but for goodness sake, have an open mind, and just watch it.  I promise it is worth it.",1490227200,15,923,4.828025477707007

She doesn't learn the social skills that other children her age do, and she retreats, becomes an introvert. As she reaches her late teens, she goes to work as a waitress in Montmartre at the Two Windmills bar. Amelie doesn't have a boyfriend and it's not from a lack of desire. She has resigned to amusing herself with simple pleasures often in solitude. Until one day, she happens upon Nino Quincompoix in a busy substation. She experiences a rush of emotion, euphoria and heart palpitations spur her imagination. Sadly, she is too gripped by shyness and paralyzed by a fear of failure that she cannot muster the requisite temerity to approach him and break the ice with small talk. As he scurries about, not taking notice of her, he leaves behind his photo album. She retrieves it and runs after him to return it. She is unable to catch up to him, and she has this idea of a game to pique his interest in her. She leaves him a succession of messages and maps about where he can find his album (a scavenger hunt).",1466380800,11,1189,4.613207547169812

Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel did a masterful job with the camera and the visual effects give the film more delight in a subliminal way. Make sure to get the edition with the special features.

From the start I was engrossed in the movie. My interest peaked after reading a description of it and seeing a brief trailer. It's no understatement as I say that peak carried throughout the entirety of the movie. The quirky humor and wonderful creativity that envelops this film sets it apart from many movies I've seen. I won't go into detail as I wouldn't dream of spoiling the movie for you, though I will say this movie is comparable to a book that finds resonance with a person. Having finished it, they see in the same way though find wonder in a new perspective and a familiar feeling of innate positive emotion.

1700581,4,B0000640VO,"The movie has aged well in the decade and a half since its first release. The only problem is that streaming version from Amazon Prime is below DvD quality, so it detracted from my enjoyment of it this time around. I last watched it in the hey-day of Netflix DvD rentals, and it felt grittier of lower screen quality since I last watched it. The movie was worth of 5 out of 5 stars, as it is, in my opinion at least, the  best romantic comedy in the French language to date. The only sad part is that part of the reason why it may look as it does now is because the quality of our televisions is so much higher than even a decade ago and it was not able to be reformated properly, which is a terrible shame, Likely however, there was no attempt to do so, and even greater shame to be sure.",1459123200,,789,4.0576923076923075

Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""Delicatessen"", ""Mimacs"",  ""A Very Long Engagement"")  is at his directorial best. His use of images, color, music, humor, dialogue and stellar casting will titillate your senses like cinema champagne.",1457827200,,489,5.48

1700687,5,B0000640VO,"Amiele is a story about coming into your own skin. Amelie, the main character of the story of course, happens to be going through this process later in life than most. Due to her unusual circumstances as a child, she is left to navigate her emotions and understanding of close relationships in her early twenties, as opposed to early teens.
 Even though I went through this learning stage at a much younger age, I can still relate to Amelie. Finding ways to express yourself and getting past the nervousness of being shy in new situations is hard. Amelie is adjusting to being out in the world instead of being isolated in her parents home. Shes has coworkers, neighbors to her building, and finds a man who she likes. Each of these types of relationships take practice to be comfortable. Its a lot like when I moved out of my parents house and had a lot more responsibility and independence. With independence comes a need for a lot more social skills.
 Even though Amelie was isolated most of her life, in the end she is able to make friends with neighbors, and even her crush! I think that she is still on her journey of becoming truly comfortable in her own skin but she made a lot of progress. You can tell she is a good person and wants to help people, even if it is a bit odd the way she goes about it. And that's part of the charm because everyone has their quarks.",1457654400,,1373,4.3803921568627455

1700745,5,B0000640VO,"Jean-Pierre Jeunets striking and memorable portrait of Amelie both surprised and delighted me. Perhaps lulled by the opening scenes, I admit that, at the onset of the film, I sat back and prepared myself for a quirky and nonsensical foray into the irreverent lives of several bizarre and eccentric characters. All of the ingredients were there: jerky cinematography, characters bordering on caricature, satire, humor, and parody. But Amelie is so much more! The film is a roller coaster ride of the senses that transported me through space and time, and had me leaning forward in my seat and cheering her on.

Amelies childhood was spent isolated from other children. Her parents were not inclined toward displays of affection, and left Amelie largely to her own devices. While Amelies imagination thrived in these circumstances, she emerged from childhood painfully shy and devoid of social skills. She soon found that she had a knack for secretly manipulating circumstances and events in a way that brought joy and healing to others. But the sad truth is that her own social inadequacies prevented her from doing the same for herself. When Amelie finally found the courage to overcome her fears in the pursuit of love, I rejoiced in her courage.

Amelie spoke to me of the ability of the human spirit to rise above circumstances. It reminded me of the sheer joy that is to be found by enriching the lives of others through small acts of human kindness. And it made me realize that experiences, both good and bad, build layers of character. Amelie took a proactive stance in choosing happiness, and her spirit beautified the lives of those she engaged. I feel somehow changed by this film; Amelie sparked within me a resolve to choose happiness. And this not for myself alone, but I am inspired to actively seek to affect a measure of happiness in each of the lives that I touch.",1457136000,,1880,4.853582554517134
1700746,3,B0000640VO,"Subtitled, but still very watchable. There's something ""different"" about foreign movies and the way they are made and shot that gives them a different ""mood"" and Amelie is a prime example of this. That alone is reason to check this out. Otherwise, this is basically the story of a young woman dreamily pursuing a lead she thinks will bring her true love. It's not too soppy, but it was a bit longer than I thought necessary - although maybe I was just tired reading the subtitles.. I spent the last 30 mins just wishing it would hurry up and reach its ""reveal""....",1457049600,,564,4.53921568627451

Audrey Tautou as the titular Amelie is very charming.  She works as a waitress, who unravels one mystery after another, and her observations are acute, friendly, and sweet.  She only wants to do good, and everybody loves her.

She falls in love, but she's diffident, not quite sure.

This is a film, which wants her to be happy, believes she should be happy, but poor Amelie is unsure.  She hesitates to the last second.

This film is beautifully shot, and I loved the quick shots of France.

An utterly charming lovely film.

1701526,3,B0000640VO,"I gave this movie three stars, because for one, I am tough on films. This film had some elements that I just felt ruined it. One of the worst though was the premise that a shy person needs someone else (a romantic interest) to be happy. As a shy person, I loved the idea that she was alone, and yet so creative in how she saw things! I loved the scenes of her by herself in her apartment, but perhaps it is because I cannot imagine any better life than being left to dream and ponder, without the interference of other people. The fact that an ""introvert"" needed ""changed"" to be happy was irritating. What about a film about the ""extrovert"" who needs to change to be happy? Not many of those it would seem. Yet life cannot be appreciated unless it is appreciated moment by moment, in a slow, dreamlike manner. This is why we escape to the movies - to allow ourselves to pass into the viewpoint of an actor, who is paid to savor each moment for dramatic affect - and thus touch our lives. Because we cannot savor, we turn to others. Yet it is the introverts themselves who change the world, save it if you will - through their appreciation of the little things. I loved that about this movie - she noticed little things that others did not, and delved into them as if she had been handed an original Da Vinci, or a Rembrandt, or a Renoir. She was a connoisseur of life - and one can never truly be when they are wrapped up in externals. But they treated it at the end as if there was something wrong with her, which could only be adjusted by being more extroverted. Au contraire! It is the rest of the world that needs to learn to look more within, as she did. That, and she fell in love with a guy who works in a porn shop. Really tacky. But the movie is very unique and creative. But five stars? She was five stars - until the rest of the film happened.",1442448000,3,1854,4.181564245810056

It has all the hallmark Jeunet ingredients: Whimsy, oddball characters, humor, a great story, score and is beautifully shot. I especially love the setting. Audrey Tautou is great in this (as is she in A Very Long Engagement), she brings a cute girl-next-door and sweet innocence to her character Amlie. It is a very feelgood film and the only Rom-Com I own, although not a traditional format it is great because it breaks the stale mold and is a breath of fresh air.",1441929600,,614,4.747663551401869

Amelie is a cute love story about a girl who lives more in her head then in the real world.  One day she decides to make a difference and help people find happiness.  Amelie on the other hand has to learn that in order to truly live life she has to break open her box and throw caution into the wind.",1438819200,,618,4.032786885245901

1701773,5,B0000640VO,"Beautiful movie. The French have a great quality in many of their films, where characterization doesn't necessarily mean focusing on flaws in a character, or having a perfect heroic character. Instead, French film characters are typically very quirky, in ways that helps to express their humanity. This is especially true in Amelie. You can't help but love the protagonist, even if she is kind of a creep, honestly.

The soundtrack is written by Yann Tiersen, and is absolutely perfect. I often find myself listening to the soundtrack, especially on a nice walk outside. The music flows perfectly with the movie, and matches the atmosphere perfectly. The colorful, romantic, picturesque idea many people (in America at least) hold about France can be seen throughout the film.

Every friend I've recommended the film to has absolutely loved it. Several have returned telling me that it's their new favorite film. If nothing else, you'll feel just a tad happier after watching this film. This movie is especially good for a night with your significant other.",1437436800,2,1057,5.1395348837209305

1701859,5,B0000640VO,"Extremely wonderful or beautiful things often leave me struggling for words. That was how I felt about this movie. Leaving the theater, I was still completely lost in the world that Jean-Pierre Jeunet created. Why would I want to leave when everything was so perfect and silly and beautiful there? It's been a while since a movie has made me feel so good about the world and life in general. This movie did that because of its simple beauty and strangeness, and I left the theater with a sense of gratitude. I am not ashamed to admit that I love (need?) a happy ending every once in a while.
There were two narrative techniques which I found especially endearing. The first was the idea of setting up a scene or event by telling the audience about several completely unrelated and sometimes insignificant things that were happening simultaneously. The second was introducing the characters by listing a few of their idiosyncratic likes and dislikes. This was a wonderful and different way to develop the characters-it made me feel strongly for each of them immediately.
Amelie is an unabashedly strange girl with an un-self-conscious smile and an amazing imaginary life. The movie begins with her tragic childhood with self-absorbed, neurotic parents and no friends. Amelie is forced to rely on her imagination for entertainment, companionship, and other things that a young girl needs in growing up. However, she raises herself well and becomes a self-sufficient, quirky, good-hearted (if a little socially isolated) 23-year-old. This is where we meet her next, working as a waitress and following her odd little passions. A random discovery leads her to try to fix everyone's life around her, both through good deeds and petty vengeances. Even as she is absorbed in this mission, she is slowly moving toward fixing her own life. The series of events that fill the middle section of the movie are wild, funny, touching and revealing.
I found this movie entirely likable (though I admit to a penchant for quirkiness). I also found the whole movie visually appealing. Audrey Tautou is beautiful as Amelie, every scene is full of vivid color and detail, and all the characters have extremely interesting faces and personalities. I highly recommend ""Amelie"" to anyone looking for a light-hearted, feel-good, change-your-perspective kind of movie...",1436400000,2,2345,5.093506493506493

1702022,3,B0000640VO,"A quirky movie with a winsome lead character, Amelie, and a supporting cast of characters whose lives are as off balance as hers and intertwine in unexpected and unpredictable ways.  Showing up, taking charge, and taking a chance on life despite our insecurities can change not only our own destiny, but that of those around us, seems to be the central theme.  The frequent use of a narrator instead of dialog gives the movie a narrative literary quality that is unusual and interesting.  Brief nudity and sexual context occur in several scenes, but are a natural part of the plot and don't feel added to obtain an R rating and thus attract a larger audience.  This French film with English sub-titles is not for everyone, as it is more a whimsical look at life and not a big action drama.  However, it is a refreshing change from high budget Hollywood blockbusters and deserves the audience it has attracted.",1432944000,,909,4.727848101265823

It has sub-titles that flash a little too quickly but that and the fact that the film is so good has lead me to re watch it numerous times and each time I've noticed something new! I think when people say it's their 'go to film' for lighthearted movie with artistic flair, plus that good feeling you get when characters are people who feel disenfranchised and whose experiences overlap, find one another and life is better for it... this is the film! One warning: this is mostly a comedy in a quirky kind of way. There is one brief scene where an unrelated person throws themselves off a building as told by the narrator, so if anyone has experienced suicide in their family, it might cause some upset, however, it is not meant as to be insensitive, it's meant to be shown as an event that causes certain changes to Amelie's own life.",1427673600,,886,4.408536585365853

Cheesy? Absolutely.
Simplistic? Definitely.
But also light, quirky, playful, 'innocent' and yet somehow strangely gripping and deep.
And of course, like every self-respecting fairy tale, Amelie packs a couple of visually well crafted lessons that give us a glimpse into what it would be like, if we could balance a seemingly dichotomous existence of an adult life with a certain childish innocence, fearless curiosity, and excitement.",1427155200,3,592,5.242105263157895

1702502,5,B0000640VO,"This is my favorite movie. Words can't even describe. I found this movie when I was only a little kid, and I used to watch it alone in my room like it was a secret. It felt like it was made for me, and I didn't want to share it with anyone else because it was MY movie. I've talked to a lot of my friends who have seen it, and they used to think the exact same thing. Amelie, although quirky and a little awkward, is touchingly relatable- especially if you yourself are a little quirky and awkward. The storytelling and narration are dry, maybe a little sardonic, and the characters are incredibly vibrant and colorful. There are little touches of the fantastical and science fictional, but somehow that just brings you closer. It's a beautifully spun realistic narrative that seems like a fantasy, which kind of makes you feel like you're as vivid and interesting as the characters. It makes you feel special. It's beautiful.

1702626,5,B0000640VO,"Destined to be one of the top classics of all time. Because of the circumstances of her upbringing, Amelie is a loner and shy. There is an elderly fragile artist in a downstairs apartment who she meets and who indirectly gives her advice and comments on her life through a painting he is working on, on which she projects herself onto a girl in the picture. There is a mean man working a market who has an intellectually challenged young man working for him. And then there is the guy who shy Amelie spots retrieving pictures from under a photo booth, and for him she forms an infatuation. When he loses a  photo album which Amelie recovers, it becomes Amelie's chance to meet him. Amelie is full of stratagems, as she plots to meet this guy, discover the strangeness of one person appearing over and over in the photo album of discarded pictures, perpetrate some sort of justice on the mean man, and have the traveling gnome bring happiness to her father. You will enjoy this light comedy and be intrigued as these stratagems unfold. See it, enjoy it.",1419379200,2,1052,4.5661375661375665

1702690,5,B0000640VO,"Am&eacute;lie (Original French title: Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain aka The Fabulous Destiny of Am&eacute;lie Poulain) is a romantic comedy film that is a whimsical depiction of contemporary Parisian life, set in Montmartre. It tells the story of a shy waitress, who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, while struggling with her own isolation. The film was an International co-production between companies in France and Germany.

Am&eacute;lie Poulain is a young woman who had grown up isolated from other children. After the death of her mother and her father's subsequent withdrawal, she developed an unusually active imagination to ward away the feelings of loneliness. Now at the age of twenty-three, Am&eacute;lie is a waitress at Caf&eacute; des 2 Moulins, a small caf&eacute; in Montmartre that is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. Having spurned romantic relationships following a few disappointing efforts, she finds contentment in simple pleasures and letting her imagination roam free. She is a young woman who had a decidedly unusual childhood; misdiagnosed with an unusual heart condition, Amelie didn't attend school with other children, but spent most of her time in her room, where she developed a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. Her mother Amandine died in a freak accident when Amelie was eight, and her father Raphael had limited contact with her, since his presence seemed to throw her heart into high gear. Despite all this, Amelie has grown into a healthy and beautiful young woman who works in a cafe and has a whimsical, romantic nature. When Princess Diana dies in a car wreck in the summer of 1997, Amelie is reminded that life can be fleeting and she decides it's time for her to intervene in the lives of those around her, hoping to bring a bit of happiness to her neighbors and the regulars at the cafe. Amelie starts by bringing together two lonely people -- Georgette, a tobacconist with a severe case of hypochondria, and Joseph, an especially ill-tempered customer. When Amelie finds a box of old toys in her apartment, she returns them to their former owner, Mr. Bretodeau, sending him on a reverie of childhood. Amelie befriends Dufayel, an elderly artist living nearby whose bones are so brittle, thanks to a rare disease, that everything in his flat must be padded for his protection. And Amelie decides someone has to step into the life of Nino, a lonely adult video store clerk and part-time carnival spook-show ghost who collects pictures left behind at photo booths around Paris.

The feel-good Amelie is a lively, fanciful charmer, showcasing Audrey Tautou as its delightful heroine. The sunniest face and the greatest acclaim belong to Tautou, who is new to these shores. A delight in the title role, she's like a young Audrey Hepburn, making us laugh and feel empathy without feeling manipulated. Finally,Jeunet's film is an ambitious, rich, and rewarding experience, packed end-to-end with delightful creativity.",1417392000,2,3031,5.14604462474645

1702727,3,B0000640VO,"I actually avoided this film for a long time (obviously) because 1. I like to go against the grain and 2. the look on Tautou's face on the cover was so forced it looked kind of sinister. lol

I liked it better than I thought though, but I don't think I'd give it a straight up 4 - still the creativity deserves more than just ""ok.""  Very original, cute, interesting but the story could have been a tighter.  Quite frankly, by the end of the movie I was just annoyed with Amelie.  I think they could have accomplished what they wanted in the story/plot/message etc with a little more disciplined writing.

And that face?  Yeah.  I was kind of right in my original snap judgment (IMHO, of course).  Tautou is beautiful, but she is always filmed from the top, emphasizing her eyes and with that *same* expression. It looked forced (and freaky) a lot of the time and by the middle of the movie her ""uber innocence""  was painted on so thickly, it felt contrived.  A softer touch would have been more effective in my opinion.

Definitely quirky, original, cute with some interesting characters.  The side stories (of the people around her) wasn't completed though for me.  The plot jerked and skipped from paying them a lot of attention to kind of dropping them or making them go off in random directions with an attempt at a neat tie-up of a few characters in the very end (kind of like they ran out of time?).  I felt that was a little sloppy.  I particularly wanted to see a little resolution with the grocer/grocery boy (poor guy!)

Amelie was an interesting character but her psych wasn't realistic... and I know nothing about this is... but it seemed inconsistent to me. From pranking to being very verbal to being withdrawn to being in her own world and then in everyone else's and being passive aggressive... if they are making a caricature of a who she'd be after her upbringing, I think she would have been just as charming (more so) if she'd been more organic.

All in all a visually interesting and well-filmed movie with some very smart and creative perspectives.  Subtitles were poor (as many have said) but I don't think poor enough that you can't enjoy it as it is (you just miss some stuff).

Don't regret the time but, in the end though, I won't watch it again.",1416614400,2,2273,4.513447432762836

Yes, it is in French with subtitles but if you've been afraid of foreign movies for this reason, well, get over it.  You're missing out on some wonderful films and after a while your brain will adjust to the concept of reading and watching at the same time.

Amelie is a shy waitress with a playful nature who lives a somewhat isolated life due to a childhood with eccentric parents.  As an only child who was NEVER allowed to go to school or to interact with other children, Amelie had developed an active imagination. Now a young adult on her own, she fills her life of loneliness by performing random acts of kindness.  It is a French language movie with English subtitles that are easy to follow. If you are learning French, it's a great movie to watch. Finally, classifying this movie as a romantic comedy doesn't do it justice because there's more depth to it than that. It is a creative, unique, and delightful film that won many awards and was nominated for 5 Academy Awards. You'll enjoy it.",1411430400,,842,4.644295302013423

1703034,4,B0000640VO,"Amelie is a highly stylized fable, from a director who made his name in television commercials, so it's whimsical, visual, fantastical, fast-paced and super-saturated with information. For some viewers this may be a bit tedious, becoming tiresome with all of the mega-input. But if you like the fast pace of the Simpsons, or Family Guy, or a typical Federal Express commercial, then you'll love Amelie. It's sort of a live-action cartoon. Amelie is a charming story about a lonely and shy French girl who learns how to love by doing good things for others. It won a ton of awards when it was released, and those accolades were deserved. There is nothing ""real"" about it except for the tears it will bring to your eyes as Amelie goes through her ups and downs.

After finding a treasure box that was hidden by a former occupant of her apartment, she decides to find him and return it to him (secretly).  He is so happy to see it, that Amelie decides to devote her life to her friends, and to making them happy, and eventually, finding love and making herself happy.  Every actor gives a wonderful performance.  I especially liked her landlady, Madeleine.  She's the one that Amelie told, ""I'm no one's little weasel""......

A delightful comedy, to be sure, but embodied in the quest for romance by it's two quirky heroes are many themes that touch us all as humans.

This movie is nothing I would have picked to watch (someone else made me watch it), but it was just odd enough to capture my attention.  First we start off with Amelie's conception and then it highlights certain pivotal moments of her childhood.  GENIUS!  Without giving too much away, we see her craftiness in childhood when she takes revenge.  Another moment of GENIUS!  The director is genius.  This movie is genius.

Great scenery.  Great acting.  Great casting.  Amelie is very relatable, especially to other introverts.  I found myself reminiscing on how I was like her when I was younger and more shy.  Audrey Tautou reminded me of Audrey Hepburn.  They couldn't have picked a more gorgeous Amelie.

Audrey Tautou is, as always, brilliant (but never more so than in this film). I own the Criterion edition of this and I can't think of a better movie to watch  again and again when you're having a bad day. Also the perfect film to give you hope that there is romance in this world  for everyone. I'd also recommend the film MICMACS, done by the same director.

The reason for the R rating was because of a very brief sex scene and one scene inside a porn shop. ( Nothing graphic, nothing that one would not see walking along the streets of Paris, frankly. I'm not excusing it, it's just the truth.)  Within the first few minutes, I didn't even notice the subtitles - I was totally engulfed in the story.",1393545600,,494,4.455555555555556

This is a movie that doesn't make you feel anxious, or angry, or sad... It makes you feel GOOD.  It may not be suitable for those who need their anxious/angry/sad-movie fix.  The imagery in this film is dreamy, sometimes queasy... with its occasional ""under the sea"" color balance, but it's a fun analogy for anyone who's ever felt shy, or dreamy, or, or...

If you think you can't enjoy a movie being forced to read sub-titles then give this one a try. It has more then enough dialog that you can afford to miss some and the on screen performers do a great job of telling the story in gestures and expressions.
  I actually wanted my fiancee to see it and had forgot all the reasons why I liked it (it has been many years since I first saw it). I was almost preparing my self for a chick-flic but faint memories told me it would be okay.

So here I go watching this movie and the way it's put together is amazing, camera work, the set design, the acting, everything looks beautiful but film is not just to make pretty images, a story is also important. I noticed myself getting bored and drifting off every 20 minutes or so, not because I can't get with intellectual dialogue or follow a side story but there was no real conflict or turning point that mattered to our main character.

Amelie is very pretty indeed, and the movie LOOKS great, but can I watch a girl just walking around being nice for 2 hours? no and when she does find something that interests her it becomes a game for her instead of a challenge, so if she's got it all figured out whats her problem?

Yes I would rank it under pseudo-intellectual, it's not 100% trash but I'd never watch it again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, there are better films that show you pretty things and maintain an actual storyline.",1390348800,,1186,4.481481481481482

1703769,5,B0000640VO,"One of my favorite movies of the early 00s, and seeing it again on Blu-ray was a treat. The transfer was solid (I didn't do bench mark tests or anything of that technicality, just watched it on my Samsung HDTV and remembered how it looked in the theatre and the DVD I had, but hadn't watched in like 5 or 6 years). There are some flaws that are revealed, but I think that's a function of how CGI and other VFX compositing and coloring was done when the film was produced.

The story, acting and directing is all top notch, as this film put Jean-Pierre Jeunet at the height of the internationally-acclaimed filmed directors after doing director-for-hire work on ALIEN 4.

Always meant to be a love letter to the City of Lights, Amelie still carries its fairy tale charm (that you'll either love or hate, I happen to love it) and Audrey Tautou shines as the titular character. The director's signature is writ at large on this film, and its style is superbly executed.

The extras on this Blu-ray mimic those from the DVD (at least I think, I don't remember what was on the DVD and I don't want to look that up, because anyone can do that at DVDBeaver or some site like that with better accuracy than I can give).",1386460800,2,1211,4.397321428571429

Delightful and soothing and funny at times. Some quirky stuff was a little weird (collecting discarded photo machine photos?) but I didn't let that stop me from enjoying the entirety and refreshing originality of this film.

1704042,5,B0000640VO,#1. I love French movies. Their humor takes odd twists. This actress. Audrey Tautou has the most precious facial exspressions. I laughed out loud in several place. Naughtey but not vulgar like so many American movies. I.m sick of farts getting laughs B O R I N G . GROW UP!,1380499200,,273,4.372549019607843
1704043,5,B0000640VO,This movie is beautifully written and filmed. I will watch it again and again. I will go and watch other movies by this writer/director.,1380499200,,136,4.708333333333333

1704066,5,B0000640VO,"The French seem to have a gift for quirky comedy that nobody can duplicate. I loved this movie when it first came out. Have only seen it for the second time now, on Amazon. It is as fresh as ever. An extremely difficult style of comedy to pull off successfully.

If you are not into subtitles, don't let that put you off. It is almost a silent movie, with minimal dialogue. Wonderful sight gags that you will never forget.",1380412800,,422,4.341772151898734
1704067,5,B0000640VO,I love this movie for all the creativity that went to it. We watched it as a Instant Stream. It was good quality no stop or stutter. Sound was good too.,1380412800,,152,3.935483870967742

1704071,5,B0000640VO,"A favorite film. Whimsical, funny, beautiful. I gifted a friend with this dvd and she also loves it. Just may have to order one for myself!",1379894400,,139,4.384615384615385
1704072,5,B0000640VO,Audrey Tautou is charming and witty in this movie. So much of the movie is based on the players facial expressions and body  movements you will not miss any of the action by reading the subtitles. The story line is explained at the very beginning so pay attention. I have to admit my second viewing was a far better experieence since I could enjoy the movie without having wonder who or what was happening. This is one of my go to movies when I feel like just having a good time for a couple of hours. Ms Tautou has made many French movies but Americans will remember her as the female police officer who helped Tom Hanks in the De Vinci Code.,1379808000,,643,4.270491803278689
1704073,5,B0000640VO,"This movie is extremely funny. At times whimsical, and at other times quite insightful. It manages to capture the pace and energy of living in Paris, but the entire film revolves around Amlie's efforts to maintain a level of warmth and human interaction that are missing from her life. The movie presents Paris from Amlie's singularly unique point of view, and it's impossible not to love.

The story starts with a number of vignettes as we see young Amlie growing into adulthood, while the remainder of the story centers around a set of coincidences that convinces her to try and change the lives of those around her for the better. The pacing with which this movie jumps from scene to scene is often quite energetic (and in some ways similar to the films of Baz Luhrmann).

Yann Tiersen's soundtrack is in my top 5 of the best ever composed, and probably #1 for how well that score fits the film. Its unique combination of accordion and piano is so good that it kicked off more than a decade of very bad imitators any time a movie or tv show was set in Paris (the most amusing rip-off of which I heard was in season 3 of Project Runway).

Parents be warned: Quick but slightly graphic depiction of birth at the beginning, a few scenes depicting sex (mostly comical with mild female nudity), and one of the characters works in a Sex shop. The sex shop is more of an issue on High Def screens, since when I first watched this 10+ years ago I hadn't even realized that character was putting price tags on (boxed) sex toys.

The subtitles, while adequate, do fail to capture some of what's being said, particularly by the narrator. Though this doesn't prevent you from following the movie, some of the poignancy and detail of the narrator's comments are lost.",1379808000,,1757,4.568253968253968

This version said that it would not load because I lived in the wrong area. Immediatly it was almost impossible to open the box. Some fancy press in mechanism that was broken from the start(should have been a sign) but if you don't live in  area 2(wherever that is) then don't waste your money.

1704149,5,B0000640VO,"The French have a somewhat unique sense of humor... After all, they think Jerry Lewis is the king of comedy!!! However, ""Amelie"" is great in any geography. Very funny, very droll, and Audrey Tautou is phenomenal. And, the supporting cast is superlative. The only chance of something this good of being produced in the US would be if the Cohen Brothers did it.
Highly recommended.",1379030400,,379,4.846153846153846
1704150,5,B0000640VO,"The director uses special effects to portray emotions in ways ONLY possible in film media.  And, it is assumed the viewer is not an idiot that needs to have every detail explained on a simplistic level.  The story is sweet, open-ended, and a marvelous exploration of what being a modern, creative young female looks like, without the financial 'how does she support herself?' wizardry so prevalent in movies and tv.  a great movie for anyone, but especially young women.",1379030400,,470,4.924050632911392

1704286,1,B0000640VO,"French movies aren't all that good to begin with but  ""Amelie"" is one of the worst I've seen.  It tries to be original but ends up being ridiculous.  The characters look like creeps and the story is boring.  The French shouldn't  try so hard.  They should stick to simple, straightforward plots like ""Jean de Florette"" or the hilarious ""Bienvenue chez les Chtis"" and leave the complex stuff to American or German film makers.",1376956800,,425,4.7534246575342465

Possibly one of my favorite fun movies!  Just watched it again, some 11 years later, and just as fun as when I first saw it.",1376870400,,289,4.5
1704318,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is such a heart-warming film about a French girl who is a little bit odd and a little bit of an outsider, which I imagine many of us are who are drawn to this film. I even recommend this movie for teens/tweens despite the ""R"" rating; the rating is due to the nature of the adult shop where Nino works and two brief scenes depicting...ahem...""intimate moments"" in the beginning. If parents are uneasy with their kids seeing it, it's easily remedied by putting a hand over their eyes for a few minutes.

The directing is superb and the film's story really plucks at the chords of both heart and funny-bone. Highly recommend.",1376784000,,629,4.566371681415929

1704324,3,B0000640VO,"This movie's format was quite different from the usual fare. It appeals to one's sense of intimacy, humanness, and sociability. In a French kind of way. The video cover pic of Audrey Tautou for ""Amelie""  is hideous, IMHO. Don't let that throw you.

1704360,5,B0000640VO,"This is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  If you like movies of transformation, with some quirk and whimsy thrown in for good measure, you should enjoy this film.  It seems totally original to me.  Amelie, played by Audrey Tatou, has been damaged by life's circumstances, and because of her resulting sensitivity she is able to intuit the needs of different people she knows and meets and supply those needs in unique ways.  To sprinkle their lives with a touch of magic and whimsy.  When watching it, you realize that life needs more whimsy and silliness.

Audrey Tatou is simply enchanting as Amelie - and yes, she is very Audrey Hepburnish.  It's hard to imagine anyone else playing this central role with the same aplomb and gamine artistry.  The book is more character-centered than plot centered.  If you like linear plots, it will probably frustrate you.  But if you like small intelligently sentimental vignettes, the movie should reach your heart and delight you.  I found it totally charmante and can watch it again and again.  It's a little work of film art.  And how refreshing to have an upbeat film with an affirming message.",1376524800,,1152,4.757575757575758
1704361,5,B0000640VO,"It brings about a certain amount of hope to the human race.
You have an eccentric girl who never fit in that finds joy in helping others in her own unusual means and along the way, finds someone who is just as strange and travels a personal journey where as a young woman, she has to overcome the difficulties of typical social norms in order to pursue her own happiness.

There is a certain innocence that is inherent in the main character, Amelie, that is almost taboo to adults who are expected to conform to their surroundings. It is that eccentricity that brings about the funny bits and the angles she has chosen to help others, and in some cases, her feelings of hopelessness that most would have chosen to ignore.

It is difficult to not smile towards the end.",1376438400,,768,4.478571428571429

It was heart warming and charismatic. It reminded me to appreciate the little things in life more, to stop and smell the roses so to speak. Of course it is subtitled, however, I think I enjoyed it more that way. It would've ruined a lot of the charm (for me) if they dubbed the English language in it.",1376352000,2,471,4.075268817204301

Amelie is an introverted young French girl that feels for the down-trodden and sad of her world and sets out (by way of experiment) to do something about it.

Even when Tautou looks straight into the camera and makes a statement to the audience, you are not jarred, but it's more as if you have become a conspirator to the action.

This movie however,  with  humor and depth,  had me watching it several times to attempt to figure it out.  Until I just read Bernard's review,  I had no idea what lied behind the translation.  It's time I took up the French language.  Knowing a list of vocabulary words is not enough for me anymore.  I can almost relate to the protagonist--being an only daughter of elderly parents--and figuring life out in my own 'creative' ways.  I would highly recommend this amusing comedy.  Just to clarify, this is not a 'nudity free' production; however, the flashes of such scenes that she has in her mind are fleeting thoughts and created 'humorously' which add to the movie's humor, yet I definitely could live without and still see this as an awesome production.",1374969600,,1039,4.685082872928176

The narrator is so unique, the seemingly mundane things that are reported tend to bear relevance to the development of the plot. I laughed so much during the narration of Amelie's early life. This film is all about caring about other people's well-being, being true to yourself and taking risks in reaching out to others and forming relationships. Amelie's introverted character made me exasperated at times, but the film finishes with a classic alls-well-that-ends-well. It's a quirky interesting gem of a foreign film. :)",1373846400,,599,5.0

1704644,1,B0000640VO,"This movie I watched for a few minutes and well, the unexpected plot, strange characters, I was sort of caught off guard. From the start I found the Amelie character, in some ways criminal. I didn't find the movie appealing at all, it was extremely boring and also strange. I even tried to watch a second time just figure out why so much appeal and the same conclusion. Maybe I need to move the time bar way up and watch the porn scenes (excuse me, soft porn scenes).",1373760000,2,467,4.318181818181818
1704645,4,B0000640VO,"Charming and humane yet too many directorial missteps and plot holes deprive it of excellence. The single biggest flaw is that by the end of the movie Amelie still doesn't represent anything. She means well but her stratagems sometimes backfire (as with the romance she instigates at the cafe) and at other times reduces herself to the level of her antagonist (the revenge she seeks on the owner of the vegetable stand). As the man with the glass bones recognizes her subterfuges are simply dodges around her own faint heart. Despite all the directorial prancing and narrative quirkiness she winds up in bed at the end with her new love like any ordinary couple. The ending doesn't bring a sense triumph and cheer but simply a sense of relief that the drama is finally over.

Amelie is a good movie. It is well placed and despite the fact the lead character is something of an oddball the narrative never strains credulity. The lead character is likable enough that we want her to succeed and different enough to be entertaining. Those who enjoy ""art for art's sake"" will love this move but those wishing for some moral heft will be disappointed.",1373673600,,1146,4.73
1704646,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is an amazing Romantic Comedy that has a little bit of ourselves within it. The protaganist, helpless Amelie played by French Actress Audrey Tautou, has had a life filled with isolation. She is constantly ignored by her father and after leaving home, she is let into the real world. After discovering a toy box buried in her apartment from the 60s, she sets her mind on helping others. The irony is that despite her strong efforts to solve other people's problems, she has trouble solving her own. Her main problem is confronting the man she loves, unfortunately her awkward self makes it impossible to succeed with this task, so she communicates with him in creative and strange ways.

The setting of course is France, and the film has a very pleasing green and red tint to it that adds to the magic and emotion.
The characters are great and expressing common French Persona.

Although this movie is not appropriate for kids*, it will bring out the youth in all of us. You are sure to enjoy this film!

*This film does have a few scenes that contain nudity and sex. All uncensored, so if you don't like seeing those kinds of things, don't watch this film.",1373587200,,1163,4.608695652173913
1704647,5,B0000640VO,I am a heterosexual middle aged man. The sweetness of this French romance gets me every time.(No... There's just something in my eye!) Amelie is an enchanting woman with a tendency towards daydreaming. In spite of her own misfortunes she makes a conscious effort to improve the lives of people around her. But while she is busy caring about everyone else who cares for her? If I made a list of my top ten favorite movies this one would make it into my top five.,1373500800,,461,4.435294117647059

1704669,4,B0000640VO,"This is movie is cute, cute, cute, strange, but cute.  I don't think Hollywood is capable of making such a funny, quirky, bizarre and fun movie as this. Perhaps Woody Allen would be the only Hollywood director who might come close.  For one thing, in classic French form, this movie has things about sex which only a foreign film would ever show in a such a humorous way.  It has strange eccentric characters, like her neighbor she spies on who is always working on copying the famous Renoir painting The Boating Party, which he as copied like 20 times.  The entire movie is a kaleidoscope of eccentric people who live in Paris.  And the movie has a very cute plot of how Amelie, shy in her own life, constantly tries to help others.  The whole movie takes a fun twist as she discovers a box from long ago that is filled with memorabilia by a boy, and she decides to return it.  As you can tell, the story just has a lot of fun and quirky side stories that makes it entertaining.

Audrey Tautou is so adorable.  I wouldn't rate this movie as a 5 star because that would be putting it right up there with her very best movies.  But it is a true delight and if you want something that will just make you smile and laugh and periodically go, ""What the hell is going on?"", all while beaming from ear to ear as the cutest actress in the world enchants you, then this movie will do it.

Audrey Tautou is utterly adorable and Amelie shows off just how cute she is.",1373155200,,1457,4.281021897810219

1704671,5,B0000640VO,"Everything about this movie is just about perfect, starting with Audrey Tautou. Besides her obvious good looks, her subtle facial expressions throughout the movie are hilarious and some are meant for whoever is watching the movie, rather than for a fellow actor. Be sure to check out the shoes she wears in every scene. The movie has elements of fantasy and whimsy woven into a somewhat off-beat romance (but, then, every character in the movies is a bit off-beat). The frequent voice-over is amusing and the cinematography is gorgeous, considering it's not a particularly scenic movie. I did not realize it had been nominated for a bunch of Oscars until after I had seen it. I'm not surprised.",1373068800,,694,4.889830508474576

1704676,5,B0000640VO,"This movie is like creme brule , you can't stop with just a bite.  Amelie is a simple girl, almost a recluse.  She takes pleasure in the simple things in life, but something is missing.  She is impossibly shy, unable or unwilling to form personal connections.  Until...one day her life changes forever.

She decides to become ""a regular do-gooder"" after a certain event leads to a random discovery of an abandoned object.  She vows to return this precious box of childhood trinkets to the owner, a man now over 50.  She changes his life as he vows to see more of his apparently estranged family.  After this event she is overwhelmed to alter peoples lives for the better (with sometimes hilarious outcomes for those who are more deserving of wacky pranks).

She continues her quest and in the process, discovers herself and (maybe) gets the handsome Nino Camcompoix.  Do they find each other?  Are they the significant other of the other?

And the biggest mystery of all...WHO IS THE MAN IN THE RED SHOES?!?!?  Watch and find out.

Watching ""Amelie"" was a joyful experience. The friendship between Amelie and Mr. Dufayel is one of the most poignant I've ever seen in a film. He's supportive when he needs to be, yet he also knows when to nudge her towards self awareness. Sure, there are fantastical elements and a fairy-tale vibe, true. Some of the criticism thrown at this film was for valid reasons (not enough diversity). But, what it truly is for me, is a story about an introverted, lonely woman who learns to help others and take her place in the world.",1367625600,,705,4.515625

They are all flawed, but for the most part in charming ways. In this dreamy world Amelie is like a mostly beneficent sprite who moves through the lives of the other people, sometimes at lightning speed, doing good deeds and playing pranks that are usually harmless. At the same time, this adorable pixie is in her clumsy way searching for love with a young man that she doesn't even know. The ending is fairly predictable but getting there is so much fun, with many silly detours along the way.
The only ""real"" thing in this film are the sumptuous Parisian locations. The colors are lavish and brilliant like a child's story-book, and some scenes are done in a cartoonish sped-up pace. All this makes the viewer suspend belief and revel in this happy world where good things happen to good people and even the (not so very) bad people only get a slap on the wrist.",1367107200,,999,4.58659217877095

Loved this sweet little film.  Very French in all the right ways.

Big thanks to Amanda Knox and Raffaele Solecito for letting us all know about this precious treasure we probably would've missed if it hadn't played a role in their (bizarre!) Perugian story.

Hope they both see a happy ending one day, just like Amelie, her sweetheart and her very, very wise and loving father.  :)

But if you, like me, are at least semi-fluent in French and have even been to France (my favorite town is Lyon, not Paris), you may love this movie as much as I do. I only say this because it is a very visual movie (what movie isn't...?), so you will miss out on a lot if you have to continuously feast your eyes on the bottom of the screen to read. That said, I loved watching it on my Kindle with the X-ray turned on, and it had a lot of fun trivia about the making of the movie (for example, that the director had the filming areas cleaned to portray the fantasy-world that Amelie lives in). I didn't know that the first time I watched the movie, and having just freshly returned from The City of Lights, I recall thinking to myself (10 years ago) ""Wow, I don't recall Paris being that clean"". Well, it isn't. Amelie is a classic, and I've loved every other movie with Audrey Tautou (Dirty Pretty Things) ever since.",1363564800,3,1156,4.381395348837209

Like many films these days, it's a film set in a real world location (Paris) but filmed in colors and styles of clothing that create a fantasy world within reality.  Much of the film is about Amelie's search for a man whose childhood box of toys she finds hidden in a wall; with another line pursuing a man whose photos she finds near photo booths;  Who is he?  Why is he taking these pictures?  And, it's a bit of a gawky romance between her oddball character and an equally geeky guy she's known for a while.  It's not a film I would watch over and over, but I have seen it more than once and always enjoyed watching.

And, if you find yourself in Paris, go to the subway stop in the movie, Abbesses.  It's near Monmartre and Sacre Cour, and has (in a subway system that is itself almost defined by its staircases) one of the longest spiral staircases I've been on this side of the Statue of Liberty or Sacre Cour.

It is a  French film, but surprisingly, the film is so engaging that the subtitles melt away and I don't even notice them. This is also the film that made Audrey Tautou a star (she costarred with Tom Hanks in ""The DaVinci Code.""

The symbolism, the theme of helping others and looking at what's stopping us....all the different characters really WANT something. And each character has their own interesting and whimsical way of getting there.

1705028,5,B0000640VO,"Movie: This movie is in my Top 5. It's just so whimsical, imaginative and fun. It makes you cry from happiness and you smile almost the entire film. Amlie plays a matchmaker to random Parisians and goes on a journey or self-discovery that she can't stay introverted and alone. You must watch it. I mainly made this review to state some issues on the Blu-ray...

Blu-ray quirks: This Blu-ray does not allow you to press Top Menu or Pop-Up Menu (or anything) during any of the trailers, company promos, etc. The only button that you can press is the Skip forward button, which takes quite a while if you Blu-ray player is older like mine. The blu-ray that I purchased from Amazon does have a menu when you finally get to it that does have a Setup menu, unlike another reviewer mentioned... It has the standard Play, Setup, Scenes, and Special Features, but is not intuitive. It makes you press the left arrow to escape out of menus and doesn't have any explanation onscreen. All of the menus move when you move your cursor and it's just hard to use.

Blu-ray: The movie is beautiful in HD, sounds great with the dts-ma hd 5.1 French audio. It even has a dts calibration tool and dts-hd trailer that I have not seen on any other Blu-ray. I have owned this on DVD from long ago and now finally Blu-ray. It's well worth being in anyone's library!",1357430400,5,1341,4.469387755102041

1705068,5,B0000640VO,"A movie filled with coincidences and love.  I felt that the movie was pure excapism. The color of the film even added to the fantasy state.  The characters were beautiful and the landscape was great.  I do not speak French, so I highly relied on the subtitles.  Now with all translation, I except that there's some loss of beauty to the language. But I was still very impressed with the story and language in subtitle.

It's been over a decade since this movie was released and I still enjoy this movie.  So I disagree that this movie was overrated.  This movie isn't staying on the shelf collecting dust, unlike other movies that are overrated or forgetable.  And owning this special editing is worth every penny.

Andr Dussollier was perfectly fitted as the narrator.  His voice helped give it that fantasy air.

Audrey Tautou was great in this movie.  Amlie Poulai is quite the character.  She reminds me a little of Jane Austen's ""Emma.""  Audrey was both sweet and tom-boy cute.  I like this actress and have watched others that she's been in.  Audrey is a good actress.

Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix was perfect.  I really liked this actor.  He's both gorgeous and shy.  I really believed in his character.

I wish more American films were like this: not wearing it's heart on it's sleeve, not afraid to be a little gentle, a little tender while at the same time being hilariously funny!  The actress who plays Amelie is gorgeous, a true beauty that any man would easily fall for.

It is a celebration of mysteries and little miracles within the magical essence of Paris, with scenes of extremely unique and charming cinematography.

I also very much enjoyed watching the additional disc with Audrey's screen test and cast interviews.",1339459200,,559,4.904255319148936
1705172,1,B0000640VO,"Thirty-five. That is the approximate number of times I was obliged to bellow the usual two-word, seven-letter refrain at the screen while watching this abomination of cinema. That would bring the total number of instances I've bellowed this phrase at a movie to perhaps forty. This could be the most aggressively, nauseatingly saccharine film ever made and watching it is like being gassed with whimsy and sat on by a giant Teddy bear.

Every other movie I've ever seen is a better movie than 'Amelie', but it will appeal very well to people who'd rather live in a different universe. It picks up real, living humans and uses them like toys, like terminally uninformed parodies of humanity. It squanders reality. See that bar-maid there? That actress playing her is probably a fascinating woman - I'm SURE she's a fascinating woman - people tend heavily to be fascinating. Sadly though, this cartoon of a film allows no manifestation of any side of any of its performers' personalities to show through at any point. I have never, ever been more infuriated by a movie. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's previous film was 'Alien: Resurrection', which goes part-way, but not all the way, toward explaining why this movie is as bad as it is.

Although there is ever so much more to be said, that's about all I'm going to say about 'Amelie'. I'd like to tell you that this is because the film's Hadesian wretchedness is beyond my ability to properly describe, but that would constitute a falsehood on the scale of 'Amelie'. The truth is that I am dismayed by the idea of exerting any more mental energy contemplating this grotesque puppet show. That the film receives such unbroken acclaim is a dreary testament to the desire of so very many people for movies that provide an escape from any form of recognizable life. For Jean-Pierre Jeunet to spit in my face would be so much kinder than what he did to me by making this movie it would constitute an atonement.

(Note: Buried in the film's sound-track is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard; a version of 'Guilty' sung by Albert Bowlly in 1931. An acquaintance haplessly gave this film to me, and afterwards I told her that, although it was the single most detestable film I'd ever seen, without it I'd surely have gone the rest of my days without having heard that sublime melody, and was grateful to her. My relationship with that song will end only at the hour of my death, unlike my relationship with this film and its director, which terminates with the completion of this sentence.)",1338163200,6,2528,4.727891156462585
1705173,5,B0000640VO,"Every few years or so, I remember to fall in love with Amlie Poulain all over again. This movie, AMELIE, won't at all topsy-turvy the French's rep for artsyfartsy cinema, but never mind. AMELIE, which came out in 2001, is an imaginative bit of whimsy, an enchanting romantic comedy, a droll time at the movies, a quirky tutorial on contemporary Parisian living. It tells the story of a painfully shy Parisian girl who conquers her fears to perform good deeds on the sly. In service of this, she - Amlie Poulain - becomes a travel agent... a poltergeist... a secret matchmaker... She becomes guardian angel to those around her. And, somewhere along the way, she stumbles onto her own slice of happiness. It's somehow all very French.

It hinges on that expressive actress, Audrey Tautou, her gamine charms, her mischievous smile. She infuses such vivid life in Amlie, a young woman whom as a child was conspired against by fate. Amlie grew up isolated and introverted and unusual. As the narrative proper begins, we see her whiling away her days as a waitress in the quaint Parisian cafe, the Two Windmills. Amlie's staid existence shatters one evening when she discovers in her apartment an old metal box nestled behind a wall tile. On a whim, she determines to locate the owner of the box and deliver unto him its contents of childhood memorabilia. This is the first link to a chain of remarkable circumstances.

Amlie's success with her modest mission inspires her to further acts of kindness. She brightens a blind man's day. She kindles a romance between a stalker and a frumpy hyponchondriac waitress. Because of her machinations, an abusive vegetable vendor gets his past-due comeuppance. She befriends a painter cursed with brittle bones. She sends a garden gnome off to see the world, and deploys the occasional postcard to its reclusive (and thoroughly baffled) owner. Yeah, Amlie is having a fine time playing the covert benefactor, tinkering and meddling and orchestrating. But when she gets a chance for her own happy ending, will she be equally as bold? Amlie Poulain, who is so shy. Qu'allez-vous faire?

The first hour of the film really sells it for me, brimming as it does with captivating visual flights of fancy and offbeat, often sardonic humor. And I love that there's a whiff, just a whiff, of magic realism in play (a refined shout out to those who've enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chocolat-Miramax-Collector-s-Series/dp/B00005K3OT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Penelope/dp/B0011N1WE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Penelope</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Story/dp/B003BZ58RQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A.

Towering above all else in this film is Audrey Tautou, she of the waifish, puckish persuasion. There is simply something so irresistible about her. So, yeah, every few years I'm compelled to fall in love with her character, with Amlie Poulain. AMELIE not only makes me like reading sub-titles, it makes me yearn to learn French just so I can relish them nuances one can only capture when absorbing the film's original language.

L'umore e la sfumatura presiedono la nostra storia epifania-caricato come i guanti di seta. Siamo subito sbalorditi dalla delicatezza del nostro Amlie di eroina (giocato brillantemente da Audrey Tautouand). Diventiamo incantato in questo film attraverso il suo mescolare poetico delle emozioni. La nostra eroina ci disegna nel suo mondo. S, potrebbe essere una cameriera timida ma  anche un vero mezzano, che vede delle opportunit di aiutare il nostro Cupido immaginario furtivamente tocco su quei cuori umani dentro il suo piccolo mondo. Amlie lo presenta di noi attraverso la sua persona perfettamente piacevole ed affascinante con una con veduta senza pretese ma sincera di come la felicit - come uno stato di essere - potrebbe essere trovato.

La sua calma diventa il nostro nettare empatico: poich sorseggiamo la ciliegia emotiva versata dalla sua prestazione in un bicchiere di Montmartre. I suoi occhi di zaffiro, il movimento e la forma riempiono la nostra immaginazione con un senso dell'anima femminile stendendo la mano sperimentalmente per l'adempimento romantico: tutto il mentre cercando - come se era un lei-angelo altruista - di aiutare quelli intorno a lei nella loro carriera di dnouement dell'amore nelle loro proprie vite. Amlie fa questo prima che completi il suo proprio movimento di sonata in III di Atto, la Scena 3 mentre ""La i giochi di Valse"" nello sfondo. La sua intuizione ci impegna cos profondamente: sentiamo un vincolo con lei. Il suo amore ed il suo interesse per gli altri toccano abbastanza.  completamente onorevole e sincera in tutto fa. Non un'oncia di malizia o l'insincerit pu essere trovata in lei, e rispettiamo il suo carattere anche mentre presenta la bellezza di tutti i giorni e la grazia a noi, come il suo molto proprio pubblico prigioniero.

Il tre di doit di femme di Une degno di onore diventa un bel tema dentro la nostra trama: quale nel giro consente che noi attendere sulla decisione dell'Amlie di cercare il contatto con il suo amante futuro, Nino Quincampoix (ha giocato con la mascolinit elusiva da Mathieu Kassovitz).

Forse, le interruzioni intime e sensuali - che colpisce ci poich un pubblico che piace un pezzo davvero elusivo romantico - e (poi) ci incoraggia a riprendere delle memorie belle e li rivive nei nostri pensieri e le nostre azioni. Porta la grand'abilit a rendere che il momento in tempo - come squisito e puro. Questo film cattura quei momenti originari con la passione elusiva e grezza. Vediamo delle coppie che fanno l'amore. Li sentiamo anche esprimendo il loro piacere mentre alle prese con la passione.

Nevertheless, I highly recommend this version as it still contains all the special features that were on the DVD version.

What is so absolutely special about Amelie is that it asks us to find mystery and joy in the small things in life. Another important part of my love for Amelie is that it is visually stunning.

I'll be content to gush about the Blu-ray version.

WOW! Beyond every endearing aspect of this film in an emotional and intellectual sense, it is a cinematographic splendor of eye candy. I remember being amazed by its visual beauty when the film was first released, the Blu-ray technology is splendidly  rendered in this remarkably beautiful film. The colors pop and burst in each seen. The color Green is so present in this film, it's is like a character in its own right. Every hue is magnificently rendered in the Blu-ray version.

As another reviewer noted, there are a lot (six 2+ minute length) of previews on the Blu-ray that you have to fast-forward individually, which is always disappointing on a non-rental disc.

1705197,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie (2001)
Comedy, Fantasy, Romance
122 minutes, French Language
Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet
Starring Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz

Several of my favorite directors produce movies which have a distinct feel, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of them. He can take the darkest topics and infuse them with his own brand of humor. Amelie is not one of his darker films, but it feels like part of his familiar world.

The star of Amelie is Audrey Tautou and she shines in the role. The movie isn't serious at all and is filled with amusing stories and delivered in a whimsical way. We are introduced to the characters by a narrator who tells us their likes and dislikes. I love the use of narration when it's done well.

Amelie is a young woman who accidentally discovers a box of childhood treasures left hidden in her apartment by a previous tenant. She decides to track him down to return it and resolves to do similar good deeds if the outcome is favorable. She's not completely good though. One person in particular annoys her so she decides to play a few pranks to teach him a lesson.

The movie has plenty of mystery and eventually turns into an unconventional romance. The color scheme places an emphasis on red and green and the world seems surreal. The setting is Paris, but this isn't the Paris that I know from my visits.

Audrey Tautou is an incredible actress. She can convey a lot of emotion without saying a word. Her face is one of the most expressive that I have seen. If you have only seen her in The Da Vinci Code, Amelie is a great chance to see her act in her native language.

I know people who would avoid seeing Amelie because it's in French and it's a romance. That would be a mistake. The movie is a pure delight and has a unique style. It won't appeal to everyone, but those who like it will really love it.",1330473600,3,1839,4.458333333333333

This movie made me cry, but I was crying because I was so happy, and this movie is beautiful, just unbelievably beautiful. This movie is about creating joy in the life of others, as well as in your own life. But not the kind of joy that comes from instant gratification. Its the kind of joy that takes days, weeks, and months to develop. In fact, this movie is really about delayed gratification of a kind so profound that it happens as a complete surprize when it finally arrives. The direction is wonderful and quirky.

And if this movie doesn't want you to hop on a plane and go to Montmartre in Paris to experience this world of Amelie, then there is no hope for you.

As far as the DVD, it's well worth it for the extras (and fret not, most of the stuff is in English). The ""Look of Amelie"" shows how precise and prepared the director was and the cinematographer actually steals the show with his explanation of various shots and scenes. There is more--funny outtakes, screen tests (hey, why don't more DVDs thorw those on?), a couple of Q&A's with the cast and crew as well as a nice face-to-face with Jeunet himself.

The entire package is well worth having.",1322352000,,836,4.56
1705204,5,B0000640VO,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 BLU-RAY REISSUE ***

Jean-Pierre Jeunet's delicious ""Amelie"" wowed many hearts back in 2001 and has remained a warmly remembered favourite ever since. Now in October 2011 (UK) - to celebrate its 10th Anniversary - ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" (its full French title) - finally makes its way onto BLU RAY - and I'm thrilled to say it's a peach.

First up - lovers off the film who already own the 2DVD Special Edition set from 2002 - will be glad to see that all of its extras have made the transfer to this Momentum Pictures Blu Ray reissue (see list below). The card-wrap on the outside of the keep case gives it a classy feel (and it's cheap too). But of course the best news is the picture quality, which is rarely anything less than BEAUTIFUL.

Some words on this because it's such a huge part of the movie. Jeunet was bitterly disappointed at how his 1991 film ""Delicatessen"" translated to screen - it seemed that none of the work he put in showed on the actual print. He took no chances with the densely populated and complicated ""Amelie"" - it was filmed entirely in digital - which meant that post-production could add or detract whatever he wanted with precision. The film therefore has a very deliberate pallet of colours - particularly GREEN and RED. It gives the whole look a treated feel - almost a glow - but it's exquisite - and subtle too. It's gorgeous to look at and was deliberately rendered to be so. The scene where Amelie walks in the attaching tunnels of the Paris Subway sees the walls look 'lime green' and the effect is beautiful (digitally changed).

There are so many great visual moments too - unplugging the aerial of a male neighbour who tricked her as he tries to watch football, her mother examining her puckered fingertips in the bathtub, explaining the sights and sounds of the market as she rushes a blind man down a street, skimming stones on the canal outside her home, her father examining her as a child and mistaking her excitement as a defective murmur (dialogue above), stealing the garden gnome, Blubber the suicidal goldfish, the book of discarded passport photos made by her equally odd male fancy (a wonderfully cast Mathieu Kassovitz) - all are realized and framed with a warmth that fills the entire film. BRUNO DELBONNEL received many nominations for Cinematography and won some too.
[Note: The natural default for the print is 2.35:1 - which means lines at the top and bottom of the screen - but even if you stretch it to 16:9 aspect (full screen) - the subtitles are still visible on the bottom of the screen (just about).]

Then there's the script. Co-written by the Director and GUILLAUME LAURANT - and told almost entirely in narration - right from the off its quirky, imaginative and on many occasions - ball-breakingly funny (a sex scene in the toilet of the Windmill Caf between a jealous patron and hypochondriac woman is fantastically good). Being spoken in French too only adds to ""The Big Lebowski"" madness of it all as random events pepper the story of Amelie - a kindly yet mischievous dreamer who works as a waitress in a Paris cafe. The place is emotional central - peopled by a boss with half a leg and a man who bursts plastic bubbles under his table as he spies on a woman who spurned him.

There are two particular scenes of cinematic genius - first is when Amelie finds a tin box of toys hidden behind a tile in her bathroom wall put there by a little boy 40 years back. She then tracks down the now older Dominic Bretodeau (masterful acting by Maurice Benichou) and lures him to a phone booth where he finds this lost treasure. His tears and look of childlike wonder is cinema at its very best. He then talks about it at a bar afterwards with Amelie listening close by. His dialogue is full of heartbreak and wisdom.

Second - there's the elderly frail painter Raymond Dufayel (a superb turn by Serge Merlin) who hasn't ventured out of his apartment for decades (nicknamed `The Glass Man' because of his supposed frail bones). Raymond continually paints and repaints a Renoir classic - but never seems to get it just so. A local grocer's boy called Lucien who is belittled by his bully Dad - brings Raymond his groceries and goodies. There is a scene between Lucien (great casting in Jamel Debbouze) and the wiser Raymond where the older observer of life helps the young put-upon boy to vent his rage with humour - it's touching, inspiring and poignant.

But the movie belongs to AUDREY TAUTOU who quite effortlessly made millions of men fall in love with her - and pine helplessly for her presence ever since. There's that touch of Audrey Hepburn beauty and class about her - a very rare thing in cinema these days. She could boil an egg and guys would stand there drooling. It was her breakthrough role and rightly so.

Rewatching ""Amelie"" on BLU RAY has been a delight - and I'd forgotten how funny, charming and deliciously inventive it is - all the way through.

Do yourself a favour and crack-open this Crme Boulez of a film...it has layer after layer of flavour - and I for one loved every soppy calorie-filled minute of it.

1705209,5,B0000640VO,"I love Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film, AMLIE. I already owned the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amlie/dp/B000068QKT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amlie</a>&nbsp;2-DVD set and have been in love with the movie since my friends took me to see it at a French movie theater back in the early part of 2002 (BTW it is in French with English or Spanish subtitles).

If you haven't seen it, AMLIE is a wonderful story about two lonely people who've been dreaming about one another since they were children. Both Amlie (Audrey Tautou) and Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) wished they had another person in their life, being such lonely children, and one day as adults, their paths cross. In the meantime, both acquire quirks and Amlie, after finding a tin box filled with a boy's childhood treasures, decides that she's going to reunite the owner (now a 40+ man) with the lost keepsake. After proving a successful and joyous reunion, she vows to become a crusader for good helping all the other lonely people around her.

However, no matter how many good deeds she accomplishes, Amlie cannot escape the cold loneliness that she feels inside and around her, until she's finally forced to help herself and take that flying leap of faith and letting someone else in.

Perhaps that's why I enjoy this movie so much. It isn't just a boy-meets-girl type of film; it explores the angst that comes along with meeting someone that you feel a connection with and that period in-between, especially if you've been alone for a long time, and you just don't know how to take the next step.

Another great thing about this film is the use of special effects. This has to be the first movie that I've seen that uses special effects and it isn't in the science fiction/fantasy genre. The use of the effects really punctuate the story and gives it a whimsical feel. Although it does paint a romanticized view of life and of Paris, it's used to great effect throughout and I love the visual style of it.

The BLU-RAY edition of AMLIE is gorgeous! The saturated colors really pop and the clarity makes the movie a feast for the eyes.

I am however a little disappointed that there wasn't any new special features added to this BLU-RAY edition.

In fact, several extras on the DVD are gone from here: the TV Spots, the French language trailer, and the cast and crew filmography. Not a big deal though since all the important specials were ported over and everything is on one disc.

1705216,4,B0000640VO,"The movie:

I won't belabor the point. Either you ""get it"" or you don't. The movie is loaded with emotion, charm, mystery, excitement, and quiet beauty. It's the story of an unusual French woman who is trying to find happiness, while not losing her quirky nature. Amelie is utterly charming and engrossing, due in part to the performance of the lead, Audrey Tautou, but also due to the really spectacularly beautiful cinematography, color palette, and shot compositions. It's in French, and that's the only audio track on this disc. So know that you will have to read subtitles. But it's worth it.

The Blu-Ray:

OK. What do we want in order to induce us to buy a movie on Blu-Ray that we already own on DVD? In my book, there are three things:

1. A reasonable price
2. All of the extras from the previous release
3. A video transfer that offers an easily appreciable improvement.

Long review short, Amelie on Blu-Ray delivers on all three counts. Encoded onto a single BD-50 disc, this release contains a 1080p transfer of the film itself, and all special features. The special features are all in standard definition, 4:3. This is a disappointment, but is par for the course on a catalog re-release like this. The point is, they're all here, so you can ditch your DVD.

The video transfer is truly wondrous. Detail is through the roof, displaying facial pores, cloth textures, and individual hairs that just were not evident on the DVD. The amped-up, slightly hot color scheme from the DVD and theatrical presentations is preserved accurately. There are no compression artifacts or color banding evident at any point. There appears to be no visible edge enhancement, and no digital noise reduction to interfere with detail. Blacks are dark and solid, but not crushed. If your brightness and gamma are set properly, you will be rewarded with loads of detail near black, especially on Tautou's dark hair.

The audio sounds pretty much like the same DTS track from the DVD. I did not notice any changes or improvements, but then, I'm not much of an audiophile. It is a dialogue heavy movie, with atmospheric surrounds only at key moments. I will say that Tatou's performance is very softspoken, so sometimes the balance between these moments required more fiddling than I would like. But it's not awful.

OK - so why am I giving this 4 stars instead of 5? My main gripe is the 14 full minutes of preview material at the front end of the disc - which cannot be skipped by pressing ""Top Menu."" Instead, you have to manually advance through each stinking one, every single time you want to play the disc. There is a rudimentary ""resume"" feature, but this only saves your bacon if you failed to watch all the way through on your previous viewing, and if your player has continuous power and storage. Whenever you pop the disc in for a fresh viewing, here come the previews.

It never ceases to amaze me how certain companies, and Lionsgate/Miramax is chief among them, punish their customers for purchasing their movies. I can't stand it, and it sours an otherwise lovely experience.

My other gripe, which is more minor, is the paucity of subtitle options. On a 50gb disc, only having English and Spanish subs available is pretty lame. My wife had wanted a disc with French subtitles, so she could listen along with the French also being displayed on the screen. At least the titles aren't ""burned"" onto the transfer, meaning you can turn them off if you like. For those with constant-image-height front projection screens, you will be happy to know that the titles are entirely within the image field, not the letterbox bars.

Conclusion:

If you love this movie and have a Blu-Ray setup, it's hard to argue against this package. Cheap, beautiful, and comprehensive, it delivers on all fronts. If it weren't sabotaged by irritating decisions on the part of marketing boobs, it would be five stars all the way. As it is, it's still a must-buy for fans.",1311033600,26,3950,4.74198250728863

It's not a movie about falling in love, a ""do-good"" woman meeting her match, romancing in Paris, etc. It is a story about a woman learning how to seize the day and start to live, how to fight her own cowardice.

1705233,5,B0000640VO,"As far as foreign films go, I don't have a lot of viewing hours devoted; most of my viewing pleasure has been with American Hollywood.  Amelie may change that for me!

After Run Lola Run, a German film with non-stop action and tons of allegory, I wanted a film that would fit the same bill and Amelie was clearly that:  fun acting, interesting allegory, some very strange scenes and several themes.

The film throws a few curves, gives information that has nothing to do with the film's plot but apparently was thrown in for fun.  The fact that a bluebottle fly buzzes by a table where, unnoticed, two glasses of wine are dancing on a table cloth is interesting curiosa but the narrator makes it sound so important.

Grown up with a worrisome, unaffectionate father and a very strange mother, (who oddly gets killed by someone jumping off a church tower! - Happens every day, right?) Amelie is a shy person who does not know how to deal with people in general.  But she's very clever.

After finding a hidden box of boy's stuff, filled with jacks, photos and all, she manages to find the person whose box it belonged to from some 40 years before.  After much adventure, she manages to find him and creates creative ways to get it to him without knowledge of benefactor.

She succeeds!  After this, it's her goal to make life happier for others.  With the help of a recluse painter, she comes to realize that her life would be better if, rather than being a do-gooder, that she really should help herself too.

The film is quite imaginative.  She fails at meeting the person she loves, turns to water and SPLASH!  She does not really become water of course - it was metaphor.  These kinds of scenes are peppered throughout the film.

Amelie is billed as a romantic comedy.  It's comedic for sure, but it is more a story of her confrontation with life, her realization that she's creating her own barriers to happiness and the adventure of overcoming these.  The wild actions she engages in to avoid contact with her crush are just hilarious.

Audrey Tautou is perfect as the shy girl with big eyes and clever lines.

Highly recommended, although the film is a bit too long and has enough sex and nudity to keep it in the R rated category.",1285113600,3,2237,4.5425

She lives alone and seems to like it that way, until she finds a tin box in her apartment, left behind by a resident who had been a resident as a child there decades earlier.  She realizes that if she can return it to the grown him it could be a good thing.  Which leads to her the idea that helping others in general would give her the same feeling, without them knowing she is helping of course, and so it becomes her prime focus in life.  Well that and teasing and tempting a man she takes a liking to - also from afar.

1705238,4,B0000640VO,"Amelie is a waitress in a Montmarte cafe.  She is painfully shy, but has an impish sense of humour.  One day she finds a box hidden behind a baseboard in her apartment - full of little toys and pictures, obviously belonging to a little boy.  She tracks down the boy (now a 50-year-old man) and anonymously gives him the box.  His obvious joy at finding these childhood treasures, and his vow to look up his estranged daughter, inspire Amelie to embark on a life of do-gooding.  Thus, the life-affirming and very charming film Amelie is underway.

The joy of Amelie lies not only in the story, but also how it effortlessly evokes a place (Paris's Montmartre district) and a feel.  The cimematographer artificially ramps up the colour to give a lush, bright, and cheerful film to match the quirky and charming events of the film.  Few films make such good use of location (it is revealed in the director's commentary, for example, that both the sex shop and grocery are within walking distance of the director's own apartment).  Sacre Coeur Cathedral is featured in one scene, but it is not emphasized - it's just part of the landscape.

Doubtless some jokes are lost in translation, but even this subtitled version is full of funny jokes.  Few are laugh-out-loud Simpsons-esque jokes to be sure, but you're likely to have a smile on your face throughout.  Tatou is brilliant in her portrayal of the titular heroine, and the rest of the cast also rise to the occasion.  I especially like her relationship with the eccentric painter who lives in a nearby apartment.  In analyzing the Renoir he is copying, she and he also analyze her life, leading to some of the most moving moments in the film.

Many reviewers call this a perfect romantic movie.  While I don't agree - the characters are all so quirky that it gets a little tiresome, and there is a rediculous ""misunderstanding"" that only serves to draw the conclusion of the film out for no good reason (and making the film 15 minutes too long).  But it is very good and fun for all adult ages and both genders (English viewers might be taken aback by the seemingly random and casual insertion of nudity/sex at certain points, but this is such a typically French attitude that, for me, it adds positively to the evocation of time and place).

There are some nifty extras.  Of most interest is the technical featurette that details the location shooting and the cinematographer's work.  The director Jeunet is actually quite funny in English as well as French, and the Q&A session at an American university is also quite fun (especially when he shoots down a questioner who makes the mistake of mentioning the French New Wave: ""New? That was 40 years ago!"")",1278633600,,2706,4.704883227176221

As I watched, my heart cried, my soul opened wide, and I fell in love...with a movie. I mean, the whole movie; the colors, the actors, the words, the language, the story, and the music, oh the incredible music. It is pointless to explain the plot or get into specifics. How do you dissect pure beauty without detracting from its overall power?

There are very few things I recommend to everyone I know, especially to those who I hold close to my heart. Amlie is one of them. I plead with you - watch this movie.

(I think that's what good art is supposed to do...)  I won't go into the story -- that's been done enough here.  I just want to tell what I found to be the most memorable scenes:

1) The scene where Amelie is cutting up the copied letters in order to create a new letter purportedly from her older friend's fallen loved one.  THe scene begins with her holding up a letter and a scissors, then zoom!, fast-forwards through all the cut and paste to then show her soaking the newly created letter in wine to ""age"" it.  That was just cool.

2) The scene where Amelie is standing near the photo booth and sees the bald man emerge with the toolbox.  ""Of course!"" some of us say, while the camera focuses on Amelie smiling, and the scene goes entirely white.  It's the ultimate expression of:  ""Then it dawned on me!""

3) The scene where Amelie finally opens the door and finds Nino standing there.  Nothing is said.  She kisses him in three different places on his face and neck.  He looks at her and then does the same in return.  I don't react kindly to ""sappy"" scenes, but this was done so well, expressing amazement, recognition, kindness, respect, and happiness, AND yes, love.

This film is wonderful and artistic.  If I were to suggest an improvement, I would want to add a component of faith, just because that, like love, romance, joie de vivre, etc. is so important to so many people, regardless of what so many others tell them they must or must not believe.  If I were to cast any criticism, the restroom romp scene was a bit overdone, but yes it was amusing...

He's turned himself into a mediocre-looking girl with big impressive eyes and quite sexy lips, who looks better with that particular hairdo, to express some of his phantasies. Imagine same movie with Amelie replaced by Amello. Amelie is kind of a petit voleur, a con artist of little things mistakenly called love? This could easily be mistaken for a TV serial, or a music video, void of music. The movie is so confusing, yet Amelie's heart pumps so hard and it shows, even to the least aware, as if the rest of the movie does not matter, suddenly it becomes obvious - she's in love. Sketches of an artist scattered on the floor across a 7 bedroom apartment, including the bathroom and the basement storage cell. Why not shatter the movie into a thousand and one pieces (just like those torn-apart photos) and try selling as individual posters perhaps? Would probably make a great photography album called: ""Delicious. Lost. Amelie"". ""Delicatessen"" was great; ""The City of Lost Children"" was not so great to creepy, even slightly pedophilic; ""Amelie"" is a waste of time for a great deal of the not necessarily unintelligent people. For those who will be searching for a matching music for this music video, I can suggest, try ""Enigma"" or something like that; perhaps you can create a youtube masterpiece by adding music to this movi(e)deo sans musique. It does feel like a short music video after all the patiently watching thing is over. Yet those, who are under influence of some substance, could as well enjoy it even without music...

Amelie is a strange bird indeed. She seems initially one of those wonderfully original creations but as time in the movie marches on it becomes obvious. She is a twelve-year-old girl in a woman's body.

Yup she has silly crushes plays silly pranks and a vivid imagination. In fact one could very much see her being played by a twelve year old. This would work perfectly if the movie wasn't so jarringly adult in other ways. (Amelie's quest works in a porn shop, people having hook-up sex in a daytime caf&eacute;)

It is more of a tone issue than any objection to adult content. (As a glance at most of my other reviews will testify.) Also like most twelve-year olds Amelie pulls pranks and games a little too long. (After the 2-hour mark or so I was practically screaming at the screen to get on with it)

Now don't get me wrong the first hour or so is one of the most delightful screen experiences. I loved the traveling gnome (which started a fad that lives on today) and liked the obsessive tape recording man in caf&eacute;.

It also shows a true fantasy version of Paris like You've You Mail's version of New York. In fact when Amelie is helping others rather than on her own quest the movie seems to move briskly and with purpose.

I figured as long as I could watch the movie it would be worth it.  To my surprise, my Pioneer BD player/TV played all the content with no problems!

The presentation on this Australian BD release looks gorgeous.  The DTS-MA track also sounds terrific.  Apparently there was another release (Canadian?) that got some negative reviews because the transfer wasn't that great; glad I didn't get that one.

The only reason I didn't give this BD release 5 stars is the extra content was lacking IMO.  The DVD release I own has much more extra content, so I'll be keeping both releases.

Great movie, terrific transfer and sound, what more could you want?

Bottom line; love it, highly recommended!",1265846400,2,957,4.609467455621302

On a Panasonic DMP-BD30, that is the case. You have to skip over the trailers,

as I really like the movie, and was looking forward to HD.

What a surprise, in my LG BD390 ... Trailers, Bonus Features, and the movie ALL play!

Hopefully the price will come down ... this is a little steep.

1705253,3,B0000640VO,"This is a strange, silly little movie about... Well, nothing in particular. The description is misleading and just plain wrong - this isn't about a girl who does ""benevolent acts"". This is about one weird, introverted young girl who was raised by dysfunctional parents and is pretty much a psycho, albeit a charming one. She's not ""doing good deeds"", she pulling PRANKS on unsuspecting neighbors and random strangers. Some are cute and good-natured, others downright wrong and cruel (causing a guy to be electrocuted is hardly ""benevolent"", or funny for that matter). When she falls in love (or thinks she falls in love), she is incapable of communicating her feelings, so instead she stalks the poor bloke. The kind of person Amelie is might make you wonder if she perhaps had body parts stacked up in her freezer. Maybe that was the whole point, I don't know... Either way, I think it was the fact of the lead acress being so utterly, completely adorable that is this film's saving grace. Sure, it's whimsical, intriguing, funny, colorful, and has that goofy, surreal French flare all over it, but in the end... It's still about absolutely nothing. You expect some awesome, fantastic resolution to the events that unfold before you (even body parts in the freezer would've made it better). What you're left with is nothing. Not a bad film.... Just disappointing and pointless.",1261267200,2,1378,4.943965517241379
1705254,4,B0000640VO,"I'm going to assume that anyone looking at this listing is familiar with the movie Amlie and will stick to technical details of this release.  If you want thoughts about the movie, I suggest taking a look at the  980+ reviews of the DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amlie/dp/B000068QKT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amlie</a>&nbsp;Suffice to say that this is a ""top 5"" favorite movie for me, since I first saw it in a theater, or I wouldn't have bothered importing it on Blu-ray Disc.

This Blu-ray Disc was released by Icon in Australia.  It comes in a blue Amaray case that is the same height as a regular BD case but is the same thickness as a standard DVD case.

The main menu and movie are in Region A, B, C (""region-free"") High Definition and will play on any Blu-ray Disc player.  The leading trailers and extras are in standard definition PAL format and will not play correctly on most USA/Canada BD players, except for region-free ones (such as Momitsu, or equivalent).

The disc opens with some copyright screens in high definition (I thought the ""don't burn"" one was nicely done).  These are followed by some PAL trailers that are not watchable on NTSC BD players.  The main menu button doesn't work but the trailers can easily be skipped by using the ""chapter skip"" button on the player remote.  That brings you to the main menu, in high definition.  The main menu doesn't have a ""setup"" tab.  Instead, when the movie is played, the disc defaults to the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio track with English subtitles ""on"" (they can be turned off if you wish).  Very convenient.  (For those folks with front projectors, please note that the subtitles are ""Sony-style"" and have the top line in the 2.35:1 image and the lower line below the picture.  This can be a problem for those using 2.35:1 masked screens.)

I thought the movie was lovely in high definition; I couldn't ask for a better presentation.  Perhaps someone with a higher end system can find flaws to criticize but for me, this is what I was hoping for with this purchase.  Best of all, this release has the correct English subtitles!  The Disney/Miramax DVD release had numerous subtitle errors, some of which changed the meaning of the dialog and led to confusion.  Having the correct subtitles is a big plus for me and was the other thing I was hoping for in this release, in addition to a good high def picture.

To sum up: this release of Amlie is gorgeous in high definition and has the correct subtiles.  But the extras aren't viewable on most USA/Canada BD players.  Since I've already seen the extras on the DVD, I'm happy to have the movie in high def at last.  Very pleased with my purchase.  I'm giving this BD four stars because the extras and leading trailers can't be viewed on NTSC BD players (they could have converted them to HD).  But the movie itself is five stars all the way!",1259625600,23,2911,4.772
1705255,5,B0000640VO,"First let me say that I own the DVD. When I saw that it had become available on Blu-ray I ordered it. As you can probably tell it is an import from Australia. Because of this, the case is slightly thicker than a normal case. The movie comes as a single disc.

The audio/video transfer was well executed, the movie was gorgeous to begin with, and it's nice to see they managed not to mess this up (unlike ""Hero"").

The only reason for the 4 stars was that the extras are not 1080p and as a result will not play on my PS3 so I won't be enjoying those.

As with the original, the movie is in French with English subtitles.

As for the movie, very briefly, it is the story of a young woman who goes on a mission to help others despite her own problems.

If I were to classify the story, I'd say romantic comedy with a side of fantasy.

It is an adult movie so there is some nudity, for those who have not seen it.

If you've seen the movie, then you already know this, the jump to blu-ray was worth the $34, for me anyway.

1705265,5,B0000640VO,"Audrey Tautou (The Davinci Code) evokes Audry Hepburn for me. This sweet film, based in Paris, follows the pursuit of love a young Parisian woman feels for a mysterious man she finds pictured in several novelty photograph booths. She gently inspires her father back to life by enlisting the aid of a flight attendant friend of hers to take her father's garden gnome with her on flights around the world. Pictures of the gnome in Russia and other exotic locals are sent back as postcards to the father who grows more perplexed about the adventures his gnome seems to be enjoying. Obviously, Travelocity was inspired enough by this movie to adopt the Traveling Gnome for their very own mascot!

On a trip to Paris about a year after seeing this film for the first time I stumbled upon the small park that is featured in the film as a sort of puzzle/treasure hunt or the young would-be lovers. I can't express the delight it evoked in me and finding it by accident was perhaps the perfect way to experience the park.

But Amalie has added to it a sweetness and whimsy that is lost in some of their earlier, darker films.",1250640000,2,341,4.745762711864407
1705268,5,B0000640VO,"From director Jean-Pierre Jeunet comes the charming romantic comedy ""Amelie"", a film that greatly transcends it's genre. Romantic Comedies are a dime a dozen here in the States, but Jeunet has crafted a very quirky, fun and visually pleasing film that delivers comedy and romance both in spades without ever feeling cheesy or familiar.

 Ameile Poulain is a shy and reserved 23 year old girl who had a rather odd childhood. Her mother was killed when a suicide jumper landed on her and father, though a good provider and kind person, never showed Amelie much affection, erroneously diagnosing her with a heart condition and having her homeshooled. Truth be told, Amelie's heart would race when her father would medically examine her, leading him to believe she had a heart condition. In reality, affection was what cause her excitement.

 Fast forward to 1997. Amelie has a flat all to herself, and desires a relationship but due to bad luck in the past has all but given up on them. She works in a small cafe in town with a group of eccentric co-workers, but she goes home alone to her cat each night. Amelie is lonely, but too shy to go out and meet people. She feels it's time for a change in her life, but she feels things will happen on their own.

 One morning, Amelie hears of the death of Princess Diana on television and, in shock, she drops in the cap of a perfume bottle. The cap rolls toward a tile on the lower wall and knocks it down, revealing a space inside, where a rusty box of momentos lies. She feels the need to return it to it's owner, now a middle aged man, and when he recieves it he feels so much joy that Amelie, satisfied by her good deed, goes on a mission. Do good deeds for others to bring a little happiness to their lives. However, karma does come her way when she finds an interesting scrapbook that a man leaves behind at a photo booth. Through this book, she develops an infatuation with this man. Is he the one she needs to fill the empty romantic void in her own life?

 Amelie has a stylish and colorful fairytale romp, well-crafted and smart without coming across as pretentious. The colors and settings are bright and vivid, and make you long to be in the city of Paris. The film goes inside Amelie's always-daydreaming mind. The viewer enters a world where televisions, and other inanimate objects, talk to you. The pixie-like nature of Amelie, played by the beautiful Audrey Tatou, is a perfect fit for this eccentric character. The cinematography is breathtaking, bringing to mind the vivid colors and atmosphere of 'Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas"", but with less acid of course. It all feels like a dream, a setting so perfect and surreal it dosen't feel realistic, but that's what cinema is about. ""Amelie"" is a 2 hour escape into a the title characters world with everything is serene and perfect, and it's a mighty enjoyable ride.

 There's a timeless feel to ""Amelie"", it's a feel-good film that makes the viewer feel hopeful. The musical score by Yann Tierson fits the images like a glove and is very memorable and unique. This is one of those rare films where everything just falls into place. I highly recommend it to any fan of cinema, regardless of taste. When you invite Amelie into your world, she won't be forgotten. Like she did for the characters in the film, she might just change your life. After all, theres a little Amelie Poulain in all of us.",1250467200,4,3404,4.565573770491803

Boys don't just leave their prize possesions in a box behind the wall and forget about them, ever - not unless they've been dragged away by wolves
(which would have been a nice touch).  And it's exactly this same style bilge the movie keeps piling up ad nauseam.

I don't blame the French - this is clearly a film that was made for the export market. I'm sure shallow and self-centered women from Liverpool to Los Angeles have no problem seeing themselves as this beautiful girl, wamdering the anticeptically idealized and sepia tinted streets of Paris, doing utterly implausible good deeds for people without ever a single thought of their own happiness.  Of course they do find a good looking hunk to love in the end - otherwise what would have been the sense doing all those stupid good deeds for people.

1705278,5,B0000640VO,"This delightful French confection, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and co-written by Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant, is the story of Am&eacute;lie Poulain, the product of a hilariously dysfunctional marriage.  Her father is an obsessive-compulsive doctor and her mother is a nervous and twitchy schoolteacher.  As a result, Am&eacute;lie grows up isolated from her peers, and has a strong tendency to fantasize.  When she finally leaves home, she takes a job as a waitress and settles in Montmarte, in northern Paris.  There, she meets a host of eccentric characters whose lives become intertwined with hers in fascinating ways.

This film is original, irresistibly charming, beautifully photographed, and laugh-out-loud funny.  Jeunet's cast is marvelous, and Audrey Tautou is perfect in the title role.  Her waif-like, large-eyed stare takes in everything and everyone around her, but she always remains on the fringes of life.  One evening, she finds a buried treasure that a little boy hid in her apartment forty years earlier.  She suddenly makes a life-altering decision to help others anonymously.  Am&eacute;lie subsequently gets involved with an aged shut-in, a mean-spirited greengrocer, a lonely woman abandoned by her philandering husband, and a young man with an extremely strange hobby.  She even tries her hand at bringing together an uproariously quirky couple.

Jeunet fills the screen with unexpected sight-gags that, along with the droll dialogue, amuse us as we shake our heads, wondering how the screenwriters came up with this unusual story.  Yet for all its eccentricity, ""Am&eacute;lie"" explores universal and timeless themes. The lonely and the misunderstood among us need and deserve our compassion; without love, a human being withers away; and in our harsh, dog-eat-dog world ""times are hard for dreamers.""",1235260800,2,1831,5.519713261648746

1705296,5,B0000640VO,"I watched Amelie on DVD several years ago for fun, and really enjoyed it. Then a few weeks ago I finally ordered my own DVD and watched it again. It's great to watch even a second time thru, probably because it's hard to catch everything the first time. And that's because many of the good parts of Amelie are very brief, especially in the first 20 minutes or so when Amelie's childhood & teenhood are shown in a pretty fast pace. Just like how the official summary of the movie describes Amelie, she is ""painfully shy"" but also playful & enthusiastic with her eccentric hobbies, like skipping stones (as well as ""stealing"" nice skipping stones throughout the movie XD), and helping people out.

As for the content of the movie, the story has some elements of intrigue & mystery, and with the shy-yet-mischievous Amelie character wanting to do things in her indirect ways, a lot of light-hearted action takes place while these little ""mysteries"" are solved. Overall it starts off as a comedy, with bits of adult content (brief showings of nude breasts & non-explicit sex scenes), a few fun fantasy elements like inanimate photos & animal-objects talking to her, and gradually turns into a light, adorable romantic comedy in the 2nd half. She and her love interest are based on a curious crush on each other, with their main goal being to simply find out more of each other, without meeting, yet. XD (As opposed to typical romantic comedies where the main characters hook up, fight, get back together, have dramas, then FINALLY get back together.)

Another thing to note about this movie is the presentation. The style is very artistically composed, with colors being selected & saturated to get an almost toy-like world in some scenes. The various characters have distinct personalities, from an obnoxiously bossy vendor to a quiet, wise painter.

Overall, people who are tired of typical romantic comedies will like how eccentric this movie is. Shy/quiet people will relate to Amelie's interests & personality, as this is a very ""character-driven"" movie.",1222992000,3,2055,4.933526011560693

""Amelie"" is an enchanting piece of porcelain which relies almost completely on the gamin charms and range of expressions of its star Audrey Tatou. Tatou does not give an acting performance in the conventional sense, but the director Jean Pierre Jeunet subjects her to endless closeups smiling at the camera and the story relies on her  ability to seduce us into her fantasy world. Fortunately, she succeeds. While at times the complicated web of stories become convoluted and overlong, an invaluable and droll commentary keeps things in check. For 2 hours we are transported into Amelie's world. There are endless visual tricks along the way, some enchanting, others pretentious but this is the ultimate feel good film and all plot points, however hard to follow, are neatly tied up.

The copy I have watched was a special edition with some good extras including a commentary from the director in heavily accented English, an interview with him and a few members of the cast who barely get a word and some cute bits like auditions and a series of stills, behind the scenes and otherwise.

Some people I know did not appreciate the artistic fantasy type of movie it was.  Some felt the female lead, Audrey Tautou, wasn't a strong character and she goes through life only to be interested in a non-leading type of a guy.  I think they missed the point because the female leads goes through a growing process and it is an adventure.

The story is simplicity itself: Amlie (Audrey Tautou), a waitress, lives in a strangely depopulated, deracinated Montmartre and longs for love. A waif with bobbed hair and pooling eyes, Amlie looks like a silent-movie heroine, and for two tiring hours exercises an emotional range redolent of those primitive early entertainments -- she smiles at the camera, widens her eyes, crinkles her mouth. Because the film's director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, is more of a watchmaker than a poet of the heart and soul, however, there is no mystery to how she finds love, only a series of intricately choreographed, Rube Goldberg-like set pieces in which Amlie flips the switch. This is too bad not only because Tautou can actually act (she's charming when she's not twinkling as she goes in for the kill), but because she was Jeunet's best chance to take the chill off his film, to modulate his relentless technical virtuosity with the pulse of real life.",1209859200,15,1055,5.034285714285715

Amelie, who works as a waitress, takes pleasure in the small things in life (smooth stones, skipping rocks on water, kindness).  She manages to orchestrate several feel good solutions for the lives of her friends and family.  And, then she falls in love but can't bring her introverted self to let him know how she feels.

I found it amusing and very good looking but the story of a naive shy young girl who found her destiny in making people around her happy by helping them find love and while doing so, finding her own love, as sweet as it sounds, left me indifferent.

She vows to become a ""regular do-gooder,"" touching the lives of those around her and, in one hilarious scene, giving the mean-spirited grocer Colignon his just desserts for picking on his slow-witted assistant Lucien. Nonetheless, Amelie remains within the inner world of her rich imagination and seldom ventures out to forge real relationships with others. When she encounters Nino, an unusual young man with whom she feels a natural affinity, she longs for a relationship but can't bring herself to approach him, instead concocting elaborate ""stratagems"" to bring them together.

Audrey Tautou is absolutely adorable as Amelie, and the artful cinematography, quirky characters, and whimsical story come together in a wonderful film that celebrates the magic of everyday life. Amelie sees the world with a childlike sense of wonder that is thoroughly contagious.

The film is full of quirky, idiosyncratic characters, from the neurotic father who spends his days tending to a garden gnome to the Glass Man, a gifted painter who hasn't left his apartment in 20 years. Nino, like Amelie herself, is a dreamer, preoccupying himself with a scrapbook of pictures he sweeps out from under a photo booth. Before that, a co-worker informs Amelie, his pastime was tape recording funny laughs.

The opening section of the film is very funny as we are told of each characters personal likes and dislikes. These are not earth shattering things, but the trivial things that we all (OK most of us) take for granted like cleaning out the toolbox. The film uses a narrator to tell us these things, and this technique works well, mainly because the film is wonderfully well-written. Because of this what seems completely illogical at some points all falls beautifully into place.

Amelie it turns out although a shy and withdrawn girl on the surface, has a sharp and scheming mind which leads to some marvellous scenes, all of which I might add are directed with a huge amount of style and panache. For a film just over two hours long it maintained my interest virtually continuosly and its certainly one that I will be watching again.

To call it a 'feel-good' movie would be simplifying to a ridiculous degree, although that is essentially what Amelie is. Extremely whimisical (both in the storyline and the slightly garrish way it is shot), the film manages to capture your interest and hold it throughout (although the film is about 15 minutes too long- the only reason I don't rate it a full 5 stars).
I won't reveal any plot points (as discovering what the movie is truly about is one of the great pleasures of watching it), but suffice it to say you will be VERY pleasantly surprised if you you are looking for a lighthearted film with a much deeper message attached.
Audrey Tautou is unbelievable cute in this film, and does a fantastic job as the main character Amelie. The supporting cast are all excellent in their roles, and really add to the quirky nature of the story. Amelie is a French film, and is best viewed in French with English subtitles (to capture the nuances of the actor's performances).
Amelie a fantastic movie that does NOT follow any tired Hollywood fomulas. It is vastly original, and will leave you with a smile and a happy feeling. No kidding!

Nothing about AMELIE lingers. There is virtually no scene that lasts beyond a five second interval with some kind of an edit. The camera angles are either above,below,sideways or right in your face.

One cannot help, at the very least, finding someone like Amelie very likable.  The expressions she gets on her face alone  would make even the hardest of hearts melt.  I have always found it a great joy in my own life to come across someone who truly inspires you and makes you feel rejuvenated like the elderly men of the film ""Cocoon"" after they went swimming in the aliens' ""Fountain of Youth"".  Amelie is such a person.  When you feel old and ancient, she can make you feel young and refreshed and ready to take on the world.

I particularly enjoyed how well this film dealt with her awakening to the fact that the greatest joy can be found in helping others and reaching out in order to touch people's lives in such a positive way.  Perhaps my favorite scene of all is when she takes the lonely blind man by the hand and guides him down the street, explaining everything that is going amid the French hussle and bussle of town.  Just that one act alone was enough to make that poor man's day and it is probably something that he would cherish for the rest of his life.

Also, after viewing this film, it made me think of a certain personal development guru by the name of Bill Reidler I heard on a cassette not to long ago and how he talked about focusing on ""Interest Out""--where you make it your entire goal in life to focus your interest outward towards others and not focusing so much on yourself.  I think that Mr. Reidler would really enjoy ""Amelie"", in that it demonstrates ""Interest Out"" to the max.

In conclusion I have to say that, if I was a father, I would be very proud to have a daughter like Amelie.  One who visits me every weekend (even if I were a little nutty like her father in the film and tinkering with a giant garden gnome) and shows me genuine respect--just as I would show her, and not just shoving me into a retirement home when I got old.  I would also be proud of the fact that she spent her life doing the best to rectify the lives of others which would give me bragging rights that I think would be quite justified.

It presents a philosophy of life that I agree with, an in-the-moment sort of improvisation that recommends itself to me (and I recommend living in the moment as much as possible) but talks about consequences.

This is also a very humorous and uplifting film, with lots of silly games being played by young and hormonally tricked out adults who are looking for love but are a little too introverted to be brave.

The film begins introducing Amelie as an inventive little girl, whose isolation is due to a simple misunderstanding by her parents. Her doctor father thinks she has a heart condition because her little heart beats faster during the only time she has physical contact with him through his stethoscope.

Amelie's world has intense colors and the beautiful sights of Paris where she enjoys simple pleasures.

She dips her hands into a bag of beans for the guilty tactile pleasure of it.

The sound of cracking the crust of her brulee delights her.

She wants to be loved, but is shy and retreats into her own little world.

A random event propels her to find and help a stranger, which leads her to become somewhat of a superhero of kindness to those in need and impish retribution to the mean. This is cleverly woven with a series of urban myths reenacted as in the traveling gnome. Her journey takes her from helping strangers, neighbors, co-workers, friends, family, and ultimately herself. Her actions in a way set free those she helps whether it is allowing them to get out and travel, feel better against a verbal insults, have some closure in the face of lost love, or find your soulmate.

Yes. Audrey Tautou is an adorable actress and is a perfect fit for the character of Amelie. Yet, I have seen her in other films being equally charming, but the films fall flat for me. What makes this film is the collection of quirky characters, the amazing cinematography, the clever writing, and the attention to details.

Otherwise they will end up socially inadequate self isolated individuals who delight in lying, stealing, breaking and entering, causing physical and emotional harm to others, and other assorted felonies and misdemeanors.

I do not know what types of laws that they have in France, but here in the United States, there would be enough evidence for her to stand trial.

1705373,5,B0000640VO,"I watched `Amelie' solely because some friends went on a ten minute rant on just how wonderfully splendid a movie it is.  I have to say that after watching it through it truly is splendid.  This is due in large part to Audrey Tautou's delightful performance as Amelie.  She's so infectiously sweet and charming it's a shame she never got the coveted Oscar nomination that said year, but in the Academies defense it was a very tough year.  Truly though, the film as a whole soaks up her sweet disposition and delivers a wholesomely delicious cinematic experience that is hard to find amidst modern cinema.  `Amelie' proves to be one of the more well-rounded delightful films I've seen in a long time, one of those very rare films that puts a smile on your face and a warm feeling in your stomach.

The film, coupled with a tremendous script, follows young Amelie as she endeavors to make right the lives of everyone around her.  Amelie grew up in a not so happy home with a not so happy father and mother and thus in her adulthood she distances herself from reality and instead of making friends and companions she busies herself with making everyone she knows and or comes encounter with happy, trying in a very humble and secretive way to make their dreams come true, whether it be setting them up with the man (or woman) of their dreams or helping them get back at the person who makes their life a living Hades.  Her biggest accomplishment though comes in the form of herself, for in helping a certain someone reunite with a memory of times past she realizes that she herself needs some helping out and thus makes her own life better for it.  I'm being completely and utterly honest when I say that no movie I've seen in recent years is as sweet and charming as `Amelie'.

My favorite part of this film would have to be Amelie's decision to send her father's favorite garden-gnome on a trip around the world.  This is of course in an attempt to persuade her father to travel before he dies, but it's this simple gesture to me that somewhat sums up the whole feel of this film.  It's so light and sweet and now every time I see the `Travelocity' commercials I'm reminded of this uplifting film.

Everything about `Amelie' works to its advantage and this in effect works very well for the audience.  Amelie moves through her life in a fairytale way, meeting new people and diverging on new quests on a whim and this adds so much to the saccharine feel of the film, giving the audience that fuzzy feeling of joy wrapped in blissful happiness.  The director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, does a wonderful job in creating the perfect atmosphere for his dreamlike tale.  As `Amelie' rolls on the audience is connected with Tautou's character in such a strong way because we begin to understand what has formed the angelic creature before us.  She's sheltered and shy yet overtly charming and endearing.  The ending may be predictable but it's the type of predictable that makes us glad we came to the movies.  Who wouldn't want everything to turn out wonderful for this selfless human being?

So, the verdict from me at least is watch this film and enjoy from start to finish what may very well be the most upbeat and uplifting charm of a film ever made.  I know that may seem like a lot of undue praise, but is it really undue?  If you watch `Amelie' expecting the good time you deserve you'll be richly rewarded with feelings that modern cinema all too often forgets to award us.  Watching the beautifully captivating Tautou prance from scene to scene in all her impishly angelic glory is enough to melt to hard of even the iciest of people.",1185926400,4,3631,4.560862865947612

If the hearing-impaired could hear the discrepancy between the spoken French and the English subtitles, they would scream. And since there is ALOT of dialogue and narration in this film, there is ALOT of subtitling.

Otherwise the film is harmless (perhaps too harmless) fun. Poor Audrey Tautou was compared (only because she had the same prenom) to Audrey Hepburn. While not equalling her in looks, Mlle Tautou is at least a better actress. The sepia-stained cinematography of Paris is, however, glorious. And the film has something conspicuously lacking lately - genuine charm (in moments).

Overall, my advice is to learn French and turn OFF the subtitles. Since the star-rating system limits me to choosing between ""I Liked it"" or ""I Liked It Alot"", I went for the former. I DID like it!",1176854400,11,919,5.079470198675497

1705413,5,B0000640VO,"AMELIE is an enchanting film that Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates with artistic mastery.  The film depicts a young woman who grapples with her past but confronts her guileless shyness, and shows the psychological intricacies in her life where she intermingles those complexities with unpretentious encounters with others.  Amelie is almost like Alice in Wonderland.

Audrey Tautou plays Amelie, a woman who suffered traumatic experiences during her childhood with the death of her mother, the loss of her goldfish, and a father who keeps a sanctuary for his wife and has a fetish for ceramic gnome figures.  Then suddenly, after watching news reports about Princess Diana's death, and by accident, finding a little cubbyhole in her bathroom, which has hidden a box of someone's childhood treasures, she believes it is an epiphany to do virtuous deeds and to find the rightful owner of the box.

Jeunet shows a montage of humorous quick cuts and quirky facial expressions.  The film is lively and fast-paced with a tinge of subtle moments.  An interesting part of the film shows Amelie and her neighbor, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), though during individual occasions, watching TV and flipping from one channel to the next where in several instances they view unusual vintage clips, such as a black woman playing an electric guitar with a gospel choir in the background and a man dancing a jig with his wooden leg on what looks like a southern dirt road as well as reflections of their own lives; the images are somewhat surreal and dream-like, but may possibly speak towards a type of inventiveness on the part of the participants in the scenes.

The film is enticing with an array of fascinating colors and images that should be contributed to the impeccable cinematography and artwork.  Indeed, it has a Salvador Dali-quality, and also captures a picturesque French landscape, which looks like a framed portrait.  The animated portion of the film is charming.  In addition, the musical score contains various moods from a music box to a pumping accordion, which evokes the French ambience that weaves in an out of the film.

The two-disc DVD is an interesting package, which includes bonus and background material about the film.  Viewers have the chance to understand the story behind the making of the film with several interviews of Jeunet and the actors and discussion of the storyboard.  In addition, there are screen tests of Audrey Tautou, Urban Cancelier (Collignon--The Grocer), and Yolanda Moreu (Madeleine Wallace--Concierge) and the film's trailer.

1705414,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie tells the story of a young woman named, surprisingly, Amelie, who lives alone in the district of Montmartre, Paris. She is intensely introverted and loves exploring the lives of others from a distance and piecing together facts about them, especially during her job as a waitress. In the end, she finds love-- but I won't give too much of this amazing movie away!!!

Amelie is a film that could be classified as ""cute"", but the delivery of the lines keep the emotions genuine and entirely plausible. The end is predictable in the way that all love stories are, but the small stories that the movies explore along the way (i.e. other romances, etc.) keep it highly entertaining. Amelie is often very funny as well, in a subtle and whimsical way.

Those who appreciate good cinematography will love this movie also; the angles of the camera, the colors of the costumes and the sets, and the warm filters portray a nostalgic Paris that you will find yourself longing for even if the thought of visiting France has never entered your mind.

Basically, this is a movie that everyone can appreciate!!! Definitely one of my favorite movies, if not THE favorite.",1172880000,4,1161,4.795

1705417,4,B0000640VO,"I'd have to say that those who think this is the greatest French movie can't be getting out much. It has none of the power of ""Manon des Sources,"" none of the dramatic flair of ""Chocolat"" and very little of the poignancy of ""Ponette."" It is, however, a very well constructed film, and one which it has been fun to watch several times.

To those unfamiliar with French culture, some of the vignettes may miss their targets. The French obsession with collecting odd things, with bicycle racing, with sending postcards from every place they visit, their willingness to be demonstrably affectionate in public, all get lampooned mercilessly. The characters are largely stereotypes; what more can one expect in a movie with so many important characters - there isn't the time to develop each one adequately, so they remain necessarily two dimensional. But it is this two dimensionality of the characters that gives the film its surreal touch that drags the viewer forward from scene to scene, wondering what can possibly happen next.

As comedies go, it lacks the gross slapstick of a de Funes film, and this is very much to its credit. The subtlety of the emotional torture Amlie applies to Collignon the greengrocer is far more entertaining than any pie-in-the-face schtick would have been. Even the running garden gnome joke fails to pall, because it is carefully not overworked. Still, if I had to designate a ""funniest french movie ever"", it probably wouldn't be this one - I'd more likely go for the James Bond style ""Une Chance Sur Deux"" which managed a better balance of types of humor, with a wider range.

All in all, Amlie is a good movie, but not necessarily a great one. It's one that is worth plopping down the money to rent, or even to buy the DVD, but I would have been disappointed if I'd paid good money to see it in a theatre - there is nothing in the movie that could take advantage of a large screen and theatre surround sound, and nothing in it that warrants parting with $15 or $20 to see it just once, with antisocial louts making comments and crunching popcorn just behind you.",1170633600,,2096,4.67479674796748

When Amelie finds a hidden tin in her apartment that belonged to a previous tenant she becomes determined to return it and once she has she decides to help others around her, from her father who's always wanted to vacation but never has because of Amelie's supposed heart condition as a child, to her workmate who needs a man.  She tries helping an old man in her apartment as well as a tyrant grocer's assistant.  But in the end she ends up helping herself for once and everything ends up happy.

1705445,4,B0000640VO,"Amlie Poulain is a young woman who glides through the streets of Paris as quietly as a mouse. With wide eyes and a tiny grin, she sees the world in a magical light, discovering minor miracles every day. Having seen her share tragedies and fantasies, Amlie Poulain is not like other girls. Bursting with imagination, she enjoys simple pleasures until she discovers that her goal in life is to help others. Amlie dedicates her life to making people happy, and along the way, she stumbles upon her own happiness... residing in the man named Nino Quicampoix.

  Along her journey to happiness, she orchestrates events to make people happy. A man by the name of Lucien works as an assistant for the grocer, Collignon. Lucien is degraded and humiliated by his boss everyday. Amlie decides to take action. As she walks down the stairs of her apartment building one day, she sees a set of keys hanging on a door. The keys belonged to Collignon. Amlie decides to return the keys to Collignon but witnesses a scene where Collignon humiliates Lucien in front of a bunch of customers. Amlie, disgusted, goes to a locksmith to make a copy of the key to Collignon's front door. She returns to the apartment building and puts the keys back into the key hole. As she leaves, you can see the copy she made in her pocket. Now, it's time for revenge. While Collignon works at the grocery store, Amlie sneaks into his apartment with the copy key she made. Switching things around the house, Amlie delivers a hilarious comeuppance. From replacing door handles to switching out shoes to switching out light bulbs, she practically drives Collignon insane. Now guess who's in charge. That's right. Lucien gives the orders now. Amlie also meets a woman by the name of Madeleine Wallace, the concierge. Her husband had left her to run off with another woman taking with him almost all her money. Mrs. Wallace is hurt till this very day, remembering her husband's betrayal as his portrait is on her wall. Amlie tries to think up a way to help her, but can't. Until...she sees a letter from Mrs. Wallace's husband. She opens the letter and reads exactly what she doesn't want Mrs. Wallace to see. With a great idea in mind, Amlie cuts out all the words of the letter. She pastes the words on top of a piece of paper, photocopies it, dips it in tea, and puts it up to dry. And when she was done, the letter looked as if it was written a long time ago. When Mrs. Wallace received the letter, she was thrilled and very happy. She had read the letter that said that her husband regretted the fact that he had left her and he still loved her. Amlie had made another person happy. What about her own happiness?

  Amlie meets Nino Quicampoix, an intriguing young man who collects the photos of anonymous individuals. One day, his album of photos ends up in her hands. She decides to return it and sets up a scenario for him to find the album. Nino, interested in this mystery woman, decides to find out who she is. As she watches Nino from afar, she gradually falls in love with him. During this time, they showed many surrealistic images that fascinated me. One scene I enjoyed watching that was when Nino was sleeping in his room. Nino woke up to hearing the voices of the passport photos clipped to his lamp. The man in the photos were talking to him and giving him conflicting advice as to how he should approach Amlie. That could not really happen in real life, but I found it amusing to have photos talk to you and give you advice. Another scene that intrigued me was the scene where Amlie's suicidal goldfish was freaking out her mother. It's true that fish sometimes try to suicide, but not like how Amlie's goldfish attempted at suicide. The goldfish was Amlie's only friend, but her mother couldn't take it anymore. And so, the goldfish was thrown into the river. I felt that this scene was symbolic in a way that Amlie was left with no friends and no one who could understand her.

  Amlie is a movie that defies all boundaries of imagination and lets the viewer experience things that could never happen in the real world. Amlie awakens the child-like part of us as we realize what we can do with our lives to make it more fun and enjoyable. This film also makes us think about how we can help others like how such a selfless, lonely girl like Amlie can. I feel that this movie has taught me how to become a better person and to not be so selfless as to neglect myself either. Amlie is a wonderful movie that lets its viewers see the little things that we normally miss or take granted for.",1160611200,3,4568,4.500603136308806

So for those who might be a little thrown by Amlie's surreal and staccato opening exposition, hang in there and let the movie catch you in its rhythm.

As I haven't expressed it yet, this is the best movie I've seen in at least a year. In fact, AMELIE is so scintillating, it would be pointless for me to try to explain or analyze its magic. Yes, the movie has appealing and eccentric characters who are perfectly cast, and a whimsical storyline that manages to be charming instead of fey, and an absolutely gorgeous color palate. But perhaps most amazingly, it's a goodhearted French film without meandering conversations OR heavy cigarette smoking. Now that's an accomplishment!

1705463,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie (or, as its proper title goes, ""The fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain"") is a modern fairy tale, and a movie so unique in every way that there really is nothing to compare it with (though the makers of Big Fish took a good look at it, for sure). Set in 1997 Paris (but a version of it with quiet railwaystations, uncrowded streets and no tourists...) it nonetheless has all the atmosphere and feel of the 50s. It is sweet, funny and optimistic, yet has at its core a strange note of nostalgia and quiet melancholy. Its subtle surrealism at times expands into marvellous flights of fancy: don't be surprised to see young Amelie play doctor to a green blubber monster, to hear the bedside lamp and the paintings on the bedroom wall discuss their owner's love life, or to see Amelie's inner conflicts dramatized in the TV broadcasts she watches. None of this, however, gets in the way of the viewer's involvement with the characters, who, strange as some of them are, have a real power to move. The impression of disarming innocence is merely superficial, as becomes clear when we find Amelie wondering, while overlooking the city, how many couples are having an orgasm right at that moment (15, and we get to see them all), or when, later, she tracks down the love of her life in a sexshop. The daring mix of ingredients is thoroughly European, and, indeed, very French. This could never have come out of Hollywood.

After a resume of Amelie's childhood that's as hilarious as it is effective, the story proper gets under way when Amelie hears the news of Princess Diana's death. (Don't miss the original French: to Amelie and her friends the princess is known as 'la-dee-dee'). Shocked, she drops the cap of a bottle she's holding, which rolls down the bathroom floor and dislodges a tile. Behind it, Amelie finds an old cigar box stuffed with boyhood memorabilia. Her 'fabulous destiny' is revealed to her in a flash: she will find the owner, and if he's moved by the retrieval of this box, Amlie will dedicate her life to making others happy. And so it goes. Amelie starts working her, often very inventive, little miracles among the people in her vicinity. And a colourful bunch they are: the old man who never gets out of his house because his bones are brittle as glass, and who spent the last 20 years painting endless copies of the same Renoir; the hypochondriac Georgette, who, ironically, is a cigarette seller; paranoid Joseph, who sits in the bar where Amelie works day in day out to record observations of his ex-girlfriend's behavior on his dictaphone; Amelie's obsessive-compulsive father, and his inexplicably travelling garden gnome; the concierge, still pining 40 years on for her lost lover; the bullyish grocer Collignon, who, 'unlike artichokes' has no heart (and gets his just deserts in some of the funniest scenes in the movie), and his soft-spoken help, Lucien; and of course the strange young man who collects discarded snapshots from the garbage at railwaystation photobooths. Unfortunately, when it comes to her own happiness, Amelie is pathologically shy. Much like Austen's Emma she goes about arranging things for others, and forgetting herself: she prefers to live a dream. And when despite herself she finds the dream coming true but requiring decisive action, she comes up with some very complicated ruses. While the story unfolds, there are delightful surprises around every corner, both in little asides to the plot (Amelie wants to give some money to a pan-handler, who says 'No thanks, miss, I don't work on Sundays), and in extraordinary visual finds (when Amelie's first hopes of finding her lover are dashed, she literally dissolves into water).

The film has a dreamlike quality throughout which has to do with the golden glow of the images, the surprising takes on familiair Parisian sights, and the wonderful cinematography. The effect is greatly enhanced by the fantastic musical score, with piano and musette to the fore. A feel-good movie if ever there was one, yet eschewing every staple of that genre.

Audrey Tatou carries this film on her tiny shoulders, with a great supporting cast to help her. She is perfectly cast as Amelie, the shy, lovelorn title character who works as a waitress in a cafe and, through a series of twists of fate, decides to involve herself in changing the lives of those around her. And, in the end, changing her own life.

Fate causes Amelie to discover a cache of long-forgotten toys, hidden in a corner of her apartment, left there by a small boy who is now an old man. This leads to the machinations of everyone's lives, from the nasty green-grocer and his sweet, simple-minded assistant, to the disabled, all-knowing man across the courtyard, to the broken-hearted concierge whose husband left her decades before, to co-workers and even her own father. But, Amelie discovers her own heart beating for the love she craves, and while guiding the lives of others, she almost forgets about her own life.

1705484,5,B0000640VO,"""Amelie"" is one of the more difficult movies to do a writeup for, simply because it's so completely off on its own: to my knowledge, there's never been another movie like this, before or since.  It's got a vibe all of it's own that makes it an inspiring and comedic standout.

  Amelie Poulain - played to perfection by Audrey Tatou in one of the world's alltime great performances - is a shy, somewhat elflike, highly idealistic girl with a strong sense of justice, an extremely acive imagination, and a thinly buried flair for mischief a mile wide.  After finding an old box of childhood treasures hidden behind some boards in her apartment, she takes it upon herself to track down the original owner of these toys and odds-&-ends.  When the original owner turns out to be a now-quite-melancholy older man who is deeply cheered by the return of these old memories, and touched by someone's having taken the time and effort to return them, Amelie too is uplifted, and thereafter takes it upon herself to help those whose lives she feels could use a boost.  In spite of her impish altruism, though, Amelie is unable to pursue her own dreams of her own accord, and the question of the movie is whether life will work out for Amelie even as she's secretly helping others to achieve their own dreams.  Of historical note, the movie features the best performance ever by a ceramic garden gnome(!) whom Amelie abducts from its owner's garden and sends on various trips around the world to get its picture taken and sent to the owner before its eventual triumphant return home, in hopes of inspiring that person to follow up on their own dream of world travel!  The angle is played so beautifully that the gnome actually becomes his own character, and it inspired the growing global trend of benevolent 'gnome-napping' that you may heard about, and has made its way into numerous travel commercials.  That there is just one of the many inventive schemes Amelie hatches to try and 'push' people towards happiness.

Man, there is a lot to see: brilliant, beautiful colors in scene-after-scene. They alone make this DVD worth owning. The story is decent, pretty interesting but nothing super. The humor is ""French,"" meaning different from what we normally laugh at in North America. The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade. If you've watched it, you know what I mean.

However, this is so uniquely and beautifully filmed that I can put up with a so-so story. The story is absurd, as most of the characters are, the lead actress, Audrey Tautou, is cute and fun to watch and the addition of humor to the romance story helps make the tale palatable.

There is almost no profanity in here and a few very quick nude shots which must be the reason for the ""R"" rating, otherwise it would be an easy ""PG."" In summary, a pleasant film that is a feast for the eyes.",1146355200,3,1165,4.460093896713615

One thing that makes this film original is the fact that the circumstances in the story are weird (sometimes even impossible), touching, and funny at the same time.

No, this movie does not encourage you to think deeply about the psycology of the characters or their situations, but that makes it a perfect, sit-back and enjoy it FUN movie that will have you grinning through the whole thing.

I am quite glad that I saw this in French first, because I feel like I really connected with the storyline, I had to pay attention to every miniscule detail to fully comprehend the plot. Amelie is a normal girl, but she views the world much differently than most of us do. She is a girl that likes to help other people and sometimes causes more harm than anything else, but it makes her that much more endearing because she tried to make something better.

This movie is beautifully written, acted, and directed. You will watch a scene, and remember the dialogue for days. Amelie is funny most of the time, but I noticed a strong overtone of sadness throughout most of the scenes. Amelie, while funny and charming, has been through much more in her young life, then most of us have in our ripe age. Sometimes she appears to be bitter, impatient, and angry, but mostly she looks sad; like a little girl who has lost her puppy...and that is what makes the movie.

Frankly, they are just TOO strange.  However, something that is apparent from the first moment of any film that Jeunet has directed is his incredible imaginative vision.  He sees entire universes within the smallest actions.  He sees fate and destiny in funny coincidences.  As you will find if you watch the special feautures, much of Amelie is inspired by childhood events that actually occurred in his life or those of friends.  I believe it is this element of true nostalgia that all of the fans of Amelie relate to.  His experiences ring true in the hearts of all.  This is where the beauty of Amelie arises.  His memories and experiences, combined with his sense of color and the way to highlight a scene, not to mention an incredible cast and one of the best film scores of all time composed by Yann Tiersen...all together they form something never before seen in the medium of film.",1143244800,3,1050,4.627027027027027

I don't know, what can I say... Do the French just feel more passionately about life in general? Maybe so, maybe not. But I think this film could melt the frostiest stiff.

Everyone Amelie encounters has such an interesting personality and she brings such a ray of sunshine into their lives. From encouraging her father, by hilarious means, to travel the world, mischievously matchmaking cafe locals and of course her absolutely romantic stratagems she devises to pursue true love, this film breathes humanity. ""Do you want to meet me?""... who wouldn't be curious about that!?

The part where she's day dreaming of Nino sneaking up behind her , running his hand across the beaded curtain, which simultaneously turns out to be her cat, is such a beautiful human touch that I rarely see done in films. Heart warming and genius.

The adorable Audrey Tautou is magical to watch as she brings Amelie to life with caring and compassion. She drinks life so deeply. And being that most of us live in such a fast paced, and self centered society we could learn a few things from Amelie.",1142985600,10,1234,4.779342723004695

1705527,5,B0000640VO,"""Amlie"" is a film where you want to find the perfect word for describing its charm. There is probably such a word in French, but I would not know what it was. All I know is that quirky, enchanting, and everything I come up with in English is wholy inadequate to the task at hand. The most important thing to know is that ""Amlie"" is a film where you should go see it because so many people love it, even if it requires you to not to do anything else so you can read the subtitles (some people resist such demands and--shudder--listen to dubbed versions of ""Life is Beautiful"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""). I feel about this film the way I did about ""Memento,"" where I told people they should see it and refused to tell them anything else because it would ruin the experience (think the Heisenberg principle). However, I think the audience that would enjoy ""Amlie"" is considerably wider than those who would cotton to ""Memento"" (which was a quirky little film).

So, I am giving you my strongest recommendation for you to see ""Amlie."" Now, if you have not yet seen the film, please go away, because I want to talk to those who have seen the film and while I am not going to be providing what we would traditionally consider ""spoilers,"" you really sure come to view this film as pure and chaste as the driven snow (of which we have lots up here).

I find it interesting that the film's French title ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain"" was reduced to just ""Amlie"" for American consumption. Combined with the green framed portrait of actress Audrey Tautou smiling impishly as the title character, this certainly does not give viewers a real idea of what they will discover in this film. One of the chief charms of the film for me was how you had to pay attention to the details because almost everything was a clue as to future developments (the exception that proves the rule would be Blubber, whose return we patiently waited for throughout the entire film).

Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Amlie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do. We then begin 48 hours in which d'Amlie's life is changed. Of course such massive developments hinge on a bottle cap fallen to the floor. Our heroine's efforts to sabotage the life of Collignon (Urbain Cancelier), the Grocer (who will never be confused with an artichoke), struck my funny bone exceedingly hard and her relationship with the Glass Man, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), was particularly nice, both their discussions about the girl with the wine glass in the Renoir painting and the old man giving her the final push to her destiny. The only question is whether Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz), is really good enough for our girl, but if she is smitten with a man who collects torn up and discarded photographs from photo booths around town, who are we to challenge her choice?

The end of the fabulous 48 hours at which point our heroine finds her destiny does not offer a perfect world. Some find true bliss in love, others finally go on trips, but some still right where they started, unpublished, afflicted by imaginary illnesses, or consumed by jealousy. But as long as Amlie lives happily ever after we are content. I pity the person who does not fall in love with this film.",1133481600,5,3326,4.660988074957411

On the surface this is a light-hearted, quirky tale about a young woman finding true love, but this is no sappy romantic comedy. In a way, the film is about a woman overcoming the poor training for life that she received from a cold, distant father and a hopelessly neurotic mother. (But don't be put off by this seemingly gloomy topic of dysfunctional parents: the filmmakers use just enough comedy to avoid being grim, yet at the same time do not go to the other extreme of all-out comedy.) A shut-in who is unable connect emotionally with people, a grown Amelie eventually discovers the joy of being a do-gooder, but even this she must do anonymously, from a distance. Only with the (sometimes unintentional) assistance of those whom Amelie has helped (including her beau-to-be) does she finally conquer her shyness and anxieties to find true love. The film also comments on the idiosyncratic or self-centered things that people do to compensate for being unable to love: hypochondria, stalking an ex-lover, obsessing about the lives of strangers, living in the past.

I have learned and confirmed a lot from people giving bad ratings and mocking reviews to masterpieces just as this one.  The most important thing confirmed is, first of all,  the unavoidable fact that that individuals percieve things through the lens of their own personalities, through the eyes of their inner being,  eyes which scope ranges from the sensitive and candid perception of a curious INNER CHILD, open to details, open to that which is trascendental and radiating.

 And then...we also find those writing mocking reviews and  sharing the sensitivity of a HIT-AND-RUN truck driver who has just rolled his 18 wheels over his ""INNER BRAT"", while burping the ""FIVE STAR"" effect of a cold ""BUD""....

Upon more time deserving descriptions, AMELIE  is a movie about the respective  liberation and fulfillment of a girl's inner fears and dreams, although more than a character, she is an icon. The wonderful thing about it all is that in the process she understands she may not achieve this without trying to help all those around her achieve this same liberation in their own particular way. Or at least the ilusion of that liberation,  the uplifting ilusion of hope.  It is difficult to describe.

1705545,5,B0000640VO,"The term ""magic"" -- as relating to movies and not just the word for a witch's spell or a magician conjuring a rabbit -- was long ago co-opted by the likes of Disney and Spielberg. The Disney and Spielberg corporate machines turned ""magic"" into just another gear in the works, with shots of awed actors gazing at something amazing followed by some jaw-dropping special effects shot.

It's been a long time that something truly magical, not phony or manufactured, has graced the silver screen. So Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amelie (a.k.a. Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain) comes as a most welcome new gem. It deserves to be cherished, hugged and celebrated.

Audrey Tautou (Venus Beauty Institute) stars in the title role, an adorable, waifish little darling who reminded me, by turns, of Charlie Chaplin, Giulietta Masina and Audrey Hepburn. On the day of Princess Diana's death, Amelie finds a little box hidden in the bathroom of her little Montmarte apartment: a little boy's treasure chest from years gone by. She decides to return it to its now grown-up owner without revealing herself to him. When she sees the man's reaction -- shock, joy and tears -- she vows to perform more good deeds.

Most of these deeds involve a great deal of clever preparation, and these play out like the ""Mousetrap"" game, where one seemingly unconnected move leads to another one and they all logically connect only at the end.

For example, an incredibly sour man sits around in the cafe where Amelie works pining after his ex-girlfriend who also works there. Using several small, nearly untraceable steps, Amelie plants the seeds for new love between the man and a dowdy, hypochondriac woman who works the cigarette counter.

This and the many wonderful other episodes never run back to back. They're cleverly intertwined with one another, keeping the mysteries moving along at the right speed.

Of course, Amelie's greatest challenge is to find love herself, which is not easy for such a shy girl who can't even show up to take credit for her own good deeds. In one scene, after she lets her potential soulmate Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) walk away from her door, she literally melts (thanks to some brilliantly-utilized CGI effects).

The movie begins daringly, with a narrated flashback to Amelie's childhood explaining her quirky personality and running some 20-odd minutes before the actual story even begins. This talky, cartoony sequence had the potential to alienate viewers quickly. But instead it easily and quickly sets up the film's warmth, humor and charm that it sustains perfectly throughout.

It's difficult to describe the look of the film, which is painstakingly precise, but colorful, airy and alive at the same time. It's like a Chuck Jones cartoon, but slower, and like an MGM musical, but faster. In order to get the precise vision of sunniness and goodness he wanted, director Jeunet digitally altered Montmarte's look, taking out the garbage and graffiti, and even changing the clouds above into more decorative shapes. It's a utopian vision of how great the world could really be if generosity were traded regularly and not hoarded like gold.

Amelie shows a completely unusual side of Jeunet, who created the dark, bizarre underworlds of Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children (both co-directed by his former collaborator Marc Caro) and Alien Resurrection. Jeunet has now expunged all traces of weirdness and darkness to make this lovely new confection.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon proved that American mass audiences can and will sit through a movie with subtitles, and I suspect that the subtitles on the French-language Amelie will likewise not deter them. This is a movie that audiences all over the world have treasured, and America shouldn't be any different.

I also foresee Oscar nominations for Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet, and one big one for Best Picture (that is if distributor Miramax can let go of its quasi-talented ""prestige"" director Lasse Hallstrom and his new film The Shipping News and put its muscle behind this one instead).

I'm into romantic movies - I am a hopeless romantic, etc, but this movie didn't do a THING for me. The lead actress is cute, yes, and there are a few moderately cute bits here and there, but romantic? NO.

It's certainly not the type of movie you feel OK about sitting down and watching with your parents (as I tried to do).

SOme nasty lines my mother hated, (""he's like that because his father peed in his mother"").

Yes, Amelie becomes a bit of a matchmaker in one storyline, but I don't think the result of the match (a man and a woman have sex in a toilet loud enough to make all the dishes jump on the shelves of the cafe) is romantic - at all.

or Amelie sitting on the roof seeing how many orgasms she can hear (fifteen, as it turns out).

In short, this movie didn't produce ANY feel-good emotion in me at all. If you're after something like Sleepless in Seattle, you're going to be very disappointed. Even the love-story in Spider-Man 2 (which I watched with my folks) was HEAPS more romantic than this rubbish.

1705550,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is the Hello Kitty of movies. You've seen it in passing. You've given it a glance. You've thought 'geez, that looks kinda...' and you never in any of those times came up with a good enough word to describe what it actually is. Is the word 'sweet'? Is the word 'sappy'? Is the word 'stupid'? Most of all, you're pretty sure that you're just going to hate it- after all, who can pack so much attitude into one little box and still have it come out as something you can respect?

If you can get past your initial misgivings about the cute-sy factor of the lead actress (and those big, glowing eyes) then you're in for a real treat. The word you were looking for to describe how you might feel about this movie is going to be none of those I mentioned...instead, you might walk away and think 'sure-fire' or 'sha-zam!' or 'crap, I can't believe this movie made me think of those words...I never use those words!'

But they're very much applicable in this case. The story, the acting, the direction, the visuals...they all zing along at their own pace; it's a tempo just shy of break-neck and right above average. The visuals blend with that tempo, creating a whole storyboard that makes us feel as though we are on some wild roller-coaster ride that we didn't really ask to be on but can't help but be grateful for all the same.

All of the actors commit themselves to being the characters that they have come to play for the audience and each of them own their roles. When Mathieu Kassovitz's character is first seen digging under the photo booth, we never think 'what a weirdo' but instead find ourselves kind of drawn into thinking 'who is this strange man?'...lured into thinking it by the simple acceptance of the title character. Amelie is a unique young lady whose view of the world sets the stage for the entire movie; where some characters might annoy the audience in other movies, Amelie's acceptance and view of them make them real people who have real problems who really need saving.

That's what makes this movie so endearing, that it's a super hero movie without a super hero about real people with real problems stuck in their own real hell who are all saved by a person who probably could not ever exist. Amelie rushes from person to person, a preternatural understanding of the way they work and how to solve their problems guiding her through the whole movie, ricocheting from adventure to adventure, saving countless lives in a webbed intricacy that leaves us dizzy and dazzled...and again, what makes that work is our own need to be saved in our own real lives, in our own real hell, in our own...you get the picture.

But where it might become bogged down in taking itself too seriously with it's save-the-world attitude, the movie instead turns cute, cloaking it's external functions with jokes and winks that make us wonder if it's trying to be dirty or if we're just stuffy conservatives. When Amelie wonders to herself 'How many people are having orgasms right now?' that question is answered in a spectacular montage that is primed by Audrey Tautou's sheepish smile at the end of it. '15' she whispers to the camera. It's this sort of thing that makes the movie not only bearable, but also exquisitely delightful to watch.

Bottom Line: there is a special DVD set out now that has this movie in it; you can find it at any local Walmart...my advice is to go out and buy it because it needs to be a permanent part of your collection.

-LP

The PS Warning: this movie is NOT IN ENGLISH! For those of you who didn't already know that I did not want to be misleading by suggesting that Amelie actually said the word '15'. But! But! It is still 100% worth your viewing time.",1125273600,3,3698,4.550375939849624
1705551,2,B0000640VO,"I would have loved this movie without Amelie. I would love a love story or a drama about the real often middle aged or older people in this movie confronting their lives and their loves and their pain, and finding something to sustain themselves in the real grind of life, not in the actions of an ignorant girl with no respect for other people.

  This is a very artificial movie. It dresses itself up in supposed quirkiness, it claims to be romantic but it is not about what real love or even friendship is about, real people knowing each other, liking each other, sharing their humanity, real people living in life.

  Essentially, the character Amelie is a person with no social skills, no real friends, and no experience in life or love, and little desire. Yet, she sets herself up with no experience to disturb the happiness and pattern of other people by lying, trying to fix people up with others who are not really interested in each other, and theft.  She steals precious letters from her father to fabricate lies for her concierge--is it an emotional problem you cant be more faithful to your father than to a stranger.

  The character Amelie really has not respect or faith in the humanity of other people. She only sees them as good or bad, and from a position of ignorance of life breaks into people's homes and steals things, doctor's people's food and medical supplies to cause them wrong, etc. etc.  All of this without trying to find out why people feel the way she does, even though her own life from conception is treated with understanding and explanation for her supposed pain.

  Amelie ultimately falls in love with a man whose work she steals for a period of time and does not seriously, promptly or courteously attempt to return to him.  Instead, she ferrets out the secrets of his work, and then forces him to go through all kinds of twists and turns and running and climbing up and down hills that would cause a normal person a heart attack.

  For what?  She doesn't know him.  Nothing meaningful is revealed in his work but obsession.  What does she love, a person?  Or is it that this movie is supposed to be a love story but the author and directors don't know how to talk about real love and real life, so they artificially produce it give this film a plot, when it really has not much of one.

  At the close of the movie, he comes to her house, she prevents him from speaking to her--having seen him once or twice without saying anything--and they make love.  Then they are seem going through Paris on her motorbike, her father, despite the purloined letters of his love being stolen, decides to travel the world which never has done before, etc.

  This movie is nothing but the fantasy of the author and director that isolates love and happiness from real life.  A character is created who in essence has no life--curiously before she does all this she is shown not to be interested in boy friends and romance--and no real aspirations.  We learn, a bit surprised, that she just wants love in the abstract or so we are told after being told that she doesn't. Nothing really convinces her that she should. The film simply relies on the fact that we are inserted in a discourse of realizing that movies with attractive young women are love stories.  The assumption is that completion in life for women is only love with a hunking handsome moveie actor type of man. We note all other men except the lover she choses without hearing or speaking a word to him are middle aged or disfigured or ancient.  Her treatment of other people really ranges from the greatest rudeness and manipulation to crime.  I have always thought love involved accepting the humanity of others and realizing that your own humanity can be share with them.

  Real people struggling to make a real living, real people with quirks and imperfections, real people who do not look as classically beautiful--but dressed unfashionably and ""quirky"" as the costume designer for the film wishes--who are really beset with making a real living-are belittled, persecuted, or given the drastic surgery by crime or abuse that Amelie seems to carry out.  No one who has known the Paris neighborhood Amelie lives in can figure out how she can live in such an apartment, in such a building, on a waitress's tips.

  The film seems romantic, but it really exports romance outside of real life. The character seems sympathetic, only because she has no real life; none of the real desires needs, ambitions and wants that real people have.  Her actions as some beneficent match maker and changer of trouble people's life in the real world would be better replaced with an ability to learn about the pain that people who have had more life and reality have.

  She finds her father's letters of passion for his mother while he was away in the army.  Instead of cutting them up and using them to falsify that a philanderer didn't desert her concierge, she should have revisited her view of her mother and late father whom she has remembered as cold and cruel as once being a woman of passion and a man filled with poetry and fire of love. Shouldn't she want to talk to her father about this, treat him differently, respect him as she has not to this point. Indeed who in the world does Amelie respect?

  See this movie as a low level fantasy for childish thoughts, rather than the deep arty romantic movie it attempts to be.  Instead, it is someone's fantasy that sees love as alienated for real life.  That is sadness.",1123977600,16,5505,4.606372045220966

1705554,5,B0000640VO,"It's kind of hard to tell sometimes whether a movie is trying to be too indie and smart for it's own good, or whether the movie is just charming and likable without trying to do so all along. With Amelie, there's a feeling of charm running throughout the entire thing but without feeling pre-fabricated. Jean Pierre Jeunet(he directed the awful Alien Resurrection but did do Delicatessen) made a film that shows there is still genuine filmmakers behind the camera.

Amelie is a single waitress surrounded by people who need some life fixing. She finds an old box that the previous tenant from decades ago left and she decides to return it to him. This then sparks an idea to start wanting to do good to everyone else. A creepy man and a waitress get together, her widowed father who never travels lives through a garden gnome who is getting photos taken at various European sites. And there's plenty more.

However she finds that her life needs some tending to as well, so enter an odd man who collects torn up photographs from those instant photo booths. Only instead of doing what others would do which is just to go up to him and talk, she takes him through a series of mini-adventures(such as a humoress one where he follows painted blue arrows only to have to run back).

There's CG in the film but it's not as instrusive as one might expect. She's got a cool little pig lamp that turns itself off, photos talk back to a guy(similar in a way to Harry Potter photos), paintings converse and Amelie turns into a puddle. It's also gorgeously shot. One of my favorite shots is where she skips stones near a waterfall/dam and the camera arcs from above the waterfall to the other side just above the water. Another part of the film's charm is its star, Audrey Tautou. Like Audrey Hepburn, she's got a lovable quality where you can't help but want to watch her.

If you actually start thinking of its length, it might feel long but if you really get into the film, it just flies by.",1123200000,4,1981,4.50974930362117
1705575,3,B0000640VO,"Amelie, or Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain as the movie is known in French, is firmly in the tradition of French romantic comedy films. This genre of film has a particular sensibility which can seem cutesy or cloyingly sweet and unquestioning; yet films in this genre often have little surprises which remind the viewer that this is after all a French film, and not subject to the rules of cutesy films in English.

It's a very well made film, with beautiful cinematography, REALLY excellent acting by great French film actors, and above all many, many long takes shot in some of the most characteristic neighborhoods and around some of the most famous public buildings in Paris. This film is a love song to Paris. You could turn the sound off and just watch it with no subtitles, and you would both understand the plot and be moved by the plot and the beauty of the visuals.

But by snooty intellectual standards, it's a bit sentimental, although with liberal doses of wit and bite. It's not a challenging film which questions darkly the basic foundations of society or anything like that. Several times in the course of the film a character turns and impishly addresses the camera, which will give you an idea of the somwehat juvenile sensibility. And this is appropriate, because after all it is about a woman who has not yet quite grown up.

There was a controversy about the film: people objected that Amelie, who is a waitress at a cafe/bar, lives in Paris: that would never happen in real life, because she couldn't afford it. And the neighborhood in which most of the action takes place is populated largely by immigrants from Africa -- yet only one character in the whole film is played by an actor of North African descent. It's a lily-white, golden- and sepia-toned dreamy look at what many French people no doubt wish France was like: it harkens back to a mythical golden France-that-never-was, where, as Nancy Reagan once let slip over a public microphone, there are ""all these lovely white people"".

So it's sappy and a little silly, but in a witty and unexpected way, and it's beautiful. And the message is kind of a good one, on balance: Amelie cares a lot about others but needs at some point to start living her own life.

The acting is top-notch, and even the accents of the characters are carefully placed and perfectly complement the emotional architecture of the film. There are some witty digressions in quick montage form of ""what might have happened"", a la the movie Run, Lola, Run, which are quite funny. Much of this film is funny.

So if you like French stuff, and don't mind a bit of schmaltz with some hot pepper popping up here and there, this movie is for you. I give it a five for visuals, a five for acting, a three for plot, a four for the dynamics of interpersonal relations and the questions explored around them, and a one for the studied avoidance of any social questions like immigration or how people who work for a living in Paris really live.

Audrey Taotou and Mathieu Kassovitz both gave EXCELLENT performances, and are totally believable as their characters of Amelie and Nino. The cinematography and use of color is AMAZING, and the film is worth watching for that alone, but besides that, its such a sweet story about a very shy waitress in Paris (shot on location)who discovers a little secret behind a bathroom tile in her house. And from then on, she devotes herself to doing good to others... but will Amelie ever do to herself what she has done so graciously for others, by seizing the man she loves?

I really enjoyed Audrey Tautou's performance in her wide range of expression throughout the story. While the story itself is not overwhelmingly remarkable, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and

Guillaume Laurant's way of telling it captures the viewer from the start. Color plays an integral role in this film, rather reminiscent of Technicolor in the early days of film. It's almost hypersaturated but only serves to enrich the tale.

To fully appreciate this film, watch it first in French with the subtitles to hear the nuances of the French language. I have also watched it dubbed in English but some of the voice inflections cannot be compared to the original French.

It is better than every movie on the Time list, so far.  Aguirre - The Wrath of God is the only one so far that comes close, but I have quite a few to go.  I've only seen about 10 of them.

What I love most about this movie is how sweet and affectionate the ending is.  I am just so tired of seeing passionate sexual kisses on screen.  The kisses here are tender, gentle, loving.

Amelie herself is unforgettable and sweet.  There is a wonderful villain in the movie, a grocer, such an obnoxious guy, but fun to watch.  The actor must have had a ball playing him.

I like the color in most of the movie.  It is bright and colorful.  I feel like it is painted with the vitality that would be appropriate for a small child's room, bursting with lively colors.

There is such a funny, gentle, accepting, pleasant attitude towards sex.  In one scene we see couple after couple in the middle of it.  In another scene we see glasses on shelves, rocking to the beat of a couple having sex.  There is a sex shop, and it isn't ridiculed or made slimy.  It's played for innocent humor, as a female employee pastes price stickers on dildos and a man carelessly sticks them on a shelf - they make a hysterical visual impact.  Anyone who objects to the sex in this movie has a problem.

She is faced with difficult people and problems in her life, and instead of blowing up at these people and problems verbally; she is more cunning and cleaver and helps out using less obvious, more creative means. Yes, she doesn't speak very much throughout the movie, but maybe we need more people like her in the world. People who shut the heck up and figure out problems in more imaginative, peaceful ways. She saw flaws in people's lives and instead of confronting these people, she helped guide them in seeing there errs in more inconspicuous ways, yet she was reluctant to face her own problems in her own life. The ultimate conclusion of the move is that she was finally able to see there were flaws in her own life from lack of confronting her feelings of love. I feel Amelie is a wonderful work of art.

The movie is fairly simple as far as plot goes, but it's presented beautifully, a free romp for the imagination for its own sake. It's made almost from a child's point of view and is the ultimate feel-good movie, but deftly avoids falling into condescension, a problem that plagues most movies of this kind. It teases itself and its characters--take for example, the scene when Amelie imagines her own death and the thousands whom she has helped mourning for her, or the fact that the 'prince charming' of the film is a clerk in a porn shop. The movie looks and feels like a daydream. Don't watch it for enlightenment or serious consideration of some important issues.

Amelie is a shy girl with an innocent but slightly offbeat sense of humor who goes about trying to right the wrongs of the world and heal broken hearts. But her shyness thwarts her from finding love and happiness for herself. In time well...you just have to see the movie.

The movie is full of wonderful sight gags that sometimes are surreal (some of this done with very subtle animation). The movie starts with Amelie coming into the world moves us through her childhood and brings us up to her adulthood. Each episode of her life is portrayed with whimsy irony and humor. It is filled with side jokes like her father's mysterious traveling garden gnome and her almost mythic quest for the man who leaves his photo booth picture all over Paris. Poor Amelie has such insight into the people she knows and such a curiosity of those, like the mystery man in the photos, whom she does not know.

Everything about the movie, the acting, the dialogue the plot and even the color palette of the movie cry out with a joy for life, especially for life's absurdities. In it's wackiness it is also a wise movie.

Every household should own a copy of this movie in the same way every household should own Band-Aids and aspirin because this movie is a cure-all for the blues.

In the end, the film is a different kind of romantic comedy for all of those reclusive nerds out there who live in their own world and are itching to join the outside.

_Amelie_ features some wonderful, playful music using instruments that U.S. movie watchers may not be familiar with. The film is decidedly French, with its exaggeration of colors and tonal hue and variety of different camera lenses.

(On a side note, the film is likely the source for the sudden commercial use of the gnome imagery, iconography, and branding.)",1114214400,4,775,4.819548872180451
1705600,5,B0000640VO,"""Am&eacute;lie"" is a film where you want to find the perfect word for describing its charm. There is probably such a word in French, but I would not know what it was. All I know is that quirky, enchanting, and everything I come up with in English is wholy inadequate to the task at hand. The most important thing to know is that ""Am&eacute;lie"" is a film where you should go see it because so many people love it, even if it requires you to not to do anything else so you can read the subtitles (some people resist such demands and--shudder--listen to dubbed versions of ""Life is Beautiful"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""). I feel about this film the way I did about ""Memento,"" where I told people they should see it and refused to tell them anything else because it would ruin the experience (think the Heisenberg principle). However, I think the audience that would enjoy ""Am&eacute;lie"" is considerably wider than those who would cotton to a quirkly little film like ""Memento.""

So, I am giving you my strongest recommendation for you to see ""Am&eacute;lie."" Now, if you have not yet seen the film, please go away, because I want to talk to those who have seen the film and while I am not going to be providing what we would traditionally consider ""spoilers,"" you really sure come to view this film as pure and chaste as the driven snow (of which we have lots up here).

I find it interesting that the film's French title ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain"" was reduced to just ""Am&eacute;lie"" for American consumption. Combined with the green framed portrait of actress Audrey Tautou smiling impishly as the title character, this certainly does not give viewers a real idea of what they will discover in this film. One of the chief charms of the film for me was how you had to pay attention to the details because almost everything was a clue as to future developments (the exception that proves the rule would be Blubber, whose return we patiently waited for throughout the entire film).

Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Am&eacute;lie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do. We then begin 48 hours in which d'Am&eacute;lie's life is changed. Of course such massive developments hinge on a bottle cap fallen to the floor. Our heroine's efforts to sabotage the life of Collignon (Urbain Cancelier), the Grocer (who will never be confused with an artichoke), struck my funny bone exceedingly hard and her relationship with the Glass Man, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), was particularly nice, both their discussions about the girl with the wine glass in the Renoir painting and the old man giving her the final push to her destiny. The only question is whether Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz), is really good enough for our girl, but if she is smitten with a man who collects torn up and discarded photographs from photo booths around town, who are we to challenge her choice?

The end of the fabulous 48 hours at which point our heroine finds her destiny does not offer a perfect world. Some find true bliss in love, others finally go on trips, but some still right where they started, unpublished, afflicted by imaginary illnesses, or consumed by jealousy. But as long as Am&eacute;lie lives happily ever after we are content.",1113609600,,3332,4.80977312390925
1705601,5,B0000640VO,"""Amelie"", a French film from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""Delicatessen"", ""City of Lost Children"") is a fairy tale confection that is sure to please most everyone who has the opportunity to watch it.

Amelie (Audrey Tautou), a young waitress living in Montmarte, happens to find a small box of toys behind a loose tile in her bathroom. She decides to anonymously reunite the toys with their owner, now a man in his late 40s. After she tracks him down, she leaves the box in a phone booth that he passes every day. As he passes, she calls the booth causing him to stop and find the box. Amelie stops at a local bar and the man also stops there, talking about the curious events of the day. He proclaims that he will call his daughter and grandson, because he hasn't talked to his daughter in many years. Gratified, Amelie begins to do small anonymous favors for the people in her life. Her path crosses with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a strange young man who collects discarded photo booth pictures. She is attracted to him, but completely unable to introduce herself.

I think it would be difficult for anyone to dislike ""Amelie"". The story is so uplifting, the lead actress is so enormously appealing and likable, the supporting cast is so excellent, the production qualities are completely top notch.

Jeunet has crafted a vision of Montmarte and Paris that is idyllic, picture book perfect, causing many intellectuals in France to denounce the film. In my opinion, these people are trying to find fault with the film because it is so good. They are jealous. This is a lovable confection for all ages. I'll address the all ages thing later.

The film is washed in a sepia tint giving each frame the appearance of an old photograph. Set in 1997, the settings look like they were pulled from the 40s. With the exception of a modern video camera, pretty much the entire film is devoid of modern technology. None of the characters drive cars and only one of them uses a small motor bike to get around. This lack of technology only serves to make the film appear even more like a fairy tale.

Amelie and her friends inhabit a Paris that is also extremely clean. No graffiti and little dirt appear in any frame as she travels to and fro. This helps attain and retain the idealized vision of life that in turn helps the viewer live inside this fairy tale.

Amelie, as played by Audrey Tautou, is so kind, friendly and infectious that it is difficult not to like her. Tautou could pass as Audrey Hepburn's love child, the resemblance is so striking. She is a young woman that realizes she has a gift for helping people anonymously. With this realization, it becomes her reason for life. Amelie is a strange girl, quiet but pretty, unconfident with strangers but also looking for a relationship. She grew up in a strange family environment, which helps explain some of her behavior. This family history is amusingly, and quickly, presented by Jeunet at the beginning of the film. Audrey Tautou is very charming in this role and this film. I inadvertently watched a DVD of ""French Beauty Institute"" the same night. Tautou has a supporting role in the film, but barely makes an impact. Hopefully, she will be able to find the type of roles that will ensure a long and healthy career.

The overall message of ""Amelie"" is so uplifting that it raised my spirits all day. Much like the disastrous American film ""Pay It Forward"", the film has a message that if we help strangers, our world will be a better place. The difference in the story between the two films is that ""Amelie"" does not rely on preachy storytelling or character martyrdom to get the message across. Amelie does her thing and the consequences happen, causing us to laugh and learn from her example.

Another wonderful thing about the film is that not all of the consequences of her good deeds last for very long. Despite the fairy tale aspect of the film, this helps it seem more real and gives the message more resonance.

I would think that ""Amelie"" would be a perfect film to take the entire family to, but there are a few things to be aware of. The film is subtitled, which will prevent the youngest kids from understanding it. Also, there are a few very brief images of nudity in a sexual situation. Two scenes are set in a sex shop and the characters price sex toys before displaying them, but they don't discuss them at all or put them into the context of what they are supposed to do. These few things will probably keep parents from taking children, but, in my view, that is a mistake. If they can read subtitles, they should see ""Amelie"". The film is great for everyone and should eventually be experienced by everyone. Wouldn't it be better for your child to see a film about a girl who does good deeds than some violent action film at every mutliplex?

""Amelie"" apparently caused quite a sensation in France. It is now the top grossing film in that country and has inspired people to do little good deeds for strangers. I have even heard that a tour company is offering a tour of the sights used in the film.

Hopefully, ""Amelie"" will catch on here in the U.S. as well.",1113264000,3,5135,4.582788671023965

And yes, Audrey Tautou's performance was what one might call ""career making"" (but also served as a kind of ""brand"" in that it is hard for people to see her otherwise). At times hilarious, at other times more tender, the story revolves around Amelie, a shy, quiet, nave waitress in Paris who ""connives"" behind the scenes, doing small things that mean something much larger to others. Amelie delights in the little details of life and lives on dreams. She conspires to inspire others, returning lost objects to their owners, befriending people who have no friends, ""punishing"" those who are mean or unjust, helping others to fall in love. Hers is, perhaps, the invisible hand making game pieces move across a board, and Amelie derives joy from seeing the reactions. However, she knows her own life in incomplete and sets out to find her path and possibly her own love... this is done in an original and ""cute"" way.

the sets were wonderful... everywhere you looked on the screen seem to glow or shine with brilliance... Jeunet seems to be telling you to slow down and look how beautiful life is! the cinematography is always full. what Jean does for this small town in France reminds me what Woody Allen did for Manhattan... he makes you fall in love with it.

and if anyone came away from this film not loving Audrey Tatou they did not watch this film... having seen other films with Audry i realized that she's just playing a character (contrasted from her brooding Senay in Dirty Pretty Things) but i think most people would like to always see her in this role... she pulls off the right amount of innocent and beauty that Amlie demands...

i could only pray that someone like Amlie would be meddling with my life...

the subtle touches with the special effects were not overwhelming but very fitting (the talking paintings and pictures... the melting into water and some the amazing shot of Amlie skipping stone)

everything about this film seemed to fit toghther... i recommend to anyone who is feeling downhearted and needs a little faith in the human spirit!",1111536000,3,1888,4.659638554216867

The twist is that the only thing keeping these two lovers apart is Amelie herself. She is both protagonist and antagonist and this will frustrate you, dear viewer, to no end. If this film wasn't in French I wonder how many people will be hailing it as they do now. It has some cute inspired moments (such as the traveling Gnome) and her mission to help others started out intriguing enough but the film falls into false sentimentality and quickly we learn that Amelie isn't a character, she's a puppet with the mannerism of a barbie doll and the maturity of a 12 yr old girl. Where are the strong confident female characters? Is this the best the french have to offer? Is this just an American movie indisguise? Don't be fooled by the subtitles, just because it's in a foreign language doesn't make it any better than your typical hollywood romantic comedy. Amelie starts off promising but fails because instead of getting a strong female character we get a walking doll who gets in her own way just to stretch this film to it's two hour time mark.",1110758400,12,1221,4.554545454545455
1705616,5,B0000640VO,"Suspend all disbelief and allow this charming film lull you into its dreamscape.  This is French cinema at its best and you certainly won't need to uncork `89 La Fitte Rothschild to let this one captivate your spirit.  Amelie is a warm and life affirming film that proves that no matter what station in life we hold we can engage ourselves and make life worth living on the most profound levels and then find true happiness.  Think this sounds like a fairy tale? Well just sit back and watch you'll see what I mean.

As the film opens up we see a younger version of Amelie and her friendless life and through the dynamic hues of the filming and dreamy French music we get an idea for what we are in for.  The cinematography is fantastic and if nothing else, watch the movie just to see how beautiful Paris can be.  As the film progresses we see Amelie in ""the present"" she is still detached and after finding a box of old things begins performing random acts of kindness from afar.  The big question is she going interact with the world on a personal level and ever find what is missing in her life.

I really liked this film but I will admit that it requires a child-like naivet&eacute; to watch at some points but the lovely feel of this movie does its best to make this easy on the viewer with its soundtrack and use of CGI.  If you are a fan of Audrey Tautou you should catch A Very Long Engagement. Amelie is terrific you will love it and the director commentary track is worth the price of the DVD itself.

I think a lot of big budget movies are made with only a single good idea to go on.  This movie has some fifteen good ideas - good solid funny or quirky story ideas - to entertain us.

There is, however, some sex here and there, so you have to be careful.  I think it would be just as good a movie without it, but the movie maker goes for some sex gags (and is not shy about showing flesh) even though they are not actually that funny.  Ah well.

The actress who plays Amelie is adorable.  She is the centerpiece of the movie, but she has a lot of help making things work.  There are quite a few unique and fun characters coming and going throughout the story.  The little girl who plays Amelie at age 6 opens the movie, and she steals our hearts with her innocence.  My favorite part of the movie is when this 6 year old exacts revenge on her soccer-fan neighbor.

1705635,1,B0000640VO,"To call Amelie pretentious would be a compliment and I decline to join in the chorus of this movie's enraptured horde of admirers. In fact, this film never manages to rise to the level of pretension although it definitely aspires to do so.

Amelie is the story of a young French waitress whose childhood was marred by her parents' neuroses that, in addition to other ills, caused her isolation from friends and family. Unlike others with less than prosaic childhoods, Amelie's young adulthood is singularly uneventful and unremarkable until the day she happens upon a discovery that opens her stunted and sheltered mind to the joyous possibilities inherent in helping other people in unusual ways (Put your hat back on, it's not nearly as exciting as it reads). The remainder of the plot, subplot, side plot...? consists of the typical boy meets girl - or rather girl stalks boy - romance fluff stuff.

In attempting to be humorous and quirky this movie comes across as sophomoric and goofy. Where they promise serendipity, whimsy and delight, Amelie the movie and Amelie the heroine deliver contrivance, triteness, and boredom. Add to this a cast of characters who were probably designed to appear likeably average but miss the mark by simply appearing weird.

Anywhere you slurp them, be it a Hollywood haunt or a Parisian caf, these ingredients amount to a less than mediocre `soup du jour' of a film.",1104105600,29,1404,4.915611814345992

1705638,5,B0000640VO,"It is really hard to give the reader a sense of this magical film because it is almost beyond words.  There have been many films (foreign and non) made about misfits who live their lives outside of the box, but few have been orchestrated with such whimsy, subtlety and warmth as was done with ""Amelie.""

Amelie (Audrey Tatou) is a young waitress at a cafe, who lives a solitary existence in Paris, and we get a sense from the very beginning that she has spent her life on the outside looking in.  She has a lively and individualistic imagination.  A chance discovery of a mysterious childhood toy box and her determination to return it to the original owner, inspires her to make bringing joy and redemption to others her life's work.  It isn't until she comes face-to-face with a potential suitor (Nino--played by Mathieu Kassovitz) that the shy waif must look to find her own true bliss.

One of the strogest qualities of this film is the magical and intriguing combination of magical realism (talking pictures of animals, the juxtaposition of Amelie's fantasies and how she applies them to reality) and warm sprinkles of exhuberant humor.  This is also a film with a great heart.  It is truly a shining example of an adult fairy tale where destiny can be determined by timing and courage.  Please don't avoid seeing this because of the subtitles, either.  Yes, it is in French, but I guarantee that this film is so entertaining you will forget you are reading them!",1101427200,9,1468,4.69921875
1705639,1,B0000640VO,"It seems somehow fitting that I've finally watched Amelie this day in November 2004 as Christmas approaches. The sheen and gloss of lights and decorations, the smell of rank consumerism spread thickly, the glow of decorative lights over one of Toronto's many panhandlers as they ask for change... ahhhh, it's good to be alive when we have films such as this to keep us cheerful as half the world battles in conflict, battles itself or battles poverty and starvation. Visually it is glorious, imaginative camera shots, excellent direction and some beautiful locations used with the colours tearing out from the screen. Like a crme brulee however, the shell is easily cracked and the actual core lacks substance. The central character is retchingly cute, from the immovable hairstyle to her facial mannerisms. She makes Judy Garland in the Wizard of Oz look like Courtney Love and probably excretes lavender lavender. The scenes explaining her messed-up childhood are generally played for laughs, depriving the character of any sort of audience sympathy by the time she reaches young adulthood and a life of being a loner with an odd imagination. Kooky, strange, weird, she's all of that and more. Quite how she ended up with previous boyfriends is beyond me, perhaps there's a curious brand of Frenchman who enjoys penetrating innocent unmoving rather asexual females who haven't adjusted to the realities of life. The post-coital cigarette probably gets replaced by a Chupa Chup: dirty talk goes no further than `pee pee' (and we're not talking watersports here).

The film really nosedives when she starts to fall for Nino, played by Mathieu Kassovitz. In short she becomes the odd girl at school whom you had a major crush on, kept asking out and then realized once you were going out with her that she spent much of her time talking to her dog as she believed he could understand her better than most people. The notes Amelie leaves, the excruciating caf scene where he can't immediately recognize her due to the disguise she wears on the photos she left... as the disguise consists of a Zorro hat and eye mask, one can only surmise that Nino is brutally myopic. She makes him wander halfway around Paris pursuing photos and pieces of paper, messes him around without a thought, he falls for him despite all of this and yet can't recognize her close up, unadorned with aforementioned Zorro semi-outfit? By the end of it you'll be screaming at her to actually talk to the damn guy because you know the film won't finish until she ends up with him and you want to go to bed/go out/do anything other than watch this girl prolong the tedium any further. Eventually she does snag the chap, they embrace, kiss cheeks and then dispatch themselves to bed. Perhaps there is symbolism there in that she previously found sex to be an unemotional detached experience and, now that she is with the man of her dreams, it becomes something more fulfilling. It doesn't come over as a grand statement about romance and true love though, more a sugary-sweet daydreamer's idea of what true love is like and how to snare a partner.

The story is very simple, the plot hardly that imaginative yet there are masses of people out there who praise this film to the heavens. In terms of romantic fantasy, it can be compared to something like Tim Burton's Big Fish and loses out to this film in every way, from characterization to plot to the depth of imagination used. It's a feel-good fairy story with none of the magic that makes Hans Christian Anderson or Brothers Grimm tales special. If you find Friends to be an example of fantastic inter-relationship screenwriting and Ally McBeal to be wonderfully quirky and imaginative then you'll suck up this film like a dehydrated sponge. The whole film is forced whimsy and, if you are of sane mind and body, the only forcing that should be undertaken is to force it out of your DVD player as quickly as possible and curse it for wasting two precious hours of your life.",1100995200,23,3995,4.788405797101449

1705642,5,B0000640VO,"Amlie is a young, independent woman working as a waitress in a caf near Sacr-Coeur. The secondary characters in the film are charicatures of typical Parisians, but they are the sort of odd mix you might find in any big city. Amlie finds herself in the middle of a bit of a mystery one day and that mystery guides the plot towards the ultimate happy ending, true love.

There are some detours on the way. Amlie reintroduces her father to life with creative use of a garden gnome. She teaches an overbearing shop keeper a lesson on how to treat people, plus a few other entertaining sidetracks. There are good subplots involving the secondary characters as well. All this makes for a very rich and entertaining movie.

The film itself is beautiful, Paris doesn't look as good in real life as it does in this movie. The colors are exceptional and the music is charming. If you're a fan of contemporary French movies it has a few recognizable faces from other movies, like Isabelle Nanty, who does a fabulous job as a weird hypochondriac tobbaconist and Mathieu Kassovitz who plays Amlie's well-matched love interest.

The first time I watched this movie, I wished everyone I knew spoke French because the subtitles do leave a bit to be desired, but I think people are still clever enough to figure out what is going on. Its just a shame to miss the nuances and idiosyncrasies of each character that their manner of speaking reflects. My husband loved it though and his French is just so-so.

If you are open to a well made romantic comedy and speak French or don't mind reading sub-titles, I highly recommend this movie.",1099267200,4,1617,4.643356643356643

Something of a romantic comedy, ""Amelie"" is extremely touching, brilliantly directed and wonderfully written. The sparse dialog and heavy narration are only one of the ways in which ""Amelie"" breaks with the norm.

Audrey Tatou is brilliantly expressive as the title character. Jeunet does an excellent job of telling this story using other forms of communication: photomat pictures, videotapes, garden gnomes, to name a few.

""Amelie"" gives us a brief introduction to each character, which lets us feel like we're catching up with a story in progress. Once given some telling little clues into a character's motivations, it's up to us to make the rest of the connections. Each of the characters is worth knowing.

1705655,5,B0000640VO,"What an enchanting little movie this is! Amelie is almost a genre unto itself. Not content to just be a funny movie, or a movie about the thrill of new love, it combines both and mixes in a heaping helping of strangeness and random meaningless events to pull together a lovely picture of life as it really can be. It's harnessing all the meaningless little things of daily life into the swirling coherence of your life.

In the big picture, I guess Amelie could be considered a romantic comedy, but it is so much more. It's a surreal slice of a France that alternately does and does not exist. It's the deep meaning of it all, as well as the utter meaninglessness of day-to-day life.

Visually, it is a stunning achievement. If you pay attention to adults, or watch an hour of HGTV you'll soon realize that for some reason when most people grow up, their favorite colors somehow become tan and off-white. Amelie's world is one of color and joy, even in sadness. It's a world of hyper-natural color... the type of world within which every child would love to live.

Audrey Tautou brought to life one of the singlemost memorable characters in movie history with her role as Amelie. The writing here is great, unique, and funny, but there is so much hilarious stuff Audrey can do just with a look that this still could have been an entertaining movie even if the writing had been much less inventive and funny. I recently picked up Dirty Pretty Things almost solely because Audrey is one its main characters. After Amelie, I just had to see her in more movies.

If director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, is ever able to top Amelie, that movie will certainly be another of the best films ever made.

Experience Amelie for yourself. You've never seen anything like it.",1098057600,5,1754,4.608974358974359
1705656,4,B0000640VO,"It's most likely just personal taste, but I wasn't blown away by this movie as much as most of the other people here seem to be. It was a valiant attempt, sure, for a director who'd only made dark films before to try to film a light comedy. Somehow, it didn't quite click with me. I judge this film a good effort, but I think that it missed its potential too often.

I'll start with the first problem: The narrator. The narrator is present throughout the film, basically describing the story at every step; whenever a new character comes into the film, the narrator describes their ""likes"" and ""dislikes"". For me, this was especially distracting at the beginning of the film, when new characters came onto the screen so quickly that it was difficult to keep track of them all. Also, I may be alone, but I find the concept of judging a person by what they ""like"" and ""dislike"" to be a very shallow way of looking at them.

The narrator is the ""easy way around"", but I don't think he's the best; sometimes, I really wished that Jeunet would use him less and use other ways, such as images, sequences, or conversations to tell the story.

Another thing that bothered me was the film's attitude to love (don't read the next sentence if you're underage); that true love comes only through flirting and passionate sex. There is NEVER any conversation between the people in the film who are in love that would show that they love each other for something other than their bodies or their outward mannerisms; instead, it's all instinctive, impulsive, physical love. Really, I found it a bit silly, shallow and demeaning to the viewer.

Thirdly, almost all of the characters in this film, including Amelie, are so different from me or anybody I know that I simply can't relate with them at all (with a few exceptions like the ""Glass Man"" or his assistant). Most of them are well acted (like the man who played the ""Glass Man""'s assistant, the immigrant artist/fruit-stand worker; brilliant), but I also find myself not finding them very interesting or realistic, and the ones that I DO find interesting are not the main characters...

Lastly, the story still feels too ""fake"", a leftover from the director's previous films. It was fine in ""City of Lost Children"" and ""Delicatessen"", where I suspended my disbelief somewhat because they obviously took place in alternate universes to ours. ""Amelie"", however, is too close to the ""real world"" for me to make those same kind of allowances. It often seemed too ""glossy"" a picture of the real world to me (I know that this is what Jeunet was going for, but that doesn't mean I have to like it).

Having now displayed all of the reasons why I DIDN'T like it, you may be wandering why I'm still giving it 4 stars. :)

Basically, because despite all of the flaws, it was brilliantly filmed, suceeded often enough to keep it interesting, and left me feeling relatively satisfied at the end. Most of you will probably love it; if the premise sounds like something that you would like, then go ahead and give it a try. Personally, I wasn't sure that it was quite my type of film, and I turned out to be correct in that regard. If I had to rate it, I'd give it somewhere between 75-79/100.",1097712000,4,3218,4.586086956521739

It was the most fun I'd had in a while.

You're REALLY got to be quick with this movie because it's subtitled and the dialogue is really clever- but also EXTREMELY fast. If you miss anything they're saying you'll be sorry because a moment later you could be in one of Amelie's visions and wonder to yourself ""What's going on?!""

The story is of a girl who finds a box full of childrens toys from the fifties hidden in a hole in her bathroom. She comes to a desicion that she will find the owner and give back the box- and if it brings the owner joy then she'll commit herself to doing good deeds. It's full of such wonderful wit- some of it very twisted and at moments so sudden you can't help but laugh in surprise and delight. Alas when Amelie DOES commit herself to a life of good deeds she finds herself searching for the owner of a lost photo album, and begins to fall in love with him (though they've never met)!

Thirdly, almost all of the characters in this film, including Amelie, are so different from me or anybody I know that I simply can't relate with them at all (with a few exceptions like the ""Glass Man"" or his assistant). Most of them are well acted (like the man who played the ""Glass Man""'s assistant, the immigrant artist/fruit-stand worker; brilliant), but I also find myself not finding them very interesting or realistic, and the ones that I DO find interesting are not the main characters...
Lastly, the story still feels too ""fake"", a leftover from the director's previous films. It was fine in ""City of Lost Children"" and ""Delicatessen"", where I suspended my disbelief somewhat because they obviously took place in alternate universes to ours. ""Amelie"", however, is too close to the ""real world"" for me to make those same kind of allowances. It often seemed too ""glossy"" a picture of the real world to me (I know that this is what Jeunet was going for, but that doesn't mean I have to like it).
Having now displayed all of the reasons why I DIDN'T like it, you may be wandering why I'm still giving it 4 stars. :)
Basically, because despite all of the flaws, it was brilliantly filmed, suceeded often enough to keep it interesting, and left me feeling relatively satisfied at the end. Most of you will probably love it; if the premise sounds like something that you would like, then go ahead and give it a try. Personally, I wasn't sure that it was quite my type of film, and I turned out to be correct in that regard. If I had to rate it, I'd give it somewhere between 75-79/100.",1096588800,,3212,4.587826086956522
1705660,3,B0000640VO,"Amelie is so French.  Paris is so beautiful.  Is it really that lovely?  I don't think Goddard thought it was.  The great French director, Renoir, well he saw the disastrous 30's as a parable of misery.  And I was dodging Paris con men and not dodging prostitutes in the early 70's, but Amelie will have none of that cynicism.  No Socialist French nightmare of unbelievable unemployment and crappy free, healthcare for the young woman, Amelie.  She's in a fantasy world.

I loved the warm colors of 19th century painter Renoir.  This is a movie that is a canvas-a-scene.  The dialogue is quirky; the scenes go by fade in, fade out, little odd twists and turns.  Fantasy animation scenes intermingle with romantic notions.  Love wins out for most while the foolish and mean come to see their way.  If only...",1095033600,5,807,4.719424460431655

Where is it written that everything must be rooted in literalism and stick to the tedious confines of abject humanism? Amelie is a joyous tale where everything is possible if one will only allow oneself to get out of one's own way.

 Visually it's a treat - it's every Parisian fantasy come to life with a score that fairly screams ""Paris!""

 Director Jeunet captures everything with a deft touch and he is aided by a uniformly excellent cast - most notably in Audrey Tautou who is . . . (sigh) just about perfect.

I love the last scene when they are motorcycling down the Parisian streets. The film is also a photographic wonder; everything, from the subway to the streets, is infused with color and light.

Amelie is a simple story told in a unique and stylish way. I am inclined to think that at least a part of its charm is to do with the fact that it is in French but this is just one little thing. I like the attention to detail in the film, the way the narrator introduces characters telling the audience his or her likes and dislikes.

1705681,5,B0000640VO,"""Amelie"" is the most wonderfully charming film I have ever seen.  It's quite possible that, upon reflection, I'll consider this to be hyperbole inspired by a recent viewing, and I'll give ""Amelie"" a more reserved rating, like ""it's one of the best films I've ever seen.""
""Amelie"" tells the story of the title character, played with a seeming impossible combination of daring, reserve, romanticism, idealism, and fear by Audrey Tautou.  In a performance where she is speaks very little (one of her struggles is that she is an observer of life who must eventually find a way to ""live"" her life rather than watch it go by), Tautou nevertheless steals the show.
Well, almost, 'cause the city of Paris gives her a run for her money.  If you are a fan of Paris, you will absolutely love this film.  Lovingly shot, the film gives us a Paris that is so perfect that it cannot exist in real life.  Colors are slightly exaggerated through clever filters and lighting, and the charming little details (such as the elaborate cursive menu on a restaurant window) are evocative of the film's romantic spirit.
One of the most original plots in years, ""Amelie"" tells the story of a woman who has always sat on the sidelines.  As a child, Amelie was so nervous when her reserved father touched her (only during medical examinations) that her pulse raced, leading to the misdiagnosis of a hyperactive heart.  As Amelie grows into womanhood, she has always sat and observed, and with a wonderful imagination has created an alternate universe for herself.  This imagination carries through to her adult life, and manifests itself in delightful ways (no other character in cinema could melt away into a splash of water at the sight of her true love).
Through a discovery of a long-lost box of childhood trinkets and the sad-yet-blissful restoration to its rightful owner, Amelie resolves to bring cheer and zest to the lives of her fellow Parisians.  Not content to whisk a blind man down a crowded street, narrating all the peculiar sights, sounds, and smells of daily Parisian life that he can no longer fully appreciate, Amelie takes it upon herself to be, at times, a match-maker, an instrument of revenge against a local bully (hilarious comeuppance alert!), and a re-writer of heartbreak.
One of the most entertaining subplots of the movie has to do with her father, who even though he has the freedom to travel (he is a widower, brought about through the most freakish of accidents) refuses to do so.  Amelie sends his beloved garden gnome on a travel across the world, including pictures sent from abroad to her mystified dad.
Of course, a romantic spirit like Amelie's can't avoid falling in love.  But when she falls in love, it can't be a straightforward seduction.  Elaborate courting, hilarious misunderstandings, and a boiling-over romanticism make for a powerful conclusion to a charming film.
Note:  the DVD does not have an option for listening to a dubbed English version - if you don't speak French, you're going to have to work with subtitles.  I don't speak a lick of French, but listening to the dialogue in French adds something to its romance, so I think this is an improvement rather than a burden -- if I had the option, I'd still go with the subtitles (this works with other foreign films, too, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" where dubbing just doesn't work).  The DVD has some good extras, too -- we're not talking a Peter Jackson treasure trove, but they are worth it.

1705682,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is a delectable little French pastry that, I imagine, only the most hardboiled of cynics could totally dismiss.  A treat for the mind, soul, eyes, & ears: delicious interiors drenched in lush colors (mostly reds and greens), a spirited soundtrack (lots of zesty accordion - but don't let you that put you off), an amusing cast of quirky characters, enchanted - and some rather disenchanted - romance, and a dash of intriguing mystery.
Young Amelie is a shy doe-like creature, the hapless offspring of two human oddities. One day she is struck with a revelation when she discovers a little boy's long lost box of treasures hidden in a secret compartment in her bathroom. Once she anonymously returns the item to the boy, who by now is middle-aged, and witnesses from afar his joy, she sets out on a quest to right the wrongs of her fellow human beings (even imagining herself as Zorro in one scene).
Along the way, Amelie stumbles across her soul mate who devotes much of his time scavenging for discarded strips of photos from photo booths and saving them in a scrapbook. Hmmmm, interesting hobby, oui? But will Amelie ever muster up the courage to actually encounter him face to face?
Ah, and what does Princess Diana's death have to do with any of these shenanigans? And who is the Glass Man and why does he paint the same thing over and over again? Who is the bald man in the red sneakers who seems obsessed with having his photo taken yet never keeps any of them? Will the nitwit with the tape recorder ever stop stalking Gina? Can anything cure Georgette's many maladies? Why would Suzanne rather eat human flesh than horse flesh? What happened to papa's garden gnome? And what on earth is hidden beneath the artichoke?

1705684,5,B0000640VO,"I am 23 years old, and admittedly quite jaded with life, society, and just about everything about the good ole Earth. I got wind of this movie over New Years, and have since watched it several times, always with different people. Not one has been disappointed, so I believe that Amelie is truly a movie that appeals to everyone. For those of you that can't get past subtitles, you probably went and saw the Passion, so you should check this out too. This will contrast that so wonderfully, and probably fill you with a new zest for life.
The premise: Amelie is a single waitress that decides to pass on living for herself, and makes an attempt to affect the lives of everyone around her. You might find her meddlesome, but it is never contrived, and normally to a person's benefit. That is until she meets Nino, a pornshop clerk, who has a weird habit of collecting torn photographs from beneath photo booths, and reforming them in albums (I realize that sentence has horrid grammar, but I'm typing faster than I think). This romance is what got me. IF there is something so innocent and pure as the chase depicted here, then perhaps humanity is not all bad. At first, it might seem a tad obsessive, but when placed within the quirkiness and oddities of the characters within the movie, it seems completely normal.
I took many things from this movie. Aside from some profound discussion with my friends after seeing it, I got a newfound desire to actually give people a chance. In addition, I also got a rather insatiable appetite for Audrey Tautou, whose childlike innocence, alabaster skin, and melodic voice is something to behold. This is probably the best film made within my lifetime; not because of special effects or cinematography, but because it tells a wonderful story in a wonderful way. You should see it, it's only $4 or so.",1084406400,3,1838,4.675925925925926

The use of color has rarely been so magnificent, and it all is SO important to understanding where sweet Amelie is coming from. Lovely fantasy stuff, mixed with the real world. I avoided seeing this film, but I borrowed the 2-disc version from the library, and was thoroughly entertained. Audrey Tautou reminds me of a young Audrey Hepburn, as well as Julia Roberts...without trying to imitate them. She's endearing. All of the supporting roles were done with conviction and strength, especially Mathieu Kassowitz, as the object of her obsession. Jean-Pierre Jeunet, like some of our other GREAT directors (Scott, Cameron, Fincher) got his big break directing an ""Alien"" film. The second disc tells that he was so upset with the Hollywood process and lack of artistic control, that he's gone somewhat independent since then. He's given us wonderful stuff like ""Delcatessen"". It's a sweet story, but if you're into visual art, be sure to see this film. Also, the music of Vann Tiersen will draw you more and more into this fantasy. It's wonderful! The 2.35:1 Letterbox shows off gorgeous sets and cinematography. ""Amelie"" is definitely worth a look.",1084060800,3,1293,5.018604651162791

I usually despise romantic comedies, but if thats what you want to call this movie (it really bridges the gap between genres but..), this is an exception.  The first 10 minutes are just brief character synopsis, and you will find how quirky and fun this movie is right from the start (the suicidal fish!  I love it!)  I'd have to say the BEST part of this movie, though, is the garden gnome!  The DVD also has the original language track in Parisian French which is interesting to listen to.  Such an amazing movie!

1705688,5,B0000640VO,"Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and starring Audrey Tatou in the title role, ""Amelie"" is set in the Montmartre area of Paris. The film focuses on Amelie, the only child of Raphael and Amandine Poulain. Her father is a neurotic ex-army doctor while her mother was a teacher with all the warmth of an iceberg. Withheld from school as a child, due to her father's mistaken belief that she had a heart defect, Amelie was educated at home - initially by her mother. Amandine died when Amelie was young, however, when she broke the fall of a suicidal Canadian jumping from the tower of Notre Dame Cathedral. Her lack of contact with other children meant her only friend was a goldfish called Blubber and led to the development of quite an active imagination.
Even as an adult, Amelie amuses herself with silly questions without ever really becoming close to anyone. She regularly visits her father, Raphael - he would dearly love to travel, but is too afraid to take the first step. She works as a waitress in a caf called Les Deux Moulins, a real caf in Montmartre. Among her colleagues are Gina, who seems to be the closest thing to a friend Amelie has and Georgette, who runs the tabac. Georgette is quite possibly the definitive hypochondriac. One of the caf's regulars is a man called Joseph - a former lover of Gina, he is an incredibly jealous and possessive character who constantly spies on her.
As the film progresses, she becomes friendly with an elderly neighbour. Commonly known as the Glass Man, his real name is Raymond Dufayel. He never leaves his apartment, and has an obsession of his own : Renoir's ""Luncheon of the Boating Party"". Dufayel has painted one of his own every year for the last twenty years, but he just can't get it right. One of the film's most likeable characters is Lucien, who works at the greengrocers and takes art lessons with Dufayel. Amelie, who is very fond of Lucien, doesn't really care for his boss - the obnoxious and abusive Monsieur Collignon.
Amelie's life starts to change when she finds a small box of keepsakes hidden in the wall of her bathroom - toy cars and bikes, pictures of football players and such like. Based on the box's contents, she believes that the box was hidden there in the 50s by a young boy, and decides to reunite the box with its owner. Looking for information about who lived in her apartment at that time, she starts with Madeleine Wells. An emotional wreck, her husband ran off with his secretary to South America, and was killed in a car accident there. Nico Quincampoix, however, provides the biggest reason for change. Another loner, like Amelie, he collects photos left lying around the photo booths of the city's metro and train stations. For some reason, he keeps these in a photo album - which is found by Amelie after he drops it in the street. However, she finds she has fallen for him - but like her father, she seems afraid to take the first step.
This is easily one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen. Set in one of the world's most beautiful cities and featuring a collection of quirky and / or likeable characters, it's a film I just can't find fault with. It's filmed in French and subtitled, which might put some people off - for me, however, the subtitles actually seem to add to the film's enjoyment.",1082937600,6,3296,4.597623089983022
1705689,5,B0000640VO,"...And just about everyone else, too. Whatever baggage you may or may not have concerning foreign films- drop it now. Amelie is perhaps the most exuberant, stylish and joyful film to pop along in ages. Lovingly made: the acting, the shot composition, the editing and the (very, very) subtle use of CGI...

 Widescreen is a must for this one, as much of the film's beauty is chopped out in the VHS release (such as one scene, where Amelie is sitting in front of the TV in a room that's nigh entirely red- save for a small blue lamp to her left. It's a tiny detail, but it fleshes out everything wonderfully- closed captioned: the lamp is gone). Little things, definitely. But then, this is a movie that is all about the tiny details in life...

Yes, it's a love story, and as sweet as they come. No need to further belabor that aspect or give away any moments. But you will be surprised many times over. You will laugh at loud. And you will want to watch it again and again, especially with someone you can touch close by. And if you don't have someone- this movie may provide the much-needed impetus to go to France and start turning (not to mention skipping) stones (the shots of the city are marvellous).

Then there's Audrey Tautou, whose expressive face is the axis of the movie. Amelie holds your gaze like a naissance de millennium Audrey Hepburn. She has an elfin grace that is utterly sublime and unique. When Amelie smiles, you smile with her.

I could gush about this for a long, long time. Rarely do I see a film that brings out the child-like optimist and romantic in me- I tend to go for the unflinching, unredemptive view of humanity (Requiem for a dream and Happiness are two good examples).

If you have seen it, then you know why you should get this one- movies like this simply aren't made that often. Especially with such skill and flair (this was, I believe, Jeunet's first film sans Caro ((they did 'the city of lost children' and 'delicatessen,' both great films!)) and the cinematographer's first feature period, though I may be mistaken...)

AMELIE can be considered a story of stories, tied together by just a single link, in the form of a girl called Amilie. Living in her own shell, this girl discovers the Samaritan in her, when she successfully tracks down and gives the previous occupant of her apartment, a box containing objects of his childhood playthings that she accidentally finds in her house, and brings out the tears of joy in his eyes, as he reminisces his days of childhood, watching and feeling the contents of the box. This experience overwhelms her, and she decides that she would now on, do whatever she could, to straighten other people's lives, and herein lies the stories, which make the story of the movie.
The movie is made up of bits and pieces, showing the rather weird nature of the various people, that Amilie tries to help. The magic of the movie lies in this aspect of how beautifully each character is depicted, with some handicap or the other disturbing their lives, which this lonely but good-willed girl tries to fix. Be it the `obsessed' neighbor, who is more than happy to read out letters from her deal husband, or the painter, who is so touchy about how names are pronounced, or the bullying vegetable-vendor, always belittling his hapless assistant, or the loveless boyfriend and the loveless hotel-waitresses, or the young man, who sifts for torn photographs of people, and reassembles and sticks them in the album that he maintains of reassembled photos of people he doesn't even know, or even Amilie's own father, who is obsessed with his ceramic gnome, each one of them is so carefully and delicately defined, that it overshadows the ambiguity in the story, which is what it intends to do, in the first place.
Though the story has a nave fairy-tale-like feel to it, it actually turns out otherwise, by its messed up characters. Hence, the movie, far from being a sappy and drab tale of feel-good, is actually quite an interesting take on the most unusual and uncanny facets of the human nature. Moreover, the slick cinematography and the music-video like feel of the movie, coupled with the swanky voice-over comments make it not only a visually splendid movie, but also an exciting joyride, with a lot of areas worth pondering on.
AMILIE has a mischievous undertone, with a visually pleasing and amiable exterior. When one sees beyond the pleasing epidermis of the movie, it provides for interesting food for thought, when it comes to analyzing the bizarre characters in it. For its glossy appearance, or for its underlying unapparent starkness, or for its feel-good aura, or just for its wacky imagination, AMILIE is an entertainer with brains and brawns.",1081296000,6,2977,4.8853754940711465

This is why I love the movies. Amelie is not your everyday dark film of murder, mayhem and ugly behavior; this is a dream world and the beautiful place I want to be taken too when I suspend reality at the door.
I watch in wonder at how the filmmaker embellishes such a simple story to create a delightfully rich tapestry, ripe with incredible images and subtleties of life. This is an excellent example of how all the cinema arts can be directed to create total magic.
Amelie is so full of originality, whimsy and nuance in this modern world of fast people and obvious everything. It is such a pleasure to be captivated by something that I would call a modern work of art.

As the story progresses Amelie finds a box containing memory's of a man's child hood. And she secretly returns it to him, enlightening his life. Here, she devote herself to helping people. Through her adventure we meet Ramond DuFayel her painter friend who asks her about her life through his painting of a crowd, her being the faceless girl. Lucien, the slightly slow fruit salesmen who wants to be an artist and is harassed by his boss about it. And Amelie's father Raphael who she is trying to convince to get out and travel but he would rather stay home with his garden gnome. But in reality Amelie gets so caught up in helping others, that she forgets to help herself. That might sound kinda heavy hearted, but this story of adventure, ""stratagems"" and love couldn't be any more lighthearted. And in the end it just left me with a big smile, making me feel better than ever and brightening the day. The DVD is two disc's and loaded with extra's but I was to engulfed in the movie to even worry about them. Maybe not the greatest movie ever made, but proabably the most fun and most entertaining movie I've ever watched.",1077321600,5,1899,4.6047197640118

The story follows Amelie from conception to her twenty something's, filled with wild quirks and flashy fixating visuals that fix you to your seat, so much so that a passer by might think you a comatose patient, with drool and all. The drool appears as a result of the childish, lively presence of its main attraction Audrey Tautuo, who fills the main role with such charm and playfulness that it could only be described as astounding. The world this movie brings you to might not be the most realistic you've seen of this kind but it is definitely a wacky adventure of all the little things that are generally only lightly touched upon in a movie but never made it's main clause. If you're the type of person that would growl at movie's that make you go ""aaah"" then this movie is not for you, if you are not, then this is a movie that will delight you from start to finish.

The DP on this film has an encredible eye for composition, balance, and color. It's obvious they did tons of color correction and filtering, but it augments the movie rather than detracting from it or distracting the viewer.
The soundtrack is incredible and it sits in my CD-magazine in my car.",1076889600,2,393,4.7101449275362315

Too many Sundance films focus on the negative underbelly of life, but Amelie is refreshing, well-acted and brilliantly directed and filmed. It combines the positivity and sweetness of Life is Beautiful (another favorite) with the vision and style of Moulin Rouge.
This is one of the only movies that my parents and siblings (age 25-65) all enjoy. It's quirky and creative, but still accessible for anyone, even those who aren't big fans of foreign films.

This story was so sweet and charming, I don't remember any other film making me feel as good as this one did. It's hard to describe what was so good about it but I'll try. The story was enchanting, Audrey Tatou's portrayal of the shy Amelie was outstanding (by the end of the picture I was in love with her), and the film was visually impressing as well. This film might not be for everyone, but if you are the kind of person who likes interesting totally believable characters (or someone who pays attention to things like character development) and you have a heart this movie is sure to touch you. Reading this review I may sound like a sap but that is because you don't know me.

1705714,5,B0000640VO,"This is a delightful romantic fantasy of love and comedy, of vivid color and some preposterous antics of love and friendship that will send mawkish tears down your cheeks while making you laugh out loud. If not, turn in your headset for a heart.
Audrey Tautou is Amelie, a fashion-sharp Parisian waitress with an impish heart of gold and an shyness born of a bizarrely restricted childhood.  She is cute and innocent, but not too innocent.
Her father, who was a physician, thought she had a defective heart because every time he put the stethoscope to her little chest it was beating wildly.  A voice-over explains that this was caused by the excitement that Amelie felt because her frigid father, whom she wanted so much to hold her, although he never did, was actually touching her.  Because of an imagined heart condition she is kept out of school and tutored at home.
After her mother dies from being hit by a falling body (an actual human body on its way to the pavement from a tall building) we are flash-forwarded to the present where we find little Amelie all grown up.  She still has no love in her life.  But one day while listening to a news report of the death of Princess Di she drops something on the floor of her apartment.  It rolls against a tile in the bathroom, dislodging the tile.  Amelie pulls down the tile and finds in a hole in the wall a little tin box full of a boy's childhood mementoes from many years ago.  In a characteristic bit of inspiration she decides to find that little boy, now grown into middle age, and give him the box.  But she is shy and so must invent a stratagem.  She arranges to call him when he is near a public phone booth in which she has placed the box.  So delighted with the joy she has given him, Amelie sets off on a series of inventive and pixie-like intrusions into the lives of others in order to bring them happiness and even love.
While this R-rated fantasy would delight children there is too much actual sex in it for most American moms to tolerate for their little ones.  In fact in the French style sex is made innocent, and of course that will not set well with those of a prudish nature.
Favorite corny pun: ""Even artichokes have hearts.""  Favorite elaborate joke: sending her father's garden gnome on the world tour that he won't take himself, and having the gnome photographed at tourist sites and the photos sent airmail to a very perplexed dad. Favorite joke: the beggar refusing a handout saying he takes Sundays off.  Favorite scheme: reconstructing through cut and paste and photocopy the words of the landlady's beloved, and then fashioning a last love letter to her from him that was lost in the mail for forty years.
The two disc set includes a wealth of information to delight afficionados.  There's an interview with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, some footage on how Amelie was made, filmographies of cast and crew, audition footage, etc., etc.
Bottom line: very funny, heart-warming and strikingly original.",1076457600,10,2986,4.618147448015123
1705715,5,B0000640VO,"I delight in films about vulnerable people finding redemption, and this is one such film. Amelie is a fragile creature, a young woman afraid of the world, too wounded by life to love and be loved, who one day serendipitously stumbles upon a child's box of toys and trinkets that will set in motion the events that promise her salvation. She begins finding ways to help people, but only ever from a distance. When she is granted the opportunity to open herself to life and love, however, will she run away, or will she take the plunge?
Here we have a fascinating tale that celebrates the giftedness, uniqueness and specialness of every person and every moment. In an extraordinarily magical way, director Jeunet causes us to weep and laugh at the ironies of life and the blessedness of truly living it. Cinematically, this is inventive and visually entrancing. Audrey Tatou is charming as the character at the centre of Jeunet's surreal yet totally believable world.",1076112000,2,965,4.8545454545454545

This movie is in another language, but I promise you that after a few minutes, you will be so involved in the story, you will forget that you are reading while you're watching.
My favorite thing about Amelie (and there are so many things; see 750+ reviews!) is how each character is introduced with something they like and something they don't.  How true this is, that it is the little things that make up a person.
This movie is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen! - says a person who likes to see her own handwriting photocopied and does not like wide open eyeballs.",1076025600,2,733,4.462686567164179
1705717,5,B0000640VO,"The French movie starts off with a butterfly landing in the street, then getting run over. That same day, Amelie is born into this world. Beauty reformed--ironically, another word for ameliorate (Amelie--ameliorate?).
In this charming piece of award winning cinematography, Amelie is raised in a rather dysfunctional family by her parents. Her father, who likes to invest time in his miniature shrine, mourns over the loss of his wife, who was killed by a suicidal body from the sky near the doors of Notre Dame. During Amelie's skewed youth, she turns much to her imagination.
Life's simple pleasures come easy to Amelie--at least in her mind. Her newfound passion for helping others serves gratifying, yet her preference for publicity was unwanted. She plays the role of a female Zorro, helping strangers without adopting credit. She lashes her sword against an evil force whom maltreats a man's love for quality produce. Intrigued by what I mean? Watch the movie.
In time, her heart of gold crosses paths with another man, one whom seeks a mystery of his own. Amelie becomes a second mystery in the man's life by marking clues of her existence after retaining his research he had dropped while chasing his mystery entity in a certain scene. After returning his odd memoir, she leads him through her fantasy and falls in love. Both were dreamers. Both were seeking love. Both lived shadows in a seemingly different world. Still intrigued? Watch the movie.
If you are also a person who looks for the ""art"" in a movie, one can not help but notice the complexity of the cinematography to which it's most defined for amongst film critics and analysts. The use of 3 basic colors in the movie was a challenge which proved to be worth taking. Green, red, and a speck of blue was used in nearly every shot. As you will notice after watching the film, its colors and montage are bold. The use of the limited colors helped create a mystical, mesmerizing gold color in which was used in a few scenes to accentuate significant signs or emotions. The camera shots used were just as well creative and challenging, which deserves recognition as well.
This movie is not for those who are seeking action-packed drama with the high level of thrill and suspense one might expect from a highly acclaimed film. This film can be appreciated by those who enjoy the simple pleasures life has to offer. It can be appreciated by those with colorful imaginations and avid art-lovers.

That's how the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film is opened, with a quick rundown of all the things these characters love and hate and how those things define who they are.
To warn you all, this film is not for everyone. It is not the standard hollywood type of story. But if you are ready for something different and something uplifting this movie would be for you. I myself was caught off guard and loved it.",1074384000,9,722,4.519083969465649

The film then takes you on an adventure through Amelie's puzzling love life, friendships, and her random acts of kindness. The message of the movie: Don't take life's simple pleasures for granted.

1705751,5,B0000640VO,"Amlie (Le fabouleux destin d'Amlie Poulain) is the kind of film you just can't find in Hollywood. It's enchanting, magical and gorgeous, with a very endearing story, very imaginative visuals and the perfect actress in the perfect role.
Amlie (played by the lovely Audrey Tautou, `Dirty pretty things') is a young woman living by herself in Paris, working as a waitress in a caf. On the day that Princess Diana's death she finds an old toy box behind her bathroom tiles, and she decides to look for the man who used to own those toys - if he's moved by this discovery, she will dedicate her life to helping others be happier. Obviously, the man breaks into tears at the realization that his long lost, boyhood treasures return to him, so Amlie embarks in many a project to help her father, her neighbors, friends and co-workers find happiness.
However, Amlie herself is not really happy, as she has not found true love yet. She needs a man who shares her dreams and her outlook on life. Thus appears Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz, `Birthday girl', director of `Gothika' with Halle Berry and Penelope Cruz, and `The Crimsom rivers' with Jean Reno), a weird young man who collects torn photomat pictures, discarded by unsatisfied costumers. Amlie follows Nino and tries to arrange for him to meet her, in one of the most romantic cat & mouse games you'll ever see.
Director's Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ('City of lost children', 'Delicatessen')use of colors and unusual camera angles give an incredible visual styling to this movie, and enhance the magical elements of the story. Another gorgeous element of this movie is it's soundtrack. Yann Tiersen's use of the accordion gives the music much of its Parisian feel.
Nominated for five Academy Awards (although it didn't win any of them), including Cinematography, Foreign Language Film, Art Direction, Sound and Original Screenplay, Amlie is a movie you'll want to share with a loved one, and that you'll cherish for all your life.",1072051200,4,1968,4.912912912912913

Take, for instance, the snippet where Amelie encounters the man playing the record player in the subway. Look at the colors, and how even the buttons on the man's coat echoes the peas in the painting behind him. Look, too, at the colors in the concierge's apartment and in the park -- everywhere! It is a feast for the eyes!
The colors and compositions are astounding, and the acting -- right down to the most minor characters -- is superb. Yet, I found the characterization and plot somewhat empty. It's all very cute and all, with Amelie going around trying to ""fix"" up people's lives, but it drags on way too long and ultimately ends on a rather meaningless note.

It has some sexy bits (eight-second 15-orgasm scene and the porn palace), but it's not too embarrassing to show to seniors.

Maybe they missed the begining of the movie or decided that reading the subtitles was not important to understand what was happening.  Amelie's inability to confront Nino can easily be explained by her childhood and it's lack of social contact.  Simply put, this is a beautiful film full of imagination that will leave you with a smile on your face.  If you can get over the fact that you have to read subtitles for the 2 hours that this film spans then this is a must see.

1705794,5,B0000640VO,"I first noticed ""Amelie"" when going through the local DVD rental store... A woman told me that she couldn't get past the cover art of the washed- out face of Amelie to try renting the movie. The exterior art, honestly does no justice whatsoever to the gem of a disc inside (the character does not look pale like the cover photo suggests).
I get very curious about the obscure titles -- especially the foreign films -- that wind up on the shelves of the rental stores, so I write down title names and surf imdb.com (internet movie database) to learn more about titles I haven't recognized. And after reading the reviews, I decided to grab the less- than- attractive box and check out the movie.
Immediately as the root menu is accessed, some rather inviting music accompanies the animated menu. So I set up the audio (no English dub, it's French language in digital 5.1 audio) and was blown away from the moment the opening scene played.
I knew from the first scene that this had the potential of being a well- written, acted, scripted, and produced movie. And as the credits rolled at the end, I wanted to see more of Amelie, who was a wonderful and genuine character, one you wished lived in your own neighborhood. And I also believe that both women and men would really enjoy this. Most guys would fall in love with Amelie's eyes, and more women would enjoy the sensitive style of creatively showing a woman's emotions. But I get the sense that a few women may not care for Amelie's character, honestly.
The original music (no lyrics) of composer Yann Tiersen will stay in your head, even if you can't get past the subtitles. Tiersen did a fabulous job of creating a score that suits every scene it's played in. The audio is rich and expansive, and can be enjoyed with even the most basic speakers.
""Amelie"" makes me wish that I had learned French, and I envy anyone who understands the language for being able to understand the dialogue without having to read a translation. It can be a little difficult to have to watch two things at once -- subtitles and a movie -- because early on, you'll feel like you're missing the movie everytime you have to read the translation. But trust me on this, ""Amelie from Montmartre"" is a movie that you'll enjoy watching again and again. It's a rare treat to find a movie that doesn't get ""tired."" And as you watch ""Amelie"" again, you'll enjoy more of the cinematography and the lush, saturated colorful scenes.
The DVD has many different options to dive into, which is a great thing since you'll probably fall in love with ""Amelie.""

It is the kind of timeless and pure story that made Hollywood great, but that Hollywood doesn't make any more.

Aside from a handful of cynics, I can't imagine anyone who won't enjoy Amelie. But here's a test: if you, like the films main character, can take joy from life's simple pleasures (like the way your hand feels sinking into a sack of dried beans, the way street markets sound and smell, the absurdity of a horse running with the Tour de France), then this is a simple pleasure you don't want to miss.

As far as the quality and value of this film, I can't add much to the hundreds of reviews already posted here except to say ""Yes! Yes! Me too!""

An interesting side note: the more I watch the film, the more little cultural references and word plays I catch. I'm sure the film is full of them, but I think it would take a native French speaker or long-time Paris resident to catch them all (understanding them is not necessary to enjoy the film; they're a bonus).

One I caught on the most recent viewing on TV (my French is sketchy, but seeing it with Italian subtitles rather than the English helped) is a play on words by Hippolito, the failed writer in the cafe, who comments that the cafe's regulars speak about the weather out of fear of the passing time. In French, ""temps"" means both ""time"" and ""weather.""

Similarly, the grocer Collignon tells Amelie to contact his mother to discover the name of her apartment's former tennent. He says, ""Elle a une memoire d'elephant, un elephant de mer."" That translates to ""She has a memory like an elephant, a sea elephant"" -- a reference to a manatee or an seal. But the point is the way Collignon stresses ""mer"" (which means ""ocean""), which sounds the same as ""mere"" (which means ""mother"").

I also noticed that the voice over used when Amelie imagines the television retrospective of her life is from the same person who does the television commentary for the funerals of France's rich, famous, and powerful. I peaked at the credits and found that he is Frederic Mitterrand, the nephew of the late prime minister.

The last might be a stretch, but on my last trip to Paris I noticed a old-time chocolate brand called ""Poulain"", which is Amelie's family name. Maybe that's just a coincidence, but with a film as sweet as this one, assuming they come from the same source is an easy mistake to make.",1063065600,8,2564,4.4425531914893615

It is a very human story about people of ordinary means and the power of love.  It uses devices that made movies like Babe and its sequel so charming, inventive and thoughtfull, tickling the senses with its rich use of color, sound, comedy, sexuality and characterizations.  The actors all look like everyday people. Audrey Tautou is fun to watch as Amelie, and I can't help thinking that she is like a mix of Audrey Hepburn and Lucille Ball. I would pair this movie with Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, Strictly Ballroom, Run Lola Run or Don Juan de Marco.",1062979200,2,702,4.503937007874016
1705827,5,B0000640VO,"In the beautiful city of Paris, in a beautiful apartment building, in a beautiful, cozy home, lives Amelie Poulain, who enjoys the simple pleasures of life, but longs for something more, desires, in the deepest recesses of her heart, someone to love and to have as her own.
  But, instead of helping herself, she begins to help other Parisians around her, whether helping them to relive their entire childhood or just to brighten their step a little, she becomes a sort of guardian angel, working good deeds wherever she goes.
  This film is a stunning fantasy romance, a true romance, something we as film viewers have not seen in a very long time. Audrey Tautou glides from scene to scene, as one watches her one can almost imagine her floating on wings.  Her performance is virtually flawless, every inch of her character slowly being revealed, her initial facade of perfect happiness, and her deep feelings of longing uncovered by the painter, the man they say is made of glass.
  Mathieu Kassovitz, as the quirky adult video store employee, is also wonderful; awkward and curious and just as longing as amelie.
  As the film comes to a close, the viewer cannot help but feel a tingling at the edges of his or her mouth, quickly developing into a full grin, a symbol of the true happiness the film portrays.",1062806400,3,1311,4.714912280701754

Amlie is a rather strange movie, but it's hilarious, dazzling, and ultimately one of the most charming films I've ever seen. You may be a little confused by the film as your eyes are glued to the subtitles, but the images really describe the movie so if you get a chance, look up!
Amlie Poulain is portrayed by the adorable French actress Audrey Tautou. Other things to look for in Amlie include the film's bright script, lush cinematography, and funny special effects showing pictures and sculptures coming to life.
Amlie is a great feel-good film which you will want to watch again and again and again. I would recommend this film to absolutely anyone, especially a movie buff. This is by far one of the 5 best films of 2001!",1060732800,3,948,4.517441860465116

1705847,5,B0000640VO,"Even if, having read the previous reviews, you are expecting something smarter and funnier than your average inane RC, you still shouldn't focus on either the romance or the comedy. Because, to my mind at least, they are not the most important sides of the story. Rather, the love-and-happiness quality of the film stems from a certain very serious philosophical attitude, exemplified most obviously by the Tour De France scenes, when past and present come together.
To repeat,  Amelie he Movie does not try to be ""heartwarming."" It only HAPPENS to have that effect on those without an understanding of Amelie the Character's unique vision. (By the way, the ""heart"" root figures too often in the preceding reviews, as though the film's theme and goal is to show us How We Can All Be Nice To Each Other and flood the audience with sweet joy. It's NOT.)
Again, don't make the mistake of taking this for a just-about ""family"" movie. It's not light-weighed, it's trim like an athelete's perfected body. Instead, watch it carefully. The hints are all here. Notice the depth of difference between Amelie and her mostly likeable but ordinary acquaintances. Take note how she stands out against this background, invisibly playing with it, usually kindly, sometimes vengefully, all the while keeping a low profile.
Of course, to the casual viewer Amelie seems a wonderful, quirky, shy person basically not very different from everyone else. Ho. Right, wouldn't YOU like to believe yourself to be as free-spirited and deeply empathic, wouldn't YOU like to think that you, too, possess the same kind of instant intuitive insight, that you feel and understand life with the same acuteness? More important (this isn't about insulting you personally, dear reader, but about prying your eyes open) wouldn't you like to think that ALL people are like Amelie on some level, and that if only we could pay more attention to each other, life would change dramatically?
Well, forget all that. As we all MUST admit in moments of honesty, the great majority of people, and France is no exception, are not nice, or sweet, or imaginative. The average person anywhere is usually quite dull, stressed-out and self-concerned - whatever better directions his life might have taken in different circumstances. It's been mentioned that Paris of ""Amelie"" is not the real city with its problems. Well, of course it's not, and people in the movie are not ""real"" either - to anyone except Amelie and her friend/lover/comrade. They are creatures of a sharply different kind. In fact, the tinge of golden and pink that gives the cinematography here its special charm is an attempt to introduce the viewer to this special vision!
This is to say, we see the whole movie as though THROUGH THE EYES of Amelie. If it weren't so, the people around her would seem perfectly ordinary to you, dear reader. She, for her part, does not care for a whole cluster of concepts mundanes have, e.g. ""reality,"" ""living within one's imaginings"" etc. Which is why the film is unafraid to use special effects even in its Monmartre scenes. It's no surprise, then, that the ""realistic"" ending with leaping into the sack seems not just disappointing, but also somehow unlikely. Having watched the movie, anyone begins to suspect that Amelie's life would be doomed to a (at least inwardly) dramatic and adventurous course.
In short, she is incredibly gifted to only partially belong to this dreary world, and equally gifted, not to mention lucky, to meet someone else of her kind. Of course, a psychiatrist deprived of their vision would think them both slightly deluded, and nearly EVERY person to have written a review on this site, too, is comfortably convinced of the same, even if it doesn't feel important. ""Fantasy,"" ""sweet,"" ""fairy-tale"" - those are keywords betraying just how remote most of the commentators are from understanding this movie (even if some of them words zero in on the truth in an uncanny way). The reason is, to understand something so personally-colored, it is necessary to either have had similar experiences or at least seriously CONSIDER the movie's message. ""Amelie"" is a rare example of ""Air from other planets,"" of true art in popular entertainment, but if you refuse to put away your customary ides about what is real and so forth, all you will see on this DVD is a pretty, funny romantic flick.

1705848,2,B0000640VO,"It's surprising that a film like this could fool a large number of people into thinking it adds up to a charming love story.  I hate to say it, but this is not a love story at all.  Amelie isn't even a story, it's an exercise.  The main difference between the two comes with flow and the editing doesn't allow that to foster a good story.  The closest the director gets to telling a story in this movie is in the very beginning where Amelie is introduced and her dilemma is presented.  The rest of the movie is about her solving this dilemma, but here is where the problem with the movie lies.  The rest of the movie feels too processed and disconnected from the true moment of feeling that the characters are going through.  Many times it feels as if the last 3/4 of the movie is simply filled with tiny bits and pieces of ideas that the director thought would be interesting enough.  I don't believe that they are because the beginning prepared me for an odd love story although, I should've known that the plot would be constantly detoured in the beginning when the narrator reveals the ponderous questions that Amelie was wondering while on top of the building. Nonetheless, my lack of foresight doesn't make this film's  lack of cohesion go away.  Add to that the fact that the movie has a constantly strange production quality that permeates the film and allows us to know that strange things will happen instead of just letting the story be strange and surprising us with an interesting moment. The knocks I have about the production don't just affect the story, they sideline it by making it seem like the movie is simply about daft craftmanship rather than the tale at hand.  I don't mind high style  cinematography, especially by this director because I love his previous film ""The City of Lost Children."" That film had a strong story driving it's craftiness, this one doesn't. I only give it two stars because I recognize hard work on the visuals and I found some of the material humorous and/or dramatically effective, but this is an inferior film, story-wise to the aforementioned film and isn't really a romantic comedy because it's really hard to get past the directors reliance on technical proficiency over plot. It struck me that the film had a good story idea and not enough development to get through.",1060128000,19,2321,4.634146341463414
1705849,3,B0000640VO,"Amelie is an extraordinary film, and this makes the ordinariness of its conclusion profoundly unsatisfying.  Throughout the movie (known as Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain in its country of origin, France) the characters are presented as delightfully quirky - Amelie enjoys running her hands through sackfuls of grain; her father likes lining up his shoes and polishing them; Nino keeps an album of photos discarded by their owners - so the ending, where Amelie and Nino leap into bed together, just as would happen in any other movie, is a huge letdown.
The premise is simple: one day Amelie Poulain finds a small box of 'treasures', which would appear to have been hidden by a small boy 40 years ago.  She decides to return the box to its owner, and if he is appreciative she will continue in her quest to help those around her.
One of the strengths of the film is that - much like real life - nobody is 'normal'.  As well as being introduced to characters, we are also shown their idiosyncrasies and history. However, Amelie's running time of over two hours feels too long and one gets the impression that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has attempted to fit too much into what is a light-weight movie.
It is also very funny in places, notably when Amelie takes revenge on an intolerant neighbour.  It is interesting how we can, after an interval of five years, look back on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and recall with a wry smile how completely it consumed our attention at the time.  Overall this is a charming and whimsical film (even if at times it is a little too aware of its quaintness), and certainly deserving of a more fitting finale.",1059177600,5,1657,4.660958904109589
1705850,5,B0000640VO,"I was so pleased with this movie! It tugged at my heartstrings the way fables and fairy-tales do. Indeed, the glorious cinematography kept an illustrative hue to the entire film.
First things first, Audrey Tautou delivers a charming performance... she is much too-often compared with Audrey Hepburn, another small-faced gamine, but her aura is decidedly different. Where Hepburn was cool and chic, Tautou is childlike and imaginative. The film focuses a good deal on the colorful workings of her imagination and the fantasies it weaves.
The tone of the film perfectly followed with Tautou's exuberant performance: the colors are sparkling and vivid, the scenery is slightly dream-like, the shots are appropriately quirky and surprising. This is not the real Paris, this is a memory of Paris.
The narration and set-up of the films delightful cast of characters is very similar to The Royal Tennenbaums. I'm sorry to invoke a comparision here, but it is so striking that I have to say it. The narration is the kind you would find in a children's tale, and the characters are introduced by their likes and dislikes. Amelie approaches life with a wide-open fresh view that sees everything for the first time and the smallest of things are of the biggest importance.
Amelie spends the whole film trying to bring happiness into others lives in imaginative ways. Ultimately, she must do the same for herself. The film's message is an uplifting one of innocence and optimism. Fairy-tale like, destiny always seems to take a large hand, and The Glass Man is the fairy godmother (father?) of the film, finally bestowing upon Amelie the courage to seek out happiness for herself.
Viewers will find this lovely fable easy to relate to, as Amelie is such a fresh and unique character. We all have a bit of her spirit in us as well as her shyness to face happiness head-on.
There are lots of great minor performances in this which add greatly to the local color. Amelie's knuckle-cracking coworker and her paranoid boyfriend who stalks her at work and makes notes of her every move into a portable tape recorder... The sad concierge at Amelie's apartment who loves and hates her dead cheating husband... Amelie's cold, serious father who longs to travel but never will... All these characters are magically helped by Amelie who seeks to breathe new life into their simple lives.
This film will do the same for you. It is a joyful little modern fairy-story of chasing down true love when you find it.",1058659200,9,2485,4.890995260663507
1705851,1,B0000640VO,"Amelie starts auspiciously because of it's unique story telling and direction.  The movie is interactive between real life and Amelie (main character) imagination.  This later expands to the ""prince"" in the movie.  I can appreciate it for this, but those looking for a feel good romantic comedy will not find it here!!  Plan on spending most of the movie confused.  Amelie decides to help strangers because of her disfunctional way of relating to people personally.  Amelie's progress is obviously, and condescendingly, paralleled by the painting of her equally eccentric and strange neighbor.  In fact there isn't a normal person in this movie: perhaps a feature that makes the ""cute"" to most.
The main point of the movie is that Amelie, as odd as she is, can find someone equally odd.  Unfortunately the disfunctionality of both 'lovers,' while starting as a cute crush and creative chase, ends as frustratingly after several failed attempts to simply say hello.
In short Amelie's disfunctional nature, and the movies obvious existential overtones,  are overstressed to the point that I want to[get sick].",1058486400,16,1107,5.209039548022599

The charming direction and cinematography add to the bitingly funny story of a young woman struggling to reconcile her rich fantasy life with reality, her quest for romance, and the desire to create a beautiful world for those around her.

I thought the actress who played Amelie was a little creepy, but perfect for the role.  The plot was fresh and hysterically funny, and one of the best things about this movie is that it doesn't try too hard. The humor and romance (and sorrow) are all served up so naturally that you barely have time to catch your breath and wipe your eyes before something else is making you crack up. This movie was truly heartwarming, especially the incident with the spinster widow downstairs, whose husband left her.

The heroine is the 23 year-old lonely cafe waitress who is more at home with her vivid imagination, cultivated over the years to make up for her lack of friends,and stratagems than with people around her. Her good works whether they work(such as the little box of trinkets that starts it all) or whether they flop(like her little matchmaking scheme), they always manage to enchant. Her most amazing stratagem in the whole movie is however the one that could keep her from obtaining the happiness that she has given to others, no matter how briefly. The acting is superb.

1705879,5,B0000640VO,"...But this delightfull French film totally turned me around on the possiblities of the romantic comedy genre.
The story of Amelie concerns the title character as she sets out to bring happiness to those around her by very subtle and inventive means rather than trying to repair her own solitary life. The film is surprising and creative from start to finish, so I won't spoil the rest of the story as when I first saw the film I had no idea what to expect and don't want to ruin that first time veiwing experience for anyone else. You just don't know what to expect from one scene to the next in this film, as opposed to Hollywood romantic comedies where the stories are cliched and predictable.
Besides the genuinely refreshing originality of Amelie, the film contains an amazing visual style which blends cgi effects into the picture flawlessly and with much great effect and purpose than any of the big budget Hollywood flicks. The music is also great with a main theme which has that really French feel about it. Audrey Tautou is amazing in this film as well, she makes Amelie beleivable and endears her character to the audience in every screen moment. Subtitles work great with this film too as even though I can only speak some basic phrases in French, Audrey Tautou gives Amelie an charming soft impish type voice that would be lost if it was dubbed and but can still be appreciated by anyone who doesn't speak the language. People who refuse to watch subtitled films are losers anway.
...P>The only negative thing I could say about Amelie is that theres a real danger that the geniuses in Hollywood might try to remake it much the same way they remade the brilliant and highly origingal Japanse horror masterpiece 'Ringu' into the silly shallow 'Ring'.

This is the sort of movie that you will find many valuable quotes in,- they are characters who speak as if in a book. It was delightful, and I love how it was made, it was new and fresh. I liked the close ups and the music and I liked that brief segment where Amelie, on a thrill of harmony and goodwill after hearing Dominique Bredoteau's reaction to the finding of his childhood box in a bar, directs a blind man down a block and gives him eyes for a moment, in describing the delicious world to him.
This is not the first foreign film I have seen. I have also seen Antonia's Line, and Burnt by the Sun, and I love all of these movies. Amelie is a very, very good movie. It's divine and lovely and you should watch it, and if you already have,- wasn't it wonderful?",1056844800,3,885,4.242603550295858

1705884,5,B0000640VO,"Much crtiticism has been aimed at Jean-Pierre Jeunet for the way that he has ""tarted up"" Paris and in particular, Montmatre for this story of a day-dreaming do-gooder who cannot find her own true love (if Austen's Emma has been born a century later across the English Channel she might well be Amelie). But surely that is the point of cinema - in some part, we wish to escape the reality and drudgery of life for a couple of hours in which we can have our fantasies played out on screen. I must admit, that had I seen the Montmatre of the movie when I visited Paris in the mid-90's I might never have left.
Much of the charm of this movie comes from a star-making turn by newcomer, Audrey Tatou - her dark eyes are deep wells into which this viewer would love to jump and her cheeky grin is infectious - you find yourself giving off the same grin as you watch her commit her samaritan acts or in the case of the tyrannical grocer, Collignon, bring him down a rung ot two. Of course Tatou is greatly supported by the enfant terrible of French cinema, Mathieu Kassovitz, a world away from his character in La Haine, and inhabiting the role of romantic leading man with great aplomb. Jeunet regular, Dominique Pinon and Yolande Moreau as the weeping widow/concierge add deft touches of humour to a uniformly excellent supporting cast.
The look of the film is also its biggest drawcard - from the bright greens of the Metro to the fiery reds of the Porn Emporium where Nino works, the film is bathed in a glorious light and dazzles with each viewing. Jeunet came back to France after the traumatic experience of filming Alien Resurrection and with this film he shows that he can count himself amongst the great cinematic artists (along with Baz Luhrmann and Todd Haynes) working today.",1055548800,2,1781,4.53416149068323

I am not apart of this silly, brainless anti-France kick. This film was a reminder that the best American films of which I have enjoyed were in a similar vein of being anti-linear and woven into a complex thread of scenes and events.

1705909,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is a weird, yet brilliant, combination of a child's fairy tale and early films by Jean-Luc Godard.  Maybe the plot isn't something Godard would approve of, or at least make (it's sappy and deals a lot with fantastic notions of fate).  But the playful nature in which Amelie deconstructs the components of cinema, is pure Godard.  The editing, use of sound, screen composition, all very playful, very critical, very calculated and perfect.
And for someone that cringes at the thought of a sappy love story (Godard's Breathless is more to my liking as a love story), Amelie left me with a ear to ear grimace for hours after leaving the theater (each of the FOUR times I saw this).  In an age that movies don't seem to touch new ground, everything seems so bland, nothing has been as fresh as the early French New Wave, until Amelie...",1053388800,3,839,4.648648648648648

The Characters of Amelie and her true love were both figures I can relate to... being someone who frequently inhabbits the border between reality and imagination.  Some people complain about the way the film plays out... the predictability of it all... how it seems to drag forever until they finally hook up... these were grievences I had when i first started watching this movie... but I found that now I care not.
THe visions in this movie are amazing.  In the series of narrtives we get about Amelie's childhood are expecially funny, as are all the things she imagines.  I especially liked the insights that you got into characters lives.  Some of them were small and odd (like someone who only likes popping bubble wrapp) but made sense in a weird kind of way.
Another comment frequently made is how unrealistic the portrayel of Paris is... my reponse... It's not supposed to be realistic... little is... the Main Character's world view is skewed by her nature.  Both her and the Male lead character saw the world through rose tinted lenses, and this is what we are shown.
Also of note is the score/soundtrack of the film which also plays an important role in creating the overall sense of feeling and emotion.

Amelie is a young French waitress who tries to secretly improve the lives of others (through all kinds of kooky schemes), but her own love life is nonexistent.  Until she encounters a young man with a strange obsession for collecting discarded photos from photo booths.

This fun movie also helped me to brush up on my French language skills, even though, I cheated and used the English sub-titles offered on the DVD.

1705942,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is a beautiful movie to watch, for starters.  It has vibrant colors, shapes, and tons of flashbacks and quirky moments.  This isn't a movie that's meant to look realistic.  It's like a painting, meant to extract emotion and feeling.  In this case, it works quite well.  As many say, this is indeed a very charming film.
The story is simple and sweet.  A young woman, who has lived in solitude but still has the ability to smile as she observes life discovers something extraodinary; a little box of treasures that belonged to the person who last lived in her appartment.  It is decades old and filled with memories.  She makes a decision to find the owner of the box.  If he is touched by this act and finds joy in his memories being returned to him, she would continue to help people and make their lives better.  He is touched, and the story takes off from there.  But there is one last question the movie asks us to consider.  Is Amelie herself happy?  She creates complicated ways of helping people, but they never meet her.  Is she really lonely and looking to improve her life as well?
The DVD quality is great.  Watching this movie really draws you into another world, and of course plenty of credit must go to the clear and eye pleasing quality that comes with this movie.  The extras are quite nice as well, with a collection of posters, an interview with the director, and an explanation on the unique cinematography of the the film.  Also, there seem to be issues over why the movie is rated R.  Simple.  It has scenes that depict [explicits].  All in all, these are fairly innocent and I'd recommend the film for anyone fifteen and up.  With no violence and cursing, there's little to find offensive.",1050624000,9,1719,4.534201954397394

There's nothing too original about this film (French New Wave is an obvious influence), but it melds a bundle of different ideas  into a perfect mixture.  I really recommend this to everyone.

1705946,5,B0000640VO,"This is my second-favorite French movie after Le Grand Chemin. The French language was a little fast, so thank goodness for the subtitles. Pair that with closed captioning, and nothing was missed. The scene with the couple in the bathroom is HILARIOUS.
As you might expect, the French expect you to watch this with a grown-up sensibility; meaning they have what I consider a healthy view of sex. At any rate, it comes up a lot in this movie. Ah bon! The real title is the Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain. If you have more than a little high school French you figure that out.
The actresses who play Amelie are adorable, both the six-year-old, and the 22-year-old! The older one is especially engaging, with her big eyes and cute haircut, but I gotta ask, do all young French women dress like Olive Oyl?? Amelie has an odd sense of fashion, for sure.
Anyway, this movie gave me a really good laugh. Unfortunately, they wouldn't show it in Puritan Oklahoma City, but I'm happy to see it many, many times at home on my VCR. I recommend it highly!

After watching Amelie, I doubt I'll view new character introductions quite the same.
Keep in mind that this is a French movie with English subtitles so you'll have to pay attention to the movie if you want to follow what's going on.
I would definitely watch this one again. There were subtleties that I probably missed while reading the subtitles. Besides, it's a good, funny story that's well done.

First of all, if you're not fluent in French, you're obliged to read subtitles.  I generally avoid films with subtitles.  Let's face it, when we watch a movie we want to do just that, watch it.  However, watching AMELIE was sheer joy.  It was like being absorbed in a painting by a master who uses vibrant colors on her canvas.  It was like hearing a story by someone whose voice is so mesmerizing you literally hang on every word.  I loved the simplicity of the story, the passion of the actors, the beginning, the middle, and the end of it!  It took me more than a year to finally see it.

1705949,5,B0000640VO,"This quirky film won me over from its first moments showing the childhood of Amelie, an imaginative girl born of emotionally stunted parents. From her suicidal goldfish to her belief that her camera causes accidents to her sullen (and hilarious) revenge against her father, Amelie's childhood perfectly describes the rest of the film: both poignantly real and humorously surreal. As an adult, Amelie (Audrey Tautou) retains her impish nature while living in a circumscribed world. She works as a waitress in a caf, lives alone in her Parisian flat, and spies on her neighbors. When she discovers by accident a small box hidden behind the tile of her bathroom, Amelie sets out to return it to its rightful owner. Because of the effect this return has, Amelie sets out to do good deeds aimed to change the lives of other people, ignoring the reality that her own life is desperately in need of love.
The plot by itself cannot adequately define this film. The wry voiceovers create a tone of humorous levity, and the cast of off-beat characters lend the feel of a small circus. Warmth and charm and wit abound. The remarkable performance of Audrey Tautou - honest and nuanced - brings the entire film into focus.
I waited far too long to see this film. I highly recommend it for a wide audience, from foreign film buffs to romantic comedy devotees to those looking for a funny, upbeat film to liven up the evening.",1049587200,10,1411,4.739837398373984
1705950,5,B0000640VO,"The opening of this movie was a little bizzar, but it certainly got my attention. The characters in the movie are introduced by the narrator, who includes the odd things they do for a simple perk (ie: Amelie likes to dip her hand into a sack of beans at the market). Plus, I've never actually seen (or wanted to see) a baby popping out of its mother. That was a little bit of a shock.
As I'm sure you've heard, Amelie is about a waitress that makes it her duty to help people without their knowledge. She's very introverted, which started because her father, a doctor, believed she had a heart problem and kept her home-schooled. Instead of meeting and talking to people, she kind of observes them from the background when she can.
The first good deed she did was an accident. She discovers a box hidden behind a lose tile in her bathroom, and feels the need to return it, which begins the search for its owner. This leads to another thing, and another, and Amelie begins to get ideas and inspirations from everything around her. Her daydreams tend to be funny and oddly real (as in, the part most Americans keep tucked away for fear it will make them look idiotic), and her imagination is great.
The settings and acting in this were fabulous as far as I understood, and the story was the type that leaves you oddly happy. When it was over, the only thing I was able to do was gush out, ""Wow,"" to nobody in particular.",1049500800,4,1418,4.395437262357414

The casting is, in my opinion, absolutely flawless; the script is incredibly intricate and intelligent; I still find no fault in the editing; and for the entire duration of the film, I find myself laughing out loud, feeling as if I am truly back in Paris, living in Amelie's world...
...it doesn't carry the emotional rush of Braveheart or Amistad (for me, at least), but I think this filmy certainly provides a light-heartedness that is very necessary in all of our lives. It's truly a feel-good story, and it definitely succeeds in being such.  I watch it over and over and am entertained every time.
The DVD also actually has good features, something that can be surpirsingly lacking on some DVDs; I particularly enjoyed seeing the audition of Ms. Tautou, found the interviews to be decently informative, and (as an amateur photographer) was quite interested in the explanation of the brilliant colour schemes.

1705967,5,B0000640VO,"....P>I saw Amelie first in the theater, but my real appreciation is for the DVD.  The transfer to DVD is almost legendary, it is done so well.  It helps to start with the magical direction of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who oversaw impeccable camerawork and a script loaded with charm into the film you will see on the DVD.  It was obviously a labor of love, and Jeunet worked nearly as hard on the special features that accompany the film on the 2-disc set.  The audition tapes, the story of the ""home movies"" within the film and the chats with Jeunet and the cast are all captivating.
Jeunet successfully uses voiceover as a tool in the film, allowing the viewer to quickly react to the situations encountered by both child and adult Amelie.  He's artistically clever with his music, with flashbacks, and with dream sequence to give you a series of interconnecting events, all leading up to the theme of redemption and the enjoyment of life through the joy you give to others.  In particular, the use of photos, the booby traps for a local grocer with a nasty temper, and the delightful traveling garden gnome are creative and funny.
There would be no story without Audrey Tatou, the whimsical actress who embodies Amelie.  Audrey Hepburn at a young age, she is incredibly charming and quirky.  It will be interesting to see if her career takes her beyond this, a signature role.

Amelie is an introspective, thoughtful young woman who is inspired one day to help improve the lives of those around her. Before you start to think this is some schlocky, maudlin film about doing good deeds let me set the record straight. The things that Amelie does to improve her friends' lives are far from normal. Whether she's sending her father's garden gnome on a trip across the world or hypothesizing about a man in a strange set of photographs Amelie's mind is always delightfully at work. She lives in a dream world and an enchanting world it is.
In addition to the vivid and original storyline the film also has a signature visual style. This was my first time viewing a film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but it will certainly not be my last. The colors jump wildly off the screen and the cinematography is breathtaking. I can't wait to watch the film without the subtitles and simply take in the visual artistry of it.

And it isn't -- it's a sweet, whimsical, weird, and touching little tale about a shy young woman with a big heart. She's nobody's little weasel... yet! But as the movie progresses, you'll rapidly want to see her become somebody's little weasel.
Amelie (Audrey Tatou) is a shy, introspective young woman with a vivid imagination and a quirky sense of humor. One day she accidently finds a little box of toys and photographs, and goes on a little quest to find the owner, decades later, and give him back his box. When the return of the box improves the man's life, Amelie is so pleased that she decides to keep helping others be happy in their own lives.
She gives a brittle-boned, reclusive old artist videos of pleasant things. She booby-traps a nasty grocer's apartment because of the way he treats a sweet, slow young man preoccupied by the late Princess Di. She directs a jealous man to a hypochondriac tobacconist in the hopes of making them both happy, sends her lonely father's garden gnome around the world (her father is still grieving for Amelie's mother, who was killed by a suicidal Canadian tourist leaping off a cathedral), and her landlady who still grieves for her late, unfaithful husband. But then Amelie encounters a dreamy young man, Nino, and finds a collection of photographs that he has collected. Will Amelie be able to do for herself what she has done for others -- and fall in love?
It certainly says something about ""Amelie"" that all the copies were virtually unavailable in my area for the longest time. It's a very sweet, cute, romantic film with a lot of nice visual tricks and likeable characters. If you don't like movies where people can fall in love at first sight, paintings talk, goldfish commit suicide and statues wink, then you won't like this -- one of the best moments is when a quartet of photographs tell Nino that he has fallen in love with Amelie ""in your dreams."" (It takes a lot to make me melt, but that did it) And it's very rare that in movies, people do nice things just for the sake of it. One of my favorite scenes is Amelie guiding a blind man down the street, rapidly describing the things around them.
And the little visual tricks, while they aren't totally necessary, are a nice touch to the movie -- Amelie being so unhappy that she turns into a puddle of water, her heart speeding up as she makes eye contact with Nino, and watching news reports about her life on the TV. Romantic moments abound -- a scene where Amelie and Nino hesitantly kiss parts of each other's faces is exquisite. And it's funny too, from the suicidal goldfish to the travelling garden gnome to the grocer's booby-trapped apartment, especially the speed dial that calls a psychiatric ward.
Audrey Tatou is wonderful as Amelie, managing to be mischievous and innocent, sweet and sad. Matthieu Kassovitz is vastly underrated as Nino Quincampoix, a dreamy young man who works at an adult video store with a gyrating stripper (yes, it's an odd place for Amelie's soulmate to work, but just watch!). Serge Merlin is good as the likeable, gruff, grumpy Dufayel, Rufus is poignant as Amelie's withdrawn dad, and all the supporting actors weave together in a complex plot that centers on... Amelie.
Like Amelie herself, ""Amelie"" is sweet and cute and funny and likeable, quirky and romantic. If you have even an ounce of romance in your soul, then sit back and visit ""Amelie"" in Paris in the springtime.",1047859200,17,3566,4.688995215311005

The screen tests and outtakes of Audrey Tautou (Amelie) are so absorbing that you feel the thrill the director must have felt when he finally found his perfect Amelie.

1706001,5,B0000640VO,"Jean Pierre Jounet (City Of Lost Children) has directed and produced a superb French foreign film, one of the many that impressed audiences last year. Audrey Tautou portrays the selfless, vibrant heroine Amelie. Audrey Tautou somewhat resemebles Audrey Hepburn- her slim, girlish figure is perfectly toned, and the scenes in which she walks down the streets of Paris and in and out of cafes is very reminiscent of the late 50's actress. Jounet's film is an artistic arrangement of cinema and a small plotline. Many people have failed to truly see the magic of this film. It is not a ""chick flick"", an ""artsy foreign film"" (although it can easily become that), it is a stunning film that's worth watching and enjoyed like an art museum.
Amelie is the only daughter of an aging father, working as a waitress at a Paris restaurant. She awakens to her powers and begins to charitably assist other people and bring happiness to their lives. She is no longer merely a human girl, but part sprite, and the magic surrealism in the film is a lot like a Bunuel movie or Salvador Dali painting. The score to the film can hardly be labeled minimalism, but at times the repetitive French accordion waltzes remind one of minimalism. It is highly entertaining music, perfectly atmospheric of romance and the elegance of Paris.
Personally, I was disappointed that during the Oscars last year, Amelie did not get the Best Foreign Film award (the award went to the Mexican film ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"". Amelie rightly deserves recognition. It is a striking, beautiful film with a magnetic performance by Audrey Tautou, and cinematic magic by director Jean Pierre Jounet. If he comes up with more films like this, I will be sure to watch and perhaps this time around, audiences will be more appreciative.",1046390400,4,1781,4.823529411764706

""Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain"" is one of those movies that can make you laugh, feel good and reflect about how many little and seemingly unimportant things can change your life or at least the way you see it. This is such an uplifting and heartwarming piece of art that it makes you want to get out of your appartment and go talk to your next door neighbour whom you've never said hello to.

Luckily enough, the director has no pretention for his movie to be very deep; it's about redemption, about trying to find a reason to live and enjoy your life, even when it doesn't appear to make sense to you.  Although it tends to flag a little towards the end, despite a somewhat sensory overload and the fact that there's whimsy to be had just about everywhere (hey, it's a french movie!), the voiceover brilliantly summarizing most of Amlie's life, the giddy accordion strains, the beautiful colors, the rare but breathtaking landscapes of the whimsy magic town, the fabulous performance offered by Audrey Tautou make of Amlie a wonderful film.",1046044800,3,1264,4.563876651982379

Amelie is hands down the cutest character any movie has ever had, and also one of the most interesting. More so, the character is so wonderfully played by Audrey Tautou.
To show you somewhat how much I loved this movie, I've started learning French again just so I can enjoy this movie without the subtitles. Of course, I hope to use it for so much more (travel, other films, etc), but this movie was what spurred me to finally study it again.

Her family life is so bad even her pet goldfish has suicidal tendencies. But Amelie finds herself finally freed from these burdens when her mother commits suicide.
Flash forward five years later to late 1997 and Amelie is working as a waitress. However hearing the news of Princess Diana's death changes her life forever and she decides to devote herself to being a self appointed guardian angel, subtly changing people's lives for the better (or worse) without their knowledge. But despite these noble (Yet somehow, below the surface; megalomaniacal) efforts, Amelie remains living in her dream world. Can she find the love and happiness for herself that she so passionately seeks for others?
AMELIE is sometimes pretentious, but mostly a very unique and charming fable which effortlessly mixes fantasy and whimsy, with a wonderful lead performance from Tatou. Directed by Jean Pierre Jeunet, best known for DELICATESSEN and ALIEN RESURRECTION. This is well worth your time. I avoided renting AMELIE for ages because the cover and concept screamed ARTHOUSE CHICK FLICK, but thankfully the movie is far from it. Normally I'd hate this type of movie, but AMELIE is different.

  I have been a fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet since ""Delicatessen"", but when I first received wind of ""Amelie"" I had no idea that it was Jeunet's work until I finally rented it.  ""Amelie"" is by far his greatest, most beautiful, and least fantastic masterpiece.  Wrought with his trademark vivid green, red, and blue shades of film color, the movie flows along a nostalgic dreamland in a would-be (or could-be) Paris.  Chance. Fate.  Ah Amour!  It was chance that Jeunet even found the script for this movie (you will find this out from one of the fantastic extras on this DVD).  The enchanting Audrey Tautou was not the original choice for lead actress and had to go through a screen test, but without her would there exist an Amelie at all?!
Whether or not you enjoy romance, a good mystery, or just good movies you will thoroughly enjoy this one.
This is an excellent movie...if you don't mind subtitles (for all of us non-French speakers)!

  ""Amelie"" was my introduction to Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Having now seen this film as well City of Lost Children, I can only say that I hold him in only slightly less regard than God. ""Creative Genius"" is a term all too bandied about in reviewland, yet it applies in this instance. I can't say that Amelie ""changed my life,"" but it definitely gave me a fresh perspective.
  One of the characteristics I've noticed in the two Jeunet films I've watched, involves his use of interconnecting threads in an otherwise juxtaposed or fractured story line. This is not exactly a unique technique in recent cinema. Paul Thomas Anderson used it quite effectively in ""Magnolia."" Likewise David Lynch in ""Mullholand Drive,"" for just two examples. Jeunet surpasses all of them, however, in terms of playfulness and sheer directorial instinct. It owes also to a sensibility in French cinema that hearkens back most directly to the Jaques Tati era.
  The artistic marriage of such an artfully clever director with an actress (Audrey Tautou) seemingly born to play a role can best be chalked up to kismet, synchroneity, harmonic convergence, whatever. I'm just glad they got together, for they make for an irresistable combo.
  Highest marks for camera work, script, direction, acting, DVD transfer. This is the whole package. Don't let anything put you off from securing this grand-slam of a film. For something ""completely different,"" also check out ""City of Lost Children."" I can't wait for ""Delicatessan"" to be released to DVD.

The basis of the story was simple & straight-forward, that they were many lost souls that needed to be saved, & one day, Amelie decided that she would be THAT saviour.  The movie explained to us Amelie's deprived happy childhood & as she grew up, she was a bit of an introvert & she had difficulty in fitting in.  By doing those charitable deeds, Amelie redeemed herself & she felt a sense of rejuvenation.  Deep down, though, she's still a lonely soul herself.  As the saying goes, what goes around comes around.  Those that she helped, they decided to help her in return & they reminded her about the necessity of taking a risk to change her life for the better.  In other words, she's entitled to be happy just as much as they do, & the ending doesn't disappoint.  The two hours spent is probably THE most wonderful two hours I spent this year.

  What makes it different is the point of view from the main character, Amelie. Being that she is a timid girl with an enormous imagination, the story tastefully draws off her charming creativity and how she uses it to meddle in the lives of those around her. And as any charming movie does, what goes around comes around.
  The acting is superb, the story is clever, and the filmwork is masterful. Even an illiterate person would have fun watching this film. I think maybe the best word to discribe this movie is classic.

Audrey Tautou plays the adorable Amelie, a young woman with a mission to help make good people happy and punish the bad with mischeviously clever tricks.
This is a charming movie, very well played by the entire cast of actors.

Capturing the energy, vitality and spriteliness of an enchanting young lady, the movie flies through a determined search for a fellow who just might be... well... the love of her life. But how does she know for sure? And how does she communicate this? In her own wonderfully quirky way, that's how.
The movie is surprising, and uses an interesting method to push the plot along. You really do have to see it, but the use of imagery, photos, and artistic games lures both of these characters to one another. The test is in whether the fellow will understand her manner, and she's convinced of it because she thinks that she understands his obsession with getting passport photos from booths all over subway stations.
The movie is playful in such a charming way. Sold from beginning to end. The result is a feeling of warmth, and a smile is just bound to creep all over your face.",1044403200,4,910,4.588957055214724
1706050,5,B0000640VO,"I see there are many many reviews for this film, and Ive only seen it once but I was totally blown away by it, and I would urge anyone and everyone to give this movie a try. Subtitles can ..., I know, but this movie is so good it makes up for them. I hope I don't reveal too much of the film with this review, either, so if you haven't watched it, why are you reading this, go and get it!
For those still reading, the first thing I noticed was the interesting cinematography, from the sped up shot of Amelie's mother's gestation (which was odd but cool), and the shots of our heroine's Montmarte (I think) environment. The film presents interesting camera angles, which work well with the suspense element, as well as showing the conflicting emotions presented throughout the film. Amelie's world is made up of vibrant colors, which fit snugly with her bubbly personality, and provide a nice contrast when she dresses in dark colors and since she has dark hair. Speaking of Amelie...
Audrey Tautou, never heard of her before, but I instantly fell in love with her after watching this film. The writers and directors did an excellent job of creating her character, with her heart melting shyness, intruging alone time, and her elaborate strategies, but I think the actress stole the show hands down. She did a flawless job of portraying her character, has that sweet little girl voice, and is so cute (pranking the phone repair people, in the theater, returning the book to the porn shop, the list goes on...) that I cant help myself. The other characters were definitely secondary, as many seemed one dimensional even though they had different emotions, but they are all well acted and each have their own unique placement in Amelie's life and times.
This movie had an uncanny ability to totally draw me in. I missed I think 2 phone calls while watching it, and totally lost track of time. I was cheering for Amelie during her two excursions, and vocalized my angst and sorrow when they didn't work out, much to the bewilderment of my family, who was home at the same time but not watching the film. With that said, you can probably imagine my reaction at the end.
I would rank this movie somewhere in my top 10 of all time, and it's the first real 'feel good' movie that really made me feel good for more than an hour after its conclusion. Everyone at my school and my work has been told to watch it, and now I am telling you to, as well. It's lovely, a truly astonishing piece of film.

I have to say, though, that I was very impressed, not only by the great direction by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but also by every single one of the actors and actresses. Everything in the movie is set up to be almost dream-like, from the small ""microcosm"" of the neighborhood that Amelie lives in, to the the strange and believable characters that live there. Tautou gives a remarkably charming performance in the lead role. She is at once an ingenue and a dreamer, and the film captures this perfectly. Mathieu Kassovitz, of La Haine and others, fame, is also great.
Having picked this DVD up while visiting in France, I was very impressed with the number of extras included, as well as eager to see how many of them would actually make it onto the US DVD release. Luckily, they all made it, a rarity for a foreign film.

However, despite the wonderfulness of this movie, the ending, while very romantic, is flawed. It depicts two people who have searched long and hard for each other in an effort to be loved having sex, something so carelessly base that a star has to be subtracted. One would think that the two would TALK, thus subscribing to the wills of their higher selves, not procreate in order to please their reptillian instincts. Overall, though, this movie is outstanding.

She subtly and deliciously avenges the abuses a mean-spirited employer heaps on a mentally slow but well-meaning assistant. And she sends her own father around the world through the eyes of a simple garden gnome.
Amelie is shy. She's empathetic. She's inventive. And, wherever she goes, she dips her hands in sacks of grain and collects flat stones for skipping. Actress Audrey Tautou is perfect in the role, a winsome young woman with huge, deep eyes and a fey smile to steal your heart away.",1043625600,2,789,4.895522388059701

2. There is advertisement for wines (I won't mention the name) throughout different parts of the CD (not during the film, thank goodness).

1706102,5,B0000640VO,"Like the star of Chocolat, the title character of this magical comedy also wants to heal people inside.  But this particular healer is a daydreamer with an irresistible smile, a Louise Brooks bob hairstyle or an Audrey Hepburn-like bun when it's tied up, and will charm the pants off the iciest of souls.
The only-child of a tight-lipped, hard-hearted doctor father and a neurotic schoolteacher mother, Amelie Poulaine grew up being too much unloved, with a not too happy childhood.  As a young lady, she becomes a waitress at the Two Windmills cafe, but other times spends her time in an imaginative world of dreams, not forming close ties with people, being terribly shy.
One day, she is watching TV when Princess Diana's death is announced.  From then on, she decides to be a healer of sorts, whether it be uniting a man with childhood memories he left in a cubbyhole in the skirting board long time ago, trying to soothe the hearts of people, make people's lives better, or being an avenging angel.  The scene where she helps a blind man across the street and describes what's going on is simply magical.
Amelie is also befriended by artist Raymond Dufayel, known as the Glass Man because of a disease that has given him very brittle bones.  They communicate indirectly through a painting he's working on, particularly a young girl that Dufayel's trying to figure out.
Amelie meets Nino Quincompoix, a man who collects discarded, frequently torn ID card photos from a photo booth and puts the reconstructed pieces in an album.  Included in there many times is a stern bald man whose pictures are always torn up.  Amelie finds Nino's album and wonders who the bald man is.  This is a mystery included in the film.
There's Colignon the grocer, an obnoxious middle-aged man who delights himself in disparaging his assistant Lucien, who's slow-witted but nice and sensitive.  Amelie feels sorry for Lucien and the scenes where she becomes his avenging angel at Colignon's expense are hilarious.  At one point she tells Colignon, ""You'll never be a vegetable.  Even artichokes have hearts.""  Ouch, but well deserved.
Amelie's widowed father spends his life collecting garden statues to decorate his dead wife's shrine, instead of travelling around the world.  Amelie steals one of them, a bearded garden gnome complete with red pointed hat, and then something weird happens.  A few days later, her father receives a postcard from the gnome, who is apparently on holiday abroad!!!  This goes on for a while and completely baffles him.
Audrey Tautou would've been my choice for Best Actress of the year.  I simply melted everytime she smiled in the movie.  She also bears a slight similarity to another Audrey--Hepburn.  Both have in common black hair, a face brimming with charm, and irresistible smiles.  Maybe that's why it was love at first sight with me.
Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet uses some quirky film techniques, mostly visual imagery, such as a scene when Amelie literally dissolves into water.  The onscreen narration is also useful.  At times, it sets the stage for turning points in the film.  Earlier, it describes the likes and hates of the Poulaines and the one important characteristic of the Two Windmill employees.  He creates an imaginative film that's a breather from the usual Hollywood grind.  But it's his closeups of Amelie and her smile that make this worth seeing over and over.",1042156800,203,3402,4.938488576449912
1706103,5,B0000640VO,"According to the American trailers for Amelie, 120 reviewers called this one of the best movies of the year.  Well, make that 121.  Amelie goes beyond the whimsical into the absolutely fantastic.  With humor and poignancy, the story unfolds.  Amelie is the lonely child of a distant father and neurotic mother.  As she stands childlike in the midst of a young adulthood, she observes human tragedy from the window of her apartment.  Upon finding a box of children's treasures in the dark space behind the wall of her bathroom, she begins to try to find the person who would have put it there.  This is the beginning of her emergence as a would-be fairy godmother, and her deeds become the portal by which she may be able to join with the rest of the human race as one of them.
The film is magnificently beautiful, and the casting perfect.  Tautou combines the self-knowledge of an introspective young woman with the disingenuousness of an imaginative loner to create an unforgettably charming character.
The DVD is rich with extra features.  What I found particularly compelling was Tautou's audition clip, as the actress seemed so much more contemporary and earthy than the character, but then was able to slip on a coat of whimsy even at that early stage.  Also noteworthy is the interview with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who says that he aims to make stories about the extraordinary rather than the ordinary (think City of Lost Children).  All in all, this is an excellent film and a great purchase...something I think I'll be watching over and over again.",1042156800,18,1561,4.830827067669173

1706105,5,B0000640VO,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet has a wonderful child-like view of the world and it's eccentricities. I have seen and loved his previous movies, 'Delicatessen' and 'The City of Lost Children', and always come away with a smile on my face and a twinkle in my eye, like I've shared a playground secret or seen a magician perform a magnificent trick just for my own pleasure. Amelie, like the other two films, faultlessly shows off Jeunet's talent as a director.
Amelie is a young woman, who as a child, was brought up in 'unconventional' settings. One evening, she makes a discovery (a child's 'treasure-chest' filled with trinkets, marbles and string) and embarks on a mission to see if human kindness will actually touch a heart. Along the way, she meets several of Paris' most eccentric residents and touches all of them in one way or another with her actions.
Amelie provides a hope and optimism that seems to be forgotten in the disposable and nihilistic culture that we perceive - an example of how a small act of genorosity and kindness can change someone's outlook on life, and reaps its rewards.
While some of the scenes are almost too sweet, and some of the visions too childlike, Amelie also contains some surprisingly clever and enchanting 'mini-stories' that contribute much to the overall storyline, and overall remind you that no matter how old and matured you get, there is still an innocent quality inside you that can still have fun with a sack of beans or bubble-wrap.",1042070400,2,1472,4.822134387351778

""Amelie"" works its spell every time, simply because it's about deciding to do good things for other people, finding a soulmate yet having chance bring you together and finding delight in life's smaller moments.
Beautifully filmed on location in Montmarte, France, the director Jean Pierre Jeunet began planning it while working in America on ""Alien Resurrection,"" compiling a list of all the things he loved about his area, all the things he'd ever wanted to film, and he built the story around those images. (Thus, we get the bits about the glasses dancing, the nuns working on their backhand.)
He uses his gift for visual effects and his love of Paris to create this film, which is as charming as every review has said. Audrey Tautou is instantly lovable.

1706134,5,B0000640VO,"With its opening sequence of kalidescopic visuals and rapid-fire narration, viewers who do not speak French (myself included) are likely to find Jean-Pierre Jeunet's celebrated AMELIE a challenge, for it is rather difficult to watch the film and read the subtitles at the same time.  That said, once you are able to sycronize these elements in your head, you are in for a treat: AMELIE is simply one of the most charming films to emerge from France in many, many years.
Considering that the film is both foreign and subtitled, and therefore presumably has a somewhat limited appeal for English-only audiences, it's story has become remarkably well-known in a very short time among English-only audiences--a fact that attests to its power.  Amelie is a shy, somewhat reclusive young woman, the product of an emotionally distant father and profoundly neurotic mother, who hides from life as a waitress in a small cafe while cultivating ""small pleasures""--skipping stones over water, dipping her hands into sacks of grain at the local market to feel the texture, and the like.  One day she discovers a box hidden behind the wall of her apartment bathroom, a tiny box filled with childhood toys stashed away by a long-ago childhood tenent.  She sets out to return them to the now-adult man who hid and forgot them so many years before... and when she sees his pleasure she finds a purpose in life: she will secretly do things to make others happier in their life, thereby vicariously living out the happiness she herself is afraid to accept.  In the process she not only brings life-changing joy to those around her, but she discovers her own need for happiness and the courage to change that she might experience happiness for herself.
The story is actually quite slight, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, his star Audrey Tautou, and a remarkable cast of supporting players give it tremendous style and an unexpectedly self-mocking sense of humor.  The film is full of visual metaphors: at various moments we see the hearts of different characters beating inside their bodies, Amelie fantasizes about hearing herself lectured by the television, the object of her affection is teased by talking photographs, and in one particularly memorable scene Amelie's disappointment is envisioned by morphing her body into a column of water that collapses with a splash to the ground.  The characters are mix of archetypes and glitchy eccentricity; the cinematography is shockingly beautiful; and everything about the film is gentle, sweetly funny, and sure to leave you with a Gallic smile and a wish that life were actually like that.
Tautou is a remarkable young actress who has been widely compared to both Audrey Hepburn and Leslie Caron--and indeed there is more than a passing similarity.  But she plays the title role with a knowing quality that belongs to her alone, and although the role (and indeed all roles in the film) is essentially archetypical her performance has a youthful grace slightly tempered by unexpected self-awareness: extremely effective and extremely endearing.  The film would be worth seeing for this performance alone, but fortunately AMELIE is remarkably rich in all its elements.
Those expecting ""depth"" may disappointed, for the life-lessons the films offers are not profound in themselves; others may find the film's odd mix of Brechtian distance, sly wit, and warmth a bit off-putting--and it would be easy to read the film as a somewhat diadactic comedy that doesn't entirely come off.  But if you can grasp the thought that the film isn't about anything beyond making you chuckle, smile, and rejoice in the small pleasures of life, you will find it extremely, extremely enjoyable.

1706136,5,B0000640VO,"Being away in Asia, and far from European civilisation, I had a chance to grab this wonderful memoire of Paris, and found it to be fresh and petillant.
Unlike most non-European films that I've been exposed to in Malaysia, Amelie Poussaint, reflects a typical parisian outlook on life with all its bleakness, innocence of human living that can only happen in Paris. Audrey Tatou the petite surbarbian carries the character well, and in not so many words, brought out one of the best movies I've watched over the past year.
I would recommend this movie to those who have not been to Paris, and those who would like to refresh memories of Paris again in their hearts. This film was made for you. And only you can know and experience the same flesh tingling effect of the movie, when you've lived in Paris. The air, the scent, the cafe, all these are not found elsewhere even in franchise cafes and makeover bistrots in Asia, or the US.",1040947200,6,932,4.586826347305389

1706170,4,B0000640VO,"The package says ""The feel-good movie of the year,"" and when I heard the basic plot, how Amelie discovers helping other people, I was expecting a pleasant but serious movie, the touchy-feely kind.  ""Aw, isn't that special.""  So I was only mildly interested in it before watching.
But it really caught me by surprise.  First of all, I was surprised by how funny it was.  I wasn't expecting it to be funny, but many lines made me bust out laughing.  Second, I was entranced with the beautiful world of the movie, a lovely type of fantasy.  I loved the way Amelie and the ""glass bones man"" talked about a girl in the painting he was working on when they both knew they were really talking about Amelie.  I loved the magic of the streets of Paris, the deeply interesting variety of characters in the movie, and particularly shy Amelie's charming mannerisms.  Adding to movie is the music which so perfectly fits, solidly contributing to the movie's good feeling, and also the unusual cinematic effects, including the way inanimate objects sometimes briefly came to life.
Often after watching a movie on DVD, I like to watch some of the extra material--deleted scenes, movie trailers, etc.  But after watching this movie, I couldn't even imagine destroying the beauty of the fantasy with such stuff.
So I watched the extras on a different day.  My favorites in the extras:  1) When the director and cinematographer discuss the use of color; it was enlightening and helped me realize one of the reasons I liked the movie so much.  Their use of color was not something I had noticed consciously while watching the film, but after hearing them discuss their use of color, I understood a part of what made this movie so appealing to me (I love color!).  2) It's called ""Fantasies of Audrey Tautou"" but really it's outtakes.  But what's amazing is how charming she is even when she's veering off the script.  3) It was interesting to see the original storyboard directly compared with the final result in one scene.
Normally I don't watch the interviews with the directors, but I did with this one and found it to be interesting enough.  But I'm not a hard core movie buff; I basically just watch movies and that's it.  I generally don't even know the actors' names (except for really big ones), let alone the directors.
For me, the extras are fine as far as DVD extras go, but this movie is such a delightful charming fantasy, the extras take away from that magic.  I'll leave those for the hardcore movie buffs and just watch the lovely story again and again.
(By the way, I couldn't decide whether to rate it 4 stars or 5; when in doubt I go the conservative route.  It's at least a 4 1/2, but I don't round up.)",1040256000,3,2705,4.586278586278587

1706172,5,B0000640VO,"The title character of Amelie is so adorable, you can't help but love her. She is a young woman who takes so much pleasure in helping other people find happiness, she forgets to find a little for herself. Whether she's trying to fix up a co-worker with a regular customer, or defending a shy young man at the grocery store who is picked on by his boss, Amelie is the ultimate do-gooder. She is so cute and sweet, you kind of wish she was YOUR friend. This is a wonderful French film (by far, the best I have ever seen) that will charm the heck out of you. This film had me from the very beginning, when it was showing Amelie as a little girl (wreaking havoc with the neighbor's television reception), right up until the very end where she lived happily ever after. And yes, it is quirky - but not bad quirky. For instance, the scenes where Amelie's father keeps receiving pictures in the mail of his missing garden gnome in various countries, yes it's a little odd - but hilarious. If you're looking for a light, fun film, this is it. Nevermind the subtitles, you may not even need them - you'll be so fixed on the beautiful scenery, and on Audrey Tautou that you may even forget to pay attention to the dialogue. That is the power of this film. Just sit back, relax, and spend some quality time in Amelie's world. It's a great place.",1039996800,22,1334,4.34
1706173,5,B0000640VO,"""Amlie"" is a film where you want to find the perfect word for describing its charm.  There is probably such a word in French, but I would not know what it was.  All I know is that quirky, enchanting, and everything I come up with in English is wholy inadequate to the task at hand.  The most important thing to know is that ""Amlie"" is a film where you should go see it because so many people love it, even if it requires you to not to do anything else so you can read the subtitles (some people resist such demands and--shudder--listen to dubbed versions of ""Life is Beautiful"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").  I feel about this film the way I did about ""Memento,"" where I told people they should see it and refused to tell them anything else because it would ruin the experience (think the Heisenberg principle).  However, I think the audience that would enjoy ""Amlie"" is considerably wider than those who would cotton to ""Memento"" (which was a quirky little film).
So, I am giving you my strongest recommendation for you to see ""Amlie.""  Now, if you have not yet seen the film, please go away, because I want to talk to those who have seen the film and while I am not going to be providing what we would traditionally consider ""spoilers,"" you really sure come to view this film as pure and chaste as the driven snow (of which we have lots up here).
I find it interesting that the film's French title ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain"" was reduced to just ""Amlie"" for American consumption.  Combined with the green framed portrait of actress Audrey Tautou smiling impishly as the title character, this certainly does not give viewers a real idea of what they will discover in this film.  One of the chief charms of the film for me was how you had to pay attention to the details because almost everything was a clue as to future developments (the exception that proves the rule would be Blubber, whose return we patiently waited for throughout the entire film).
Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Amlie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do.  We then begin 48 hours in which d'Amlie's life is changed.  Of course such massive developments hinge on a bottle cap fallen to the floor.  Our heroine's efforts to sabotage the life of Collignon (Urbain Cancelier), the Grocer (who will never be confused with an artichoke), struck my funny bone exceedingly hard and her relationship with the Glass Man, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), was particularly nice, both their discussions about the girl with the wine glass in the Renoir painting and the old man giving her the final push to her destiny.  The only question is whether Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz), is really good enough for our girl, but if she is smitten with a man who collects torn up and discarded photographs from photo booths around town, who are we to challenge her choice?
The end of the fabulous 48 hours at which point our heroine finds her destiny does not offer a perfect world.  Some find true bliss in love, others finally go on trips, but some still right where they started, unpublished, afflicted by imaginary illnesses, or consumed by jealousy.  But as long as Amlie lives happily ever after we are content.  I pity the person who does not fall in love with this film.",1039996800,14,3337,4.660988074957411

1706177,5,B0000640VO,"Although MAYBE a little too mature for me, I loved Amlie. There were 2-4 nude scenes, but besides that, I loved it.
Somehow I find it more difficult to comment on movies I liked. Perhaps this is because praise is harder to put into words than complaints, and merit is often less tangible.
""Amelie"" is a movie I would highly recommend. I know, I know: it's already been labeled an international hit, but this is one of those rare occasions when a movie deserves the praise it has been showered with.
It's fresh, original, beautifully shot, and features a memorable score that helps create its very special atmosphere. It leaves you with a wonderful feeling, like ""an orange-coloured day"", when nature is in bloom and harmony, inviting you to the celebration of life. It endows your memory with a picture album of those colourful, dynamic, artistic, often poetic sequences of which it is composed.
""Amelie"" is not a simple fairytale, as some might think. There's a bit of everything in it: romance, mystery, philosophy, brilliant humour and whimsy. It touches upon many issues, but never ""in your face"". Obviously, it wasn't meant to mirror reality, so don't try to find flaws here. And I wouldn't encourage viewers to question some of Amelie's actions from the moral standpoint. Doing so would be taking the film too seriously, instead of just enjoying its mischievous twinkle.
The plot is well-woven and a pleasure to follow. I've seen the movie several times, and it hasn't yet lost any of its charm. It isn't perfect, at times overly sentimental, but I would generously give it 9/10, for all of the above and for making my day. :)",1039564800,5,1632,4.790780141843972
1706188,5,B0000640VO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  It may not be an intellectual feast for the mind, or a gritty documentary about the pain and suffering of real life, but it DOES remind us of the simpler side of life and what it is to see the world as a child might see it.  This is entertainment, so I must protest, it is entitled be whatever sugar-coated confection it wants to be!  And it is not really so sugar-coated.  Nino works in a porn shop (though it is surprisingly un-seedy), and other characters have their problems (though they seem surprisingly easy to solve by our irrepressible heroine).  Amelie is a sweet, Ally McBeal-esque girl who has never really grown up.  She is still the little girl who lives in a world of her own imagination.  And if those glasses are rose-coloured, who are we to say that the way she sees the world is worse than the more pessimistic brand of cynicism that seems to be so rampant in ""realism"" today?  Amelie reminds us that perhaps, after all, the children, with their innocent idealism and little games, have somehow got it right.
Both Amelie and her accidental ""amoureux"" are adorable, though I thought perhaps Jeunet might have taken a cue from Jane Austen and pointed out that Amelie's interference with other people's lives, like Emma, sometimes turned out badly (like Georgette and her psychotic lover), and Amelie should have taken some responsibility for that.  But perhaps that is my North American liberalism speaking.  I loved the integration of the fantasy with reality: talking pig-lamps, the photographs that speak to Nino about the ""beautiful"" mysterious girl....are they merely manifestations of Nino and Amelie's subconscious thought, or is destiny really working miracles to bring them together?  And it is the pointing out of the details of life that holds the movie together in terms of story.  After all, most people's stories are manifested through the details...this is the stuff life (or at least an ideal one) is made of...c'est la vie.  And everybody, not just Amelie and Nino, has their quirks.  I thought the narrated introduction at the beginning of the film quite funny in its portrayal of the silly and the absurd that really, though exaggerated, makes up much of our lives.  And the characters!  Oh the characters!  There's not a sane one in the lot (it has been said that the French have their own distinct brand of madness..j/k)!  Nevertheless, we see echos of people we know in each of them, in the jealous boyfriend, the angry grocer, the kind painter, etc.  And perhaps there is an Amelie in some of us too, shy introverts who think up strategems to avoid confronting our true passions.
Last but not least, the cinematography is excellent.  It may not be realistic (I lived in Paris for a few years and it isn't), but it's a pretty fantasy of an Ideal Paris.
All in all, it's a satisfying fantasy with a happy ending.  And in these days, don't we all need some more happy endings?",1039478400,21,2947,4.75049115913556

1706190,5,B0000640VO,"You can almost smell Paris in this beautiful, rich and fun film. Amelie is a lonely girl who grows into a quiet adult - whose life is small and neat - but whose past has been somewhat fraught and misunderstood. A chance event sends her life spinning off into a parallel existence - one in which she realises she can quietly do good for other people without seeking reward - and it also helps her find love.
Now that is the barebones of the story - but it in no way actually manages to capture how wonderful this film is. It is sweet, shoulder-shruggingly gallic film - where everything is open to gentle ridicule from the argumentative old house-wives to the nature of Ameilie's mothers' death. (killed by a woman falling from a Cathedral). As Amelie tries to organise true love she realises that this is the one thing you cannot organise - for if you help it along it will not necessarily turn out  - and you cannot avoid it if it is meant to be.
I didn't think I would like this film at all. I thought it would be meaningful and poignant and have long lingering silences and then try to carry it off by having a gamine heroine for the lead. Well it has the Hepburn-esque heroine, but the movie is just a joy from start to finish. LIght, refreshing and one I will happily watch again.",1039392000,2,1285,4.331950207468879
1706191,5,B0000640VO,"I find it difficult to believe that not one person has written a review for this movie. So I shall try to do my very best. This movie simply oozes charm. I bought it on a lark, and not a few positive words from others. And well, because Audrey Tautou looks cute on the cover. I'd seen a few bits of it here and there, and decided why not. I am glad that I did too, because it's marvelous.
  This is a quirky movie, and in that way that we Americans will never be able to reproduce. All we do is remake them, and they're typically saccharine sweet at best. We seem to excel at war movies, and depressing stories that crush the spirit of the viewer. And those are good too, but there's only so much one can take before they need a movie like this to soothe their soul. And here we have the French to thank for something other than blowing up a greenpeace ship. Not that I don't whole-heartedly appreciate that.
  The story is about a girl who spent her childhood starved of affection from her neurotic, but well meaning parents. Mom dies in a bizarre suicide attempt by a Quebec exchange student involving Notre Dame, gravity, and a little bit of screaming. It has almost no bearing on the plot other than to dispose of the mother, and thus add a dimension of grief to the father, who builds her a shrine of odds and ends; to include a (seemingly) nomadic garden gnome. She works at a caf with more ""interesting"" people, who have their own little stories, but they are little indeed. She's unlucky in love, thus far, and in life she's so shy that her world consists of working, visiting her bereaved father, and isolating herself in her apartment, where she spies on a curious neighbor who has painted the same Renoir every year for the last twenty years. He also suffers from a genetic condition that predisposes him to suffering broken bones with great ease. Similar to Samuel L's character in that horrible movie Unbreakable, but here it's actually believable.  Everything changes when she hears on the TV that Princess Di has been killed, thus she drops the lid from the bottle in her hand, thus it rolls off and knocks loose a wall tile in her bathroom (how's that for contrived?). Hidden behind is a dust covered rusty tin with some small child's treasures concealed within. She decides to reunite the tin with it's now quite grown up owner, and if she is successful, she will spend the rest of her life trying to reunite other miserable people with some form happiness. It sounds sweet, but only through some small cleverness on the part of the writer can it possibly succeed. Thankfully, it does, begging me to wonder if this movie could possibly ever been made in the States...
  All of this takes place, and more, with the backdrop of a Paris that does not really exist. The colours are bright, the streets clean, the people amiable. But the photography is outstanding, and helps the movie along in that effortless way we all like to see. Amelie is not all sweet though, as she sees fit to avenge the small crimes of one of the movies myriad of characters. It's all quite harmless, as is the movie, which makes it such a delight to watch. Like eating tiramisu, in a hot bath (I guess). This is definitely a good movie for guys to rent if their lady is coming over, and should yield some form of passion (though I take no responsibility for that comment). Excellent movie for anyone not afraid to read subtitles.",1039392000,5,3419,4.478330658105939

Like Jeunet's great early effort ""Delicatessen"", this movie is filled with some pretty weird characters, and the story evolves from a mosaic of moments that are little story gems in themselves. The main character of the movie, Amelie, is a waitress in a typical Paris bistro, but her solitary life is far from ordinary, as is her upbringing. Bent on the mission of helping people (in her own twisted way), she sets out on several adventures. The discovery of a small metal box hidden behind one of her bathroom tiles by a child some forty years ago sends her on a chase to find this person and reunite him with the lost treasure. At the same time she chases her own luck and love by engaging the guy of her fancy in a chase across Paris.

1706197,3,B0000640VO,"Amelie (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2001)
For the past two years, I have been reading reviews of Amelie that all have one thing in common: the word ""sweet."" I have no idea what film these people were watching, but it wasn't the twisted little minor gem I saw on Sunday night. ""Sweet"" may be the last word I'd have come up with in trying to describe it. I should have had more faith in the brilliance of Jeunet. (Of course, all of these same people persist in describing Audrey Tatou as anything from ""pixie-like"" to ""gorgeous,"" as well. I found her rather disturbing-looking, as I find everyone in Jeunet films.)
Throw the other reviews out and listen to me, will you? Amelie is the story of the title character (Audrey Tatou of Venus Beauty Institute), and there's actually precious little story. It's more a slice-of-life thing, during which she does such things as befriend a man with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Serge Melin of The City of Lost Children), try to set up some of her compatriots at work, torments the local grocer Collignon (Michel Robin, presently onscreen in America in Merci pour le Chocolat), and lead a hopelessly lovestruck guy from her grade-school class (Matthieu Kassovitz, from Jakob the Liar) on a wild goose chase to discover her identity. None of which is all that sweet a thing to do, really.
Jeunet's usual twisted sense of humor is evident here, and it rears its head often in visual clues (think Police Squad! for a more highbrow audience). The wit isn't as dry as usual, and thus the movie doesn't have as many laugh-out-loud funny points as Jeunet's finest film, Delicatessen. That doesn't make it unwatchable, but it does pale in comparison. Just be prepared to find a movie filled with subtly disturbing (especially in their appearance) people that will leave you scratching your head and wondering ""what in the world was all that about?"" ***",1038873600,11,1870,4.8105590062111805

At least Adam Sandler WANTS to entertain you though. It's not just two hours of artsy, self indulgent fluff. But about Amelie..
  It wasn't completly awful. There are a few laughs, but they take to long setting them up and they are too far between for such a long movie. The actress is a sort of pretty, female version of Rowan Atkinson. I think if the movie had concentrated just on her and her life and been much shorter, then I might have enjoyed it. Unfortunatly, the main character is left very lightly developed and most of the other characters are almost less than stereotypes. The director only gives Amelie maybe three expressions and shoves down our throats how waifish and charming she is and how sympathetic and sorry we should feel for her. Halfway through the movie I felt myself wanting an insulin injection. The movie mostly spends time dispensing threadbare lessons about LIFE!, LOVE! and ART! (there were moments in the movie were I could imagine the art house crowd nodding their heads and saying 'so true, so true'). I guess it was more important than developing actual characters. I felt the atmosphere of French kitsch (I guess that's what it was) a little suffocating. I think the American equivalent would be like being stuck in a big parking lot filled with hot pink and aqua blue 57 chevys, each one containing an Elvis and Marily Monroe look alike.
  You'd think you could count on a European movie to have a clever or ambivalent or at least deppressing ending, but Amelie can't even do that. The writer can't even think of anything for the two lead characters to say once they do get together- they just skip straight to the sex. And this is supposed to be a romantic movie! How is this man any different than the facelss man Amelie is shown [fornicating with]of the movie?

Speaking from the point of view of a girl, I think girls really do things like this! It's true.

1706222,5,B0000640VO,"From the very beginning, Amlie shows itself to be different from predictable American blockbusters.  Its opening sequence, the retelling of the salient points of Amlie's childhood (according to her delightfully skewed view), draws the viewer into her sweet little world with its clever script and beautiful cinematography. We learn all about her parent's small quirks; her father, for instance, hates the feeling of wet swimming shorts sticking to his legs but thoroughly enjoys polishing his shoes to a deep shine, while her mother detests the wrinkled hands that come from bathing too long while finding great pleasure in empting out and reorganizing her purse. Amelie lives in a world where everyone can be categorized by such small but vitally important facts, and every little deed has its own reward.

Amlie spends her days in two activities, for she is both a waitress and a doer of good deeds. A decided introvert, the heroine delights in interesting ways of relating and interacting with the world which might not occur to the more literal minded. Much of the film is spend detailing the whimsical ways she discovers and carries out the most fantastical wishes of those unrecognized worthies that live around her. And in the midst of her small philanthropic acts, Amile thinks about about the mysterious man whose photo album she acquires when it falls right off his pannier, and plans how she might get in contact with him. The end, of course, is no surprise to anyone except Amlie; though expected, it lacks not one bit of charm, and the seducer becomes the seduced in a beautiful turn of roles.

The Paris shown is not a gritty city but rather the City of Lights as the dreamers might see it, and the enhancement of reality is perfect for the new view of the world it gives. We might see the world through Amelie's eyes, and thank goodness for it: I never knew the world could look this bright, nor the colors so sharp and dazzling. The little integration of computer animation that does occur is both unexpected and seamless, delighting in its whimsical nature. This movie is a treasure from all perspectives, and I look forward to seeing both past and future efforts from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.",1037750400,13,2214,4.86737400530504

1706224,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is nothing short of remarkable.  Words cannot say or speak to the level of emotion that this film conveys.
The film is centered around a young woman who, in her childhood, experienced almost no physical or emotional contact.  Upon discovering a hidden treasure of someone else's young memories, Amelie had found her epiphany and unlocked her meaning in life: to bring joy to others.
However, Amelie's route to doing so must be at her own expense.  She cannot know the joy of someone expressing emotion to her, she had the past to keep that from happening.  She must effect joy on those from a distance, bringing a cornucopia of amusing and elaborately plotted situations that were remotely devised without anyone discovering her.  However, when given her own chance for happeniness, when discovering that the man she loves wants to know her, she is unable to do it.
Here, the film shows a young woman with tremendous heart, yet tremendous anxiety.  This heroine also has the ability to touch the heart of the viewer.  Yes, through the magic of television, she makes the viewer cheer for her as she cheers for others.  The film is pure genius.  Bravo!",1036972800,4,1157,4.803030303030303

The cinematography has a painter's touch, as the colors seem more vibrant and warm than in life; and yet the settings never struck me as being artificial.  The characters are also crafted with a similar flair; even minor characters seem like portraits having unexpected familiarity...  The soundtrack to the movie complements the action and the characters, and is a work of art in itself.
The only negative aspect of the DVD (at least on mine, I bought it elsewhere) is that one can't view French subtitles, only English or Spanish.  The French would be helpful for anyone interested in learning French...  But that is a minor detail.",1036713600,6,778,4.725925925925926

While like many other French films this is very whimsical, it is so well performed and directed that only the very hardest hearted would not find the charm of this film irresistable. Part of the reason for this is down to the remarkable central performance of Audrey Tautou as ""Amelie"". Her entire performance seems to be more mimed than acted and seems to do without dialogue to a great degree.  This works well due to her excellent acting abilities as well as some outstanding direction.
The plot is based around an unashamedly romantic story concerning our heroine; the acting skill and direction give this film a quirkyness and zest which really set it apart.
I enjoyed this film immensely and felt enriched from having watched it.  Definitely one of the filmic highlights of the past year and very highly recommended.",1036627200,4,1078,5.044943820224719
1706237,5,B0000640VO,"I've been reading some reviews for this film and I really don't care for how unrealistic this film is said to be.  Yes...life is not like the movies, but can we not have the movies take our mundane lives and artistically manipulate it into something more?  One French reviewer said that it did not portray Paris in the way it was at all.  I don't think that really was the point of the movie, nor to portray the most intelligent protagonist.  Amelie is a simple girl.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The world consists of more than just intellectuals.  We already know what the world is like...what reality puts forth.  Why would we have to sit through a movie that shows all of that if we can just step outside our door?  I believe that movies are a form of escape...artistic expression...a way to give form to our dreams.  I don't believe we should make all our movies with our heads in the clouds, but it's good that once in awhile, someone can create something not out of pragmatism but just pure, simple human emotion and fantasy.  The movie was not meant to be a documentary.  Everyone nowadays flocks to the blockbuster hits...action films...films with provocative actresses and promiscuity...or even the downright hardcore films that portray reality right down to its extreme complexities (Requiem For a Dream, FIght Club, which i do like).  It's a nice change to watch a simple film that focuses on artistic imagery and musical score rather than fast paced plot and sexually, superficially stimulating fidgeting with bad actors.  I feel that this movie shows how we forget about the simple things we all can afford in life...how we forget how refreshing and liberating those simple things can be.",1036195200,21,1709,4.7687074829931975
1706238,2,B0000640VO,"See, I'm a French guy, I live in Paris and I know quite well about the area where this movie was shot. It's a poor, dirty area, with plenty of bums and rats, it's not at all like it is showed in the film. So don't get abused. This movie is just a postcard on celluloid, this is valuable only for the tourists.
Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who before this ""Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" (the French title), had directed some pretty 'noir' and sordid movies like ""Delicatessen"", ""The City of the lost Children"" and ""Alien 4"", completely changed his vision for this film; he even changed his director of photography! For a single young girl, for her big eyes and her haircut in the Louise Brooks style only, he cleaned up the 18th district of Paris. Here, no rain, no bad weather, no clouds in the sky, no traffic jam, no pollution, no garbage bins, no dirt on the sidewalks, in the gutters and in railway and metro stations... which may be acceptable. But when he puts away all the poor elements - the Black and Arabian people, and the bums -, and gives to Jamel Debbouze (an Arabian comic, very well-known in France) a character with a typical French name - Lucien -, then we have the right to scream with fury and ask for the filmmaker to be on court martial. Maybe it's only a movie, and you can tell me this, but I think there's still some respect to be shown for the location and the people.
But this is not the most disgusting look of the film. No, what can easily make you throw up is the emptiness of the treatment, there's no message at all, the story is ridiculous and unsignificant, and Amelie and Nino excepted, the characters don't evoluate, don't progress, they just keep turning around and around in closed spaces they practically never get out from. Amelie herself is quite irritating, she's not very intelligent, doesn't have any of the grace that all the medias gave her, and her stupid games and her way of minding the others' business are desperating. How can you be interested in such a character? The special effects are honeyed and add to the boring and too long aspect of the film, where nothing happens from the beginning to the ending. This movie, which received five Academy Award nominations, would have deserved the one for sugar. Mathieu Kassovitz, a shocker director, disappoints his fans with this sweethearted character, a little lost. Dominique Pinon (""The City of the lost Children"", ""Alien 4"") and Isabelle Nanty are very good, so is the ending, but it's not enough.
The reasons of the success of this film are that it tells a fairy-tale in a real place, and portrays an ideal world, where everything is white, clean and neat, and in the end everything is always OK. We may be skeptical about this... In any case this movie is the proof that we can make any ... believable with a good dose of 'Chantilly' cream, when we see how successful and highrated it is...",1036022400,16,2890,4.559615384615385

1706240,5,B0000640VO,"Let me make something perfectly clear right from the start. Amelie is not a comedy. Amelie is not a romance movie. Amelie is nothing less than a work of fine art! Amelie is certainly not a romantic comedy and if you set out to judge it by these standards you are apt to be disappointed. Also bear in mind that like a classical symphony, it must be experienced several times before this wonderful movie can be fully appreciated.
I first heard the word, ""Amelie"" on a pay-per-view ad, the first thing I thought of was a brand of motor oil from the fifties. (Maybe spelled Amalie?),  ""Well"", I thought, ""any girl named after a brand of engine oil is worth checking out"". Then when I saw the teaser on TV I thought; ""Any movie that features a black-haired, doe-eyed pixie and an animated pig-lamp must be worth seeing"".
I expected a light entertainment, a bit-o-fluff romantic comedy, and thats exactly what I saw. But deep in my soul I began to sense something else. So I watched it again and a whole new world began to reveal itself. then somewhere around the fifth viewing it hit me; This is cinematic magic! A symphonic dream of light, sound and love brought to life for all to see. Yes, it took five viewings before it got through my hard shell of cynicism. I am so glad it did!
Amelie lives in a beautiful fantasy world where streets are clean and uncongested. A world where waitresses and store clerks find happiness and love. Where bad guys get there comeuppance and not a single drop of blood is spilled. For anyone who grew up lonely, got picked on but never picked for the team, those who would never be a cheerleader or have a chance to date one, this movie tells your story. The entire film is populated with also-rans. Lame bartenders, failed writers, hypochondriacs. People like we meet everyday in the grim, soul crushing, ultraviolet stained world of reality. But these lucky souls live in a beautiful, green and orange colored world where hope still lives and dreams still come true.
After a long, hard, day at work, when I've dodged all the angry and bitter people on the freeway and performed all the daily chores that let me keep resident on earth for yet another day, then its time. I take off my shoes, relax and enter Amelie's little world. Soon I feel the anger and depression slip away and for a while, life is worth living again.

1706243,5,B0000640VO,"Jeunet has done it again, this time apparently without the help of his usual partner, Marc Caro.
Amelie is a perfectly French film, demonstrating the French knack for finding beauty in the mundane and accepting human frailty.  Poor little Amelie grew up with somewhat loving but eccentric and unapproachable parents.. Her childhood social life and family situation has made her into a painfully shy but compassionate young woman.  She has retained her childish way of finding likes and dislikes -- another French specialty? -- and instead of making judgments on practical bases, she makes decisions with her intuition.  She intuits her role in life, her lovelife -- you'd guess she probably picked her place of residence based on the grain of wood on the balustrade.
This is a character you will root for; you will talk to her as she struggles with her bizarre insecurities; you will applaud her clever mischief; your heart will ache joyfully when she succeeds in her first mission of giving meaning to another person.. (you'll know what I mean when you see it) I have to say, if you don't care about this beautiful creature, your heart is defective.
All that aside, Jeunet works his usual magic with stop-motion, animation, slow-mo, various effects, highly stylized dream sequences put into documentary format.  Of course the performances are all perfect as usual, and there is at least one ""usual suspect"" on the credits.
I was foolish enough to miss this one in the theatre, but luckily decided to take the time to see it on DVD..  Do yourself a favor and do the same if you have not seen it..",1035244800,5,1596,4.831501831501831

1706248,5,B0000640VO,"The story centers around a shy and ""playful"" character (Audrey Tautou) who becomes a secret guardian angel for other lonely people. The irony of the situation is that she herself has had a lonely childhood and her adulthood isn't any better.  Nevertheless, she decides to ""help"" others unseen.  The various episodes to illustrate the transition is well-presented.  There is a certain charm in the narrative style used by the director - in portraying fairly mundane activities with a novel vigor and mysterious charm. Having a wonderful cast does help that cause. In between helping others, the character realizes her own loneliness.  The story then moves into a ""chance romantic"" realm.
The movie is well taken, and is blessed with excellent score and talented cast.  Some slick editing adds to the wonderful spirit of the movie.

Even the front dvd cover packaging grabs your attention (it's very reminiscent of either a Pixar Bug's Life dvd cover or a Walt Disney film release cover of the 60's).After hearing the Oscar buzz about this off beat French comedy I needed to find out for myself what the big deal was. Well, for starters it has a pretty French actress named Audrey Tautou who has definitely captured my attention (beautiful dark eyes and plenty of skillful talent on screen)! The acting chemistry between Audrey Tatou and director/actor Mathieu Kassovitz was perfect and authentic (they really looked like a good couple);Very believable...
The story centers around a meek and introverted waitress who cherishes her solitude...That is until she discovers that she has quite an uncanny knack for bringing great cheer and happiness to others concerning matters of the  heart. However, the real comedy comes into play when Amelie retaliates against those who take great sadisitic pleasure in harrassing the under dogs ! While she accomplishes these great feats through well calculated yet very eccentric methods she is unable to bring herself to find her own personal happiness with the opposite sex. She is able to play Dear Abby in a very enigmatic way to those who do not suspect she is helping them, yet is unable to follow her own advice !...
Amelie is rich with colorful characters and witty (French) dialogue. Non-human characters from Amelie's vivid imagination come to life with remarkable computer animated graphics. The French location and scenery is truly amazing ! One can even feel the wind blowing on several scenes where Amelie's father's home is located (just check out the garden scene where he is accepting mail from the postman and you'll know what I mean)! Amelie is beautifully crafted and filmed in richly saturated colors for the dvd format. The 5.1 surround digital mix isn't too shabby, either.

You see a gorgeous, primary colored, clean Paris through her eyes, and it is a sight to behold!  Amelie, though a very empathetic character, is not saccharine.  People who offend her are tricked.  She is devious in her methods of bringing joy and settling scores.
I particularly liked the Frenchness (for lack of a better word) of the film.  The French have a pragmatic, relaxed view of sex that is so at odds with the serious and rather frantic importance we Americans give to the subject.  Now food, on the other hand, is a very serious business and not casual at all to the French.  I noticed all kitchens, no matter how small, were fully equipped with every type of blender, beater and bowl (but not necessarily appliances.)  When Amelie eats a solitary dinner, she sets the table, has a glass of wine and three carefully prepared courses.
When Amelie falls in love, her shyness about does her in.  She is fearless at helping others, but almost paralyzed at helping herself.  You really pull for her even while getting a little exasperated with her hide and seek methods.  There is enough comedy throughout to keep the film from being oversweet.
The DVD:  The color is excellent, the sound good and the images sharp and clear.  The package is good and interesting.  There are subtitles in English and Spanish, no dubbing.

1706257,5,B0000640VO,"""Amelie"" is a wondrous and whimsical movie about a shy, beautiful young woman named Amelie who emerges from her sheltered, dream-like existence into the real world.
One fateful night, Amelie discovers a little keepsake box in her apartment.  This inspires her to find the owner of the box. She does find the owner.  She is so overjoyed by the owner's gratitude that she ventures out to do more good deeds for more people.  In the process, she changes peoples' lives for the better.  She also learns to trust people.  Amelie becomes a participant in life instead of only an observer as she had been.  And she eventually overcomes her fear of relationships and finds a soulmate.
Visually, ""Amelie"" is a marvel in filmmaking with stunning cinematography and surprising, even startling special effects that are seemlessly blended into the comedy, romance, and fantasy of the story. The quirky narration and dialogue are filled with witty and worldy observations about life in Paris and about life in general.
""Amelie"" is imaginatively brought to life by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and by its radiant star, Audrey Tautou.  Hers is a starmaking performance.  Tautou endearingly and precisely captures the hesitant charm, fragility, ingenuity, and ultimate determination of our heroine Amelie with exceptional subtlety and grace that should have earned her at least an Academy award nomination. The movie itself deserved to win Best Foreign Picture but didn't.  Go figure.

If you did not like the movie, you're not likely to buy it. If you have not seen it, you're more likely to rent it for three bucks than buy it. Yes?
So, here is a review of the *DVD*. It is not good. In the commentary by the director, he even admits that he pushed the color too far to green and said he was not sure it worked. It is annoyingly green. There are things that are green that should not be green. If you have ever been to Paris, you know that the walls of the Metro are beige and not green.
The movie is adorable. Tatou is adorable. The characters are cute and quirky. The added footage, interviews and commentary are very good. The director's chatter over the film is very French, ""Zees is my favorite scene....well, zees is my favorite scene...no, really zees is my absolute favorite scene, more zan zee others!"" The techical info is great. The peek into the ordered mind of the director is very edifying (if you want a director, hire this guy. He doesn't waste film. He plans it out ahead in great detail.)

Criticism of the film for being too cutesy on the surface seems founded but there is a dark-spot in 'Amelie's warm heart.  In her pursuit for other people's happiness the she is not adverse to causing others a little well-intentioned pain.

Amelie is perhaps the most exuberant, joyful movie to pop along in ages. Lovingly made: the acting, the shot composition, the editing and the (very, very) subtle use of CGI... Wide screen is a must for this one, as much of the film's beauty is chopped out in the VHS release (such as one scene, where Amelie is sitting in front of the TV in a room that's nigh entirely red- save for a small blue lamp to her left. It's a tiny detail, but it fleshes out everything wonderfully- closed captioned: the lamp is gone). Little things, definitely. But then, this is a movie that is all about the tiny details in life...
Yes, it's a love story, and as sweet as they come. No need to further belabor that aspect or give away any moments. But you will be surprised many times over. You will laugh at loud. And you will want to watch it again and again, especially with someone you can touch close by. And if you don't have someone- this movie may provide the much-needed impetus to go to France and start turning (not to mention skipping) stones (the shots of the city are marvellous).
Then there's Audrey Tautou, whose expressive face is the axis of the movie. Amelie holds your gaze like a naissance de millennium Audrey Hepburn. She has an elfin grace that is utterly sublime and unique. When Amelie smiles, you smile with her.
If you have seen it, then you know why you should own this one- movies like this simply aren't made that often.

I chuckle at some of the reviewers who try to treat it as flawed art in some misunderstood tradition. . Let's get back to the basics of life, which is where art comes from. The director of this film followed his spirit, not Hollywood, thank God. This is a French movie, not an American movie; I restate the obvious because I have not seen anything emerge from Hollywood in a decade or more that is this uplifting, this entertaining, this funny, this poignant, this beautiful, and which leaves one feeling so wrapped in love. I don't know whether we Americans have lost the touch, or if we never had it. Oh... wait... Moulin Rouge comes close. I stand corrected. But Amelie reminds me of a long list of movies in the French tradition which leave me smiling and reassured that the world is not spinning off its axis and careening into the fearful abyss. Love and sweetness find their ways through any obstacles, however primitive or modern, and Amelie somehow connects the old and the new with that joi d'vivre wherein the most pathetic of human existences are all revealed to be golden at the core--all respond to the spirit of Love.
Amelie is entertainment that massages your spirit. Yes, I know I've used that word already; it's intentional--this movie works on the level of the human spirit! The vistas of Paris, from downtown to Montmartre, to the suburbs, will bring you wonderful memories, and if you haven't been to Paris, the movie will GIVE you memories. The trains, the stations, the streets, the cityscapes, the people... oh, and the music. Then let's not forget the charming Audrey Tautou, who delivers a character so sweet it aches in the solar plexus where you crave to know her. If you're dead to the world, you might not like Amelie, but if there is some spark in you that you remember once having but can't seem to find; I promise Amelie will find it and blow on it and set it ablaze again. If you, like me, find yourself looking at the current waves of movies to wash up on the surf from Hollywood, shaking your head and walking away empty handed and wondering if they've simply made all the good movies already and nothing worthwhile is left, this is the movie to spice up that malaise and set your mouth watering again.
I will spare  you another plot synopsis; one really cannot do it justice here anyway, but hear me--from my spirit to yours (oh my, there's that WORD again!) --I can't recommend this movie enough.

Being rather shy, her life is rather solitary and private until she discovers a tin box hidden behind a bathroom tile in her apartment on the night that Princess Diana is killed.  The tin box contained keepsakes of a young boy who had lived in the same apartment 50 years earlier.  Amlie decides that she must find the child who is now a 50+ year old man and return his box.  From that point, Amlie's life is never the same as she begins a crusade to do nice things for other people to help them, including her father; but she prefers to remain completely anonymous.  Ultimately, she is forced to confront her shyness after she falls in love with Nino Quincampoix (played by Mathieu Kassovitz) and can no longer remain anonymous.

  -'Amlie': Going Sweet and Sentimental Has Its Rewards (Daniel Zalewski, 10/28/01, NY Times)
Though overcute, overlong, and overcontrived, this film has such an appealing star (Audrey Tautou), tries so hard to please, and is so unexpectedly sunny (coming from France), that its flaws can be forgiven.  But at least two of those flaws are worth noting.  The first is that the cartoonishness mentioned above makes it seem as if the director is trying to distance himself from the romanticism and sweetness of his own film.  This unfortunate failure of nerve leads to a kind of self-contradictory effect, as the Tex Avery touches get wheeled out every time Mr. Jeunet seems to be embarrassed by the sentimentality of a situation he's just presented.  This may help him keep his credibility with his fellow French filmmakers but necessarily weakens what should be some of the films finer moments.  Still, if you're willing to get in the cartoon spirit they won't bother you too much.
The more serious problem concerns a quintessentially French, or at least European, aspect of the plot.  The film, like Clueless, represents a modern take on Jane Austen's Emma, with its story of a young woman meddling in the love lives of those around her.  However, while Emma is one of the most underrated political novels of all time precisely because it shows the disastrous results of Emma's what we might call central planning, Amlie assumes that such interventions would have uniformly happy results.  Oddly enough for such an otherwise whimsical movie it betrays the flaw of rationality, in its conceit that those things which Amelie can imagine would work out well continually do so.  In fact, Mr. Jeunet says that people have told him that he inspired them to become Amlies themselves.  One shudders to think of these film-addled Frenchwomen roaming the land fixing up peoples' lives the way they think they should be.  Mr. Jeunet and his followers would do well to recall the words of the great Eric Hoffer :
  A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs
  by minding other people's business.
This, though Mr. Jeunet seems to have missed it, must be the point even of his own film.  The inherent drama lies in Amelie's attempt to fill her own empty life, which if we really had the godlike powers she improbably demonstrates might not be so empty.  But since we don't and since we are ultimately not really either responsible for nor competent to govern the lives of others, the plot of the film has to build to the moment when Amlie herself embraces the possibility of love.
Ms Tautou is so compelling an actress that we do indeed rejoice when this moment comes, and we have a pleasant enough time along the way.  But Mr. Jeunet needlessly lessens the tension with both his Bugs Bunny antics and his gallic certainty that our lives can be run better for us by others than we run them ourselves.  If only he'd imbibed the lessons of Jane Austen as deeply as those of Tex Avery it would be an even better picture.

1706295,1,B0000640VO,"Since there is no ""goodness"" except into people's minds, the whole idea of the movie tuns into pieces. A predominance of female supporters can easily be explained in the archetype of womanhood Amelie portrays. This is the ONLY plus in the movie. Accordingly, the average woman is utterly irrational and in order to avert responsibility of hers own acts, she typically sees herself as victim. To strengthen this self-indulgent image, she seeks company of other ""victims"" and frequently involves into ""humanitarian"" acts. The difference between Amelie and factual reality consists in HOW MUCH the victim-character is working to convey its true nature. Amelie is CRUCIADING against normality. She thinks having the right of intruding people's lives, being backed with such insight truly shameful not being shared with the rest of us, the poor unenlightened. She might be broadly classified as a crossover between the preaching evangelical and infamous ""civil rights activist"". (It's probably unnecessary to remind you how much I hate these sorry shacks of humans.)
Outside of these considerations, Amelie is extremely long, absolutely boring, pleading for the beauty of ignorance devoid of responsibility, cheaply sentimental and FINALLY filled with recycled religion and postmodern rubbish.",1031356800,13,1288,5.576530612244898

The film is a worthy successor to some of the surrealistic films of the French tradition. At one at the same time it is an adventure in realism and a peregrination through the dream state.
The subtitles do not get in the way of the film. They're carefully done.

I took everyone I knew to the theater to see this movie, and everyone felt the same. It is not a girl movie or a boy movie. It's about anyone who appreciates life, or needs to.
The DVD is amazing. It comes in a wonderful package that can show a grown or young Amlie. Not only is it a visually stimulating package inside and out, but the 2 disc set comes complete with a very enjoyable commentary (can you say you've sat through any other commentary besides the Simpsons?) and the audition tapes are worth the DVD on their own. I won't waste your time telling you what's on this DVD, since it tells you below. I'll just tell you that if you have a DVD player or plan to get one, get this DVD.

But that statement does not do the film justice.  I did not know what was going to happen next, and the film continued to surprise me until the end.  The visuals in the film are stunning, and Audrey Tautou is remarkable in the lead role.

""Amelie,"" also known in French as ""The fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain"" takes place in Paris, the city where an innocent and angel-like girl grows to become a good-doer, much in a style similar to the movie ""Pay it forward"" from 2000. However the storyline is totally unconventional, filled with her daydreaming depicted in very original and fun ways, and with unexpected turns as she goes about her good deeds. At one point she finds herself caught in pursuing what's best for others, while being afraid to pursue happiness for herself.

At times quirky and sentimental without being mawkish, ~Amelie~ is a cinematic experience which transports the viewer into the lonely but highly imaginative life of a young woman, whose random and conscious acts of kindness changes the destiny of those around her. ~Amelie~ shows us that even little things can cause people to fall in love again, alter their views of themselves and make life worth living.
Amelie Powlain (Audrey Tautou) is a beautiful girl living in Paris, who waits tables at a local restaurant, and discovers that pleasure can be found in simple things: skimming stones across water, cracking the top of her Creme Brunee with a spoon, and ultimately taking a genuine interest in the lives of the people around her.
The direction of Jeunet and the magical photography of Bruno Delbonnel, creates an otherworldly Paris, a Paris that Parisians knew existed but is now almost forgotten. There's no graffitti on the walls, the charming streets are rubbish free, and the soft hue of that special Parisian light, which is well known to some of us, is captured with subtle intensity. This is truly another world that we can only wish for.
It is certain that viewers of this unusual and beguiling film will come away with the feeling that life is about simple pleasures, and kindness, random acts of kindness, can change the destiny of people around us in profound ways.

I could see this train wreck coming at the beginning. How sweet! Cute lonely girl helps others find happiness. Will she find love and happiness herself? Duh! ...! If you want to see a great film about how one person affects others, one that has great writing, acting, character development that is far above this ""Amelie"" tripe, then rent or buy ""Vagabond,"" a film by Agnes Varda starring Sandrine Bonnaire.

The lush, glowing red, green, and blue of Montmarte creates the kind of Parisian fantasy and fantastic Paris everyone conjures in their dreams.

Although the dialogue is in Parisian French with English subtitles, this doesn't detract from the viewing experience like it does in some other foreign films.
Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and costarring Dominique Pinon (you'll see the same credits -- directed by and costarring -- in the wonderful French film ""Delicatessen"" and the American film ""Alien: Resurrection""), ""Amelie"" was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Film. From her childhood and the comedic horror it wrought with a suicidal pet fish and the very unusual demise of her mother to her newfound purpose in life to help complete strangers this is a feel-good comedy full of surprises and wonderful visual effects. Amelie is kind of like Ally McBeal, without all the whining and self-pity. She has a very healthy imagination and sometimes retreats into it, but not to the point that she ignores the real world. In fact, she most often affects the real world using her imagination. She is not self-concious or shy, except when it comes to going after her own dreams.

The picture was tinted green digitally, so don't think that's a Paris thing.  It is beautiful and colorful throughout with great sets and Paris locations.  It has a great French-sounding instrumental soundtrack.  Interesting camera movement and angles and quick editing add to the effectiveness of the great story.  There is a quirkiness to it in style and characters that is similar to Jean-Pierre Jeunet's other films like Delicatessan and City of Lost Children.  I saw Delicatessan on cable many years ago, so I can't really compare the two.  I recently rented City of Lost Children.  Liked it, but I love Amelie.  France has yet another beautiful actress on their hands.  Hope to see much more of Miss Tautou in the years to come.  She's a good reason to start liking subtitles.
Probably my favorite film of the last year and certainly on my all-time favorites list.  I couldn't believe it lost to No Man's Land for the Best Foreign Film Oscar.  Probably because it doesn't make any political statements.  I saw both.  No contest.  My only ""complaint"" is that is seemed a bit long.

It is a realistic slice of Parisian life, with scenes in empty subway stations, apartment rooms,bistros,  courtyards and parks. It is a quirky romantic tale of a woman getting to know herself and finding her soul mate. It is also a montage of vignettes about people in Amelie's everyday world. These characters are portrayed so well that one finds themself drawn not only to Amelie, but  to these others as well. We care about what happens to them all. Finally, and most uniquely, this movie reflects a deep truth. Amelie decides to slowly change her world, by  performing little acts of kindness for those people around her.

1706342,2,B0000640VO,"After having read the blistering attacks on this movie in the French daily ""Liberation"",  I expected to either really like this movie or really hate it.  As it turns out, I just found it to be rather mediocre.
Bored, mostly working class, lives follow their course without hope of positive resolution.  The protagonist, Amelie, decides to add some magic to these lives by arranging a series of coincidences.  In other words, Amelie is sort of like God in a Kieslowski movie.  The only problem is that you get a buzz like the one you get from a McDonald's Happy Meal...empty calories, high on sugar.  Amelie has that glossy look just like the pretty people in those fragranced women's magazines.
So I can see why the French Left would have such a low opinion of this movie.  In a time of deindustrialization and rise of the Right, when most people hope to escape their ""fate"" by winning the lottery, arrives a film like Amelie which bolsters our hope that there are fairy-godmothers who will swoop down at the last moment and rescue us.
Well, you say, that is reading too much into it.  Perhaps. But even as pure fantasy, I found that it fell flat. There are some funny scenes, like the Gnome in New York!  It's a film that appeals to the French love of nuance and making mysteries unravel
slowly and enticingly....des trucs interessants.  For these reasons, I have given it two stars.

If a bad day is plaguing you, pop this one in and revel in its instant catharsis. Starring doe-eyed, instantly charming Audrey Hepburn incarnate Audrey Tautou as the shy but quirky main character, the viewer is instantly transported into her delicately colored, imaginative world. Amelie leads a quiet life, working as a waitress in a restuarant filled with dysfunctional characters, occasionally caring for her friend's cat and indulging in simple pleasures. Then one fateful day, her life changes forever. Upon finding a childhood keepsake and returning it to the owner, she becomes a secret guardian angel to the people around her. But while she can make others happy, she just can't seem to make things click with handsome stranger Nino (the talented and good looking Mathieu Kassovitz).

This story of a lonely girl becoming a do-gooder and eventually doing good for herself becomes a beautiful fantasy. It is a feel good movie without the usual audience manipulation tricks.
If any one thing is a negative in this film, it is the lack of an English dubbing option. The debate over which way is the best to watch a film in a foreign language, dubbed or subtitles, comes down to personal preference. I personally like to see films both ways, subtitled to hear the vocal tones and inflections actors give, preserving the film as the director intended; and dubbed so I can watch the visuals while understand what's being said. This film has so many wonderful visuals, at times I felt I was missing a lot while hurriedly reading the subtitles. It's unfortunate the DVD didn't come with a choice of viewing.

Though this film has many special effects and an interesting directing style, it is the acting, the writing, and the solid direction that make it a classic. I especially enjoyed the character writing for the characters at the cafe where Amelie works! The techniques and especially the unconventional special effects that the director use may remind you of ""Moulin Rounge"". Not only do we see Amelie and her life, we see her mind too thru floating images of Amelie's thoughts that hover on the side of the screen. At first, I was afraid the director would overuse these techniques. Hapily, these images always had purpose in showing the impish nature of Amelie, and always made me laugh!

Amelie tries to support other people (without noticing it) to realize their dreams and to solve their problems. She also includes her own ""craze"" in a game of confusion  which shows the fear and the contemporary wish of a relationship with this person clearly.
It's a magical movie which Jean-Pierre Jeunet brought onto the screen of our cinemas and now our TVs. He succeeded in shooting an unusual movie which is told with nice rides and adjustments of the camera, with much irony and joke, with much love and romantic, with a nicely told story and with beautiful ideas.

1706351,5,B0000640VO,"That's what I think of this movie.  The imagery, tale, and whimsy all put together on one tiny disc so beautifully, that once you see this you will feel the same.
The first thing you will notice is the stunning camera work, then the actors, then the plot.  The direction of this is so brilliant.  The tale itself is pure whimsy but it will leave you with a sense of well-being.
All of the cast did an exceptional job and you will find that reading the subtitles is, in most cases, not neccessary.  The director, actors and cinematographer have the uncanny ability to tell the entire story, along with mood that even if you don't read the subtitles, or for that matter understand French you will know what is going on.  The actors delivery of thier lines let you in on every detail that is happening or about to happen.
The extras on this DVD is worth a look as well. Most of the time the ""behind the scenes"" stuff that laden DVD's  is worthless, such is not the case.  Take the time to look at all of the interviews and in particular, the director and the cinematographer.  When you get a glimpse as to what it took to make this, you will be astounded.  Sure it's not full of car chases, explosions or any other very high-tech special effects, but rather the director's vision and use of color to set the tone of every single scene.  It is amazing.  When you hear those blowhard directors talk about pouring thier souls into films generally, you pay no mind.  However, with Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it's a whole different issue.  The attention he paid to even the smallest detail is impressive, to say the least.
I find this film to be more palatable than his ""City of Lost Children"" which is a bit more like ""Brazil"". Jean-Pierre Jeunet, can get a tad complicated at times, but in Amelie, he does not lose focus for one second and you finish the film with the thought that there is a little bit of Amelie in all of us, but perhaps there should be more.
It doesn't matter if you are male or female, if you like action or sci-fi, this is not  a ""chick flick"", this is a film for all. One of the best films made last year that should have had more recognition than it did.

1706352,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is a rare delight.  The title character is a painfully shy loner who discovers a small box filled with a little boy's keepsakes.  She seeks the rightful owner of the box.  The charm of this film is that Amelie wants to perform her little miracles, hiding in the shadows, with no recognition for herself.  The characters in this piece are fascinating, each one reflecting back a facet of Amelie's personality.  In the end, Amelie's compassion ends up being her own salvation - and that is what makes the film so much of a joy to watch.  Hollywood has pretty much exchanged emotion and subtlety for rudeness, crudeness, and over processed digital special effects.  Like a good French wine, this motion picture is an experience to be savored - not devoured.  Amelie has a look and feel that stands out from anything I've seen in recent years.  So many modern films are filtered with a grayish or orange tint, which tricks the viewer's eye into thinking it is watching a stark, gritty documentary.  Steven Soderbergh seems to be the reigning master of this technique.  Amelie by contrast, with it's deep reds and fluorescent and forest greens accented by cobalt blues and electric yellows, transports you to a world full of magic and hope.  The effect is enchanting.
The DVD package is complete with commentaries and documentaries on the making of the film.  These added features make it clear that this film was carefully planned by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, much like ""The Sixth Sense.""  Shots were storyboarded, set up, and orchestrated months in advance.  And any extra footage of Audrey Tautou is always welcome in my home.  A blend of the beauty and grace of Audrey Hepburn, the humor and physical skill of Charlie Chaplin, and the vulnerability of early Winona Ryder, and the sultry elegance of a sixties European model.  Her method of using her eyes, facial expression, and body language (relying less on verbal expression) to create a character is what helps makes Amelie transcend language barriers.
I was a little disappointed there wasn't a version with dubbed English, but after 15 minutes or so, I didn't even notice that I was reading subtitles.  There were more than quite a few belly laugh moments, and it became very apparent that this is one of those rare films that is so good it completely transcends culture, language - the universal message is ""The good you do for others returns - especially when you don't expect it to.""  A French delicacy.  I just hope we get to sample more of Jeunet, Tautou, and the rest of this team's products soon.  Thanks, Miramax.",1028937600,6,2586,4.81859410430839
1706353,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is a charming film from innovative French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City of Lost Children, Alien:Resurrection) starring a lovely doe-eyed Audrey Tautou.  In telling the tale of kindness and relationships, this movie has the unique look of Jeunet's other films (and uses many of the actors we've seen in his earlier work) with characters and situations that are more accessible.

Special features include: a commentary track with Jeunet, in French or English; a featurette, 'The Look of Amelie'; outtakes; screen tests by Audrey Tautou (Amelie), Urbain Cancelier (the abusive greengrocer) and Yolande Moreau (the lovelorn concierge); Q&A sessions with Jeunet or with Jeunet and cast members; a storyboard comparison of the scene in which Amelie rides through the funhouse; an intimate chat with Jeunet, in which he describes the process of getting the film made, its snubbing at Cannes, and its subsequent commercial and critical success; 'Home Movies', inside the making of the film; French and American trailers and tv spots; a scrapbook; and cast and crew filmographies.

I think Jeunet is the most interesting French director working today.  Amelie is visually dazzling and narratively both compelling and charming. The special features are plentiful and interesting, and make the dvd version worthwhile, particularly if you are interested in the work of this fine director.

Highly recommended.",1028937600,10,1422,5.534562211981567

Yes, she will revenge people who have been mean to herself or someone she likes. Yes, she will steal her father's gnome and send it along with someone who is traveling with picture updats :)). Yes she will cut and paste her neighbor's past husband's letter into a new one, then sent it to the neighbor as a lost letter found up in Mount Blanc. Yes, no matter she goes she will always notice the stone she likes for skipping it. And yes, she will hear Stalin telling her not to care about what the glass man told her.
There are so man things in this movie that will make you smile. My favorite parts were that she went to the photo booth with Zorro's uniform (she imagined it, too, while she revenged on the grocery shop owner for one-armed Lucien); and when Nino first went to the coffee shop while she stood behind and denying she was the Zorror girl and pass a piece of paper to him. Kind of remind me some childish love in young age. Well, I guess her childish (or genuine I should say) nature is the momentum of the movie and is what makes her so cute. I must applaud for Audrey Tautou. She did an incredible job being Amelie.
It's hard to end this comment because there are so much to say about, but I will just end it this way. Watching Amelie is just like reading Zola's story. While following Amelie through her daily life, we have all become herself in the end of film. I believe for people who love this movie, you will smile for at least a week.",1028937600,2,1761,4.244047619047619

Also, I had heard such glowing reviews about this film that I was prepared to be disappointed as well as frazzled.  I could not have been more wrong.
This is a wonderful, wonderful film.  Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a mousey girl living in Paris whose life is so ordinary that it borders on pathetic.  One day she discovers a tin box in her apartment with little toys and keepsakes of a young child that was hidden behind a wall decades ago.  She sets out on a mission to find the boy and return the treasures to him.  If the mission has a positive effect, she vows to devote herself to doing good deeds for others.  This leads to numerous touching and droll adventures, where Amelie doles out her own personal brand of justice to various characters, both good and evil.  Along the way she discovers love and turns it into a cat and mouse game of mystery and fascination, making her lover fall for her and pursue her without ever knowing who she is.
The story is brilliantly written, with a wry sense of humor.  Only the French could make mundane situations so funny, ironic, charming and philosophical at the same time.  It is a marvelous mix of intrigue, misdirection and offbeat humor.  Director Jean Pierre Jeunet squeezes the maximum amount of wit, sentimentality and humanness from every frame.  The Parisian street scenes are wonderfully done showing us more of an insider's look at Paris than a tourist's guidebook.
Audrey Tautou is captivating in the lead role.  She reminds me of Audrey Hepburn, full of breathy enthusiasm with a twinkle in her eye and mischief on her mind.  When she is good she's wonderful, and when she's bad she's even better.
This is an enthralling delight of a film, like a glass of sparkling French burgundy.  It will make you chuckle and tug your heart strings.  I rated it a 10/10.  Even if you hate subtitles, see this film.  You won't regret it.",1028851200,19,2012,4.569832402234637

The visuals are amazing, Jeunet really shows off his eye for directing, hopefully he can do more like this in the future and stay away from stinkers like Alien: Resurrection.
The humor works very well, quirky but charming, like the rest of the film. The bits like the minute details about the characters and their interactions are very humorous.
Which brings me to Amelie herself...Audrey Tautou is amazing, simply the most adorably cute actress ever. Her acting is well-done, the expressions and messages she conveys without speech are very eye-opening, close to the silent antics of Keaton or Chaplin.
Some might call it overstatement, but this is one of the best films ever. A must-see, especially now when the summer movie period is winding down and you need a break from the mindless action and popcorn movies out there. A must-own.",1028764800,2,865,5.013888888888889

In the movie, we are witnesses of the adventures of Amelie, since her birth till her quest for true love. We discover magic is also knowing our neigborghs, taking care of the people we are constantly in touch with, as the guy in the store, the old man at the door, etc. And we can also truly enjoy the little things about being alive, by seeing the ways of Amelie taking care of an old boring father, an excentric boss, or a mistery in the photo machines at the central station.
The action is as fast as it would be in a thriller flick, but here we are enjoying a comedy. Definitely a great movie to see and to enjoy.",1028678400,,831,4.367741935483871

I could just watch the movie without any sound, but really and the movie would still be captivating. The settings, the props, the clothing..... everything, down to the tiniest detail was important to the people working on this film and it shows. There is absoltley nothing gratuitus about this movie. I have heard people say they have turned it off within the first few minutes because of this, and I must say they are wrong. There is absolutely nothing bad in this film. There is one scene which mentions orgasms.... but come on, exactly what is the problem with this? The story is about life, love and how the little things matter.
The only problem with the American DVD version at least is that the translation is very wrong at certain points. I can't understand how some of them were made, but it is not a major problem.
If you like Amelie, you would probably like L'argent de Poche(translated as Small Change, even though, again, I don't agree with the translation........ I sound very uppity, sorry reader).",1028419200,18,1154,4.606796116504855

There is one thing more I have to say. There are a lot of people complaining about the ""sexual"" content of this movie, and I'm shocked, that it is rated R. Why? You wanna know something? Here in Germany, the movie is rated ""6"", that means that everyone from the age of 6 can watch it!! Come on! Don't be so prude!

From the opening childhood scenes to the climaxes of discovery (I loved who the man in the photos turned out to be) there was absolutely nothing about this movie I did not like. Most DVDs should be rentals - you watch them once and then they gather dust on the shelf - but I'm sure I'll be watching this one for years to come.

1706373,5,B0000640VO,"Supposedly charming movies I have hated:  ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Pretty Woman,"" ""Serendipity.""  Of course, serial infidelities and street prostitution *are* pretty delightful, so it's probably just me being a pill...
Instead of taking rather ugly situations and insisting without any particular proof that they are adorable or romantic, ""Amelie"" shows the effect that a particular mindset can produce, making the very ordinary into something magical.  While not exactly an advertisement for the Power of Positive Thinking, the advantages of a mischievous, curious approach to life are certainly amplified here.
""Amelie"" is not all sweetness and light.  Despite her appeal, the character Amelie is sly and secretive and has an unsettling disregard for the consequences of her actions.  Her playfulness takes on an air of cruelty in her treatment of the mean-spirited greengrocer, and I began to wonder if she orchestrated the romance for her co-worker out of friendship or spite... However, it is her playfulness that, for better or worse, makes things happen.
Unlike most movies meant to entrance audiences (i.e., like those named above), ""Amelie"" takes place in a recognizable world where all the ordinary rules apply. Except for the contrivance of Amelie's occasional asides to the camera, demonstrating the workings of her busy mind, nothing happens in this movie that could not happen in real life.  The charm of this film rests on these practical underpinnings, and it is Amelie's imagination which provides the glow.
Having never been to Paris, I can only say that the Paris of this film looks and feels exactly like Paris is supposed to:  twisty little streets, tilty old buildings, wheezy accordions, and ample evidence of le chic which happens to be very shabby.  And so far as the look of Amelie herself, so much has been said about Audrey Tautou and her doll-like, anime-eyed darlingness that I needn't say anything more on the subject.  Oh, OK, one more thing:  she makes a very sexy Zorro!
So Amelie's love interest works in a porn shop.  So people in France have (not-very-graphic, actually) sex.  The sexual content is minimal and struck me as being mostly farcical - it's romance that is taken seriously here. I have no kids, but I think many would find it OK for older children, especially since there's so much else to enjoy - I would be more concerned about a child's ability to read the subtitles and keep up with the story!",1028246400,,2453,5.029629629629629

Gradually, however, she starts meddling in the lives of her neighbors and co-workers and finds that she loves doing it. She becomes fascinated by a man who collects discarded instant-photos in the train station and, with the use of some clever photos of herself, they fall love.

The thing that makes Amalie so utterly irresistible is the script: Amalie talks directly to the audience and shares her candid thoughts throughout the movie. She is funny and clever. The star, Audrey Tatou, reminds you instantly of Audrey Hepburn. She is petite, perky, and has her own style. She is simply adorable. I saw it twice and I'm going to get the video. I enjoyed hearing the beautiful French spoken in the film; it added to the film, making it seem lighter and more joyous.  Amalie makes life seem wonderful!",1027987200,7,905,4.832258064516129

(And, not to take anything away from either actress, but Audrey Tautou reminded me of another famous Audrey. She had that same ""je ne sais quoi"". That's the limit of my high school French!) The movie has what is missing in so many American movies and that is multi-layers-- mini-stories that don't detract from the main story but add a lot to it. The only bad thing I can say was I had a heck of a time accessing the subtitles and getting them in English. Maybe the DVD (a rental) had a glitch in it but it wasn't a very friendly menu and unfortunately, I don't understand French well enough to follow it in a movie. Liked the music, too.

Despite the fact that i have always had a liking for horrormovies and that sort, this has turned out to be the best movie experience i have ever had, and it is definetely NOT a horrormovie. It is the wonderful tale of a young girls struggle to make other people happy and thereby making herself happy. Should you think that this sounds really boring, then let me tell you that in the hands of any other director than Jeunet it probably would be, but he manages to make it into not only a fantastic story but an audio-visual experience beyond anything i have seen in a long time.
Not only is the story funny, charming and welltold, but the technical side of it all is also topnotch. The actors, especially Audrey Tautou(Amelie), the rest of the cast, the director Jeunet and the rest of the crew behind this film, has simply given themselves 110 procent. There is simply not one weak link in this movie.
So if you are looking for a movie to cheer you up, or if you are just looking for something a little different than the usual hollywood-run of the mill, then give this great movie a chance. I promise you it is better than alcohol, drugs and pills, at least it put a big smile on my lips all of the times that i  have seen it!
PS. And if you can stop from falling helplessly in love love with Amelie then you must surely have a hard of stone or a very bad taste in women!
PSS. Dont be fooled by the fact that Jeunet also made ...Alien 4, he has made a gigantic comeback here with Amelie.
By the way while you're here, buy a copy of his two earlier french films ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of the lost children"", although they are not quite as good as Amelie, they are still very entertaining.",1027987200,,1815,4.257971014492754
1706400,5,B0000640VO,"This is a French romantic comedy set in Paris and almost told as a fairy tale. Is this a postmodern version of Cinderella? Close, perhaps, but the slipper seems to be a picture. Yes, you get to actually see places in Paris you might have visited. I was especially delighted for that reason.

I don't remember the last time I laughed so much while watching a movie. In fact, maybe it was when watching ""What About Bob."" Which proves psychological hilarity does appeal to my sense of humor to the extreme.

First you have two obsessive compulsive parents who never fully develop into characters you can admire or dislike. They simply exist in this movie as some sort of semblance of balance for the dysfunctional life Amelie (Audrey Tautou ) has woven her fragile existence between until her parents are torn apart by death. For the first part of her life, she is not shown normal affection and finally retreats into her own imagination. Deprived of love and basic childhood pleasures, like friends, Amelie lacks social skills in various areas, while she seems to survive working as a waitress in an eccentric caf.

One day her life changes. She is watching the news and is so shocked by the revelation she drops something that rolls to a bathroom tile, that reveals a hidden treasure. She vows to return the treasure to the original owner.

There is something beautiful about Amelie's character. She embodies an innocence long forgotten and therefore her vindictive side in regards to the corner grocer will have you rolling on the floor. The man (Mathieu Kassovitz) she falls for is of course even more eccentric than she is and well, he works in a place that might not delight you and there are a few seconds here and there of adult naughtiness. They could have left out the dancer and the shop where he works because technically those items are not really woven well into the story. A more hilarious view is taken of sex in this movie and there are no serious love scenes to be sure. His character is not fully developed and they focus more on Amelie's life and longings.

Amelie sees herself as an angel/avenger. Half the time she is helping the eccentric characters find their way to happiness, while the hilarity comes from her attempts to ""teach"" other rather rude characters a good lesson. Then Amelie sends her father's garden gnome all over the world and this inspires him to travel. She seems to inspire others to follow their dreams.

In the process she discovers that having heart only shows her half the real picture in life. She needs a soul mate to complete her. Being the completely innocent character she is, she would of course find someone who is rather a nonconformist in a way. He spends some of his time collecting torn up pictures from a photo booth and is seeking to solve the mystery of his life. Who is the man who keeps appearing to have his picture taken?

Watch for a moment of pure spectacular creativity when water splashes all over the floor. There are artistic moments of bliss in this movie!

Nostalgic in places and poignant scenes that will catch you off guard as you find yourself suddenly crying and maybe relating to Amelie in some intimate way as you realize that you too have had dreams that didn't always come true just when you wanted them to.

Completely modern movie making and has academic nuances here and there to delight the poet in you. A cozy Parisian Soundtrack is included to match.

A similar experience to watching Moulin Rouge because you have an intense desire to watch this over and over again. I think it is just so visually stimulating and the details can hardly be absorbed in one viewing.

A feel good movie that leaves you with a sense that
there is still beauty and sweet innocence left somewhere in the world.

Or maybe that is just a fantasy...

1706403,5,B0000640VO,"The most compelling part of AMELIE is the way that it tantalises the eyes.  While the viewer knows in his or her heart that Paris never really looked this clean or beautiful, the film nevertheless manages to delight every second of its 122 minute run time.  The colors, the light, the imagery, the fantasy:  all blends together to entrance and excite the viewer.  In this way, the film harkens back to the earliest films made, those by another resident of Paris, Lumiere.  There was no real point to those little films except to startle and delight the viewer, and in that sense the film follows very much in that tradition.
Audrey Tautou is a wonder!  I hope that she makes very many films.  She is utterly adorable, and a delight to look at with her black hair and apparently matching eyes.  With a lesser actress, this film might have been fun to look at, but would not have engaged the viewer emotionally.  As it is, we care very much for her to find happiness in addition to helping others to find it, because we come to like her.  The rest of the cast was also very enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed Serge Merlin as ""The Glass Man,"" socalled because he has especially brittle bones.  The film conceit of having him constantly work on hyperrealistic copies of paintings of Renoir works marvelously, though he shouts so loudly a couple of times that I was surprised that he didn't break a couple of ribs.
Everything in this film conspires to make it an enjoyable experience.  Visually, as I have mentioned, it is utterly stunning.  The cinematography and the art direction is just extraordinary.  I loved the soundtrack, and for the hour or two after seeing this the strains of the accordion kept playing through my head.
All in all, this is as enjoyable a piece of eye candy as I have encountered in a long, long time.  It is as visually arresting as another recent film set in Paris, MOULIN ROUGE, but I personally found the film as a whole far more enjoyable.",1027814400,2,1965,4.571428571428571

Perhaps, but it IS a remarkable movie, an incredibly sweet, touching little story about a woman who takes it upon herself to go about changing people's lives for the better, but finds herself afraid to take bold steps in her own life.
In an interview on the DVD Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet said this film came about out of a desire he had to bring something positive into the world. He succeeded beautifully. In addition to a tender story about love and courage, this is a strikingly visual film. Jeunet's use of color and angles leaps off the screen the way very few American movies do.

Some of her experiences are almost surreal and definitely magical. I smile whenever I think of this movie, which is smart, enormously likable, and visually interesting.
Amelie's desire to do good and make others happy creates a touching story of the triumph of good. She accomplishes her goals via complex strategies, and always anonymously. There is no preaching, just a fast-paced story enhanced by a fantastic star and numerous interesting sub-plots.
The one thing Amelie has the most trouble with is mustering enough courage to let a young man, Nino, know how she feels about him. Both of them are too shy to approach each other directly, which leads to some funny scenes.

Whether it's returning a childhood treasure to it's elderly owner to bringing two people together, Amelie goes about bringing just a bit of happiness to those around her. But will she find it herself?
For those who have seen the 'Delicatessan' and 'City of Lost Children' before, director Jeunet brings the same aesthitics to 'Amelie' as he did to those films. Each scene is beautifully filmed, with CG effects thrown in here and there to spice up some of the scenes. There are only a few primary colours used in each shot, but it works well giving the film a look of it's own.
The actors are great as well, each one performing the individually appealing characters perfectly.

1706409,5,B0000640VO,"I was vaguely interested in viewing Amelie mostly due to the picture of the charming Audrey Tautou on the film poster. I had viewed two of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films before - 'City of Lost Children' and 'Alien: Resurrection', the former being a dark and cynical fairy tale and the latter being the most forgettable of the Alien films. So the bright, cheerful and optimistic feel of the film came as a complete and total surprise - and the storyline hit a little bit too close to home.
Ever remember what it was like being a teenager? If you're good looking, you've got nothing to worry about, but if you're slightly overweight and have an acne problem, then you can pretty much forget hanging out with the in-crowd. I spent most of my teenage years alone, with no friends to spend time with. Fortunately, my adult life has been a lot more fun. So I could very easily empathise with what Amelie was going through - she uses her good deeds as a way of connecting with the rest of humanity - a way of not feeling alone. So for me, the ending of the film has a huge resonance, and that final romantic image will stay with me for a very long time.
I'm glad that I didn't see this film in the theatre with an audience. The themes in this film are way too personal - the concept of being lonely, separated from the rest of society and trying (and succeeding) in forming a connection with the people around you. I'm glad that I could watch this film on DVD, in the privacy of my own home.

I ran out and bought the disc as soon as I saw it appear on the shelves (it happened to be on sale), brought it home yesterday and watched it this morning.  I was thoroughly impressed and entertained!  This is a romantic comedy like no other I have ever seen.  The French certainly have a refreshing sense of humor.  There are a few objectionable scenes (they were fun), but this is really a PG film, all things considered.  You can gather plenty of information about Amelie by reading other reviews so I will not waste your time with it.  I will say that you will not be disappointed at all.  If you liked The Cutting Edge, Six Days [and] Seven Nights, Sleepless in Seattle, or other such films, then this one is sure to paste a huge smile on your face and hold it there for two straight hours.

1706414,5,B0000640VO,"With a delightfully playful exterior and subtle inner wisdom, Amlie reveals a world within the world of our perceptions, where not everything absolutely must be as it seems, if only you take a moment to peel away the surface layers of life's hidden fruits and let the pulp rain in droplets onto your tongue.
A magical composition of stories within a story, Amlie challenges us through gentle suggestion and colorful detail to think past the ordinary, to see the world through our mind's eye and, as Amelie does herself, to notice the things nobody else does. Vibrant, fascinating and compelling characters encourage us to see past the outer weave of personality and peek inside, where everyone has a little lost soul inside, waiting to be appreciated.
Most of all, perhaps, this story reminds us that a world of inspiration is often as close as our own backyard.",1027555200,,862,4.870748299319728

1706429,4,B0000640VO,"""Amelie"" is one of the few foreign-language films to use the DVD format to its potential. The director, enthusiastic DVD collector Jean-Pierre Jeunet, says he was inspired by M. Night Shyamalan's work on the first ""Sixth Sense"" DVD and by Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky"" commentary. Jeunet, who recently polished up his English, can be hard to understand at first, but soon proves a captivating storyteller.
Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel's bold images are captured in widescreen (2.35:1), with enhancements for 16:9 monitors. The odd but captivating green color scheme, saturated to verdant plushness in digital post-production, looks great. The cirque reds, blues and yellows retain their vibrant pop. The Dolby Digital (5.1) audio, however, fails to keep up with the playfulness of the Oscar-nominated sound editing (no DTS, alas). Still, the sound is strong and clear. Rear speakers are used sparingly, leaving the heavy lifting to the front three. Center channel voices are clear and resonant without boominess; the subwoofer stays busy keeping up with the boomerang dynamics.
A 13-minute featurette on ""The Look of 'Amelie' "" shows Jeunet working his visual magic. Jeunet replaced the sky in many of his outdoor shots, preferring to create his own weather digitally. The seemingly naturalist film is in fact crammed with special effects, he points out. A scene in which Amelie skips rocks across water was done digitally because the actress couldn't get the hang of throwing stones. The ""explosion of color"" in the film came as digital timing was manipulated to saturate the images. ""We could change everything (digitally),"" Jeunet says. ""It was a miracle.""
Although the movie was written for Emily Lloyd, we know Amelie as French actress Audrey Tautou, the highly photogenic but rubber-faced comedienne who charmed audiences worldwide. Disc 2 includes her screen test, which made the director's casting decision an easy one. (There are a few clips of the actress having her long hair cut into the famed Amelie bob and some funny blooper clips.)
 True to the spirit of ""Amelie,"" the typical making-of featurette is replaced by ""home movies"" that have fun with elements from the film such as the photo-booth snapshots and the hilarious orgasm blitz. The screen-test section includes a must-see performance by Yolande Mureau, who powered her way into the role of Amelie's landlady.
Menu screens are beautifully done, mixing stylized cast photos and scratchy moving images",1027296000,2,2473,5.324808184143222
1706430,4,B0000640VO,"Amelie is a French comedy that recently caused a small stir in the U.S. It's quite a bit different than your standard fair, but is a pleasing, enjoyable movie to watch. The film follows the main character, starting with a graphic birth scene, and transposing us to her adulthood as she begins a quest to find company and a place in the world. Much of the films feel-good appeal comes from Amelie's clever tricks and gags, including a home-alone like stint in an angry grocers home. The films visuals are nice, with some beautiful shots, and the sound track is excellent as well. Amelie's gently plot and lack of much conflict may not appeal to some viewers, but provides a nice relaxing movie. I wouldn't recommend watching it with the kids though, it's rated R for excessive amounts of sexuality.",1027296000,,797,4.7
1706431,5,B0000640VO,I did not see this film at the theatre but was so sure I would like it I pre-ordered it and have just now viewed it for the first time...Ive got to say it is the best movie that I have seen in a long time and can scarcely recall a film that I enjoyed as much as Amelie.  It is everything that a great movie should be with many interesting and artful details that defy description.  Director Jeunet is pure and simple A Genius and Tatou was born to play the title role like no one youve ever seen.  Dont miss this if you love great movie-making.,1027296000,3,544,4.018518518518518
1706432,5,B0000640VO,"While the characters of Ally McBeal from the television show and Amelie are different and certainly Calista Flockhart & Audrey Tautou are worlds apart, one thing that appealed to me about the tv show also appeals to me about this film.  The expressionistic element is wonderful in Amelie.  Just like we used to see arrows actually flying at McBeal's heart when she was suffering a romantic heartbreak, we see Amelie literally melt into water in this film.  These are great touches.
Jeunet carefully planned the film, using storyboards to plan down to the minute details of exact camera angles and film speeds.  The added commentary on the DVD is an eye opener as it is described how the digital imaging now allows for the filmmaker to tint the colors and control the look of the film.  Amelie represents a great technological achievement.
The story is touching and carried me along to the end as if the movie passed in an instant.  Just as Jeunet paid great attention to the look of the film, he has cast and shot the supporting characters with detailed attention.  Even Jean Darie who walks across the screen for about a minute as a blind man Amelie whisks through the city describing the city scene is memorable, without uttering a line.  Serge Merlin who played Drefayel the artist with the breakable bones who paints the same Renoir painting each year for the last 2 decades is marvelous and propels Amelie to go for the gusto, so to speak.  Isabelle Nauty as Georgette the tobacconist that Amelie falls in love is wonderfully dense and neurotic.
The themes of the picture are also playfully and entertainingly represented.  The innocence of Amelie and Nico is a touchstone for the picture.  This is contrasted by the world around them:  Nico works in a porn shop where Amelie bravely walks in to find him.  And while Amelie does try to make those around her happy, she also metes out justice as she sneaks into the apartment of the cranky grocer and puts foot cream where his tooth paste should be and shorts out an electrical cord sending sparks.
Finally, I enjoyed the romance of this picture.  Mathieu Kassovitz is wonderful as the Nino.  The final scene where Amelie wordlessly and tenderly kisses his eyes and neck with him returning the caress so gently was quite beautiful, and reflects the sweetness and innocence at the heart of the film.  I found the picture a complete joy and look forward to revisiting it again.  Bonjour!",1027296000,,2439,4.741706161137441

I mean, there may have been a select few who saw it and didn't like it, but they don't matter, do they? This is a magical little movie of instances, superb moments wherein a quirky young Frenchwoman is beset by grumps and cold shoulders. She sets out to make her world a better place by doing good for other people, succeeding greatly with each effort yet not really trying to improve upon her own life. There's another equally odd person that she's known since childhood and loved all the while. She freezes up whenver she nears him and runs off in a panic. This was an all around great movie. If you can get around reading subtitles then you'll enjoy this movie. I especially enjoyed Audrey Toutou (excuse any misspelling) in her alluring Zorro costume.

1706434,4,B0000640VO,"I really enjoyed Amelie. It was a fun sweet romance movie with a few twists. Compared to the standard Hollywood pacing, it feels a bit slow and plodding in some spots, but the quirkiness of the side plots help keep the entertainment coming. This film though about the modern world of real people is full of fantastic little touches made possible with great cinematography and rich special effects.
My only complaint isn't about the movie itself, but about the DVD. The DVD is in French, with the option to have English and Spanish subtitles. Loathe as I am sometimes to listen to overdubbed movies,I wish this DVD had the English overdub option. Reading the subtitles is a distraction from the beautiful filmwork and actors subtle visual performances.
I give the DVD 4 stars, and the movie itself, 5. It may not be for everyone (my wife slept most of the way through) but fans of foreign films and independent movies may greatly enjoy it.",1027123200,6,938,4.725609756097561
1706445,5,B0000640VO,"Last year the selection committee at the Cannes Film Festival in France proclaimed that Amelie was not `serious enough' to be included in the event. This slight didn't harm the movie's performance. It became one of France's biggest hits ever and went on to become the highest grossing French film ever released in America.
Amelie is pure fantasy. It takes place in that fabulous Paris that exists only in the movies - the Paris of Moulin Rouge, An American in Paris and Gigi. Movies as fantasy can be tricky, though. When poorly conceived, we roll our eyes and sigh, ""Only in the movies!"" But when done well, as in Amelie, we smile, feel good inside, and exclaim, ""Only in the movies!""
Amelie [Audrey Tautou] is 23 years old. She had a miserable childhood. After her mother died accidentally. her father mistakenly decided Amelie had a heart condition and treated her accordingly. She watched him become lonely and sad. Now, she works in a Paris cafe, surrounded by co-workers and customers as daffy and eccentric as she is. One day she finds a cigar box with a child's toys in it. It's been hidden away in her apartment for years. She decides to find its owner, and the happiness this act brings to a stranger causes her to make a hobby out of helping people. Sometimes, if a person deserves it, she plays tricks on them, but this is just part of her plan to help them. Her biggest challenge is to trick her father into coming out of his isolation. She also falls in love with a young man who hardly knows she exists. How she gets him is as strange and delightful as the ways in which she carries out her good works.
Tautou is wondrous as Amelie. Her big eyes, amazing hairdo, somewhat gawky manner, and quirky, knowing smile combine to make her character unique and charming.
The movie is photographed in wonderfully rich, warm tones that make Amelie's world most inviting.
Some critics seemed irritated by the movie, claiming that it manipulated their feelings. I didn't see it that way. We find out at the beginning that Amelie is a lonely child who finds happiness in a fantasy world. So, it's logical that she would see the good things in life as fantastical. Her actions always fit her odd view of reality.
The biggest drawback for some viewers is that the movie is in French. Imagine that! A French movie in French!",1027123200,2,2323,4.6

1706449,5,B0000640VO,"It is amazing what one person can accomplish when they really put their mind to it. I'm not talking about huge global changes here. Most of us will never be in a position where we can significantly impact a huge number of people in a positive way. This film shows that you really don't have to. Anyone who simply decides to make the lives around them better can succeed a lot more than they fail. Background, education and station have nothing to do with making that little decision and taking action on it.
Amelie is a simple girl, with simple tastes. Some one who would just as soon spend an evening skipping stones as going to a fancy restaurant with a man. She is not looking for love so much as direction. Up to the point where the story really begins, Amelie has been simply drifting, as most of us do. Victim of the events that her life has thrown at her. She has a job, an apartment and friends... Maybe not friends so much as aquaintences. The people she lives around and those she works with become her project. Amelie becomes a doer of good deeds.
The story plays out sweetly and with very inventive visuals. I'm sure we've all seen the trailers with the pig-lamp that turns itself off and the scene where Amelie disintegrates into a puddle of water after talking with a man she fancies. These effects are not distracting and really do lend themselves well to the progression of the story. Comparissons to Alley MacBeal are inevitable, but mostly inaccurate. Where the illusions on Alley's show were often violent or overtly sexual, those in Amelie are sweet and fanciful. The illustrate the nature of the young woman who has made it her goal in life to make those around her a little happier.

So when I saw Amelie on a plane, I thought I would surprise her with a great film that she would enjoy and I could gain some brownie points (even though I too enjoyed the movie immensely).
Without insulting the ""purists"" among those who may read this, I have to say that - for initial viewing - I think the lack of English dubbing on the DVD distracts from the movie.  One of the greatest things about Amelie is the visuals and the creative images in the film: its simply wonderful to look at.  I found myself spending half the time reading and, unfortunately, missing the visuals.  That was fine for me, as I had already ""seen"" it, but I don't think my wife got the same pleasure, though she too enjoyed the film.

1706453,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie was one of the best films I have seen this year. I absolutely loved it! Certain films have the ability to give you a fresh perspective - they can change the way you look at things - and Amelie is one of those films. And rarer still, Amelie combines this ability with some really hilarious moments and some equally touching scenes!
More specifically, my favorite thing about Amelie is its originality and creativity. It had a unique style that really allowed the viewer to get into the heads and hearts of the characters. This is probably due in part to the sarcastic, funny, and clever script and the remarkably effective voice over narration (which really sets the tone for the movie). Also, Amelie's originality and freshness is due to the interesting directing style.
Essentially, Amelie is about a young French waitress (Audrey Tautou) who decides to help people fix up their lives. In her haste to help others, however,... This plot summary really doesn't convey the charming quality of the movie...but believe me it was wonderful!
The acting was also great, and Audrey Tautou really reminded me of the other Audrey, the great Audrey Hepburn. They share the same shy glances, pretty faces, and delicate charm. In fact, in one scene in particular (when Amelie goes to meet Nino at the merry-go-round), I was sure that the director was poking fun at a classic Audrey Hepburn movie, Charade (where Audrey and Cary Grant meet in front of a merry-go-round), by dressing Amelie up in Audrey Hepburn style clothing. Did anyone else notice this?

Through the viewing of this film I have experienced no small amount of pain and, in these trying times, I feel it is my duty to save my fellow brethren from such a fate.  My suggestion... stay away from this life sucker.  This is a chick flick about a self-obsessed high maintenance hoochie-mama.  If it was starring Julia Roberts and was set in New York, you wouldn't touch it with a ten foot loaf of French bread.  Don't let the art house cloak fool you, this film will cause you pain.  It seems there are many people out there who enjoy watching this character run around for 2+ hours (in France) acting real cute, hence the stack of good reviews.  Hell, even I was curious.  But to me it felt like 5 hours of, albeit beautifully shot, trite French torture.  Some women will implore you to see this film.  Ignore them!  You may also want to carefully examine said women, as they probably feel akin to the heroin, and trust me, having a space cadet like Amelie in your life could only cause you harm in the long run.  If a man (or dude, depending on were you come from) recommends this film, slowly back out of the room so as not to arouse suspicion.

1706465,5,B0000640VO,"Just after the start of the director's commentary in English on disc 1 of ""Amelie,"" Jean-Pierre Jeunet warns the viewer something along these lines: ""If you want to keep the beauty of the film, the poetry of the film, intact . . . DON'T LISTEN TO ME!""
Granted, that advice may hold true for the commentary, with Jeunel pointing out which beautiful images were really only special effects or how many takes were required of certain scenes that look completely natural in the context of the film. But it almost certainly does not hold true for the DVD treatment itself of ""Amelie,"" which, even if it contained only half the features that it does, would STILL be one of the most wonderful and creative uses of the medium thus far. (And I say this because, as of right now, I've still only gotten through about half of those features myself!)
Jean-Pierre Jeunet admits to being a ""control freak"" here, and that may well be a large reason for including a whole other disc of material whose running time is probably as long as ""Amelie"" itself. But, in this case at least, the backstory is just as engrossing, and it actually serves to complement ""Amelie's"" themes of destiny and that sense of wonder that goes unnoticed by most people. Here's the best of what I've seen of it so far:
-- At the Q&A with Jeunet at the American Cinematheque in L.A.  last January, he good-naturedly apologizes for his broken English; as with that version of the director's commentary, an interpreter prompts him periodically. (Of course, considering that he apparently didn't speak it at all when he directed ""Alien: Resurrection,"" I didn't think his English was that bad.) He goes through a few of the true and even autobiographical elements of ""Amelie"" and, when asked about the influence of the French New Wave, blurts out, half-mockingly and to great applause, ""FORGET THE NEW WAVE!"" A ""new wave"" lasts for three seconds, Jeunet says -- not 50 years. Plus, he said it was better to make a French film that the audience would enjoy -- not just the filmmakers.
-- The screen tests feature Audrey Tautou, Urbain Cancelier (Collignon, the grocer) and Yolande Moreau (Madeleine Wallace, the concierge), but it's pretty obvious who's the star here. It's absolutely breathtaking to watch the lo-res video footage and see Audrey Tautou finish giving the screenmakers three-quarter shots of her face and then scrunch it up, open her eyes and just EMBODY Amelie -- and then go back to being an actress again. With Cancelier and Moreau, there's a similar sense that there's something happening, too.
-- My favorite feature so far, though, is the informal chat with Jeunet, which basically features the director sitting in (presumably) his office, facing the camera and just talking in French about some of the details that he faced while preparing and filming ""Amelie."" Some of them seem downright laughable now: He'd said in interviews that he'd wanted to make a small French film with universal, heartwarming appeal but didn't think that he had the stuff for it, couldn't get financing at first for it and then was rebuffed at Cannes because the president of the festival thought the film depicted a ""nauseating Paris."" It's also interesting to visualize Emily Watson in the role of Amelie: Jeunet initially was so dead-set on getting her that he had an English version of the screenplay written because she didn't speak French. But, just as with ""Amelie"" itself, it's hard not to break into a smile when Jeunet describes the sensation that the movie caused in France. In the first weekend, ""Amelie"" almost equals the overall admissions of his first feature, ""Delicatessen."" The French title of the movie becomes a pun in newspaper headlines throughout the country. And, following a private screening at the Presidential Palace, Jacques Chirac declares it one of the best nights that he's ever had (after a bad day that apparently included burning himself while making eggs over easy) and feels invigorated enough to go back to work again. My favorite part, though, is when Jeunet shows off two pieces of mail that he received from a particularly solid fan of ""Amelie."" There's a thank-you letter featuring Fotomat pictures of the girl dressed up as Zorro and then what appears to be a mock-up of the Garden Gnome. Neither piece of mail has Jeunet's address: They get to him because the girl has written an apparently persuasive enough letter to her mailman and included it with each package.
Anyway, you get the idea, and this is just a SMALL part of what's contained here. Of course, some of the stories are repeated a couple of times (both in English and in French), and it may be a bit extraneous to some viewers to sit through things like the Audrey Tautou blooper/out-take reel, the storyboard comparison and the multiple mentions that, YES, the color was digitally enhanced. But in a way, all these features reinforce the fact that ""Amelie"" really is a film much greater than the sum of its parts, and just as with the film itself, there's almost always something to catch your eye and demand your attention.
Bottom line, though: The DVD package of ""Amelie"" is beautifully faithful to the magic of the theatrical version, and it will definitely be something to treasure for a long, long time.",1026950400,4,5269,4.841463414634147
1706466,5,B0000640VO,"I saw all the 5 nominees for best picture for the academy awards (including A beautiful mind) and also the picture who won best foreign (no man's land) and this one has my vote for the best picture, american and foreign, of 2001. First of all it has a great look, not your typical color movie but more like a beautiful painting. You have a lot of green and red colors which makes it look different and particular but it works and the film look more artistic. One thing that makes a film work usually is the relation you develop with the main character(s), let me tell you I was in love with Am&eacute;lie (Audrey Tautou) 5 minutes after I've seen her for the first time. She reminded me of the other Audrey (Hepburn) who you fell in love with everytime you see her on the screen. This Audrey Tautou has the charm and the beauty that I can't find anywhere today (Julia Roberts...don't make me laugh). Her character has such a beautiful soul and so many sweet qualities that you love and root for her even more as the story goes along. The other characters surrounding her during this wonderful story are all very colorful and all different in their own way which makes for a richer movie. Since I am a big fan of silent movie, I like the way the story is told, the screenplay is great but a lot is told by images. This is a visual film and I'm not talking about explosions and major hollywood special effects, the emotions of Am&eacute;lie are often seen visually and this way of telling a story is not seen or not enough seen today. The great HBO series six feet under does that. The storyline is simple, Am&eacute;lie tries to make everyone happy around her and not thinking about her own happiness, the magic is the way the story is told and the high caliber performance of Audrey Tautou. The director tell, in one of the interview that you can see on the disc 2 of this double disc DVD, that he wanted Emily Watson (the english actress) for the role of Am&eacute;lie but she declined. She's a great actress but good for us cause Audrey Tautou is more than perfect. I've been waiting a few months for the US version of the movie (because here in Quebec we had a french release since june) and the wait is worthwhile. This is the ultimate version, you can see the french version with or without subtitles, 2 audio commentaries one in french (for me) and one in english and the second disc is full of interesting special features. Many interviews, screen tests, photos of the production, home movies and more. Thanks USA for this ultimate version which is much better than the single disc produced here.",1026950400,8,2603,4.459119496855346

1706469,5,B0000640VO,"Audrey Tautou is the shy, pixieish ""AMELIE"" in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's magical romantic comedy that has garnered nearly unanimous rave reviews wherever it has played.

And yes, it really is that good.

Gamin-like and wide-eyed, Tautou bears more than a passing resemblance to a youthful Audrey Hepburn and she is perfect in the part of a lonely waitress who accidentally discovers a small box of what must be a former tenant's childhood treasures behind a loose tile in the bathroom of her apartment in the Montmartre section of Paris. Even though the items obviously have no monetary value, she sets out to discover who hid them and return the decades old object to their rightful owner.  The strategies involved and the resulting success give her such a warm feeling she sets out to continue her acts of selfless kindness whenever the opportunity presents itself.  Along the way, she is surprised to discover that her needs and wants are being met and she has found someone to love that just might love her in return.  Naturally she plays out the game in the most charming of ways.

Jeunet, in an interview in the supplemental material, says this story has been in his head for more than twenty years.  And it shows in the nuanced details of every shot.  The fluid cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel perfectly matches the smooth flow of the constantly surprising story with sequences carefully composed and choreographed to underscore the emotion of every scene.

Furthermore, the entire film has been digitally tinted to match the patina hued paintings -- with splashes of red and spots of blue -- of a favorite Brazilian artist of the director.
In our cynical age of irony as entertainment, there's something special about experiencing a movie that reminds us of the sublime pleasure inherent in ""treating others as we wish to be treated.""  Make no mistake, this is not a message film, it's not preachy and neither is it a chick flick.  But rather a deeply beautiful film that charms on such a high level that it puts in proper perspective the dreck that poses as entertainment almost everywhere we turn.

Don't miss this marvelous film.  It will resonate in your heart and mind for a long time.",1026864000,5,2195,4.836898395721925

1706486,1,B0000640VO,"Usually when people think pompous movies they think of some rehash of a rehash of a Ingmar Bergman movie that slugs its way through the college film school circuit.  Low angles, black and white, abstract, etc.  (Hold on, I'm getting to my point) And what separates this stuff from the masters?  These young turks confuse their childish self-obsession with actually meaning something.
Of course anyone with a brain knows when they see a good piece of film and when they see a bunch of second rate irony in clove cigarette smoke.
But then what if these same people decided to say ""Wait!  Let's make something sooo precocious it'll make your eyes water!""  And that is what Jeunet did with Amelie.  Now I'm a huge fan of his work up until this point:  Delicatessen was excellent, so was City of Lost Children.  Geez, I even like Aliens Ressurection (try to find five other people who do)!
But I can't bring myself to like Amelie because it is so self-aware of its own cuteness.  You can almost hear them behind the camera giving each other high fives on how they saccharin this film is.  The entire point of Amelie's life seems to be ""I know people are watching me, and I know they know I know they are watching so watch how cute and adorable I can bat my big puppy dog eyes!""
Usually this happens with children actors in movies.  Sometimes you have the Haley Joel Osment of Sixth Sense: endearing because of his unmanufactured charm.  Sometimes you get the Haley Joel Osment of Pay it Forward: nauseating because of everyone trying to cash in on his brand name.  It is the difference between a hand written valentine and something from Hallmark.

The stylized imagery of ""Amelie"" is simply delicious and lush, from the opening credits to the end.  It is nothing like real life; it is reality that could only happen in film. And only in film as only the French could do it.
Wide-eyed Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Amelie in this storybook-like story.  Amelie is a 23-year-old waitress working in a Paris cafe, but she might as well be Madeline, that popular little denizen of Paris, for all her mischief and her child-like eagerness to make things right for other people.  A very unlikely story for a very jaded world. But director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a genius for pulling it off , and the score by Yanni Tiersen is a gem ( a must-buy--just listening to it conjures images of Paris sidewalks and cafes).

Like all of us, Amelie weaves personal mythology and dreamscape into a life which is far more than any exterior observer (all but one, the Glass Man, whose fragile bones keep him indoors painting and repainting a Renoir, while observing her across the way) can imagine. When she discovers a tin box holding some boy's memorabilia from decades back, she decides to return Lost Time to him, and finds that small acts can tilt others' destinies around her in unexpected ways. Also like all of us, when the same forces evidently conspire to give her the perfect invitation to introduce herself to the man she's most attracted to, she weaves an elaborate trail of clues and evasions through Paris, tempting fate with a sort of child's gamble, desperately hoping that destiny will, no matter how much she runs from it, bring them together.
  The film is filled with sharp little surprises and sudden laughter as her match-making gambits, her schemes of retribution against the vegetable seller who abuses his retarded assistant, and the plan to get her father to follow in the footsteps of the globe-trotting garden gnome she steals from his garden, all pay off.

1706513,4,B0000640VO,"What a fun film! From the moment it begins, ""Amelie"" bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. ""Amelie"" is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.
Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a naive girl working at the Two Windmills Cafe. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers).
I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical ""Bells Are Ringing"", with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.
After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role.
Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for ""Amelie"". The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery.
With films like ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"", ""With a Friend Like Harry"" and box-office hit ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"", French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with ""Amelie"", a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou's performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world.",1022889600,59,3702,4.4375917767988255

Her performance immediately draws the viewer in. She is supported by a wonderful supporting cast of characters, especially in my mind Lucien the assistant grocer and the younger Amelie. Also keep an eye out for the gnome.
This is truly an inspired movie that captures the magic of romantic comedies without force feeding the viewer romance and comedy (think Serendipity). Both the romance and comedy is subtle and wonderfully portrayed. If you've been searching for a well-done romantic comedy, this is it. Though the subtitles may be off-putting to some viewers, this is not a difficult movie to follow. Give it a chance - you will truly be glad you did.

Audrey Tatou is divine in her role of Amelie, a young French girl working in a cafe who has a moment of clarity, an epiphany so profound and simple that she is able to grasp it and act upon it without hesitation.  Simply put, to make peoples' lives better.  She then embarks upon a series of quests to do just that.  It is these quests that are the joy of the film, but fear not, Amelie is not left out.

Usually this kind of movie would be cloying and sentimental but Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to keep it both light, touching and at times marvellously funny.
Tatou is an absolute revalation as the central character, managing to remain at once cute and feisty.  Also important is the manner in which Amelie helps people, not just with small favours but with careful thought and intent that has a beautifully touching effect.  Added to this is a wonderful score and sumptuous photography that completely immerses its audience into the streets and gardens of Paris.
What's great about it though is that its never too sentimental and at times is genuinely humorous.  For instance, the list of what each character likes and dislikes is fantastically well observed.  To conclude, it's been a long time since there's been a movie of this kind that is both heart-felt and touching.

Amelie is a beautiful and touching movie.

Now that I have that out of my system could I ask for all lovers of this type of cinema to bug Amazon, DVD stores and anyone else they can think of to release Delicatessen on DVD?

I won't bore you with the story, as you have in excess of 200 other reviews here you can get that from!, but just wanted to say a few points about the movie; Audrey Tautou is simply wonderful in the lead role, the film has a fantastic opening sequence with Amelie as a young girl, it is full of uplifting moments (like when the man finds his childhood treasure box in the phone booth), it is vibrant in colour and has a great visual style, and a superb soundtrack by Yann Tiersen which fits the film perfectly...Amelie is simply a wonderful film that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible, even those that don't normally watch subtitled movies.",1019692800,,1221,4.579908675799087

Perhaps one of great cultural changes of recent times has been Hollywood's embrace of more & more foreign language movies (Life Is Beautiful, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Ring, Audition to name but a few).  Amelie's appearance is therefore as timely & strategic as it is wonderful.  The film embarks on a magical journey of a young & naive girl who works as a waitress in Montmartre & the quirks of her everyday life & the people with whom she encounters.  Amusing & touching, & perfectly shot, the tight script & gripping colours & cinematography render this oeuvre a captivating watch which shall mesmerise again & again.  Audrey Tatou plays the ingenue with such wit & charm (as the cheeky cover alone suggests) as a woman who influences others more than she wishes her own life to be influenced.  Some of the most captivating scenes are Tatou dashing pebbles across the water (it's ony about 15 seconds long but majestically shot) & the character introductions at the beginning (her parents are wickedly hilarious) & the evil greengrocer & Amelie's revenge on him.  If there's one movie you should consider purchasing it is definitely this.

1706561,5,B0000640VO,"Nietzsche looked to Wagner and Heidegger to Holderlein believing that artistic creations could set the new paradigms for the blossoming of human life. 'Enabling Myths' was Nietzsche's term. The trouble was that they both grew disillusioned with their artistic Gods; the Wagnerian insistence that love mattered more than power was really annoying for Nietzsche; whilst Holderlein's German nationalism seemed a little unfitting in the aftermath of WW2. The point that I'm rather stupidly stimbling towards is that
in 'Amelie' Jeunet has created the most perfect story on which to build a life. It is the ultimate rebuttal of the hideously simple cynicism for which people have such an ugly love. It is fantastic in both the popular sense (as in 'WOW! That was fantastic!') and the true sense (as in being some sort of fantasy) however the magic which it undoubtedly contains is so absolutely grounded in humanity that it can't be talked away as metaphysical nonsense.
The message is clear: its alright to be nonconformist; and simple kindness makes the world a better brighter place. I'm sure that some people will blush at the term non-conformist as it stirs up awful thoughts of dire little children who think that they're tearing down the system by dressing up as Marilyn Mansun(son?) There are, however, two types of nonconformist; those that do it for style, for whom it is a pretence, who break from conformity in the same way that everybody else does, who indulge in the apotheosis of Marilyn What's-His-Name; and those who find their own reason and happiness in their own way, who don't follow but generally just wander, those who are in some sense truly alive and free. 'Amelie' is about the latter group. 'Amelie' is about the redemption of happiness and kindness from the curse of world weary cynicism. Albert Camus said the true meaning of life lay in doing good for others, a brilliant message which echoes through this film. Watch it and fall in love with the world.",1019174400,8,1978,4.942942942942943

Easily the best European import since ""Wings Of Desire"", this beautifully shot and imaginatively edited film explores similar themes of humanist romanticism, albeit with a lighter touch. Audrey Tautou literally lights up the screen as the endearingly offbeat Amelie, a ""gregarious loner"" who decides to become a guardian angel (sometimes benign devil) and commit random acts of anonymous kindness. Amelie's ""people in need"" are suspiciously silmilar to her-those who need that little push to come out of self-imposed exiles and revel in life's simple pleasures. Of course, our heroine is really in search of her own happiness and fulfillment. Does she find it? You'll have to see for yourself!

1706567,4,B0000640VO,"""Amelie"" (2001)
Since this movie was released just a little while after the September 11th tragedy, I think all viewers gave a certain warmth towards it because it was such a feel-good film and that's just what audiences needed after seeing the twin towers crash down. I actually saw this movie about December of 2001, so I wasn't as affected by the cheery state of this film as the viewers watching it a month or so after the tragedy were. None-the-less, Amelie still made me smile.
Alas, there were problems though. At times I felt very manipulated by the film and had the feeling that the movie was trying too hard to get me to like it. The most annoying thing about the movie is it goes on for a little too long. The film develops an excellent first half, but it bogs down just a little in the second half with an only mildly interesting love story that remains mysterious for far too long.
This definitely isn't a bad movie though. I had some dislikes, but overall, I enjoyed Amelie and it kept me happy. Mostly due to Audrey Tatou's amazing screen presence. She brings much light and warmth to her character, and I look forward to her becoming a big star in future films, and maybe not just French ones.
The characters are developed very well and I loved how at the start of the movie it had voice-over's about the characters likes and dislikes, and their style of living, how old they are and so on and so on. The movie doesn't just develop its characters with words; it also uses movements, facial expressions and quotable one-liners to make these people more 3-dimensional.
Amelie is also good for a laugh. Many of the scenarios are laugh-out-loud funny (Amelie punishing her neighbours, a cigarette saleswoman having sex for the first time in months, very publicly!) and others are just small laughs that earn big smiles. I enjoyed the laughs and kindness of the movie, and I liked how the title character wanted to do things to make others' lives better. It made me feel like I wanted to do something good for somebody else. Sometimes Amelie was a bit too in-your-face nice, like do we really need the lead character giving us nice, cute smiles every 5 minutes, and showing us spoons nicely, while being nice? There were really no dark aspects of the movie, but I suppose that is not exactly a flaw because the aim of the game was probably to make Amelie as much of a a bright, fun, happy film as it could be, but I would've liked a bit more genre range.
All in all, this movie earned my respect and I recommend it, but it certainly wasn't the best film of 2001, as many critics and festivals are calling it. It was simply a quirky, funny little number that you can watch once, smile and laugh with it, and then forget about it after a few days.

 The most inspiring stories are those where insignificant people are shown to be significant in the lives of others. Amelie is one of those stories of how one insignificant, beautiful (and I do mean beautiful) waitress can inspire and touch the world around her.

Amelie was truly inspirational, innovative, creative, moving film that as Gosford Park actor, Ryan Phillipe stated eloquently, ""took me to another place and time.""
I mean, I'm sure the Bosnian film was well done and all, but every year it seems there's a come out of nowhere film about a war in Bosnia by a couple guys whose names you can't pronounce being nominated every year for the foreign film category. Was
it the same guys doing every year? Was this a Randy Newman thing where if you keep on doing the same thing long enough, the Academy gives it to you just for the heck of it?
Sheesh, anyway, the movie is simply wonderful, innovative, and a refreshingly artistic movie that gives its viewers a break from the usual Tom Green High School Flick, Mel Gibson war-militarization-patriotism- flick, and the Jim Carrey is this funny flick.

It is also about ethical activism, making a difference in others' lives, and living bigger than one's fears and limitations.  It is visually breathtaking and perfectly acted.

That there can be a woman out there who is beautiful, but alone, and lonely. Second of all, in the film she falls in love with a pretty much ordinary guy. That idea, again, is very appealing to most men, and can identify with that ordinary guy, and think it is realistic that he, the viewer, could be him.

Infused with a lush soundtrack from Yann Tiersen who also worked on ""The Dreamlife of Angels"" that carries you delightfully through, on the bouyant beats of the accordian. You'll need to buy it after hearing it-------
We see Amelie grow up with her odd parents, her father a doctor--touches only each month for a checkup (which makes her heart race--so now he's convinced she has a heart problem) Her mother a schoolteacher--meets her end while they were at church praying for a baby brother--a young woman from Quebec jumps of the roof--right onto her.
Her father busily spends his time tending her mother's shrine in the backyard--which consists of a large garden gnome---
 Amelie leaves home as soon as possible---becoming a barmaid in a bar where we meet even more strange people---Suzanne,the owner (an ex- circus star with a limp) a woman who is a crazed hypocondriac (Georgette)-- Gina whose ex Joseph (Dominque Pinon) is now a permanant patron of the bar (just to pester her it seems) he tapes conversations and keeps track of all the other male customers he thinks Gina pays to much attention to---
One day (on the death of Princess Di ) she discovers a box hidden behind a tile in her bathroom---she tracks down the little boy who hid it there--now 40+ years later--she decides if it makes him happy--she'll make that her mission, to help people... She arranges for him to find the box, and once he opens it, he's overcome-- he's found his lost childhood...

1706605,5,B0000640VO,"Amlie Poulin is this naive and sweet girl who has a fantastic destiny in front of her. One day, while watching the news that say that princess Diana has just died in Paris, she discovers a hole in her bathroom with tin box. In the tin box she finds someone's childhood treasure. The picture of a sports hero, a little Formula 1 car from the 50's, a little bicycle toy... Understanding just how valuable this treasure should be for the owner she sets out to find him and deliver it to him without taking any credit. Suddenly she realizes that she can help people, specially those around her.
 There's Madeleine, a neighbor of the building where she lives who lives depressed as her husband died while being unfaithful to her. Raymond who has a disease that makes his bones so fragile that a mere handshake could shatter his hand. He never leaves his apartment and despite painting the same Renoir picture he has never been able to get the look of one of the picture's characters right. Lucien who works at the grocery store and who has a somewhat ""romantic"" view of life but who's humiliated every day by Collingnon, the owner of the store, who enjoys making Lucien's work a miserable experience but who will run to call his mother the second he's afraid. And then there's the people who work with her at the coffee shop like one who sells the cigarettes that thinks that she has every disease imaginable but probably just needs a little love. The psychotic customer who stalks one of the waitresses that he used to date. His father who had always dreamed of making a trip around the world but discarded that idea when his wife (Amlie's mother) died and now lives a sad and solitary life. And finally Nino who goes to every instant-photo booth in every train station and picks up the pictures that people have thrown away and collects them in an album but he wonders why a certain peron has taken his picture all around the city but always throws it away.
Amlie will help them all. And the audience will have a lot of fun watching her do it. One will cry at times but tears of joy indeed and one will laugh at times. And at the end of the movie one will cheer for her as she gets her reward because by the end of the movie she will have found her way to every spectator's heart.
However the magic of the movie doesn't end just with this superb story and wonderful characters. Kudos for Jean-Pierre Jeunet on his marvelous directing. The editing techniques, the cinematographic language he uses....One critic said that Jeunet was born to direct this film Couldn't agree more. And of course the acting is superb.

I had read that it was about an overly imaginative young woman, but that's not really accurate. In this movie, Amelie's whole world is hyperimaginative--it's not just her. There is a great narrative train overlaying the movie, as we are informed about certain facts regarding the characters, such as one whose sole pleasure is  bursting bubble wrap, and another who dislikes waking up with her face wrinkled from the pillow case. Through it all, our heroine Amelie tries to arrange the world to provide maximum happiness, without trying to do anything in particular for herself at first, but thank goodness, she winds up pretty happy herself by the end.

1706621,4,B0000640VO,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet's giant raspberry swoon of a picture is very much a film of and for fantasists - it's no surprise that our heroine, lonely waitress and professional do-gooder Amelie (Tautou), finds her belated match in a fellow lost soul (Kassovitz) working amidst the screams and shrieks of Montmartre's porno shops and ghost trains. In the film's fantasy sequences - where, amongst other effects, the waitress melts into a pool of cold water upon seeing her beloved - Jeunet demonstrates it's not too far from Amelie to Ally McBeal; but where the American lawyer always seems trapped by her own cuteness, determined to be winsome at all legal costs, Amelie's ever-spiralling gift for the imaginative proves something of a liberation as the film goes off in every direction, the camera charging through the heart of Paris and ending up in a district here given a real - if ethnically uncertain - sense of community, with all the fraught and tangled relationships that word implies.
The film takes the sensual over the sensational, though, and is more interested in the world's life-giving petites morts than in death itself. This is a film of simple pleasures (sweets being made, hands being dipped into bags of grain, the smell of a lover's hair, a box of trinkets) which keeps the grand tragedy of Princess Diana's death in the French capital strictly as a backdrop. I was worried how this real-life event - with its treacly potential for sentimentality - might be filtered into the plot, but it turns out that Amelie is more interested in the pleasant sidebars than the press's wailing headlines, and more affected by the quiet, unseen tragedies happening to those we personally know than by those celebrity deaths trumpeted across the news - these latter, Jeunet argues, are the type we can do nothing about.
There's still something in the plot about cameras and accidents. An early joke has Amelie take revenge on the neighbour who tells her her automatic flash was responsible for a minor car crash, which feeds into the film's best gag about the melancholic-looking man (Rufus) whose torn photos litter the floors of Photo-Me booths the whole Metro over. But this seems part of Amelie's discourse on art and life, how we can take others' personally-specific creations to our own hearts; at one point, the heroine watches a drab Russian military drama whose subtitles keep referring back to her own life. Certainly this is a movie about a woman who has to put some kind of distance between herself and her lover to maintain any kind of a relationship. This is a rather fun notion of romance as game-playing, and when our two star-crossed lovers finally kiss, it seems apt they make for predestined targets on the other's face, trying to sink one another's emotional Battleships. (In a film of such simple pleasures, Tautou and Kassovitz's sole love scene is suitably simple - and pleasurable.)
Jeunet is here playing astute political games, delivering a feel-good movie which both assures the Right that there is still good in the world (even if it has to be brought about by exploited waitresses and sex shop workers) and suggests to the Left the need for more radical changes, like those brought about by Amelie, to improve a society. Tautou increases in charm and presence as the film goes on. With her stylish layered bob and big shoes, she first appears a little too girlish and model-like, as if she's just stomped off the Paris Fashion Week catwalk and out into the periphery. Eventually, though, the casting begins to make perfect sense, particularly in those scenes where the happy-maker's broken heart leaves her impossibly fragile: the noise you can hear in the cinema is that of an entire audience falling for one woman.",1014940800,5,3742,4.903785488958991

Stunning.  Very funny.  Sorry this isn't a more helpful review, but it's difficult to give specifics on a film that relies so heavily on all of its parts working together.  So many movies today rely on a strong story, or scenery, or just one main star, or even just one director.  Amelie is quite different: it succeeds because nothing is given more importance than any other thing.  Without the soundtrack, it would have failed.  Without Kassovitz's puppyeyes, it would have failed.  Without the creme brulee, it would have failed.

1706624,5,B0000640VO,"Amlie was the most charming, unusual and totally unexpected film I`ve ever had the pleasure to see. It features a quirky cast of characters, beautiful and unusual cinematography, a magnificent soundtrack, and an original, magical story.
The film begins with a random, startling voiceover: ""On September 3, 1973, at 6:28 pm and 32 seconds, a bluebottle fly capable of 14 670 wingbeats a minute lands on St. Vincent Street, Montmartre."" We are introduced to the other characters by a similar stringing together of tidbits of information that form a giddy bubbly necklace: the cat enjoys listening to children's stories, Joseph, spurned lover of Suzanne, owner of the Two Windmills and ex-circus rider, likes popping bubble wrap, Raphael Poulain likes stripping wallpaper but dislikes clingy swim trunks, Nino Quincompoix, employee at the Porno Palace who collects torn up photographs from under photo booths, Lucien, grocer's assistant who is slow with words but quick with smiles, Monsieur Dufayel, an old man born with brittle bones who shields himself from reality in his padded apartment, painting the same Renoir over and over again.
We see Amlie grow up before our very eyes, raised by a strict father who never hugs or touches Amlie, who yearns for contact. Flash forward to the future: Amlie is now a waitress at the Two Windmills Caf in Montmartre. Her wide brown eyes and mischievous smile lend her a pixyish air. We could all learn a thing or two from Amlie: smile frequently, and do something nice for someone to brighten their day. Her life changes forever on the morning that Princess Di's death was announced to the world, and the rest of the film follows her adventures. Amlie's world is one of magic, one where pictures talk and objects come to life.
The cinematography is equally jarring, switching from handheld camera to vintage footage to pieced-together photos to animations and back. The film has a sepia wash that gives it an aged appearance, adding to its charm. The soundtrack, composed by Breton Yann Tiersen, is quintessentially Parisian: accordion waltzes accompanied by the rather unexpected sound of typewriters and music boxes. Piano plays a central role in the scoring, and some of the songs are vintage oldies, record hiss and all, others have gypsy flair. Buy the soundtrack if you have a chance, you will not regret it. It is a melodious blend of classical, Parisian bistro and film music that will stay in your ears for days.
If you're looking for a break from everyday drudgery, look no further than Amlie. Her magic is contagious and will brighten your day.",1014681600,28,2594,4.993071593533488
1706625,4,B0000640VO,"""Amelie,"" directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, tells the story of a waitress who engages in an extended, game-like romantic flirtation with an eccentric young man while at the same time playfully meddling in the lives of the people around her. The film is a romantic comedy with quirky accents of fantasy and absurdism.
As the title character, the lovely Audrey Tatou is a delight. Amelie is a mischievous woman-child, both sexy and oddly innocent. Tatou is excellently complemented by Mathieu Kassovitz, who plays Nino, Amelie's romantic interest. Kassovitz brings an appealing, dreamy vulnerability to his oddball role. The rest of the cast brings a lot of life to their roles: Amelie's gloomy father, a brittle-boned artist known as the ""Glass Man,"" a hypochondriac tobacco salesgirl, and others.
Overall, this is a fun, lighthearted film. I was intrigued by the recurring motif of England's Princess Diana, who functions as a sort of patron saint throughout the film. The film is filled with many clever visual flourishes: pictures that come to life and talk, etc. If you're in the mood for some sexy, silly, imaginative romance, go for ""Amelie.""",1014681600,,1145,5.161290322580645
1706636,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie takes us to the Montmartre district of Paris to meet Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou). She has had an uncomfortable childhood - her mother died when she was six and her father only seemed interested in checking her heart. By the age of 22, she is a waitress, and seems to be going nowhere until a certain discovery changes her life forever.
This is one of 2001's best-received films, and it's very easy to see why. It's a delightful trip through the life of one of the most intriguing characters to appear on screen ...
Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Alien Resurrection) has created a fictional Paris, much like Baz Luhrmann's in Moulin Rouge, except not as over-the-top. Amelie, however, concentrates much more on substance than style. In fact, the special effects fit in very well. One of the film's real assets is its voiceover, which allows us to learn something about each of the characters whilst never taking itself seriously, thus providing us with some unusual comic relief. But there are many other comic moments sprinkled throughout the script - all of which are ingenious, original and very funny.
A number of scenes are amazing, and some of the still shots, especially those of Amelie herself, really are a sight to behold. The editing and camerawork are deliberately overworked - it's an approach, which generally pays off, even if it occasionally confuses. Yann Tiersen's upbeat and slightly melodramatic score successfully blends in with the mood of the film.
Unsurprisingly, lead actress Audrey Tautou, who bears more than a passing resemblance to another famous Audrey (Hepburn), leaves the longest lasting impression. She is luminous, charismatic, and successfully allows us to believe in all sides of Amelie's character - the reclusive, the likeable and the mischievous. Her BAFTA nomination was well deserved.
Amelie's success doesn't revolve completely around Tautou, however. Mathieu Kassovitz, who plays Amelie's eventual love interest, Nino, also excels in his role, and the rest of the cast successfully fall into place, with especially notable displays from Serge Merlin and Rufus. Every major character in the film has a back-story, and Jeunet aims to ensure that we develop sympathy or hatred for them, depending on their characteristics. And we do.
Amelie's only fault (and this is a minor one) is that the early parts of the film perhaps aren't as emotionally involving as they could be. Also, the sentimentality and foreign nature may put off some people. But who cares? Most go to the cinema for feel-good experiences, and it's doubtful that you will find a better one ... Capable of holding your attention throughout while simultaneously making you laugh (or even cry), Amelie makes for a perfect night out at the cinema.  --This review refers to the theatrical release.",1014595200,,2807,5.1154684095860565
1706637,5,B0000640VO,"Just as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" cast its foriegn film spell over popular movie audiences and the Oscars last year, ""Amelie"" seems the rightful heir to the throne this year. Drawing from memorable characters, a well-told story, and the unforseen magic that becomes the essence of life, ""Amelie"" is a savory cinematic joy!
Amelie is an atypical girl living a typical life. She loves the little details and magic in life the most, like cracking creme boulea' with a spoon, and watching peoples' faces in the dark of a movie theater. When she finds a rusty tin box hidden behind a tile in her bathroom filled with lost treasures of childhood, Amelie sets out to find its owner which sparks a series of events in which Amerlie becomes a ""do-gooder"" to those who deserve it, and a ""bad-dooer"" to those who've earned it. Eventually, Amelie must also face her own personal wishes and desires or loose them forever.
We are enthralled, we're entertained, we laugh, we smile, and by the end of the film, we learn to ever-important lesson that making yourself happy in life is the next best thing when helping others appreciate the magic of life. The current ""seeping in"" of foriegn films into mainstream cinema could not be better represented than by ""Amelie"", a true treasure of foriegn cinema that's bound, not only for Oscar glory, but to capture the hearts of American audiences as well. Do not miss ""Amelie""!",1014595200,,1411,4.810699588477366

Not a usual (therefore annoying) ""I love you, you love me"" story (not that I've seen a lot of those), but rather a film about an extraordinary and broke french girl with my favourate director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, behind the camera. If you love Hollywood films like Pearl Harbor or Independance Day, then please stay away from this movie for your own good. Far from sexy chicks and ""jumping off the roof seconds before the building bursts into flames"" celebrities that I'm personally bored of seeing, Jeunet chose two ordinary characters who played the role ""I want to show my affection to you in the most wierd way."" It's amazing that many of my friends didn't like the movie and some even lacked the potential ATP production to go to the theater for this movie, but it's probably (and they'd hate me for saying this) because of their lack of imagination, creativity and wish&courage of acting just the way you want, even like a child. (I'm not sure if I put it right, but if you watch the film, you'll know what I mean) Honestly, I'm not sure about buying the DVD since I'd hate myself if I watch this movie a billion times and start getting bored of it.

This is an enchanting story of a young woman growing up in France and of her adult life in Paris.  Her childhood is neatly explained, but the bulk of the movie concerns her life in Paris.  The movie follows her and the cast of characters surrounding her as she subtly manipulates their lives: bringing together two of the regulars in the cafe where she works, sending her father's garden gnome around the world in hopes of inspiring her father to do the same, etc.  She is sweet and a little bit devilish at the same time.

American movies are generally too commercialized, airheaded and generally showing  norrow perspectives (few exceptions exist, of course).  In contrast, Amelie shows how normal, blue collar young people enjoy life in a meaningful way and best of all, they end as happy people while being financially poor.  No SUV's, a mini-vans, shopping malls, air-head teenagers, ""perfect body"" dudes or gals, exercised obsessed people, REAL cafe's (not that cheap imitation called Starbucks), and the list never ends.

1706659,5,B0000640VO,"Vive L'Amour! Vive Paris! This sunny and funny picture is one of the best of 2001. `Amlie' --both the movie and the character -- is smart and very enchanting. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's fable has universal proportions, once it deals with love and the desire of happiness, that exist in almost every human being.
It is the story of a very well meaning girl who tries to happy everybody around -- herself included-- and sometimes she succeds, but sometimes she fails. Having a difficult and lonely childhood the woman Amlie has a simple and meaningless life, until one day she founds a mysterious box inside a bathroom wall. She promises that if she succeds in findinf the owner of the box, she will do good things forever. If she fails: unlucky world!! To put in a nutshell: she finds the owner and her life will never be the same. Neither her father's, her friends', and any one else's who `dares' to cross her way.
Amlie's attitude reminded me very much of Jane Austen's Emma. Both girls try to fix up everybody's life but ends up doing mistakes. However I think Amlie is a bit less naive than Emma.
The characters are very well developed. And no one finishes the movie in the same way he/she began. Of course Amlie is the one who has the most dramatic changing. But all the others find some joys in their simple life, and from that time on, life, love, friendship will never be the same again.
Audrey Tatou is nothing but perfect. She is beautiful and charming. Sometimes she may look like a femme fatale, but she can perfectly be a unprotected child looking for some love. Her eyes are so beautiful and expressive that they dominate the screen in some scenes. Even in the film poster, I think the eyes are the first thing we see. Mathieu Kassovitz is also very good as Amlie's love interest: Nino. He is naive but not silly or stupid. They make a perfect couple. The supporting cast is also very nice. Every character has his/her charms and dramas, that will only be solved with our heroine's help.
The Paris where this fable takes place is a dream land. It is clean and beautiful. The sky is like in heaven. The whole film comes down to be Parisian. More than an way of life, it is a philosohie. People there are different, they think and look different. Moreover, Paris is still the Capital of Love.
Another interesting thing in this picture is the photograph. The lighting is very peculiar. CGI can be very usefull sometimes-- it can have other uses than creating dinossaurs. Since the beginning, one can notice it is a one-of-a-kind movie. But it couldn't be different. Director Jeunet is known to be very focused on details, and here every detail counts. To make things much better, the soundtrack is fabulous! The songs perfectly fit every scene, and Paris as well.
After 2001, with `Amlie' and `Moulin Rouge', Montmartre is back again as a place of bohemian, love, dance and colourful sets. People there are better, more beautiful and lovable. To sum up,  this is a charming movie that is recommend for all ages. Mainly for those who are young at heart. It is impossible not to leave the cimena smiling.",1013385600,2,3107,4.608303249097473

Amelie is just a fun movie - a sweet romantic comedy from beginning to end.  In this film, the special effects act as surreal compliments to the story - more Jean Cocteau than Jerry Bruckheimer.  In the scene where Amelie gets her heart broken, she simply melts into water.  The story, such as it is, basically concerns her fear of meeting the man she has a crush on from afar...or maybe it's about the things a woman does to amuse herself if she's never had a fulfilling sexual encounter?

1706690,5,B0000640VO,"Normally I come away feeling guilty for having enjoyed a ""feel good"" type of film. Guilty for having allowed myself to be emotionally manipulated by its saccharine sweet charms and silly romanticism.

  Not so with Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""Amelie""! A movie that easily trancends all the trappings of a ""feel good"" movie to that of absolute, pure, cinema magic. While plainly unapologetic in its romantic whimsy, ""Amelie"" earns its emotions honestly. It doesn't resort to shamelessly manipulative gimmicks; it earns them by virtue of the fact that it has presented its audience with a finely crafted film: intelligent script, wonderful characters and outstanding performances.
  And speaking of performances- Audrey Tautou as the titular Amelie is a wonder to behold. She is both beautiful and utterly charming. She kept reminding me of another famous Audrey- by the name of ""Hepburn"". I hope we see much more of Mademoiselle Tautou in future.
  In a world where movies are rarely both entertainig as well as true works of art ""Amelie"" exceeds all expectations. Jeunet has made some fabulous (yet dark) films in his career (ie. ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of Lost Children"") but ""Amelie"" is, for me at least, his most enjoyable film to date. Before you even think about watching ""Pretty Woman"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle"" again, check out ""Amelie"". I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",1011830400,2,1378,5.18018018018018

But is it any good? In short, yes. It's very good.
Don't worry about the subtitles, there's no problem in following screenwriters Guillaume Laurant and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's plot. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's doe-eyed heroine Amlie (Audrey Tautou) has had a lonely childhood and an unsatisfying love life. Her father is a glum recluse, who never offered her any physical contact, warmth or love (but who cherishes his garden gnome) and her neurotic mother was killed by a suicide jumper who hit her on the way down outside Notre Dame. As a result, Amlie has become wrapped up in her dreams as a way of escaping her lonely life. By day, she waits table at a Montmartre brasserie frequented by many eccentric characters and at night, she goes home alone to a little box flat with a rear window from where she can spy on her neighbours and dream of what their lives must be like. Until one day when she discovers a box of discarded toys left behind in her apartment 40 years ago and begins a search for the man-boy who once owned them. Finding that she can make a difference to other peoples lives, Amlie's own life is given a new purpose and a new vocation but can she find love and happiness for herself?
Some critics have complained that Amlie's is a right wing exercise in nostalgia and that Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's depiction of Montmatre is too lushly perfect, whilst others have criticised it for being nothing more than a rip-off of Jane Austen's Emma. All of these criticisms are unfair (although there are obvious comparisons in the plot that can be made to Emma) and downright offensive. There is no obvious political agenda on display here and so what if the streets of Montmatre are picture postcard friendly? Amlie's Montmartre may just be a dream but it's a beautiful dream. Who cares if in the real France most people eat at Burger King or Mc. Donalds or shop at a supermarket for their groceries? Amlie's Montmartre is an enchanted place, where the water's of the canals are blue and sparkling and the scenery picture perfect.
Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Director of the much darker Delicatessen and City of Lost Children), has created his own universe and populated it with some wonderfully eccentric characters, thus allowing some of France's finest actors to charm their audience with a proliferation of visual humour and pseudo-philosophical dialogue. In particular, Serge Merlin, the wise old artist from across the street, conjures up magical wisdom and steals most of his scenes, as does Rufus, as Amlie's morose father. However, make no mistake this is the rather beautiful and elfin-like Audrey Tautou's movie and she captures your heart with her big doe-eyes and her mischievous smile and plays the role of Amlie to whimsical perfection.
Amlie will capture your heart; make you smile, make you laugh and send you off into the night glowing happily, with a little bit of faith and hope in life restored. We all like to feel good about ourselves and Amlie is well worth checking out for anybody who enjoys a little romance and dares to dream.",1011830400,15,3293,4.819787985865724

It is a romantic comedy of sorts.  The movie starts out with an introduction to Amelie's childhood (how she was teased while growing up, how her mother died, what she did for fun, etc.)  The real story of Amelie begins when her perfume bottle cap fell to the ground and dislodged a tile in her bathroom.  Behind this tile is a little lozenge box filled with memorabilia from a boy's childhood.  This is the moment Amelie decides to perform good deeds (and random acts of kindness); starting with returning this box to its rightful owner.  Along the way, she finds time to play practical jokes on her mean neighbor downstairs, teach an old artist to see more of the world through television, solve a mystery involving the instant photographs of a man, get her father to travel around the world, and much much more.
But where's the romance you might ask.  Amelie's search for love began when she happened to make eye contact with a guy who has a hobby of rummaging through the trash beside/underneath an instant photography machine.  She is intrigued enough to play a game such that they will meet again.  Through all that happens to Amelie, the viewer is drawn into her magical world and learns to empathize with her.
This is such a perfect date-movie.  I saw it alone, but I can totally see a guy and girl enjoying this film.  There aren't any awkward moments where strangers might feel uncomfortable.  I guarantee that even the most indifferent of viewers will get atleast a giggle from this film.
Go watch it!  :)",1011657600,4,1748,4.525477707006369
1706696,5,B0000640VO,"My wife and I saw Amelie last night and it made me remember that there was a time when films were produced and directed by artists.  When the movie ended the audience remained silent while a long list of credits scrolled down the screen. Even the credits were done with humor and taste.  When the credits were about to end the audience broke into spontaneous applause.  Its been a long time since I have experienced this kind of response to a movie. The response was well deserved.
Amelie is a tribute to the human imagination and excellent acting.  It is as far away from the formula films of recent vintage, that are the creation of corporate marketing, as one can get.  The plot has unexpected twists and turns that had the audience laughing aloud when it wasn't wondering what new aspect of Amelie's personality they were about to discover. The cast was also superb.  The best way to describe the acting is to imagine that each of the roles required an excellent character  actor and that everyone delivered.  Audrey Tautou was outstanding in the title role.  She was in almost every scene but she hardly spoke.  She didn't need to.  Her actions and facial expressions said everything.
Paris also contributed to the success of the movie.  It isn't the Paris that tourists come to see, however.  It is the Paris that nourishes and supports the lovable screwballs that we come to know as they go about their routine lives which would seem eccentric and implausible almost any place else.",1011657600,2,1489,4.702702702702703

The title character is a shy eccentric young woman who decides to improve the lives of her Parisian acquaintances with a series of anonymous good deeds. However, as in any good story, there is a deeper motive for her actions - she is tentatively expanding her own sense of self and discovering who she really is. The writing is witty and the film was very well made. Several scenes had us laughing out loud and others had me wanting to hug the well-played characters during their vunerable moments.

She decides to stir things up a bit with a ""loventure"" where she plays an exciting and mysterious voyeur game throughout the city with one man she recognizes from her past.
Taking an unusual vigilante approach to a wrongdoer in her neighborhood, we're thrown into humorous scenes of confusion as he thinks he's going simply mad.
Great reflection is shared with a fragile neighbor and she is able to grow and blossom thanks to his bending an ear.  His reward comes in glimpses of an unknown world.
With splashes of personification, inanimate objects add to this splendid flick with their opinions and wonder.

In visually playful style, it tells the story (in French, with subtitles) of a dreamy, lonely woman who seeks to help the other oddballs she is acquainted with to find love and joy, but has a hard time helping herself. The cinematography is delightful and the the characters are amusing, although I did feel that the movie was a little self-conscious in giving each one of them an absurd eccentricity (copying the same Renoir over and over, collecting photo booth rejects, etc.) I also felt that although the film had a happy ending for some of the characters, it left a lot of the other ones hanging. A friend told me that was more realistic than resolving everything, but there is nothing realistic about this film, either in style or content. Fans of this French director will think this his finest, most accessible work. Newcomers will enjoy the weird whimsy of this colorful thing, if they can stand to look at Amelie's face smirking on the film advertisements.",1010361600,,1091,4.808510638297872

After the movie was over, I found myself smiling as I left the theatre, thinking about various scenes in the movie.  Thirty minutes later, I was smiling, thinking about scenes in the movie.  I found myself looking at mundane things as I drove my car home...thinking...""how magical the simple things of life are.""  The movie made me think that too often we ignore the simple, but meaningful and beautiful things of life while we run toward our goals, ignorant of the beauty that we are passing by.  The moview made me want to take a moment and savor life...to savor the way the rain drips off a leaf, to savor a fellow human being just walking down the street...to savor our relationships with each other...to savor what we rush by every day.  I was reminded by a scene in Thornton Wilder's play, OUR TOWN, where Emily, who is dead, talks about how we miss most of what is going on around us while we are living.  This movie underscored how easy it is for us to fall into such a trap.  All I can say is to go see this movie and walk out changed.",1010275200,11,1272,4.337552742616034
1706737,5,B0000640VO,"I am not be a pundit in the appreciation of French movie but AMELIE clearly deserves the accolades it garners - and what a triumph for director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who returns to his motherland after dabbling in a Hollywood feature Alien Resurrection. Jeunet uses masterly beautiful cinematography and digital effects to enhance the poetic Paris where Amelie, played by the enchanting ingenue Audrey Tautou desires to spread bliss to the surrounding people and performs the deed anonymously.
The movie starts with the purveying of Amelie's childhood where her father is a physician who yearns to travel. The intimacy towards her reticent father is only experienced when he gives her a check-up; her mother died tragically with a fateful suicidal victim falling onto her. Introverted and a lonely recluse, she enjoys the small pleasures of throwing stones in the river and eating strawberries from her fingers. She slowly fades into the glorious Paris where few ever stops to admire its delicate beauty. It is only until the day when she finds unexpectedly a box with little toys and returns it to the owner after much difficulty that she discovers the simple joy of spreading warmth to the people around in her tiny universe.
AMELIE is heavenly for the subtle emotions it triggers. The quirky humour where Lady Di's sensational demise is juxtaposed wickedly to Mother Teresa's; Amelie's sarcasm towards the grumbling grocery shop-owner -""even artichokes have a heart"". It is ironic that she lacks the courage to pursue her own happiness when she gives others mirth through little acts. She steals her father's gnome and pictures it with thw world's historical monuments as backgrounds to convince her father to venture out; she writes love letter to comfort the forlorn widow; she gives the Glass Man who named for his brittle bones a new perspective towards life. In her adventures there is sweet exuberance and fluttering hope that she finds her true love with a shy photographer (Mathieu Kassovitz).
Of course the dazzlingly resplendent magical Paris isn't reality - and curmudegeons in the Cannes Festival rejected the film for its lack of realism. Yet in this film Jeunet's deliberate removal of flaws through computer effects has wondrously touched the audience's heart to spellbinding effect. It sheds miraculously hope in the worst of times and that ordinary heroes can achieve happiness unwittingly. The lead role intended for Emily Watson is through a twist of fate, helmed by Audrey Tautou - and through her emotive eyes - there are genuine moments of sorrow, mellifluous joy, cunning and bashfulness.
For all its box-office phenomenon, it remains at the very best a deeply moving picture that will tug at your heartstring for a very long time after you leave the cinema. Happiness is a subliminal experience - and it is definitely one emotion you will feel after this movie.",1010188800,4,2885,5.101479915433404

1706761,5,B0000640VO,"I had the luck having seen previous movie of Carot such as ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of lost children"", so I knew more or less which visual style of movie I was about to witness. I had no idea about the plot though, so I was very willing to let myself be surprised. And surprised, I was.
The movie opens with a 4 minute mixture of complete factual but not to the matter enumeration of events such as somebody removing one name from his address book and a fly (which flaps his wings at 14.670 beats per minute) being squatted by a car. And all of a sudden, with a pace that you have rarely seen in any movie, you are thrown right into the life of Amelie.
You will go through the life of Amelie from baby to adult. The very many details of this life do not stop to surprise you (her father thinking she has a hart problem, and the discovery of a box filled with children toys on the day that Lady Di dies).
What is very special about this movie , besides the excellent plot, is the visually overwhelming scenes. Carot really makes every scene work for themselves like he has done in his previous movies.
The biggest problem is that it is very hard to describe what this movie really is about. Is it about a girl who is unlucky and tries to help other people find their luck? Or is the movie just telling us the story of the life of a girl and what happens during her life?
It is up to you - the viewer - to decide on such questions. The movie just gives hints at what life could be. It is definitely a must see if you want to get away from the typical Hollywood blockbuster for a while.",1009756800,5,1583,4.12621359223301
1706762,5,B0000640VO,"Without a doubt the best movie I've seen this year.  Amelie was wonderful, imaginative, and hyperbolic in all ways.  She sees life with such romance and wonder- although not always happily.  And her desire to do things for other people anonymously springs not so much from a Pollyanish ideal as the romantic ideal of the INFJ- to see mystery in life, and create mystery in others.  Beyond the rich characters, the cinematography and sound editing are fantastic.  The sights and sound are so vivid one feels like they can actually touch the movie's insides, taste the stars, and eat the light.  After leaving the film I yearned to see all the details of life as she does.  I was rewarded crossing the floating bridge next to Seattle, and seeing the left side storm tossed with tall waves of foam; the right side completely placid and calm like a small pond on a hot, breezeless day.  This is the imagery of the film, and the benefits from seeing it.",1009670400,3,948,4.601190476190476
1706763,5,B0000640VO,"I loved the artistry of this movie - that people can acurately represent their vision of beauty always impresses me. So much cheerful color saturation that made each scene like a painting, every inch of what you see is lovely - little inanimate objects come to life, creative concepts abound.
I enjoyed the plot emmensly. It is possible? -to unclench one's grip on reality for just a moment and watch how an imaginative recluse might see the world on a good day, or what it is like to fall in love - or might such sencerity make people cringe? I do not find this concept a stretch, for my part there was much in the movie I identified with. Sure I have my bad days too, but this movie was not the time nor place to explore these thought and visions.
Are we allowed to be this cheerful? People seem to equate carefree and sunny with vapid and immature. Do we only have sunny weeks like these in childhood? Is a woman's sexuality childlike if she expresses shyness, imagination and sensitivity? I certainly hope not. Some my be sceptical of all these elements - Sure there have been many examples of sapp laden movies that have attempted to ""warm our hearts,"" in the past, but I would not put Amelie in that catagory. It's a matter of personal taste I suppose - you can't please all of the people all of the time. But as I understand it, many people got the sugar rush from this movie I did (note sugar, not sacrine).
If it isn't already obvious, this movie is non-representational. It seems to bother a few people that the ""real"" Paris was not shown, but I think most people are aware that Paris is not saturated in sepia tone and accompanied with constant accordian music. In case this might distract from your pleasure, you are hereby warned.
Relax and enjoy the sunshine.",1009497600,3,1773,4.4753086419753085
1706764,5,B0000640VO,"Certainly this years' best, ""Amelie"" delivers what you expect from the word ""cinema.""  Anyone who thinks life is worth living would agree with me.
The greatest achievement ""Amelie"" displays during its non-stop 2 hours joyful ride through Paris is, ultimately, celebration of life.  What is more important is, it tells also dark side of life.  ""Amelie"" is sweet, indeed, but it is the film's subtle way of implying that life is not actually all made of sugar; (look how Amelie comes to be detached from her own father).  Not forgetting that fact, the film firmly convinces us that life is sweet.  In that respect, ""Amelie"" shares its viewpoint with ""Life Is Beautiful.""
Unlike the latter film, which is also a great masterpiece, ""Amelie"" reaches something very unique.  The narrative skills are full of amazing items; you can see ""a suicidal goldfish,"" ""a falling tourist,"" and ""a travelling gnome"" that really goes to NYC and Moscow!  Or picture yourself with Amelie how many couples are experiencing orgasm right now ... the film literally ""picture"" the answer (15) !!
Besides these amusing scenes, you will be fascinated with colorful characters (one of them is Dominique Pinon as a very nervous guy with a handy recorder, who previously appeared in Jeunet's third sequel of ""Alien"" series in a wheelchair).  However, it is cute Audrey Tautau who steals every scene in the film.  It is now an incredible fact, but the director was first thinking of Emily Watson as a leading lady (hence Amelie, got it?) but, though I love Emily Watson, the result turned out probably better with Tautou.
Finally, ""Amelie"" proves what a good cinema can do.  It is funny, it is lovely, but most of all, it celebrates life.  And that makes the film a must for everyone living at this age full of troubles.
And, really, finally.  Hollywood, don't you ever try to remake it.",1009411200,4,1855,4.853968253968254

1706767,5,B0000640VO,"I absolutely loved this movie.  Audrey Tautou is one of the charmingest actresses to grace the screen in recent memory.  Amelie is one of the loveliest, most endearing characters ever created on film.  This really is an amazing move, done in a fashion suitably dreamy to provide a backdrop for the romantic yearning of its title character.  The movie transcends sappiness, largely becaue it is willing to poke fun at its protaganists as well its heels.  And my tough-as-nails grandma liked it a much as I did.
In trying to write a review I keep coming back to Amelie/Tautou.  She is just so lovely and clever and awkward and vulnerable.  I was rooting for her the whole time, even though I knew she would eventually get what she wanted (how couldn't she?).  In fact, my only disapointment was that the guy she ends up with isn't good enough for her, the dope.  As an aside, I rooted for Amelie partly because I fell in love with the character, but I think she is easy to root for, a hero for the romantic in all of us.
Towards the end I couldn't help but notice that Amelie and Chcolate both have a feel-good scene tidying up all of the loose ends.  I point that out to preempt any comparison of the two.  They couldn't be any more different (except maybe for lovely heroines).  Amelie is about a girl unaccustomed to human contact, afraid of intimacy, who takes small steps to share her idiosycratic world with someone who can share his own with her, in settings fantastically real.  Chocolat is a story of a mystic who enters a conservative town and destroys their conventions, replacing them with pleasure-seeking.

In general, I very much agree with most of the reviews I've seen on here ... so you'd have little to gain from my yammering on about this wonderful movie.  However, one review that I read on here I hope is disregarded as utter rubbish.  The review I'm referring to dissed this movie as the characters (especially Amlie) seemed ""childish"".  I would say that ""child-like"" would be a more appropriate description and I feel this only adds to the charm of the characters.  Amlie lives in a very much ""adult"" world ... yet her subtle method of interacting with this world makes it seem quite innocent.  Basically, Amlie is able to create a world that she is happy in.

1706781,3,B0000640VO,"Frank Zappa had it just about right with that quote, and if you're not laughing you've obviously never been to the REAL France (and stepped in some of the ever-present dog-doo on the sidewalks over there or dealt with some of the bizarrely rude attitudes some of the people there happen to be legendary for), or had blinders on when you did go there, inspired by the FANTASY Paris of charming little virtuoso films like ""Amelie."" As for the other side of the coin, if you want France described through rose-colored glasses but from a street poet who knew what he was talking about read Henry Miller's fantastic nauseated-by-Americans classic ""The Air-Conditioned Nightmare.""
But away from Zappa & Miller, and back to fantasy land in ""Amelie."" Now, in all fairness to the film, it does contain some very intense and hilarious satire in its first half & is obviously the work of a CINEMATIC virtuoso (which does not imply Jeunet is an ARTISTIC virtuoso also, it only means the guy is a complete master of the TECHNICAL possibilities of the medium), but the splitting of the film between satire & irreverence on the one hand & the most cliched of sappy, schmaltzified romances on the other, seriously hurts the film's effectiveness as a possibly DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT piece of ART-ifact. It starts off majestically & ends up as CHARMING-SATIRE-MINUS-A-LOT-OF-FLUFF, unlike ""THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"" by the Coen Brothers, which starts off majestically dark & ends an awe-inspiring confirmation of the maxim behind every great 'realist' film: Pascal's famous ""Man's greatness is so obvious it can even be deduced from his wretchedness."" Now, I mention the Coens' film because it is the only film I've seen this year with CINEMATOGRAPHY (courtesy of Mr. Roger Deakins) matching or maybe even surpassing the INSANELY MAGNIFICENT level of the one in display in shot after shot in ""Amelie"" by BRUNO DELBONNEL. I was truly knocked out of my seat by the unerring beauty of the angles used & the antique-look-contrasting-with-modern colors within the shots. I also mention the Coens, because Jeunet is making films now that are sort of ""Raising-Arizonaish"" in their comic-book-imposed-on-reality extravagant, comic style, but will hopefully achieve the maturity of the Coens, in his deeper outlook to turn out something like ""The Man Who Wasn't There.""
Getting down to more specifics, ""Amelie"" reminded me of Louis Malle's classic 1960 film ""Zazie Dans Le Metro,"" which also is split down the middle, magnificent for the first half, BORING & cliched in the second. However, Catherine Demongeot (who, bizarrely enough, Nabokov once said would've been the PERFECT LOLITA had he been allowed to pick one young enough to add the proper amount of repulsion to Kubrick's film) in ""Zazie"" is a 10 year old girl, & much less interesting a character to red-blooded heterosexual hairy-chested men (such as yours truly) than the SUPER-cute, 'BIG SHOED' (above & below), starlet of Jeunet's film: Audrey Tautou. On one level, the film is a love affair between Jeunet's camera & Tautou, in the time honored tradtion of Sternberg/Dietrich, Powell/Kerr, Hitchcock/Hedren, Godard/Karina, De Palma/Nancy Allen, etc., the angles he uses, the way he frames her, the endless close-ups, all of these things are the work of an artist in love with his subject (whether there's a 'love relatonship' in 'real life' is beside the point), and all the audience is thankful for it.
On another level (again reminding me of ""Zazie""), the film takes you on quite a TURBOCHARGED, non-cliched 'tour' of picturesque areas of Paris, & is maybe the best advertising the old 'city of Romance' has had for years. It takes the eyes & sensibilities of masters like Jeunet & Delbonnel to get these shots with just the proper amount of irreverence incoroporated (by what they choose to show and omit), & then ruin them by overplaying sappy annoying accordion music for way too long towards the latter, weaker third of the flick.
DEFIITELY RECOMMENDED, but like another technically dazzling, relatively popular (though not a 'smash hit' like this one) French film before it Leconte's ""The Girl on the Bridge,"" a little too short on substance and TRUE ROMANCE (as opposed to the cliched, NON-EXISTENT kind displayed in the film; check out Renoir's ""Picnic on the Grass"" or Jacques Becker's ""Antoine et Antoinette"" if you want to see a similarly whimsical, semi-fantasy film nevertheless displaying the EXISTENT KIND OF 'ROMANCE' IN INNER SENSIBILITY if not in actual, same-story realistic possibility) to give the 'HELL OF FRANCE' its proper artistic due, and in consequence become as great (in the all-important artistic realm) as let's say Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player."" And one more thing before I leave you with your questionable tastes in without a doubt loving fake, 'non-depressing' fantasty films too much: next time you see the film, you should be aware that a sizeable portion of the film is, among other things, a dead-on satire of Hitchcock's overrated classic ""Rear Window.""",1008374400,3,5034,5.088270858524789

1706786,5,B0000640VO,"I have seen thousands of films in my life, and thought nothing could surprise me anymore on a screen. Amelie proved me I was wrong. Instead of writing another ""best film ever"" comment, I would like to give some indications for non-french speaking viewers, as the translation might have made some lines a bit obscure.
Amelie says to Colignon ""Meme les artichauds ont du coeur"" (Even artichokes have a heart). In french, ""un coeur d'artichaud"" (an artichoke heart) is a person that falls very often and easily in love.
Colignon calls Amelie ""Amelie-melo"" (pronounce ""ah-may-LEE-may-low"") which sounds like ""un meli-melo"", a muddle or mix-up.
In the cafe, people discuss about time and weather, as the same word ""temps"" means both ""le temps qui passe"" (time that passes) and ""le temps qu'il fait"" (the weather). So goes Hippolito's theory : they speak about the weather because they are afraid of the passing time.
Collignon says about his mother : ""Elle a une memoire d'elephant, un elephant de mer"" (literally: she has memory like an elephant, a sea elephant). A ""sea elephant"" is a sort of walrus, and ""mer"" (sea) and ""mere"" (mother) are pronounced the same.
When Amelie is in a theater, she watches ""Jules & Jim"", a movie by Francois Truffaut. There are many references to Truffaut in the movie : Claire Maurier plays the mother in ""the 400 blows"" and many scenes refer to ""Bed and Board"", which itself refers to Hitchcock's ""Rear window"". I still have to figure which was the movie whith Spencer Tracy driving without watching...
When Amelie watches her projected life on TV, a scene that refers to Woody Allen's ""Zelig"", the voice over is from Frederic Mitterand, nephew of his uncle, who is famous for commenting weddings or funerals of aristocrats on french TV.
The ""likes/dislikes"" narration was experimented by Jeunet in a short movie ""Foutaise"" with Dominique Pinon, that will be included in the collector edition of the DVD. It also refers to ""La vie, mode d'emploi"" (Life: a user's manual) from Georges Perec, although Jeunet admits he could never finish the book.
Most TV scenes are stock shots. The story about the horse running in the Tour de France is true. Most stories told in the film are true, including the one about collecting discarded pictures.
There are numerous references in the movie, including to other Jeunet films. The scene in the mystery train is almost a copy of a similar scene in Alien : Resurrection where Ripley has an almost tender behaviour with the alien.
Finally, ""Amelie"" comes from ""Emily"", as Emily Watson was supposed to play the role, and ""Poulain"" is both a young untrained horse and a chocolate brand. And this is not a coincidence.",1008201600,824,2679,4.87719298245614

1706788,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is 23. She left home and became a waitress at 2 Moulins in Paris. Her mother died in an unusual death and her father was mourning for his wife for life. She has not thought about what she wants to do until the death of Lady Di, also in Paris. Now she is trying to change the life of others, but the fact is that who would be helping her to change her life? Amelie is a very hilarious movie on dealing with all the minute and seemingly trivial problems of life, but in fact all these affect our choice for our life in many occasions. The director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The city of lost children) managed to put all the troubles of life in a minor and light-hearted manner. How we could push ourselves across the seemingly barrier of life depends on what kind of attitude we have. We may have the guts to do so, but just think that we can?t do it and give up. The filming method is very creative and the way Jeunet portray psychological changes through the use of special effects is very outstanding. You would wonder how the director could capture the essence in just a perfect touch of cinematography. Amelie would certainly float you in the air, and it is a definite choice away from mainly stream heavy loading Hollywood stuff.",1008028800,,1248,4.430434782608696

1706790,4,B0000640VO,"I really enjoyed the film. Witty, clever, at time surprising. I definetely recommend it for an evening of fun.
I was pleased of the the added bonus of being R rated (in USA), which would prevent too many young girls from seeing it unsupervised. Why? It is a tale with what I call: ""the Beauty and the Beast syndrome"" a.k.a. ""a goody goody girl needs to save beastly men to find happiness and fulfilment"". In this particular film there is a touch of ""SnowWhite and the 7 dwarfs"": Amelie actually meddles with 7 diminutive (or somewhat damaged) male subjects, not to mention the garden gnome.
Am I cynical? yes, but films carry messages, and very strong one too. No wonder so many male viewers fell in love with Amelie: she is a modern century heroine, whose kind are hard to come by in time of equality and political correctness.
Keep dreaming, but still see the film for the clever laugh.",1007942400,,888,4.55625
1706811,5,B0000640VO,"I am far from an expert on French film. But as an AP french student, I have seen the eccentric, the subtle, the whimsical, the heroic, the tender, and the callous side of French cinema in films like My Life in Pink, My Mother's Castle, and The Horseman on the Roof. So there, I went to Amelie with some expectations from those past experiences. But actually, many raving reviews received before the film was even released in the US gave my impatience the needed extra push.
The story is about a Parisian girl named Amelie (a wide-eyed elfish/nymph like Audrey Touton) who grows up to become a heroine bigger than the aimless life she seemed destined to lead. Having discovered the joy of charity and creating miracles for all those around her, Amelie is at last ready for some miracles performed for her. And enters Nino, an unlikely Prince Charming, whose boyish chagrin adds an extra charm to the already light-hearted film. The whole cast is amazing as one eccentric character after another is introduced and subtly pricks the audience's bourgeoisie/mainstream taste and conscience. The pace is delightful as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet moves his camera through the streets of a dream-like Paris. Everything seems perfect in Jeunet's world as the colors of clothing and the mood, the atmosphere, the music coalesce to contrast the emotional edges that chafe inside all of us. Amelie is determined to change everyone's live by scraping off those edges, and by the end of the film, I myself was ready to doubt the feasibility of unhappiness.
So how is Amelie the film French? Like a sophiscated, artsy informercial, Amelie possesses a light, springy, optimistic tone that easily seduces the audience into believing there is beauty in the world and poetry in even the most banal occurrences. But Amelie the film is also universal, especially now. Because without the heavy grandiosity (so prevalent in escapist films of the war and patriotic genre), Amelie speaks to the heart, and unleashes another form of heroism ~ the most unobtrusive kind.",1007856000,2,2044,4.97953216374269
1706812,5,B0000640VO,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the brilliant director behind ""Delicatessen,"" ""City of Lost Children"" and ""Alien: Resurrection"" comes back in 2001 with a fable that's as close to reality as you'd ever want it to be. ""Amelie,"" also known in French as ""The fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain"" takes place in Paris, the city where an innocent and angel-like girl grows to become a good-doer, much in a style similar to the movie ""Pay it forward"" from 2000. However the storyline is totally unconventional, filled with her daydreaming depicted in very original and fun ways, and with unexpected turns as she goes about her good deeds. At one point she finds herself caught in pursuing what's best for others, while being afraid to pursue happiness for herself.

1706816,5,B0000640VO,"Extremely wonderful or beautiful things often leave me struggling for words.  That was how I felt about this movie.  Leaving the theater, I was still completely lost in the world that Jean-Pierre Jeunet created.  Why would I want to leave when everything was so perfect and silly and beautiful there?  It's been a while since a movie has made me feel so good about the world and life in general.  This movie did that because of its simple beauty and strangeness, and I left the theater with a sense of gratitude.  I am not ashamed to admit that I love (need?) a happy ending every once in a while.
There were two narrative techniques which I found especially endearing.  The first was the idea of setting up a scene or event by telling the audience about several completely unrelated and sometimes insignificant things that were happening simultaneously.  The second was introducing the characters by listing a few of their idiosyncratic likes and dislikes.  This was a wonderful and different way to develop the characters-it made me feel strongly for each of them immediately.
Amelie is an unabashedly strange girl with an un-self-conscious smile and an amazing imaginary life.  The movie begins with her tragic childhood with self-absorbed, neurotic parents and no friends.  Amelie is forced to rely on her imagination for entertainment, companionship, and other things that a young girl needs in growing up.  However, she raises herself well and becomes a self-sufficient, quirky, good-hearted (if a little socially isolated) 23-year-old.  This is where we meet her next, working as a waitress and following her odd little passions.  A random discovery leads her to try to fix everyone's life around her, both through good deeds and petty vengeances.  Even as she is absorbed in this mission, she is slowly moving toward fixing her own life.  The series of events that fill the middle section of the movie are wild, funny, touching and revealing.
I found this movie entirely likable (though I admit to a penchant for quirkiness).  I also found the whole movie visually appealing.  Audrey Tautou is beautiful as Amelie, every scene is full of vivid color and detail, and all the characters have extremely interesting faces and personalities.  I highly recommend ""Amelie"" to anyone looking for a light-hearted, feel-good, change-your-perspective kind of movie...",1007683200,14,2364,5.093506493506493
1706817,4,B0000640VO,"The lack of any decent films from the English lingo countries of England and America has given rise to an increase in recognition of some of the finer foreign language exploits into cinema. Earlier this year we had ""Amores Perros"", and in England we had Japanese shock-fests ""Audition"" and ""Battle Royale"" (the latter has to be seen to be believed). The most successful foreign language film this year, bar ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" obviously, was this French trifle that whilst appealing to the fickle tastes of mainstream audiences superbly serves up its romantic hokiness in a touching and cute way. Over-hyped, to be sure, but not without its pleasures.
Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""The City Of Lost Children"", which he co-directed with Marc Caro, bears the most resemblance to the look of ""Amelie"", which looks different to any other film this year with all of its rich, antique-looking cinematography as well as its inclusion of several effects shots that help to render Paris as paradise on Earth. Visual coups include Amelie herself collapsing to the ground as a puddle of water and the titular garden gnome that travels the world much to the chagrin of its owner, Amelie's father. Everything smacks of resplendence in this movie and no cinematic trick is left not utilised.
In all respects, ""Amelie"" is likely to play better in America than it should in Europe, where its cute benevolence will be welcomed by many, especially after September 11. If you are one of those people who can't help but giggle as bug-eyed little girls stare into the camera with a cheeky smile, then this film is for you (indeed, Audrey Tautou is bug-eyed, cheeky and very good in the title role).

  This film captured my total attention, and took my mind off present concerns and the world situation. The film is masterfully done, with the special effects complimenting the story of a very shy young woman, who gets pleasure from helping others, but ignores her own needs.

They're simply candy-coated entertainments that you can only find at the movies. Obviously, some folks aren't going to care for ""Amelie.""

I should note, however, that the two negative reviews I've spotted here baldly misstate some of the film's ""plot"" points and characterization, and their misreadings may have contributed to their dislike of the film.

1706825,5,B0000640VO,"The Toronto International Film Festival has a history of picking arty hits before they break.  Past winners of its prestigious Audience Award include ""Chariots of Fire"" (1981), ""The Princess Bride"" (1987), ""The Fisher King"" (1991), and, most tellingly, over the last three years it has honoured ""Life is Beautiful"", ""American Beauty"", and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  The 2001 award went to a film that fully lives up to that lofty pedigree: ""Amelie"".
""Amelie"" is a movie that inspires one to use an assortment of frothy adjectives: whimsical, surreal, pleasant, charming, magical, effervescent, and inspiring.  I could go on, but I figure it also deserves to have its praise sung in complete sentences.
It begins with a kinetic retelling of Amelie's childhood.  The product of overprotective parents, Amelie develops a shy nature, but also an abundant imagination.  This section also introduces an appealing way to sketch characters: through their likes and dislikes.  Amelie's father loves the simple pleasure of cleaning out his toolbox.  Her mother hates garden gnomes.  Amelie herself gets lost in the activity of skipping stones across the water.  It's a neat little short hand that the film uses to quickly introduce the audience to its characters.  Better to spend your time showing the characters involved in the story, than to waste too much time on needless character exposition.
When Amelie grows up, we see her simple little life: working at an eclectic diner, walking the streets of Paris, and retreating to the solitude of her apartment, where she can surreptitiously spy on her neighbours (my favourite: The Glass Man, so named for his brittle bones, who's always painting a replica of Renoir's 'The Luncheon of the Boating Party'.).  A chance discovery leads Amelie on a quest to quietly do good deeds, in order to make everybody else's life better.  But who is to make Amelie's life better?  Watch closely, and be prepared to be moved.
Amelie's actions reminded me a lot of the main character in another foreign art-house hit, featuring a charismatic and beautiful female lead sprawling out across her city in an attempt to counteract the fates, ""Run Lola Run"".  Where Franka Potente's Lola was all kinetic energy and brute physical power, Amelie relies on her playful nature to make things right again.  Audrey Tautou, who plays Amelie, sports a lopsided haircut, has huge but asymmetrical eyes, and a glorious smile.  She stomps around Paris in pretty dresses and clunky shoes.  I dare you to try and take your eyes off of her.  Her charisma is so magnetic you could stick her on your fridge.  But Tautou is also perfectly adept at portraying Amelie's more shy moments.  It is this contradiction, the attractive but introverted young woman, which makes Amelie such an appealing and fascinating character.  She is surrounded by a wonderful cast, portraying a menagerie of wonderful characters.  Standouts include Serge Merlin as the aforementioned Glass Man, Isabelle Nanty as a hypochondriac tobacconist, and Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon as a hyper-jealous diner customer.
Take another look at the list of adjectives in the first paragraph above.  Could they also be applied to the other films in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's filmography?  ""Delicatessen""?  Magical, maybe.  ""City of Lost Children""?  Surreal, surely.  ""Alien Resurrection""?  That's a tough one.  The point is that ""Amelie"" is a drastic left-turn for the French writer-director.  It's much lighter in tone, is set in a world that more or less closely resembles our own, and is truly life affirming.  But Jeunet retains his sense of flair with the camera.  ""Amelie"" is a wonder to look at, in that it's composed of a series of beautiful and kinetic shots, which serve to push the story along and create insight into its characters.  Witness one scene, where a young man asks advice from his boss at a Sex Shop.  They casually talk about the mysterious woman trying to get his attention.  But the camera slowly zooms in to reveal that said conversation is taking place while they are pricing and stocking boxes of dildos.  Jeunet has a perverse sense of humour, and this is just one shining example of it.  He also provides his film with a wonderful score, taken from old Paris, but updated to reflect the film's more magical moments (those magical moments include: Amelie, in a moment of embarrassment, turns to water and splashes to the floor; Her bedside lamp, which has a pig in a suit as it's base, reaches out and turns itself off).
""Amelie"" manages a fine balance between a ridiculous sense of fun and severe melancholy.  It gets both emotions just right.  Some would say that at over 2 hours, the film runs too long.  I beg to differ.  I could have spent the whole afternoon and most of the night exploring Amelie's fascinating little world.  Be prepared for a sense of loss when the credits finally roll.  You'll surely miss the joys of ""Amelie"" once they're gone.",1007424000,68,4956,4.998778998778999
1706826,4,B0000640VO,"There is a profound sadness and a distinct mean spiritedness that is at the very core of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""Amelie."" And appropriately enough both of these attributes are part, but not all, of what makes Amelie (Audrey Tautou) not only tick but tick in a full-bodied, fleshed out, multi-dimensional and interesting way.
""Amelie"" is the story of a Parisian waitress and do-gooder who takes it upon herself to correct some of the wrongs she sees in her daily life: she's a vigilante for the unloved, the infirm, the love-sick, the handicapped.  So why is she incapable of approaching Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a man for whom she has fallen in love and righting her own love life?
The character of Amelie and the beguiling performance of Audrey Tautou very much calls to mind Guilietta Massina in ""Nights of Calabria,"" even though the tone of these two films is very different.  The film that ""Amelie"" most calls to mind is Joshua Logan's ""Fanny"" with Leslie Caron.  On the surface both films, one set in Marseilles and the other in Paris, are lighthearted and sunny but there is definitely a dark undercurrent to both stories. They also share a tone of deep forboding and yearning which is interesting because these are the traits I found so resonant in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's only American film, the much maligned ""Alien Resurrection.""
""Amelie"" is shot is super saturated, yet filtered color that makes it appear muted and somewhat aged.  This was the same technique used in ""Burnt Money"" and adds another visual dimension to both films.
""Amelie"" can be interpreted on at least two levels: on the surface level as a humorous Dolly Levy-type story of a woman who, with a twinkle in her eye, helps others as one would do in charity or as the story of a deeply troubled woman who rights the wrongs she sees around her as a way of helping herself feel important and wanted; getting as much as she is giving.
Either way, ""Amelie"" is fun and important yet inviting...pulling you into the world it creates with vividly drawn characters and situations.  My hat is off to Mr. Jeunet and Ms. Tautou.",1007337600,5,2089,4.775623268698061

If Tautou learns English, she could become a major star in the perception of American cinema audiences.
AMELIE grew up socially and tactilely deprived. Her father, a physician, only touched his daughter during her annual physical. She was so thrilled at this rare contact that her heart beat quickly. Diagnosing AMELIE with a congenital heart anomaly, her father kept her out of school. Thus, she was tutored at home and had no friends. Her mother died when the girl was young in a capricious accident involving a distraught tourist and the cathedral of Notre Dame. AMELIE is now a shy, emotionally isolated, and awkward young woman working in a corner bistro.
One day, by a freak of circumstance, AMELIE discovers an old, metal box hidden behind a wall tile in her apartment. It contains the boyhood treasures of someone who is perhaps now past 40. Tracking the man down and anonymously restoring to him his childhood memories causes him immense happiness. Gratified by her success, AMELIE decides to enrich the lives of others. Her schemes are quite intricate, and all are undertaken without the knowledge of the beneficiary - one is even her father.  Along the way, AMELIE discovers the possibility of love, and she pursues the young man with a stratagem just as delightfully elaborate as her other contrivances.
This whimsical film captivates for several reasons. The characters in Amelie's Parisian world are mildly eccentric (though, after further thought, perhaps really quite ""normal""). The director has an offbeat sense of humor, as is revealed in the particulars of the Notre Dame tragedy, and when AMELIE wonders how many orgasms are happening in Paris at a particular moment. Then there's the one scene when AMELIE turns into water. And best of all, there's AMELIE herself. When she looks directly at the camera with her impish smile, one imagines that she's thinking, ""I know a tasty secret, and am willing to share it with you.""
I hope Audrey Tautou becomes a regular on the American silver screen. I think I'm in love.",1007337600,5,2316,4.984496124031008
1706828,1,B0000640VO,"The only thing to recommend this FLICK is some cute special effects.  Which is like recommending a restaurant because it has colorful table cloths.  It has no story line, no substance, and unless you speak French it is very hard to follow.  Don't waste your time, there are too many 'good' movies out there to see.  I wouldn't even recommend this movie for 'rent and take home' for a dollar.",1007337600,10,391,4.542857142857143
1706829,5,B0000640VO,"In ""Amelie,"" Jean-Pierre Jeunet employs the whole panoply of Nouvelle Vague camera and narrative tricks first used by Truffaut, Godard and Malle. He uses them in the service of a sweet, funny story about a young waitress who decides to become the secret benefactress of her eccentric neighbors in Montmartre. The camera charges, darts, swirls and loops as Amelie plays matchmaker, reunites middle-aged men with boyhood treasures, wreaks quiet havoc on the life of a nasty grocer who berates his mentally challenged assistant. The camerawork is incredible, and in Audrey Tautou--with her confiding grin and Louise Brooks-meets-Leslie Caron beauty--Jeunet has found an actress eminently worth photographing. This film, being French, is blase about the existence of sex shops, orgasms, etc., so the blue-nosed be warned. The rest of us will respond with joy to the sunny, stylized Paris of ""Amelie.""",1007251200,2,896,5.4071428571428575
1706830,5,B0000640VO,"One of the most beautiful films I've had the pleasure of watching in a long time, Amelie captures the audience's hearts and minds from the very start. It draws attention to life's subtle yet moving moments and combines it with simple every day events that many of us have grown numb to in our hectic modern day lives. Set in the Monmartre district of Paris, Amelie is essentially a story about a shy, reserved and somewhat eccentric young girl who convinces herself that her mission on this planet is to help people, and so she sets out to do just that. At the same time, she finds herself falling in love with an equally quirky character who collects discarded photographs lying around photo booths. Fabulous escapism that's a breath of fresh air to watch and so different from the run-of-the-mill Hollywood movies of late where the actors and titles change, but the movies remain so similar.",1007164800,3,893,4.730769230769231
1706831,5,B0000640VO,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  With Jeunet as director it's no wonder it was such a successful film (also directed City of Lost Children...another 5 stars!).
Amelie is like the young girl who could have been your quiet playmate as a child and who still captures that innocence as a young woman at 23.  She is the quiet girl in the back of the room wide-eyed in observation with quirky obsessions developed throughout her childhood that have stuck with her over time.  Her wild imaginings and sense of vengeance will leave you tickled-pink.  She becomes a Mother Theresa of sorts when she finds that one of her true callings in life is to help people find simple happiness from memories of long ago in their little day-to-day lives.  Eventually she finds that her own life is in neglect of the happiness she sought as a child and did not recieve from her loveless family.  Now, on her own, Amelie takes foot into a bevy of endless adventure.
The art direction is fantastic and you will learn to fall in love again with the simple pleasures of everyday with Amelie.  Amelie is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant world cold with misery.  Bring the child to life and watch this film.  You will be glad you took the time to sit and watch as the plot unfolds a beautiful story about life, love, and happiness!  Don't blame me for wanting to watch the film again and again!!",1007078400,10,1398,4.404669260700389

This is a sweet, charming, whimsical story filled with magic and humor.  It is not a gripping, edge of your seat story, nor a deeply moving drama. But it has magic and a wonderful wit, which keeps you smiling.
At one level it reminded me of The Red Balloon (a  must see classic.)
The story, about a strange, somewhat alienated young lady who finds a sweet way to give some meaning to her life, has some very creative twists and turns.
Like a fine French pastry, this one will give you pleasure, and perhaps pause to think what you can do if apply a bit of effort and creativity.",1006992000,,607,4.315789473684211
1706833,5,B0000640VO,"Why I loved this movie:  First off, it's in french, subtitled.  Which I love, because I adore the sound.  Secondly, it's surreal.  Beautifully weird.  Thirdly, I totally identify with Amelie, which is probably going to sound really bad once I start talking about the movie.
 Basically, it's a fairytale.  This girl grows up in a very cold family, so she developed a very active fantasy life (which thankfully didn't involve dancing mice), but no social skills.  So when the movie really starts, she's 23, but already has a number of eccentric habits, and she's basically started down that path that ends with 45 cats in a studio apartment.  She has an eclectic, but very nice apartment, she still visits her father every week, even though he doesn't seem to care, she has a job as a waitress in a cafe near Montmartre.  She goes through life as an observer, not a participant, and there's nothing to make her get more involved.  So then one day--the day Lady Di died--she finds a box in her apartment that belonged to a little boy 40 years before.  And she decides to find him.  She decides that if he is pleased to get the box back, she'll continue doing good things like that.  And if he isn't, well, so what. You don't need to know more than this.
 All that you really need to know is that it's wonderful.  It's like watching a deLint story, almost.  It's fabulously surreal, it's gorgeous, it has little bits of magic in an ordinary life.  Amelie is a French Jilly, but not so chipper.  She's gloriously fey--the poster makes her look almost scary--and so nice.  She still at 23 has a very active imagination, and she manages to be pure evil (in an okay manner) once in the movie.  I want this movie.  It was a little sad, very sweet, hysterically funny, and utterly charming all in one. It goes on my list to buy, as if I'll ever find it in the states.  As it is, I'm probably going to go see it sometime this week.",1006732800,34,1920,4.43839541547278
1706834,5,B0000640VO,"I went into this film expecting a cute film about nothing.  I got more than that.  This film was a cute take on the life of a girl (obviously Amelie) who has a strange life.  It starts off by introducing random points that are happening simultaneously.  Her parents are brought into the film through their likes and dislikes.  The random odd-ballness was appealing and catching.  It was hard not to like this film.  It starts off a little strange, but eventually grows into an simple storyline, though in no way boring or dull.  This film gave me a sense of peace by the end, and I could not help but smile.  She herself is an adorable character and easily lovable.  The director portrays France in a way that promotes roundness.  Everything is color coordinated and perfectly fitting.  The clothes of the characters, the attitudes of certain people in relation to their physical appearances.  This movie is about two hours long and there was never a tiring moment.  I highly recommend this movie.  It makes one light-hearted and feel happy about things later.  It has it's unusual parts, such as a porn shop, but these add to the personality of everything.  More or less this movie is about a girl who decideds to change lives.  It's made in a style where one can easily follow along and relate.  Enjoyable.",1006646400,11,1308,4.657894736842105

In closing, one of the VERY BEST FILMS OF 2001. And considering that this has been the worst year in major cinema, I hope ""Amelie"" will make Hollywood shake in their boots and scratch their heads wondering how an original & whimsical French film cannot be made in LA-LA land.
My answer? A little bit of innocence, child-like wonderment and hope never hurts.
Try it! Then have an ice cream afterwards! I'm pretty sure Audrey Tautou will be there in spirit with those big brown eyes, beautiful & luminous smile holding a spoon beside her.

Amelie is no exception; none of the boring explanations you generally get in American films as to the whimsy you see on the screen (note the twins in one scene, they are just there for the visual delight, that's all!)  And, Amelie, oh my, is there anyone who cannot relate to the dysfunction she's endured, and not believe that one can go on to be charming and eccentric, if only the world was as acceptably nutty as it is in Amelie's world?

Audrey Tautou's portrayal of this remarkable character coupled with Jean-Pierre Jeunet's whimsical story-telling is intoxicating.  I literally stumbled out of the theatre cognizant of the fact that I was in no condition to drive. Why? I had just met the person we all want to know, who felt the way we all want to feel.

1706840,5,B0000640VO,"Amelie is a wonderful and sensible little film about a wonderfully simple young woman. Amelie was born to parents who seemed more concerned about their careers than about her. Her lack of attention and over protective upbringing will lead to her shy and quiet manner.
As an adult Amelie lives a simple life as a waitress, she finds pleasure in simple observations and skipping stones along Paris famous canals. Yet her simple life is changed upon the news of Lady Diana's tragic death. An accident reveals a serendipitous discovery that leads her to bring joy to those around her and avenge those who have made her miserable. Her good deeds are elaborate, almost Rube Goldberg like in their complexity but each one leads to happiness for the recipient. Whether it is reuniting a father with his estranged family to helping her own father pursue his dream of traveling, Amelie uses this newfound courage to go out and find happiness for those around her.
Directed by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Amelie is a break from his earlier surreal distopian fare (City of Lost Children, Delicatessen). In contrast Amelie is a warm and pleasant comedy that features his unique style and quirky characters without the dark and cruel background of previous works. Amlie makes you want to smile with her frail appearance that reveals her warm heart and devilish wit, she is so full of life and yearning for adventure. Her search for other peoples happiness will lead to her own search for love but along the way she has to make that guy respect and admire her even more.",1006128000,5,1563,4.835820895522388

The basic plot of the movie has been recopunted by others, and so I won't go into it in detail here; essentially it's the story of a young girl looking for meaning in her life, who finds it in making others happy. But there's so much more than that; the plot is almost incidental to the magic.
Movies like Amelie show what really great films can accomplish while at the same time showing the paucity of imagination of most multi-million dollar Hollywood epics. There's so much detail, so much imagination and so much pure joy here that you'll find yourself constantly laughing out loud and crying with delight. The characters aren't the two dimensional fashion models you'll find in a ""Titanic"", but rich, full people, the sort you feel you might know, people whom you care about.

director jean-pierre-jeunet does a variation on the classic jane austen character and recreates a marvel for the ages. amelie's life story is like a cartoon, and yet the cartoon is a believeable as real life. nothing happens quite the way you expect and the result is in the name of goodness. she is not gorgeous, but she is cute; her face is unforgettable; she is the patron saint of the outcasts, wonderfully left of center.
i'll try to explain this movie, but it will be an injustice. amelie appears to help those who need it: she finds a small box of toys under the sink in her bathroom, the night princess di dies. they belonged to a former tenant from 40 years ago. amelie gets the toys to the owner without being discovered. and when the man finds the box, he is in tears and reevaluates what's important in his life. amelie then goes on to play matchmaker for two jaded hearts who hang out at the resteraunt where she works as a waitress, and she becomes an avenging angel,  fighting for a dim bulb employee at a vegetable stand who is constantly taunted by his boss. i'll just say she finds subtle ways to drive him mad.
amelie becomes all things to all people, but she is shy and introverted; she then meets a man, nino, who changes her life...

The sheer delight, sadness, joy, elation, humour and down-right fantastic entertainment value of this film is overwhelming.  Audrey Tautou's performance is breath-taking, and she will steal your heart as much as any fine performances in the history of cinema will have done before.
It's like a re-birth for your faith in cinema.  If you feel that cinema is a dying art, this will prove it's still alive and kicking.  If you believe cinema is alive and kicking, you won't know how hard until you see this.
The story is simple, but perfect - a love story set against the most ridiculous and charming of obstacles.  The innocence of this movie shines through with Amelie's bashful and wonderful pursuit of her 'Love At First Sight', her whimsical and definitely child-like take on anything that we may consider routine or tradition, and the mockery of every day life is so funny that it could never, ever be offensive, even to the most hardened creature of routine.

I visited Paris this summer and ""Amelie"" was playing there - one of my good friends who lives in Paris, told me then that the film was completely fantastic and a must-see. I took her word for it, and have not been disappointed in the slightest. In fact, I wrote to thank her this morning for recommending such a wonderful way to spend two hours.

The story is magical, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and the whimsical elements make you bubble with laughter. It seems like an odd pairing, but Jeunet's meticulous, and usually dark visual detail works perfectly with this airy adventure. From the beautiful city-scapes, the the wonderful close-ups of the characters, the art direction seduces the viewer into complete submission, and you will probably never want to be released.

1706852,1,B0000640VO,"(...)The story begins by recounting the simultaneous occurrences at the moment when Amelie (Audrey Tautou in what is barely allowed to be a performance) was conceived. This fascination with coincidence continues throughout, and seems to be cribbed, like the film's updates on the state of the weather from PT Anderson's Magnolia, and really neither seems to add anything to the film. We get to see Amelie grow up in the film's frenzied opening moments, and the combination of many short scenes accompanied by voiceover narration feels like early Godard or Truffaut's Jules and Jim (which Amelie attends a screening of). Still, this grows tiresome in a way that  their films didn't. When every shot is meant to amaze, none do.
Once the film settles down on the adult Amelie in 1997, she seems relatively well adjusted even though she lost her mother at an early age and she didn't get enough hugs from her father. She engages in casual sex and seems rather content and unquestioning in life. Once she hears news of Princess Diana's death on television, however, she seems to regress into a childlike state. She seems to be stunned by the announcement of that tragedy, and her attentions become diverted immediately upon hearing it by a small tin box filled with children's toys that she finds. She becomes obsessed with the toys, and with finding their owner, and is able to literally shut the news of the princess' death off once she finds them. It's almost as if she reverts to being the girl that she was before her mother was killed. She seems to recreate herself as a princess in order to deny the loss of Diana. Suddenly, she needs more than just sex. She needs Romance, Love, and Justice... all with a capital letters! Her views of the world regress until they have a childlike simplicity. She begins playing tricks again on those that are mean, as she did when she was a child. She seems to become repulsed by sex without love (she tries to block it out when it rears his head by turning on a cappuccino machine or by hanging up a phone).
The man that she becomes attracted to is presented as a phallic nightmare. He works in a sex shop(...). Although Amelie is not a virgin, she sure acts like one in his presence. He catches Amelie's eye, but she is unable to approach him. She ends up creating a series of coy games to lure him to her. She has problems relating to other people, and initially communicates with them through notes, film clips, or her own imagination. She begins to apply her principles to the world around her. She becomes consumed by her childlike idealism, and is petulant when the world does not bend to her ideals. This transformation is interesting, but the film flubs badly when it wants us to approve of it. Of course, Amelie is optimistic, and that's great, but she is also detached from any rational understanding of the world. Her idealization of her mate results in a one-sided relationship that doesn't seem to function on any mature, adult level. Her never-ending winsomeness seems to ignore the world around her, and the film never calls her bluff. It's infuriating.
This fanciful film ultimately failed to engage me since it was not about any perception of reality that I could relate to. The world of Amelie has no politics. It has no issues. It only has an exaggerated sense of quirkiness and a pea-(...)The film's suggestion that maturity is founded on cynicism is ludicrous and worthy of a Robin Williams movie or Pay it Forward (which at least had Helen Hunt's acting -- Tautou is overdirected and barely gets to deliver more than two consecutive lines here). Amelie, which feels much more similar in tone and style to Hollywood productions than most French ones, isn't far from Williams' tearjerkers in terms of quality.",1005350400,44,3767,4.724924012158055
1706853,5,B0000640VO,"Many people have referred to this moving as a gem.  It is, I must say, uplifting and cinematically gorgeous.  The opening sequence alone is beautiful.  The plot itself, while traditional -- lonely person falls in love -- while not full of the typical ""twists and turns,"" is sparkling with creativity.  All of the characters are well-developed and enticing.  Some of the delights include: the garden gnome Amelie steals from her father's house and sends on trips to other countries to convince the widower that he needs to see the world; Mathieu Kassovitz's character, who collects ruined pictures from the photo booths around Paris (the fact that he works both at a porn shop and the Foire du Trone, a fair that does have the run-down, slightly dangerous feeling of Coney Island is also funny); the pair that work at the local fruit stand -- the evil boss whom Amelie winds up playing a number of pranks on in a delightfully amusing scene; and his employee, the sweet-but-stupid boy who loves the fruit.  Probably the most interesting and most crucial relationship in the movie is the one that develops between Amelie, a girl who is charming but shy and ultimately slightly frightened to really be in the world, and the ""glass man,"" the old painter who lives in her building.  It is ultimately through the old man that Amelie comes to realize that she must seize life; simulaneously, she tries to do the same for him.  I have mentioned a couple of brilliant parts of the plot, but there are many more.  (The circumstances surrounding Amelie's mother's death are hilarious, as is the reason that Amelie was not allowed to go to school as a child.  The people at the cafe are all full of life as well.  In fact, the character development is probably one of the most compelling things about the film.)  Being from France, I suppose I am obliged to say that I am glad that a non-Hollywood movie has captured America's attention -- in Seattle, where I was living last year, the movie played for 6 months at the same movie theater.  It is ultimately a romantic dramedy -- not wholly comedic, because it is also profoundly touching (the type of movie people say changed their life, even when it probably didn't).  Audrey Tautou is a soon-to-be-legend in France, but let's not forget Mathieu Kassovitz, who's character is also fabulous.  Tautou is wide-eyed, mysterious, and coquette.  Kassovitz plays his role in a subdued manner that makes the romance between the two all the more wonderfully serendipitous.",1005264000,,2501,4.794871794871795

1706865,5,B0000640VO,"There are two French movies that I consider must-see: The Grand Illusion and Amelie. Amelie is funny, sad, happy, romantic, mysterious, strange, absurd, sexy, cute, and just fun. Brief synopsis: Innocent Amelie is trying to find the mystery of happiness and this is the story of what happens on the journey. What made the movie for me was the way each character is described in intimate detail. I've never seen this technique used before. Basically, the movie pauses when you meet a central character and you are told about his/her background, habits, likes, dislikes, etc. Besides being very funny, it brings you even closer to Amelie's world. One last thing: The bit with the garden gnome is worth the price of the ticket! See it, buy it.",1004832000,2,740,4.834645669291339

This time I could not but seeing this movie was a lovely substitute.  The film is beautifully written and directed; well acted and the type of movie which, had it been filmed in the United States might have starred Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.  The slice of Parisian life is beautifully done; more importrantly it can give the viewer an understanding of the importance of neighborhoods in the city.

Directed with his usual eye for off kilter beauty, Jean Jeunet presents us with the Paris of fantasy, the one we allways knew was there (underneath all the dog poop and the public urination).  The charm of Paris is surpassed only by the staggering loveliness of lead actress Audrey Tautou as she searches for inventive ways to better the lives of those around her.

1706871,5,B0000640VO,"Funny, moving, intelligent, original... Amelie takes us on a trip through the streets of Paris, showing us, through her imagination, the real beauty and little pleasures of life.

1706872,5,B0000640VO,"Before I urge you to rush out and revel in this romantic wisp of a movie, I must warn you that it is the kind of film that will make you either quake with bleary joy, or propel you out of the cinema with an ungovernable urge to smash things.  If the words 'sugar', 'naive' or 'cute' are not in your vocabulary; if the mere sight of a bobbed gamine making eyes at you across the screen doesn't make your heart flutter; if scenes where lamps discuss their owner's love life with her paintings, or a young girl screams to save her suicidal goldfish don't enchant you, than, in the words of Gilbert and Sullivan, don't go.
If, however, you feel your spiritual home is in France, than 'Amelie' might just make you fall in love again.  it is for those who love Paris in sunshine or rain; who palpitate at the very thought of tree-lined Parisian streets and cafes; who have experienced haunting musical epiphanies at night in empty Metro stations; who have read Raymond Queneau novels; who rejoice in street markets, Renoir paintings, or the sight of horses running in the Tour de France.
'Amelie' is a romantic comedy for those who prefer the chase to the clinch.  its heroine is almost a ghost, unloved and friendless as a child, who presides disembodied over strangers' lives, linking characters, punishing baddies and deciding destinies in ways that seem supernatural to them.  She can only observe others from a distance and act accordingly - her own life remains emotionally dead.  Of the various Queneau-like mysteries, red-herrings, non-sequiters and paper trails strewn throughout the film, the most pressing and emotionally charged is - will Amelie find love and rejoin the real world?
The film is unashamedly nostalgic in its romantic vision of a vanished (never-was?) Paris, where musette is still played in sparse cafes, and funfairs and ghost trains become sites of erotic possibility.  The CGI effects are used not for inhuman spectacle, but to do rich justice to individuals' inner lives.  The idea of reworking the past; the comfort of myths, lies and delusions; the creation of one's own future - these are some of the film's themes, and they encompass characters, culture and place.  As such, the film has been condemned as reactionary.  It's probably sexist (although I identified with Amelie, rather than simply fancying her).
It has reminded people of various reference points from the Oulipo writers to the early films of the French New Wave to Ally MacBeal.  its most recent counterpart might be 'Magnolia', from the opening narrtion with its comic chaos theory, and its narrative about disparate people trying to connect, to the godlike force that contrives to do so.  But it's much more treasurable than that.  i loved this film.  I loved the adorable Audrey Tautou, funny and smart, with huge melancholy eyes - a 21st century Audrey Hepburn.  I loved the way the film felt like a cinematic novel without being literary.  I loved the way the mystery plots took on emotional dimensions - the connection of clues to recover the past to restore happiness.  I loved the colours, especially those rich reds; the wistful accordian music; the love of vignettes, photographs, chance, fantasy, dreams...",1003276800,353,3213,4.900369003690037

7960273,2,B0000640VO,"I was disappointed. I heard that this movie was a fantasy, but it seemed more like a romantic comedy with brief fantastical sequences thrown in. Even worse, while the main characters enjoy a happy ending, things remain bad for pretty much everyone else, which is ironic considering that the main impetus for the plot is Amelie's desire to help others. For example, while the end of movie resolves one of the secondary story lines--the unwillingness of Amelie's father to travel--it leaves most of the others unresolved--the tension between Georgette and Joseph, Raymond's inability to paint the woman drinking the water, Collignon's insulting attitude toward Lucien, Hipolito's professional failure. Therefore, while the movie appears to want to be a comedy, the ending actually seems quite pessimistic. Perhaps the director filmed satisfying conclusions for the secondary characters and those parts merely got cut in the editing process. I don't know, but this version of the film, at least, is utterly unsatisfying.",1525132800,,1017,5.40251572327044
