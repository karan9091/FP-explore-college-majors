220842,4,6300179109,"Manhattan Baby, considered a failure by many critics that wanted Fulci to conform to the formula of horror that made him successful, was actually one of his more entertaining movies. This was because it did break from the proverbial mould, building more on a storyline and an ever-present, overwhelming scene of doom. Unlike many of his earlier movies (Zombie, The Beyond) that brought this bleak overview with them as well, Lucio decided to try a new avenue in this presentation, one that only briefly sprinkled gore into the cinematic formula, causing much of the fallout experienced. He said that he wanted to present a more metaphysical terror, using a small array of special effects in the process, that would give his film a more Catholicist, ""evil can be beaten but not truly destroyed,"" mentality. Well, mission accomplished.
  The storyline, with its Egyptian focal point, deals with the manifestation of an ancient evil that is awaken (and overused) by a little girl after her foolishly curious archeologist father prods at things best left alone. It has some nice scenes with pieces of dark humor mixed together with catchy ""manifesations/proofs of the dark forces present,"" plus some humorously cheap scenes that keep the movie from taking itself too serious. All in all, its fun and a bit dark at the same time, and is a good film for horror lovers/Lucio fans that remember his Sci-fi trials/Westerners and not simply his gore films.",1025222400,21,1446,5.020833333333333

220846,3,6300179109,"A complaint that can be made of just about every one of the many horror films out these days is that they have in some way, shape or form ripped off something from their predecessors.  Manhattan Baby is no exception.  Although I do not get the overt Exorcist connection that most people see in this film, I can definitely see the parallel with Poltergeist.  Interestingly, although the film begins in an Egyptian tomb, most of the action takes place within an apartment-and the stylish way he transmits the claustrophobia of a tomb into this apartment for the duration of most of the film is where I think Fulci triumphs the strongest.  Things I thought were effective:  the actress who played the girl, the photo in the park, the conjured doorway, the body in the wall, the eyeless entity in the beginning of the film, and (I may stand alone on this one) the attack of the birds at the film's end-this scene was so out there, I was taken in nevertheless . . . strings and all.",995241600,4,977,4.497175141242938
220847,4,6300179109,"Falling as the very last film in Fulci's ""gothic"" cycle (consisting of Zombie, City of the Living Dead, House By the Cemetery, The Beyond, and The Black Cat) Manhattan Baby is far to often the victim of bad press, mainly due to the admittedly disappointing lack of gore, somewhat ""low budget"" production values, and the almost non-existent story.  While all of the aforementioned downfalls do exist, they in no way destroy the film as a whole.
Manhattan Baby is what all of Fulci's horror films of that period were, an exercise in visual cinema.  While this time around the visuals tend to not be of such an evisceary nature, they remain visceral none the less. Heavy clouds of green and yellow envelope the screen in the opening desert scenes, (added towards the end of production, and against Fulci's wishes) creating a vast hopelessness that near rivals his visions of hell in The Beyond.
After we move from the desolate landscapes of Egypt, to the claustrophobic confines of a New York apartment, the color schemes move more into blue's and reds, (while not of the extreme Suspiria, or Whip and the Body variety). With this, the atmosphere of the film drops into a creepy drone, very efficiently conveying the confusion and fear of a frightened child.  Up to this point the movie works wonderfully, the problem is that it never really picks up a full head of steam after that.  Somewhat uneventful deaths follow one after another, all taking place without the patented Fulci gore that fans have come to expect from his films (especially of that era).  And while the feel of the movie remains dark in tone and cinematography, most of the ""creepy"" scenes fail to shock due mostly to a lack of the necessary budget to pull them off.  It isn't until the last few minutes of the film that the maestro pulls out all the stops with a neck spurting, face ripping finale. But even that suffers from Fulci's habit of using unconvincing animal puppets in attack scenes, whose similarity to the Muppets can quash the fear from even the scariest of scenes. (See the tarantula attack in The Beyond, and the always loveable Cat in the Brain)
One watches this film with somewhat mixed feelings; both enjoying the experience while simultaneously wishing that they could see the film Fulci had envisioned.  If he had only been granted the time and money to make the film he had originally set out to achieve, Lucio would no doubt be celebrated for Manhattan Baby the way he is many of his other classics.  As it stands though, we still have this, a skeleton that was the makings for a classic that only the Maestro could have pulled off.",993254400,3,2623,4.699346405228758
220897,5,6300179109,Manhattan Baby is a beautiful shot supernatural thriller. I really enjoyed it and was shock that it got so many bad reviews. It's not for everyone but if you are a fan of Fulci check it out. The film is almost dreamlike in some sequences and the score by Fabio frizzi is chilling. The ending I think will confuse people but I understood it after a second watch that made me love the film even more. This film is truly a underrated masterpiece. Highly recommended.,1409184000,3,463,4.458823529411765

220899,1,6300179109,"Also released as Eye of the Evil Dead and The Possessed, this is yet another example of how Lucio Fulci (Aenigma, Conquest, The Beyond) is great as getting our attention and awful at storytelling.  He's also bad at titles.  Why oh why is this called ""Manhattan Baby""?  Yes, the girl lives in New York.  But ""baby""?  What was this guy smoking when he came up with this?

So, this archaeologist goes spelunking in an Egyptian tomb where he encounters a glowing gemstone that shoots lasers into his eyes, blinding him.  This may sound inexplicably random, but it's exactly the sort of senselessness I've come to expect from Fulci.
His young daughter Susie becomes possessed by some evil spirit inside of an amulet that dad gave her from the expedition.  Because that's what archaeologists do with ancient Egyptian artifacts recovered during professional expeditions.  They dole them out as gifts to children!  Seems legit.

This movie was awful and its badness really wasn't even fun at all.  Fulci steered away from his iconic gory shock tactics and tries to strike fear into us with such horrifying images as a cobra on your kitchen floor, being stuck in an elevator, a paranormal investigator's stupid babble or finding a scorpion in your desk drawer.  If you're wondering how that would be scary, let me spare you the effort.  It's not scary.  Not a bit.  It's just dumb.  I can comfortably say that nothing about this movie was done well.  Not even the X-ray that showed a cobra comfortably residing in Susie's chest, which by the way, was SUPER DUMB.

One scene made me laugh.  We'll call it ""taxidermy's revenge.""  A bunch of stuffed birds suspended by strings (which we can clearly see) kill a guy in the one gory scene of the movie.  This was poorly executed, but funny.  Why did the stuffed birds attack?  No clue.  What made them do it?  No clue.  This shitstorm just happened before my eyes as I stared with a stupefied grin.

 I really can't think of much to write about here.  There isn't anything to spoil, there's nothing to the plot, and the movie is basically boring.  This movie almost made me angry.  For real--actually angry.",1384905600,4,2143,4.723577235772358
220900,4,6300179109,"This film fails to live up to the standards of Fulci's great horror work 1979-1982.

It plays like the old master just going through the motions of his greatest hits: lots of eye zooms, supernatural reveals set to staccato music at the end of scenes, and stodgy effects.  The actors are fine, but lack the charisma of past leads.

Most depressingly the entire soundtrack, normally a highlight of Italian horror productions, is cribbed from his earlier, better films.

If you love the director's earlier films you'll probably get around to watching this anyway, so rest assured Blue Underground has created the best DVD possible.",1346112000,,628,5.009615384615385
220901,3,6300179109,"""Manhattan Baby"", despite the inclusion of a very small amount of gore near the end, managed to out-bore even the dull ""The Black Cat"". If you have to buy one of the Fulci releases from Anchor Bay, your best bet would be ""House by the Cemetery"". ""Manhattan Baby"" isn't enthusiastically recommended as a film, but given its very respectable presentation on DVD, this disc should fit nicely alongside other Fulci releases on your DVD rack.",1307145600,,437,4.84
220902,3,6300179109,"""Manhattan Baby"" opens with an excellent prologue set in atmospheric ruins of the Egyptian pyramids. Lucio Fulci seems very at home filming these photogenic sequences which set up a rather daft story about possession via an ancient amulet. Naturally the possessed individual is an irritating child (influences of ""The Exorcist""), and Fulci's reliance on his two child actors, and lots of narrative inconsistencies ultimately undoes the promise of this fine opening. Fulci's usually insane editing patterns create an immediate sense of disconnectedness and a filmic space in which time and its ever shifting progress cannot be trusted.

Unfortunately the whole thing goes downhill (as it often does in Fulci's films) when he has to deal with characters and their complex interactions. When the action moves to Manhattan, the clich&eacute;s begin to pile up, the actors show their limitations and the whole thing collapses into senselessness. But fans of Lucio Fulci, of which I consider myself one don't care about these things. In fact much of the pleasure from Fulci's work derives from this lack of cohesion and sense.

But other things save ""Manhattan Baby"" from outright disaster. It's clear that this at one time was a very ambitious project, and Fulci struggles to realise the visual ambitions that a limited budget imposed on him. But his efforts are well worth watching. The film is also very self referential, not only too more obvious big budget productions such as ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"" and ""The Awakening"", but also too Fulci's own films. The strange alienated and empty landscape of Egypt is oddly evocative of Fulci's vision of hell in ""The Beyond"".

 Fulci's efforts to create atmosphere necessarily lead to a film that is very light on gore (save for a particularly inventive stuffed bird attack), and the director makes little use of the potential of his Manhattan locations. Although the ancient evil which possesses the young girl is never satisfactorily explained, it does provide some nice moments involving snakes and scorpions. In conclusion this is an interesting, intriguing, but ultimately failed experiment which marked the end of Fulci's most creative and successful period.",1198627200,2,2210,5.269886363636363

220904,1,6300179109,"I thought if I finally watched ""Manhattan Baby"" on DVD in widescreen rather than the poor full-screen video copies of it that were previously available, I'd be able to re-appraise it, but sadly, I still find that it's among Lucio Fulci's worst efforts. Fulci displays no evidence whatsoever in this movie that he knows what to shoot to make an interesting or suspenseful film. Half the time, he can find nothing worth putting in front of the lens except extreme close-ups of the actors eyes. Time and time again, the camera zooms in for lingering close-ups of the actors eyes, when there could have been - there must have been - so many other creative possibilities to choose from...did nobody point this out?

Anyway, whatever the artistic ""vision"" was supposed to be, the story goes roughly as follows: A husband and wife take their young daughter on a trip to Egypt, so that the husband can investigate an ancient tomb, and the wife can take pictures of all the tourist sights. The daughter, Suzy, wanders off alone and is ambushed by an Egyptian crone who gives her a mysterious amulet. (Cue the first of many extreme close-ups of eyes, and of the amulet, which also bears the design of an eye). At the same time the husband is blinded by a flash of blue light that emanates from a forbidden burial chamber that he has just discovered. Back in New York, the family is reunited with Suzy's younger brother Tommy (played by the same child actor who played Bob in ""House By The Cemetery"" ), and their nanny. From this point on, Suzy begins to act strangely, wandering about the house (cue extreme close-ups of eyes), scaring the nanny by playing odd hide and seek games with Tommy (cue more extreme close-ups of eyes), and putting the amulet in various random places for some unfathomable kind of dramatic focus (cue more extreme close-ups of the amulet). While all this inconsequential nonsense is going on, the parents of the children drift in and out of the action, occasionally looking fraught or troubled at the goings on (cue more close ups of eyes, naturally). A few people die in unremarkable ways. The end of the film sees Suzy fall more perilously under the spell of the amulet (cue more close-ups of the amulet) and the struggle to save her by a mysterious antique shop owner who comes to visit Suzy and tells the worried family that he can undo the curse (cue more close-ups of eyes).

Watching this film is only slightly more fun than watching paint dry. Fulci seems to have entirely run out of ideas about how to make a film that is visually stimulating - there is nothing even approaching interesting on the screen for about 90% of the running time. Just endless talking heads and those never ending eye close-ups. The trademark gore scenes are all but absent, save for one right near the end when a character is attacked by stuffed birds. The slant that the birds are stuffed rather than alive -  having supposedly been re-animated by the evil power - is quite a good one, but sadly you can see the wires carrying them around the room in EVERY SINGLE shot during the attack. At least there were some good old-school close ups of bloody flesh-pecking to wake me up at this stage, but the film was over an hour and twenty minutes through by this time...far too late for redeeming the movie as a whole.

The dubbing is also terrible, the worst I have seen for a long time. Especially of the children.  When an instant photo turns out badly, Suzy exclaims chirpily ""It's a dud, defective stock!""...What the...? And when the parents ask where the babysitter has vanished to, young Tommy exlaims ""She's gone on a voyage!"" A voyage? What 8 year old boy uses words like ""voyage""? It's almost a shame to see poor Giovanni Frezza, who appears to be an unselfconscious and lively child actor, crippled by such a hideous dubbed script. At least be thankful he does not have the same sounding voice he had in ""The House by the Cemetery"", which similarly ruined his character. But the fault lies way beyond pinning this on lame performances (Although I would have loved to see Katherine MaColl take the role as the mother rather than the lacklustre Martha Taylor, and Christopher Connelly is equally forgettable as the father.). There is really nothing worth keeping your attention on the screen for. A passably attractive prologue filmed on location in Egypt soon gives way to the rest of the film almost entirely taking place in the family's nondescript apartment. The antique shops looks like the set of the basement from ""The House by the Cemetery"" with just the cobwebs removed, and even the music is lifted from previous Fulci films, most notably some very recogniseable music from ""The Beyond"". How any self-respecting director can just re-use a score that was (one would presume) originally composed to match the story and atmosphere of one of his previous films is beyond me.

The plot, as usual, does not serve up anything cohesive to the audience, so without any arresting visuals or jolting gore scenes, watching the film is a pretty boring experience. There's no climactic ending, just a rather tame suggestion of the cyclical recurrence of the evil curse, the origins or intentions of which are never explained anyway during the entire plot. And as if you hadn't had enough by now, the film closes with - yes you guessed it -  more extreme close ups of eyes and another, final (thank god!) close up of the wretched amulet, not that the sight of it produced any sense of dread throughout the whole dreary story. I will allow that there have been reports of imposed conditions behind the making of ""Manhattan Baby"" that lead Fulci to make some severe compromises, but he has to take responibility for what he delivered to his audience, and he should be ashamed of the undeniable weakness of the end result.",1143590400,9,5821,4.69539666993144
220905,3,6300179109,"Lucio Fulci's ""MANHATTAN BABY"" is not even close to his best effort,but just like ""SWEET HOUSE OF HORROR"" it has its tiny moments of Fulci's atmospheric & gorey brilliance. A sure shot for Fulci fans! all others should rent before buying!",1126483200,3,238,4.829268292682927
220906,2,6300179109,"Italian horror will never be seen as art to the masses.  Even the hardcore fans admit to the cheesiness as being part of the attraction to them, but even though it's a trashy kind of genre, you can screw up!  Lucio Fulci screwed up here.  To people now taking an interest in Fulci, I'm sure this dvd cover has stared out at you from the shelf at the store and beckoned you to take it home .  Don't listen to it!  Yeah, it's Fulci, and yeah, it's from Anchor Bay, but don't let that fool you.  Manhattan Baby is BAD, even for a Fulci film.  With most of his horror films you could always guarantee to have a fun viewing experience, but this is actually quite painful.  Everything you love about his previous works is nowhere to be found here.  Fulci was actually trying to make a real horror film with suspense and stuff.  Many directors accomplish this, but Fulci never has, and he certainly doesn't here.  Fulci's films excel in atmosphere, music, gore, cheesiness and just downright strangeness.  This film has none of that.  It's basically a reworking of the Charleton Heston mummy flick, The Awakening-which was no masterpiece, but better than this.  The only purpose this dvd will serve is to make your Italian horror dvd collection look bigger, coz it will get only one or maybe two viewings-mark my words!

7804443,5,6300179109,"Manhattan Baby blu-ray

It's odd out of all the blu-rays Blue-Underground has released of not only Lucio Fulci films, but all their releases that Manhattan Baby just might be their best release thus far. The release of Zombie and Maniac are also contenders, but Manhattan Baby gets a slight edge. Most of the reviews for Manhattan Baby are subpar and I really can't defend the film as there's really zero plot and things just randomly happen, which was common in 80s Italian horror, but what they lacked in logic they made up for in being fun. Manhattan Baby isn't one of Fulci's strongest films, but I don't think it's as bad as some reviews. Even though the Beyond and House By the Cemetery lack logic they both have eerie atmosphere and terrific gore F/X. Manhattan Baby isn't as eerie and there's very little gore except the final death scene. Manhattan Baby is simply average at best, but while it isn't top 10, but I wouldn't rate it in the bottom either it's again simply average, but yet gets a 5-star blu-ray treatment.

The HD is probably the best Blue-Underground release thus far as Manhattan Baby simply looks wonderful. The audio is also strong. The audio is English only and before anyone complains Italian films were shot with no sound so all of them are dubbed plus a good portion of these films have English speaking actors and were often filmed in English and since it was filmed with no sound it didn't matter how well anyone spoke English. An Italian track would be dubbed so it really isn't an issue that it's English only.

7804444,3,6300179109,"Produced just as the exploitation market was winding down, Manhattan Baby (1982) also finds director Lucio Fulci at the tail end of his collaboration with writer / producer combo Dardano Sacchetti and Fabrizio De Angelis, the same team responsible for a string of gore-heavy Fulci classics like The Beyond and House by the Cemetery.  But here the pendulum swings towards ancient mysticism and optical effects, bypassing the usual blood and guts in favor of exotic curses and Egyptian tombs.  It might be a bit of an adjustment for Fulci's more rabid fans, but the execution still bears all the marks of his indelible cinematic signature.

Archeologist George Hacker (Christopher Connelly) and his family return from Egypt with a deadly curse in tow.  George himself has been blinded by a sacred amulet - the very same one that has now taken possession of his daughter's soul - causing several deadly accidents to those who attempt to dispose of it.  The victims are sent into parallel dimensions, which defy logic, but tantalize the occult community.  Desperate to save their family, George and his wife allow a mysterious antiques dealer (Cosimo Cinieri) into their home who may or may not have their best interests in mind.

Like much Italian horror, Manhattan Baby isn't suited to a quick synopsis.  The supernatural rules are extremely flexible, characterization is minimal and the plot segues from one illogical dream state to another.  All in the best possible way, of course!  Fulci's eye for composition is firmly in place, especially in the opening scenes set against some stunning Egyptian ruins.  And the pulsing score by Fabio Frizzi repeats an obscenely catchy theme that enhances everything on screen.

But Manhattan Baby feels unsure of itself, twisting in a breeze of classic and current horror references (The Exorcist and Poltergeist are two of the most obvious) while failing to deliver the gory goods Fulci aficionados have come to expect until the overstuffed finale.  The film's best moments are its most subtle like the carpet of sand left behind after one well-intentioned character's inter-dimensional journey.  In their attempt to evolve past their Gothic tendencies, Fulci and company wound up staring at a metaphysical cul-de-sac.

Still, viewing the film is the equivalent of horror-fan comfort food thanks to the director's familiar visual style and Frizzi's equally familiar score, parts of which popped up in other Fulci films.  And those looking for an upgrade from the old 2001 DVD will have their minds properly blown by Blue Underground's 3-disc limited edition which includes a new 2K hi-def transfer, DVD copy and original motion picture soundtrack CD!

The transfer is as pristine as soft, Italian photography can get (which is wonderful, besides a few distracting hairs in the camera gate), and buoyed by some blistering use of color and a 5.1 DTS score.  Extras include a previous interview with Dardano Sacchetti and a whole new slate of special features, including more sit-downs with co-star Cosimo Cinieri, make-up effects artist Maurizio Trani, and film historian Stephen Thrower.  But the bulk of the attention goes to composer Fabio Frizzi, who takes part in a one-hour documentary about his career as well as a live studio performance of the Manhattan Baby Suite.  Trailers, stills and a great set of liner notes from Troy Howarth make this one a comprehensive shelf-filler...even if it's not likely to come down too often afterwards.",1476662400,5,3483,5.152753108348135
