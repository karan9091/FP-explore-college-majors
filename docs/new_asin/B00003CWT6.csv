While I haven't watched all the content yet, I did put every single disc into my player to see if they work. They seem fine. The disc surfaces themselves, both top and bottom, were in near mint condition. Very pleased. So far so good and seems all legit (always seems like a risk shopping for films online).

1297703,3,B00003CWT6,"RELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring adapts the first part of JRR Tolkiens popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular Fellowship of the Ring, to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor.

The rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).

This three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that itd be sinful to give it a lower rating.

There are problems, however, at least for those who aren't uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it couldve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn't care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.

Fifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren't much more than glorified cameos. Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story.

Despite these negatives, The Fellowship of the Ring is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.

1297851,4,B00003CWT6,"UPSIDE: I write here about the whole trilogy. It does yeoman duty in bringing a great work of literature to the screen. Absolutely, the photography of New Zealand and use of CGI are jaw-dropping incredible; I can see why these films garnered recognition from the Oscars. The use of the languages invented by Tolkien was awesome. The actors all portrayed their characters just as we would have expected to see them portrayed. The costuming is just wonderful in keeping with the medieval atmosphere of the story.

And not least, if you are into historical costume play (think Medieval-Renaissance festivals), watching the military maneuvers of the armies, from the ""tortoise"" to the shield wall, you will be astonished at the accuracy in the use of the all the different methods of attack. Even the bows and arrows are historically right-on (I am into Medieval-Renaissance costuming). (For a real adventure story, read about the life of Christopher Lee in World War II as he fought the Nazis, and what he told Jackson about sound effects when a sword is plunged into human flesh. Some studio should make a movie about those World War II adventures, and how Lee and his cohorts WON.)

DOWN SIDE: Who did Jackson think his prime audience was going to be? Sure, we go to the movies to be entertained, and to see our favorite stories brought to life. The battle scenes go on and on and on, but so do they in the novels. (Remember, Tolkien saw front line battles in World War One.) Unfortunately, each and every movie in the trilogy has some 8th grade snide comment in it (body functions, body parts, cuss words). That is why I even hesitate to watch movies being made today; at least one or more insipid, out-of-character, ""wash the director's mouth out with soap"" commentary crops up.

Overall, I still think this is a fantastically-researched and acted work of cinematic art.",1518480000,,1871,4.804347826086956

1297856,5,B00003CWT6,"The movie Lord of The Rings Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of Peter Jacksons epic trilogy which follows a well-cast Fellowship to destroy the one ring. This movie in my personal opinion is one of if not the best movie of my generation and of all time. The cinematography is phenomenal, featuring the beautiful scenery of New Zealands varying landscapes. The score written by Howard shore is the best with his only challenger being John Williams of Star Wars in capturing the mood and tone of the film to perfection. And when you think that the movie cannot get any better the casting for this film is fantastic. Ian Mckellen as Gandalf is fantastic, Elijah Wood, Vigo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, I could keep going but I think you get the picture. The cast is outstanding all actors whom we know as greats. And for many of them these movies put them on the map as good actors. Also this movies set design is so good that they literally built a physical shire you can tour to this day. Which is something you don't see very often the dedication to a fan base that many movies don't indulge to this degree. Also another great thing this movie does is costume design for everyone. You genuinely feel as if your there with these people fighting Saurons armies. And with his Armies you cant tell at all that the orcs and uruks are even people. They are truly terrifying villains who are dedicated to the role of monster. This movie truly does capture J.R.R Tolkiens fantasy world without a fault. This movie is showing of love and dedication that only a great director like Peter Jackson could create.",1517184000,,1603,4.588850174216028

1297958,4,B00003CWT6,"This still stands up remarkably well. Director Jackson always keeps things moving forward. The performances and casting are generally spot-on  Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen in particular  and my appreciation for Sean Beans performance grows with each viewing. The New Zealand countryside seems infinitely suitable to the films settings. The effects  including the magic that makes the actors playing hobbits and dwarves appear small relative to those playing men and elves  are still top-notch. And while additions (like Arwen) and omissions (like Tom Bombadil) may offend purists, they are ultimately harmless. Jackson compressed the material without sacrificing anything essential.

You may nevertheless have some issues with the translation. (Thats inevitable, given that we often take personally things we have first read.) For me, the feel was a bit off over certain sections  for instance, initially, its too twee  and I don't care for some of Elijah Woods performance or, in fairness, what may have been Jacksons directions to Wood. (In the book, Frodo was one tough nut. Here, he shows less resilience.) And the Middle Earth I saw in my head when I read the book does not always correspond to Jacksons vision. For instance, I didn't see Moria as an open-architecture mine and some of Lothlorien feels manufactured.

But none of this prevents me from enjoying the film again and again without notable effort. Sometimes I stream it for background noise when Im working (we also have a free copy from Google Movies)  and then find myself watching more than working.

Then I stop working entirely and settle in for the long haul.",1514937600,4,1636,5.162878787878788

1298117,5,B00003CWT6,"I have loved both books and movies since I was a small boy. I loved the written word and I loved losing myself in a movie. As I got older, it grew harder and harder to enjoy either, but this movie (and the other two) brought that joy back. What amazed me is how Jackson and Friends (Fran and Phillipa were not given enough credit... if you listen to the commentary, you will find that these two women were instrumental in keeping the movies faithful to the book. Their insight was extraordinary.) mated the two media together in a way that should have satisfied all but the most ardent Tolkien fans.  the ones who think it a sin not to incorporate every word into the movies, thereby making them unwatchable. I think that the ghost of Tolkien had to be looking over their shoulders and whispering. What is amazing to me is how many ways it could have failed. The casting was perfect. The cinematography was impeccable. The script, the score, the costumes, the FX, the editing, etc. I cannot praise this movie enough since I think it will be a long time before we see anything like it again. Cate Blanchett's voice opening on the black screen with that beautiful, soulful violin piece can send shivers down my spine. Showing Isildur's fall was more than I could have hoped to see at the beginning (extended cut helps this tremendously). This is a movie that was helped a lot by the extended and added scenes. Many times you may look at the additional scenes from a movie only to find that the editor did the right thing by cutting them out. With FOTR extended, you get a fuller, richer unfolding of a timeless classic. And in the few areas where some things were changed, they worked for me. Giving Arwen's character a more active role as well as replacing Glorfindel's throw away lines was to my mind a stroke of genius. Nearly all of her story is taken from the appendices and so is therefore pretty accurate. And casting Liv Tyler was awesome. She looked like an elf! Another thing that could have ruined the movie was incorporating the languages. But Elvish is beautiful and it was incredible to listen to it spoken. Anyway, if you are not a fan, then my words cannot sway you. If you just watched the movies once and were thinking of them again, I hoped I inspired you to take another, closer look at them.",1506816000,11,2310,4.486935866983373
1298118,5,B00003CWT6,"We see the history of Middle Earth and how evil almost triumphed and at the moment of triumph the evil one is cut short. Some things that are best remembered are forgotten in time. The story which is adjusted for a different media than the book must in was being different in form and timing. However the essence of the book is captured in this story of the fait of Middle earth and man is placed in the hands of a mild rather small creature called a hobbit. Galadriel,""For the time would soon come when hobbits would shape the fortunes of all.""

Defiantly need to see the extended version as even then many things were left out as Tom Bomadil. The story goes much smother than trying to make sense form the theatrical version to someone who has not read the book.

I will not go through the story as the thrill of discovery is worth the viewing however they could not have picked better actors for each character. Especially Christopher Lee. He adds richness to the character of Saruman. Gandalf reminds Frodo to spare Gollum as Bilbo did. At other times as in Bible stories evil intentions can bring about good situations.

There is a great attention to detail; many times they go out of the way to match description of the book. At other times the add what is needed to show the tale

The movie is fun to watch and interesting. What you may not see so readily is that the formula is that described by Joseph Campbell of the coming of age of a hero that does not realize he is until he must be proven.

The special features of the extended edition help understand what they tried to accomplish yet it does not really add or subtract from the tale.",1506729600,,1649,4.39344262295082

Great special effects, love the actors chosen to play the roles, almost as good as the books which I read by ""audio"" (with an excellent narrator I must say.) A lot is left out of the movies and for some fans, it is a big issue. But like other books made into movies, you can't have it all and someone's favorite part or character is always going to be missing. I LOVE that my name is at the end in the credits, being a member of the Tolkien Society; read online about it and had to check! Yes, I am there along with some of my other buddies who are also members. Nice touch and it means that as each new version of the movie comes out, I have to buy it!

1299530,5,B00003CWT6,"SOOOO GOOOOD! If you have never seen The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I HIGHLY recommend it. It is an excellent trilogy. I especially love the extended editions. I know they add even more screen time to a daunting trilogy, but they add much more depth to the characters and storylines. If you are not yet ready to tackle the extended editions, start out with the regular versions and if you like those, then watch the extended editions and you will enjoy spotting the extra scenes and getting more back story. Again, I HIGHLY recommend these films. They are timeless and beautiful. (I also recommend the books if you like the films)

Just for reference, the order of the films is as follows:
1. Fellowship of the Rings
2. Twin Towers

1299791,5,B00003CWT6,"I've already reviewed the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings films elsewhere (in short: 5 stars, the 6 movies that justify the existence of the film industry), so let's focus here specifically on The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition) .  The key difference between this and other releases is the special features, most of which are, within my experience, unique to this edition.

The special features disc includes...

Welcome to Middle-earth: Houton Mifflin In-Store Special
Quest for the Ring: FOX TV Special
A Passage to Middle-earth: SCI-FI Channel Special
lordoftherings.net Featurettes
Theatrical Trailers
TV spots
Enya ""May It Be"" Music Video
Special Extended DVD Edition Preview
Behind the Scenes Preview of ""The Two Towers""
The Two Towers Video Game Preview by EA

... and of these, the first three special productions and the lordoftherings.net Featurettes are the best part.  All of the special productions are things I have not seen in any other DVD or Blu-ray package.  The lordofthe rings.net Featurettes are a collection of all the short (5 or 6 minutes) films that appeared on the films' official web site during the production of the movies, and I have not seen them anywhere else--on no other disc package, not on YouTube, and no longer of the film's web site.

There are some bits that appear in other short productions and special features, but in all cases, these specials and featurettes give us a fresh look at the production of the movies, providing information and insights we can find nowhere else.",1463356800,7,1573,5.05019305019305

Throughout the entire LOTR many of my personal favorite things from the books were left out, but all in all I think its a fairly enjoyable film even for someone who has not read the books. For someone like me who grew up reading them there are some disappointments, but all in all the visual, the majority of the acting, incredible special effects, and the CGI are pretty spectacular.

1300321,2,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowhip of the Ring was a well made movie.  Of that there is no doubt.  However what is in doubt is whether British people who invented the English language are able to read.  Peter Jackson who made the movies replaced the Elf Glorfindel who is a male in the
chase scene on the way to Rivendell with a woman Arwen.  Now why would someone who is trying to make a book into a movie replace a man's role with a woman's.  Also Jackson totally ignored the scene in the Shire with Gildor the elf.  This was a main piece of the story and made Rivendell and the elves aware that the nine black riders were chasing Frodo Baggins.  With such radical deviations and confusing reproduction regarding the plot, it is no wonder that someone would wonder if Peter Jackson really read the original Tolkien books or was simply handed a script from the movie studios.  Thus the Lord of the Rings trilogy was a huge achievement, however maybe the substantial money spent could have been invested better.  This movie thus is a poor achievement.",1456617600,,1030,4.524324324324325

I did enjoy the Two Towers immensely but was bothered by elements of the Return of the King - Arwen's fate being tied to the ring, Aragorn not revealing himself with the Palantir and the stupid elephant man orc captain- and also great moments of joy and sadness.

Those extra minutes make this movie ten times better. The emotional impact is breathtaking, the character depth grows far more than one would expect, and the tension of what's to come really hits a person right in the gut. I think the best way to describe how deeply this movie (both original and extended) impacted me is that EVERY. SINGLE. TIME I see Boromir's death scene, I cry. Actually, I sob...for a good twenty minutes.

1300823,5,B00003CWT6,"This 2001 movie version of J.R.R. Tolkiens The Fellowship of the Ring is an all time favorite.

The casting choices were excellent.

The decision to film on location in New Zealands South Island was inspired.

The themes of the story are timeless, and resonate with  widely recognized higher truths:

-...but the hearts of men are easily corrupted, and the ring of power has a will of its own...

-it is altogether evil...you cannot wield it

-Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

And for those of you who are out there whining and complaining that the movie strays too far from the book(s), lets put it this way-

The books are extremely long-winded and involved, and were not written with the tempo of a contemporary Hollywood action adventure screen play in mind, therefore...

 ... any attempt to faithfully convey the original text word-for-word on screen would require something on the order of (two) successive twenty-two episode sized-seasons of hour long shows.

At least.

This may actually not be a bad idea for someone, some day, to pursue, but given the constraints inherent to the movie business, Peter Jackson did a fine job cutting down and actioning up and sexing up the story. He even bequeathed to us an extended edition of the movie which is almost three-and-a-half hours long.

Isnt that enough?

Furthermore, a little artistic license can be a good thing.

For example, does anybody really object to having Arwen Undomiel instead of the original Glorfindel getting Frodo safely across the Bruinen River?

I didn't think so.",1447804800,5,1549,4.918918918918919

Perhaps this is the director's cut, which was further cut before the film appeared in theaters.  I certainly won't be renting the last two.",1433721600,,388,4.422535211267606

I will purchase it soon, because it is such a wonderful movie with beautiful scenery, magic, courage, and great characters.  Peter Jackson has really created a amazing movie series which, in my opinion, is one that people will watch over and over for many years.  I know that I never get tired of it!  There is really something for everyone in this film, whether it is about courage, kindness, companionship, magic, gorgeous settings and beautiful costumes, amazing acting....well, I could go on and on!

1301908,4,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring, the first movie installment to the iconic Tolkien book series, provides a solid foundation and good look into an epic fantasy world of power and intrigue. Even if one hasn't read the books, they're not going to be too lost while watching the movies. This movie starts out with lots of CGI (ouch) and sequences that come at a dizzying pace. However, things take shape and settle down to a moderate pace. There's some very clever acting, and the directing overcomes the obvious challenges with trying to convey a world of fantasy. Most of all, this edition is the one to own; the extra 30 minutes really make a difference in the drama/action element. Overall, this is a good movie, and a good start to the trilogy of movies that would go on to gross almost $3 billion.",1431129600,,794,4.559440559440559

1302280,5,B00003CWT6,"The movie is great and does justice to Tolkien's great novels.  I hate to criticize it in any way but do so in a comparative sense, only.  I believe that for most of us, great movies aren't usually quite as great as the great books from which they are adapted.  There are many reasons for this but one of the most important is that when a person reads fiction or even history, his imagination has full reign.  A movie, on the other hand, SHOWS you how it is.  Little or no imagination is required.  Obviously a person's imagination knows almost no limits so, except for the very unimaginative or those who just can't be bothered to read a book, the book is better.

In the written ""Lord of the Rings"" series, for example, the educated reader will quickly figure out that many of the characters and situations have cognates in Germanic and Norse religion and fairy tales.  My guess is that a viewer of the movie, who has never read the book, might miss this entirely which is to miss much of Tolkien's intellect.",1425254400,,1011,4.456521739130435

Better than that: Peter Jackson manages to modify the original book to erase the boring part (even if the Lord of The Rings books are brillant, let's be honest they are often long and some parts are not easy to read).

Those cracks can be assumed and there's a lot of filler talk that is also unnecessary.  You could shorten the movie by an hour if you fixed these things.,1420070400,,305,4.169491525423729

1303411,1,B00003CWT6,In the past suppliers have understood that Australia is Region 4 and have sent the appropriate DVD set. Unfortunately the set I received is Region 1.

Even playing these DVDs on a multi Region player I lose a lot of the content that I bought this set for (I already have a single disc copy of Fellowship of the Ring),1418428800,,510,4.494623655913978

Um...I'm just kind of lost here. The main problem that I have was that they needed one mystical, fake thing in order to do some other mystical, fake thing. It's like ""Ok, enough already!"" The people who like this got divorced from reality a long time ago, and haven't seen it since. They wouldn't recognize reality if they were riding on the number three bus, looked out the window, and saw it flying past. They would never pull the cord to get off at that stop. But they need to.

1303654,5,B00003CWT6,"This is the first part of the trilogy written by John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973). An English writer and a Professor at the Oxford University. He fought as a second lieutenant with the Lancashire Fusiliers during the First World War. He started writing the 'Lord of the Rings' in 1925. The synopsis of the Fellowship: In a small village in the Shire, a young hobbit named Frodo has been entrusted with an ancient Ring; he must embark on an epic journey to the depths of Mount Doom in order to destroy it with the help of his eight companions. This film made by Peter Jackson is an immortal legend in itself. This will feature in the top twenty films ever made. I had not read the book before I saw the film. Yet, I feel that I have read pages and pages as the film is so descriptive and expansive. I am fortunate to own the extended version of the complete trilogy. All parts are played to perfection by the cast and the casting is one of the best seen in years. It is a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. Special mention for Sir Ian Mckellen, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and Elijah Wood. The film is a masterpiece and bears potential of outshining its contemporaries. The music of the film is its strongest point. Howard Shore has come out with a magnificent score. It is epic film music writing.  The set designs are stunning and much effort has gone into art direction. The majesty of the drama's landscape is given a boost by the enchanting New Zealand mountains. I will call it breath-taking and will not hesitate to grant it Seven Stars!",1415664000,,1585,4.428082191780822

The acting, the visuals, the effects, the music and sound are all just perfectly part of the narrative. Sure, there are a few cheesy moments but never enough to distract from the story, and what I appreciate is how the special effects never get too computerized and domineering to ruin the films (ala Transformers). Enya's songs are a plus, and what a tragedy that she didn't win an Oscar for them, much better deserved than the Toy Story music that won instead.",1413763200,,605,4.771428571428571

1304243,3,B00003CWT6,"This version is a trainwreck!!!!! The original version is be far one of the greatest films ever made. It is also in my opinion a perfect film. One of its great strengths is its pacing, something that is lacks in the hobbit films. It is a masterful film and this version does at points add to the overall quality of the original. However! While moments like the elves leaving the shire should have been included. The opening is destroyed by the inclusion of bilbo's narration which seems oddly placed.

I have seen some comments that say ""never watch the original again"", please do not follow such advise. The original is a masterpiece and it should have won the best picture oscar in 2001. In fact I would agree with AFI in labeling it the finest installment of the franchise, far superior to the overstuffed Reutrn of the king and the sometimes neglected Two Towers.",1408492800,,867,4.62987012987013

I was honestly not impressed by the actual movies, but not for lack of wanting to.  If I were to have not read the series, I probably would have enjoyed the movies more.

1304647,5,B00003CWT6,"Years ago, I read the Trilogy repeatedly and wished that someone would have the guts and determination to make a great movie out of it. Given it's size and scope, there was a part of me that didn't think it was possible.

I was proven right initially with the ambitions, but failed attempt by Ralph Bakshi in his cartoon version in the late-80s.

So when the Peter Jackson version came out in the early-2000s, I ignored it, even after it won numerous Academy Awards. I thought I would be disappointed.

Well, over 10 years later, I decided to take a peek at it, feeling pretty certain that it would not live up to my expectations.

It turned out that I was wrong beyond words.

Peter Jackson, the cast, crew and technology team have realized the huge vision required to make this movie capture the spirit and depth of the books. It does not capture every little detail, but for me -- Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, is what the movie version needs to be.

Like the book -- it is completely over the top and Middle Earth, Frodo, Gandalf, Aragon and the whole gang is bigger than what most people can imagine them to be.

The Star Wars and Harry Potter series' are great, but this is this is the one Trilogy to Rule Them All!",1402531200,,1226,4.3744493392070485

As for me, I started the movie fully expecting to walk away and find something else to do, because I easily get turned off/bored by action movies and violence. This time, I was glued to the screen for the whole 3 hours. Although there are violent scenes, the editing is so skillful, that I never got to my usual ""OK, I get the point. . . move on"".

This movie is worth watching for the sets alone.
This movie is worth watching for the acting alone.
This movie is worth watching for the editing alone.

Last year, Brad Bushman, professor of psychology at Ohio State University, testified before the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science that ""people who consume a lot violent media come to view the world as a hostile place, where violence is 'normal' behavior. When people expect others to behave aggressively, they are more likely to behave aggressively themselves. Aggressive youth often consume violent media because it allows them to justify their own behavior as being normal."" And Bushman isn't alone. The International Society for Research on Aggression is an organization comprising a world-wide body of scientists dedicated to the study of aggression and violence. In its 2012 report, the ISRAs Media Violence Commission found that ""the effects of violent content are learning effects in the brainMedia characters are attractive role models, especially if their violent actions on the screen are presented as justified and socially acceptable. If the violent content is rewarded and seen as ""fun,' then aggression concepts will be classically conditioned with positive feelings. These will likely result in changes to attitudes and beliefs about aggression, such as seeing aggression as a more acceptable response to provocations.""",1394064000,,1291,5.591836734693878

1305323,5,B00003CWT6,"What can I say? If you're looking at this special edition box set, you probably need no convincing that the Lord of the Rings series is one of the greatest film achievements of this century (not to mention a fantastic series of books!). Therefore, I'll focus on what makes this edition special.
A lot of effort when into the details of this thing, from the nicely textured box, to the hours of documentaries and special features. The box feels good in the hand, and looks almost like a thick book. It looks good on any shelf. But what makes this addition really special is the extra footage in the film. God knows how many hours were filmed for this series. The theatrical version of the Fellowship of the Ring was just under three hours at 178 minutes. This extended addition adds 30 minutes of added and extended scenes. Even at that, there's still a lot left out from the book, but the overall effect is a more complete telling of this epic tale.
I was deeply impressed with the level of quality in the additional scenes. They were produced to just the same standards as the rest of this award-winning film. The editing, the special effects, and direction were all so smooth that I had a hard time noticing where new scenes blended in with ones from the theatrical release.
The extra features are nice for those who like that sort of thing. The ""making of"" film was quite fascinating. This film was a monumental undertaking, and it is genuinely interesting to see how it all came together. Numerous other documentaries look into specific aspects of the film making process. Still, this would have been worth it to me for the extra footage alone. Truly an edition that no LOTR fanboy/girl/hobbit should be without.",1391299200,3,1716,4.6480263157894735

Did he have something against the Orcs, who stink of urine and rat nests, or did he just want to give us more moments of boredom? I find there to be no redeeming values in this tasteless film which wants to simply reek in great amounts of money, win undeserving oscars and proclaim itself under the pretense of a great film, to be the best movie making experience.

The movie is both beautiful and lovingly made, but while I was watching it, I almost felt sorry for contemporary children who might see the movie exclusively or prior to reading the books. Some of my happiest hours in childhood were spent in Narnia and Middle Earth and the imagination of another, no matter how well done, cannot even come close to the magic I experienced then [ on the other hand, I am forty years older now so that might be a factor as well].

Big kids will love being transported back to that wonderful experience by way of the film. Parents, please steer your kids in the direction of the books in addition to watching the movies.",1388707200,,709,4.404580152671755

1305667,5,B00003CWT6,I recently updated to the BluRay version and I can tell the difference. Jackson did a great job with the movie and the extended version is great to watch. He cut out a good deal of the unnecessary stuff to make the story flow better. I just wished that he could have added in the part where the fellowship is chased by wargs on there way to Moria to add some more action. I enjoy watching the special features about how they made the stuff for the film.

Years pass, then I see this film at around $6 and then when I looked at the other 2, it showed them available at about the same price.  I thought about it for a few seconds and ordered all 3.  I'm very happy.  I have seen and enjoyed the Extended version, but I am not the person who needs an extended version.  I like owning the Original Theatrical version.  If you a fan, but not a fanatic, this is the choice for yourself or any other fan you know who doesn't own any DVD of THE LORD OF THE RINGS.

This is where the story begins and all the characters we will follow.  It is beautifully done.  The adventure rolls in, each character given moments that will be carried through the following films.  There is loss even here, but it is the nature of great stories to lose major characters who die and others return in a new form.

1306059,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is a classic. It's a lot more ""Adventure"" than the Two Towers and Return of the King, which feature far more action because of the great end battles showcased in those films. This is by far the lightest of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and really sets the stage for the awesomeness to come in the next two installments. The entire cast is awesome and it sets up the Middle Earth World ridiculously well. If you've never seen any of these films before the way Fellowship hints at other things to come in the next installments will make you want to watch all three movies in a row without stopping.
The music in this film is perfect, the creatures and special effects are amazing because it's all mostly done with make up except for gigantic creatures like the Trolls and a large Demon that Gandalf throws down with at one point in the film.
This movie really should appeal to anyone and everyone, especially if you're into action, adventure, or sword and sorcery films.",1385510400,,979,4.536723163841808

1306227,5,B00003CWT6,"Many fans of Tolkien's novels fall in love with ""The Hobbit,"" but seem to have some difficulty reading through ""The Lord of The Rings"" trilogy.  While Tolkien maintains the same style, LOTR can be a tasking read because it moves more slowly, is interjected with many poems/songs, and adds to the list of names a reader has to keep straight.  And even though we have all been burned by favorite books being botched on film, this is not the case for Peter Jackson's adaptations of the books.  In many ways, LOTR was meant to be put into film.  The visual addition really helps the book's ""extras"" gain perspective and if nothing else, glorify Tolkien's ability to create such a fun scene on paper.

The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book in the LOTR series and is set in the third age of Middle-earth, though the movie begins introducing the significance of the rings created by the Dark Lord Sauron during the second age.  The rings were divided amongst nine Men, seven Dwarves, and three Elves; but Sauron also casted the One Ring which holds power over all the others and permitting him control of Middle-earth.  Sauron was believed to be destroyed when Isildur sworded the ring from Sauron's hand in battle, but his life force lives on.

The movie goes on to explain how the Ring came into the possession of Bilbo Baggins, or likewise.  As Bilbo retires, the Ring becomes Frodo's, but upon Gandalf the Grey's discovery of the Ring, Frodo is dispatched with Sam Gamgee to remove the Ring from the Shire while being hunted by the Nazgul.  Along the way, two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, join their party. Gandalf then meets Saruman the White in Isengard; Saruman betrays Gandalf, trapping him atop the tower.  Saruman then begins to breed an army.

Once the four hobbits reach Bree, they encounter the descendent of Isidur, Aragorn, who aids them in evading the Nazgul, though Frodo is stuck by a mortal blade.  Arwen, and Elf Princess and old flame of Aragorn, finds the hobbits  and leads them to Rivendell where Elrond, the Elf King, heals Frodo's wound.  In Rivendell, Frodo also encounters the aging Bilbo who passes along the sword, Sting, he carrier in The Hobbit.

A freed Ganalf joins a council in Rivendell where it is decided that the One Ring must be destroyed by buring in the place it was forged, Mount Doom.  Those who will carry this burden, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Sam, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas (Elf), Boromir (Man), and Gimli (Dwarf), become the Fellowship of the Ring.

The remainder of the movie follows the Fellowship (and Gollum) through Moria, onto the Elf city of Lothlorien, and onto Parth Green.  Possessed by the Ring's powers, Boromir frightens Frodo into continuing on alone, though Sam has followed along.

The two-disc widescreen version features the film's theatrical version, ""The Two Towers"" 10-minute preview, cast interviews, online content, three production documentaries:  ""Welcome to Middle-earth"", ""The Quest for the Ring"", and ""A Passage to Middle-earth"", Enya's ""May It Be"" video, and more.",1382400000,2,3065,4.876447876447877

1306425,5,B00003CWT6,"First of all, I bought this as a gift for a close friend with whom I subsequently watched all three movies (all in this extended/theatrical combo edition.) The movie comes as 2 discs, as the extended editions are LONG. The only downside is that you have to switch discs halfway through the movies -- sort of made me nostalgic for cassette tapes from back in the day.

The box is a sturdy cardboard case with a transparent window which shows through to the image you can see in the Amazon picture.

As to the movies themselves, I think it goes without saying that they're great. I pick up new things every time I watch these, and now I can do that on my own time, rather than waiting for the waste-your-entire-Sunday marathons that don't even show the full extended editions!",1380153600,,774,4.521428571428571

1306527,4,B00003CWT6,"I'm  certain that with over 4000 reviews written for Amazon alone, there is nothing left to say. So I will make only a brief comment from the viewpoint of a guy with what would be considered ordinary television and a relatively small screen. Then I will add the age dimension.
Clearly this was a film designed to be shown on the biggest screen possible and equipment which includes all the latest picture and sound improvements. It is very good to look at, but on a smaller screen, without the gadgets, much of its potential is not realized. Still and all, one can appreciate what has been done.
As to the content, I have long since gone beyond an age at which anyone thinks I am young. In addition, I am not big on fantasy, am only into science fiction for short periods when I am curious about what the rest of America is watching, and have lost my taste for 'costumers',
whether in terms of historical drama or any other variety of movie whose setting is unlike the  present.  From that viewpoint, I am glad I saw the picture, it was entertaining, until the length exceeded my comfort zone, but I had no sense of loss for not having seen it in the dozen years since it came out and no feeling that I now want to read the book. If I were in a family situation, I would not have minded turning off the ballgame so that all ages could watch together.
In sum, it is an excellent family movie, but is just something to watch for the older crowd (although, of course, I can only speak for one member of that group).",1379721600,,1512,4.316901408450704

If you buy the DVD, you get the regular release plus the extended Director's cut editions in HD, plus a whole bunch of extras.

1306703,5,B00003CWT6,"The impact of the First and Second World Wars on British Literature is a subject that is not fully explored.  To this reader, The Lord of the Rings Series is one such work of literature where the impact of those terrible conflicts can be felt.  J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of the works upon which this movie is based was himself a veteran of the First World War.  Critical to this idea is that there is a sense of a past, unfinished conflict that is going to fought again.

The Fellowship of the Ring explains the past conflict and brings the rising tension to the fore.  To meet the challenge of the coming war a group of different races of Middle Earth band together to destroy an evil ring.

Thus the adventure starts.  This movie carefully develops the characters and leads the viewer on the ups and downs of the initial quest.  Eventually, Frodo must leave the fellowship and seek to destroy the ring on his own.

1306799,5,B00003CWT6,"Sixty years ago, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins came into possession of a magic ring. When he decides to leave his home in the Shire and retire, he finds it curiously difficult to leave the ring behind. Disturbed, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that Bilbo's trinket is actually the One Ring of legend, which the Dark Lord Sauron needs to complete his return to power. Bilbo's cousin Frodo has to take the Ring on a long and arduous journey across Middle-earth to the volcano known as Mount Doom, deep within Sauron's land of Mordor, the only place where it can be destroyed.

Back in 1999, when Peter Jackson began filming The Lord of the Rings, there was an expectation of failure. A thousand-page-long book adapted into three three-hour movies by a director whose biggest previous movie had been a minor ghost comedy starring Michael J. Fox? And on a budget of only $90 million apiece at a time when $200 million+ budgets for such epic films were becoming more commonplace? It seemed like a recipe for disaster.

Against the odds, Jackson pulled it off. The trilogy as a whole is a remarkable work, translating Tolkien's vision onto the screen with - for the most part - respect and integrity. There are missteps, mistakes and some ill-conceived changes, but these are mostly restricted to the second and third films in the sequence. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, is moved from page to screen with enviable skill.

The main key to the film's success is the casting. Elijah Wood may be a lot younger than Frodo in the novel, but he sells Frodo's mix of book-learned wisdom with a lack of practical experience with wide-eyed enthusiasm. Representing the old guard, veteran actors Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Christopher Lee bring their roles of Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman to life with presence and gravitas. The actors are pretty much all excellent, even Cate Blanchett as she struggles with a curiously-written interpretation of Galadriel. Marton Csokas is probably the film's weakest acting link as Celeborn, but given he has about twenty seconds of screentime, this is not a major issue. I must also admit to not being altogether convinced by Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn the King, but as Strider the Ranger in this first film he is superb.

In terms of scripting and changes from the books, some key sequences are missing. Tom Bombadil is gone (which is a wise move), as are the barrow-wights (which is more regrettable) and other elements are compressed (the journey from the Shire to Bree, which covers dozens of pages in the book, happens instantly on-screen) or eliminated altogether (Fatty Bolger, the 'Fifth Hobbit', is exorcised from events). Other events that happened in the book off-page or only in flashback occur here in their correct chronological order, such as Saruman's confrontation with Gandalf at Isengard.

For the most past these changes are well-judged, even if some fan-favourite moments are left out. For a three-hour movie the pacing is generally excellent, with a good mix of exposition, character-building moments and action setpieces. The movie's effects are impressive, with CGI being held back and used only when absolutely necessary, with miniatures often employed to give physical locations a sense of presence and weight. Whilst clearly resulting from budgetary restrictions, this prevents the film getting buried under fake-looking CGI and means it still has more convincing effects than the recent first Hobbit movie, which feels a little silly.

It's difficult to pick a stand-out moment from the film. The Black Riders pursuing the Hobbits is an evocative moment, as is the confrontation on Weathertop and the flooding at the Fords of Bruinen. The outstanding sequence is probably the descent through Moria, which features both excellent character moments (such as Gandalf's conversation with Frodo when they discover that Gollum is pursuing them), humour (Pippin's encounter with a skeleton on a well), action (the battle with the cave troll in the chamber of Mazarbul) and tragic horror (Gandalf's last stand on the bridge of Khazad-dum). The whole sequence is a joy to watch.

The film missteps a little near the end: the trip to Lorien, where the Fellowship regroups after Moria, made sense in the book but in the film it dangerously comes close to killing the pace of the movie altogether. This is not helped by the somewhat bizarre characterisation of Galadriel. Jackson is to be commended for trying to make the longueur work, but ultimately it feels like it's delaying the film's climax too much at the moment it should be ramping up towards it. Fortunately, in the cinematic edition it's a fairly brief sequence. Events culminate in the epic battle on Amon Hen, with Sean Bean delivering a stand-out performance during Boromir's last stand and Sean Astin's Sam getting his first notable moments in the film's cliffhanger ending.

The movie's success is furthered by some truly remarkable production design and the quite astonishing soundtrack by Howard Shore, which must rank as one of the finest movie soundtracks of all time.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (*****) remains, twelve years on, the finest fantasy movie ever made. The writing, acting and effects work all combine and work in tandem with one another to produce something very special, something that Peter Jackson has struggled to replicate ever since.

Note on the Extended Edition: In 2002, the film was reissued as an Extended Edition with approximately 30 minutes of additional footage integrated into the movie. These extra sequences include (amongst many others) an expanded opening sequence about Hobbits, additional scenes at Bilbo's party (reintroducing the Sackville-Bagginses from the book), additional combat scenes on Amon Hen and a major extension of the Lorien sequence. The Extended Edition is remarkably well-integrated with the structure of the existing film and gives new information that is useful for the sequels (such as the gift-giving sequence at Lorien). However, it does also expand on the film's weakest elements, with more screentime for Celeborn and Lorien overall. Whilst this does adversely affect pacing, it is more than made up for by the strength of new scenes earlier on. As a result, the Extended Edition (*****) retains the score of the cinematic cut.",1376265600,,6345,5.0806142034548945

1307056,4,B00003CWT6,"All in all, this almost (just one minute shy of) three hour show was rather good.  The photography was absolutely magnificent, the actors were anywhere from very good to great, and the special effects were splendid.  BUT! Unfortunately, as in any movie that follows a book, the producer has to take some artistic license. While the variations were quite noticeable to anyone who has actually read the Trilogy, they weren't TOO bad... except for one that stood out like a sore thumb.  Whahoppen with Tom Bombadil?  While it's true he was sort of a minor character, the fact that the ring had no effect on him and that he saved one of the group from the barrow wights should garner him at least a quick scene or two.  The main characters come across just as they should.  Gandalf is great, Frodo is very well done, as are Sam, Merry, and Pippin.  I was a tad disappointed with Galadriel.  Whoever was playing her was a bit stiff and cardboard, except for her confrontation with the ring.  That was very well done.  Sauruman's descent to the service of Sauron was very well done.  The Balrog was rather well portrayed as a CGA, and was more or less as I thought it might be.  All in all, it was an interesting presentation but, as I've noted, only worth four stars.  I'm sure that J.R.R. Tolkien isn't doing push-ups in his grave, but he might be just a tad restless.  Still in all, I in no way regret buying it, and I'm positive you won't, either.",1372809600,,1445,4.465648854961832

1307148,5,B00003CWT6,"Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson's first swing at J.R.R. Tolkien's daunting mutli-volume masterwork, lands flush on the chin of fans and casuals alike. It's a gorgeous example of just how well a literary adaptation can perform with the right mix of passion, budget, vision and expertise. Jackson's direction, though quite long-winded, seems fat free and balanced with a good sense of when to press forward and when to admire its surroundings. The acting is a relatively broad mix - while Ian McKellen resides comfortably in the quasi-leading role of Gandalf the Grey and Viggo Mortensen is both gallant and inspiring as Aragorn, I found Elijah Wood just a bit too doe-eyed as the ring-bearing hobbit, Frodo. That's nit-picking at its finest though, admittedly, especially given the scene-stealing part played by the realm of Middle Earth itself. Staggeringly realized with an obsessive attention to detail, it's a stern flex of the artistic muscle unlike anything I've seen, before or after. Watching the film today, in the shadow of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is doubly rewarding, as dozens of throwbacks to the events of that film are planted like seedlings throughout the landscape. For my money, this is the best plot of the three LotR volumes, to boot. With one foot planted firmly on the ground and the other teasing the abyss, it covers a gamut of emotions, isn't bashful about shedding important cast members, and gives its audience a sweeping taste of the many colors and flavors present in this world. A wonderful fantasy-adventure hybrid, spiced with action at all the right moments, that does its mythical source material (and the legion of associated fans) proud.",1370995200,,1689,5.101083032490974

Storyboards, still photos, concept art, and plenty of documentaries provide insight to the staggering amount of work that went into creating this fantastic work of art.

My only question is why every time someone decides to make a film out of a good book, they distort and embellish the original story almost beyond recognition (think Quo Vadis here). The effects were great and the scenery was exquisite. I suppose if one hadn't read the books beforehand it would probably be a pretty cool film. But as to the original story, I felt that it took too many liberties and left out some very important parts. I can imagine the tourist board of New Zealand is pretty happy with it though. It made me think it's got to be one of the most beautiful places in the world.

I had no real preconceptions except I'd heard that it was enthralling, so I was not sure  whether to be a curmudgeon or a fan.  I found it gorgeous beyond belief, full of humor and tension and pathos and drama, BUT you have to allow yourself to fall into Middle Earth and accept that elves and dwarves and heroes and kings exist and are willing to do battle for the hearts and minds of a place and time that does not, has not existed.  Once you take that leap of faith, a leap that is surely one of the great joys of fiction, Lord of the Rings is fantastic..dense and well-crafted, full of unforgettable characters and nuanced portrayals.",1364083200,,695,4.323076923076923

I downloaded The Fellowship of the Ring and watched it on my Kindle and found it so fascinating I couldn't take my eyes off of it.  Personally, I loath movies that last go past the 120 min. mark because I find them obnoxiously long for absolutely no reason but to be long.  The Fellowship of the Ring was long but for good reason and I fell in love with the world.  So much so, that I ordered the extended version box-set of The Lord of the Rings and watched those.  Much to my husband's dismay (and he did point out where the movies should have added things and other things that were silly add-ons) he enjoyed them as well.

1307969,5,B00003CWT6,This goes without saying.  Great movie!  Second one is too.  But this last one that just came out was....so-so.  I was disappointed in this final one (hopefully final).  But all those before it are brilliant.,1361750400,,208,4.828571428571428
1307970,5,B00003CWT6,"I was hesitant to buy this since we already have the movies and we've watched them a dozen times. The only reason I went ahead was because supposedly they integrated the changes into the movie. We all know they could do this since the beginning of dvds but for some unknown reason they never have. They always put ""extra scenes"" or ""alternate scenes"" somewhere else and you had to watch them separate from watching the movie. Even the Bourne film you had to click an icon to make it show the alternate beginning and the alternate ending.

They actually redid parts of the movie as well as just adding back in stuff that got cut and even changed little parts including changing the music to match. The result is a movie that makes a lot more sense. There are more details that really put things into perspective. There is a scene with Boromir that changed my entire view of him - really gave him more substance as a character. It's very difficult to tell you why you absolutely MUST see the movie like this without giving things away. You will have to have some faith when I tell you it was worth every dime.

The extra pieces give a much better sense of time also. These are things that felt odd in the first movie but then it was another scene and you pretty much forgot about it. When you see the changes, it feels right. It feels like this was the way it should always have been.

I can't wait to get the other two in the special edition versions.

As an aside, the movie is lighter also - seems like they've increased the contrast though I've never been good at that color stuff so I'm not sure what exactly they did but you see things you couldn't see before because it was simply too dark.",1361664000,,1695,4.337539432176656

Once in a while a  movie comes along that so faithfully interprets a novel that you gain a whole new understanding of the plot, the characters and the purpose behind the story.  This is such a series and such a movie.

1308145,4,B00003CWT6,"I received the Mandarin Chinese Edition of LoTR:Fellowship for Christmas; and I have watched it several times already. I purchase/request the Mandarin version of popular movies like this, because I'm learning Mandarin.  And, watching ""American"" movies that I already know the theme (and a good portion of the dialog) helps to get ""acclimated"" - ie I learn new phrases, pronunciation, syntax, and become comfortable with hearing the language being spoken.

Pros:
- The Mandarin version is fairly inexpensive - currently cheaper than the ""English"" version.  And, since it also includes the ""English"" dialog and captions, this is quite a bargain.
- While I'm still learning, the translations seem to be decent (good sound quality, follow the character's persona, etc). Overall, they did a reasonable job dubbing an appropriate Chinese voice, and adding captioning, while maintaining all of the music and sound effects.
- The disks and box/packaging are very good quality. While it's not ""collector"" quality; the box is certainly solid enough to protect the disk. If you are thinking of giving this as a gift; it does look fairly nice.
- This is one of the few disks I have received from Fast Shipper 4U; but, according to the purchaser, they shipped it quickly and it arrived as expected.

Cons:
- These region 6 disks will not play on many/most American DVD players - the benefit of market economics. However, I did get all of my ""foreign"" movies to play on a Mac Mini without making any modifications.  So, it is not impossible to find a player. Also, I have found several computer DVD/BluRay drives (esp Asus and Pioneer) that can play disks intended for non-US markets. But, buyers should be aware that the Sony PS3, like most major name-brand DVD players, will NOT play these disks. Some devices can be ""programmed"" (ie hacked); but this is not an option for technologically challenged.
- The main menu on the disk can be difficult to maneuver for people that cannot, yet, read Chinese (Hanyu).  Luckily, there are not too many options; so, it's pretty simple to figure out through trial-and-error.

Overall, this is one of the best gifts I have received; and I will continue to watch it over and over. As anyone that has learned another language will attest, watching movies is one of the best ways to ""acclimate"" yourself.  I would give it 5 stars, if it weren't for the DVD region restrictions (which is not the seller's fault) and the menus not including English (very minor).",1360800000,,2482,4.906921241050119

1308147,2,B00003CWT6,Show story line was good with excellent graphics. The sound varied from loud to long stretches of soft spoken words with British/Irish accents which made the show difficult to follow.

I have a high speed internet connection averaging 25mbs download speeds, and have purchased several other films from Amazon, so I'm very familiar with what should be expected from a digital purchase like this.

The story flowed, the acting was brilliant and the scenery was beautiful!  This is truly a must see!

The only thing holding me back to giving this film five stars is it's length.  At nearly four hours, it is much too long.  Another problem is that there is not a lot of action.  There was mostly dialogue.  My final problem with this movie is that it lags a bit in the middle.  Other than that, I enjoyed it.

This movie should be okay for children over twelve.  This film is much too violent for anyone younger.

Other than that, The Fellowship of the Ring is a movie worth seeing.

I recommend this movie.",1359158400,,716,4.293233082706767

1308844,5,B00003CWT6,"For those who have not read the books or do not have a thorough understanding of much of the history of LOTR, this version isn't for you. There are many details added that will no doubt confuse and befuddle the amateur viewer. However, those who have a solid grasp of the legendary tales of Middle Earth, Peter Jackson hits a home run with his Extended Edition. The relatively brisk stop at Lothlorien in the theatrical version is greatly expanded. More attention is given to the Shire and many subtle unanswered questions are attended too. If you can find the time to watch all of the movie and can sit through some idle parts, you will love this movie as much as I did

1308846,4,B00003CWT6,Undoubtably a great movie though personally I think it's the lowest quality of the three. I still think it is a great movie but it is a little slow for me. A must see like the rest of the trilogy and absolutely worth buying.,1357344000,,224,4.113636363636363

1308849,3,B00003CWT6,"It's the same movie, so I'm not reviewing the movie.

The newer pressings of the theatrical version DVD use the cases with the ""recycle"" logo cut-outs in the front. So, they're quite flimsey.  That's not so bad.  The inside booklet (a 3-panel fold-out) is EXCLUDED from the recent pressings as well.  So, that explains the low price.

However, this pressing still includes the ""bonus feature"" disk.",1357344000,,398,4.96969696969697
1308850,5,B00003CWT6,It gives out a great cliffhanger. This is the first movie of three and is so addictive that you will want to watch the other two.,1357344000,,129,4.0
1308851,4,B00003CWT6,"the scenery,various characters and the story line were exceptional, you must concentrate as there are many odd names of geographic areas that tie all the characters together, nice to watch this in two parts as it is quite long but entertaining nonetheless",1357344000,,255,5.095238095238095
1308980,5,B00003CWT6,Great show!  It was pretty darn close to the greatness of the books.  Looking forward to seeing the other films again soon.,1357257600,,123,4.545454545454546
1308981,5,B00003CWT6,The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is among my favorite movies of all time. It has been a while since I have sat down and re-watched these classics. I had never seen the extended editions but I paid the extra money as they are my favorite movies. The extended editions are superb and add a lot of content. This movie is one purchase I am extremely satisfied with.,1357257600,,358,4.279411764705882
1308982,1,B00003CWT6,The film is what it is.  Flawed and overly long but kinda awesome none the less.  I purchased the streaming version and it was basically unwatchable.  The resolution was terrible.  Very disappointing.,1357257600,2,200,5.15625
1308983,1,B00003CWT6,Too bad the streaming was AWFUL!  We were very disappointed.  Amazon really should figure it out.  Stream it from Netflix or get a DVD.,1357257600,,135,4.541666666666667

1308986,3,B00003CWT6,Received this rental free in purchasing the Blu Ray.  The nice part of getting the free rental is that I could watch it while the Blu Ray was being shipped. Video streaming picture quality was fine but I cant verify if it was HD or not. Just be aware that this video is NOT the extended version of the film. My main gripe is with the description of the blu ray (which suggests it IS the extended version)- will address this when I review the blu ray purchase.,1357171200,,459,4.215909090909091
1308987,5,B00003CWT6,"This, along with The Two Towers and Return of the King, are my favorite movies. Peter Jackson does an awesome job at directing a spectacular cast of people who bring alive the classic JRR Tolkein novels. Howard Shore brings alive the cast of characters and the setting for these movies with music so wonderful it stirs the heart. The combination of story line, directing, acting, filming, scenery and music make these by far my favorite movies.",1357171200,,444,4.855263157894737

1309049,5,B00003CWT6,purchased this on black friday; definitely worth the money. waiting on sale for the other two.  Great movie.  Love every minute of it.,1357084800,,134,4.782608695652174

1309051,3,B00003CWT6,"Well crafted, acted and spectacularly filmed.  I'm not much into fantasy and got bored but would highly recommend this movie for those who like the genre.  This is my opinion on all three of the Lord of the Rings movies.",1357084800,,220,4.475
1309052,5,B00003CWT6,"This is a fantastic story that is fantastically acted, directed and shot.  Please see it if you haven't.  Don't delay.",1357084800,,118,4.85
1309053,2,B00003CWT6,"That Frodo!

When he fought back against the Nazgul at the vale near the ring on Amon Sul, he was so brave!  Except he didn't, in the movie.

When he rode the white horse through the Ford, and turned defiantly to face the Nazgul once more, he... wait, wait, it was Arwen who was bravely defiant in the movie.

The result of these changes, these emasculations, or is it e-hibbitations -- the result is that all of Frodo's doubt is lovingly expressed by the director and Elijah Wood, but none of his pluck or bravey.  The balance from the book is off in the movie.  And the result is that you want to smack Frodo, and to a lesser extent all of the other emoting, sobbing, crying, and gazing off in anguished emotion hobbits.

Those little soppy sappy hobbits, they sure do cry a lot.

This was half a good movie, with the death of Boromir well played.  Gandalf was cool, the Balrog was sort of cheesy-cool.  There needed to be brief moments of exposition, the sort of human and humane (hobbitane?) moments that preserve the plot during the special effects.

But there is something about a crying hero, a soppy little hobbit, that makes you want to see them smacked down by goblins.  Not a good dynamic for
a movie.  The moment you tire of Elijah Wood's soulful sad gaze, and want his head cut off with an orc-blade, is not a good moment for exposition.

Any movie that requires an apology to your son, because he should read the book, where ""the hobbits have balls"" is a sorta bad movie.",1357084800,6,1485,4.411764705882353
1309054,2,B00003CWT6,Audio was not clear even after I set the volume to be real high. Absence of close captioning made it worse.,1357084800,,107,4.142857142857143

1309056,5,B00003CWT6,"Yeah, I said it...it's one of the movies that everyone should see in their lifetime.  The movies match the books quite closely, with a few omissions.  There isn't much that is changed in a big way, except the unnecessary expansion of Arwen's character.  Tolkien's characters are designed to feel a love that goes beyond the body and hits right into the soul and that love is able to be felt between any two beings, no matter the gender or race (we, in our closed minded attitudes can't really handle a male dwarf and a male elf loving each other like that, so it had to be replaced with a sexy man and a beautiful female elf).  I have no real complaints with the movie, aside from that deviation from the book.  Everything in the movie is impeccably done and I truly feel something for every single character.  There were very few details that were out of place for me, and I have watched this movie more times than I can count.",1357084800,,928,4.39766081871345

The Amazon review for the Fellowship of the Ring is a little less clear: ""Extremely useful are the chapter menus that indicate which scenes are new or extended.""  This would seem to indicate that the extended edition is included, but that is not the case.

Story-wise, Fellowship definitely takes the cake. The Hobbit looks more splendid, obviously, because they have better technology and a higher budget. I will say, however, that the less-used CGI in Fellowship really pays off, and I think these sequels will live on better than the upcoming prequels, not unlike the Star Wars saga.",1355961600,,512,4.965116279069767

I have loved the movie since it came out in theaters, especially the third.  I hadn't read the books.  But to anyone that has ever read the books, or is simply a fan of good fantasy, this movie will help to satisfy both.  Filled with adventure, and peppered with some mystery, horror and a little romance; it's a film that can entertain a lot of viewers.

If you're looking for a good film, buy the theatrical release.  If you're a Tolkien fan, buy the extended DVDs, otherwise, as a casual viewer I'd avoid those (they get lengthy and the mythology is more prominent, which, if you're not an invested fan, can get a little boring).

On a final note, if you have children, the films are pretty family friendly.  However, if they're under 7, it may be a little too scary to understand for some.  Preview first before watching as a whole.",1354752000,,897,4.414634146341464

1310005,5,B00003CWT6,"I remember reading the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy originally in 1995 and thought it was one of the best series of books up there with the ""Dragonlance: Chronicles.""  When first hearing that there was going to be a movie based on the books I was rather excited, but not overly excited knowing that movies are almost never as good as the books.  I was also overly religious at that time and just wasn't in the habit of going to the movies.  Therefore, rather than catching it in December of 2001 like most people, I caught it late in the theatre with a friend on Valentine's Day.  I'm kind of glad I waited because by this time the crowds were much thinner.  However, the movie was so good that I made sure to catch the next two on the day it was released, dealing with the overcrowded theater.  So now onto the movie:

As most know, the movie is based on the first book of J.R.R Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  Aside from the fact, that ""the movie is not as good as the book"" this was the beginning of the story of what would become the first of three of the best movies I have ever seen.

In case there are people out there that do not know the setting of ""Lord of the Rings,"" it is a fantasy based movie.  There are various well-known mythological races such as elves, dwarfs, orcs, goblins, and of course the species that always seems to have the shortest life span when it comes to fantasy movies and books...humans.  I don't know what it is about fantasy writers, but all these other races are either immortal or have long life spans.  However, hobbits, which I believe are an invention of J.R.R. Tolkien (and play a significant part in the series), have only a little bit longer of a lifespan.  Hobbits are an interesting race as they are smaller human like beings that seem to exist separate from the other races of Middle Earth.  The plot of the story is based around the race of hobbits, 4 in particular, becoming a vital part in the war to stop the evil lord Sauron from gaining control of Middle Earth.  They know very little knowledge of the world and are not trained in fighting skills, which only complicates their challenge.

The Fellowship of the Ring is a lengthy movie and some people may find it boring at times.  I know people who said they fell asleep during the movie because it was so long and seemed like it dragged on.  So this movie isn't for everyone.  I would say that if you are a fan of epics such as Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean you might like this movie.

The movie has a good variety of shifting between action and storyline.  One moment the main characters may be trying to escape whatever evil is chasing them only to enter an Elvin land which the pace slows down and the story continues to be told.

I am one of those people who like to look at possible symbolic meanings behind the entertainment that I enjoy.  Of course, this is very subjective but it is my review style.  The Ring of Power, which plays a focal point in the movie, seems to me to be a symbol of our nature to hunger for power and greed.  The hobbits seem to be relatively immune to the ring, perhaps from being accustomed to the ""simple life.""  But as one can see even the innocent are susceptible to longings for greed and power.  The ring seems to draw out the worst in the characters and even a person who longs to use power to do good can even be corrupted.

It is also about coming together for a common purpose and therefore needing to set aside their differences in order to succeed.  The characterization is excellent as one gets to see the inner struggles of the main characters.

This movie is excellent for someone who likes adventure and action with a strong meaningful storyline.  Of course, I recommend reading the books, as they help fill in some of the gaps that the movie doesn't bring forth.  However, this movie, along with the two after it do stand well on their own.  I also HIGHLY recommend watching the extended edition...it just...well...gives more to the story.

1310109,3,B00003CWT6,"Even though they've been released several times in different versions and formats, the coming of ""The Hobbit"" has encouraged Warner Bros. to give fans a chance to get the extended editions of all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films AGAIN in special Blu-ray 5-disc sets. There's no possible way that any stone is left unturned or single piece of behind-the-scenes footage is left unseen after these are delivered.

Each film is over three and a half hours to over four hours long spread out across two discs. Couple those with three discs filled with special features and you have enough ""Lord of the Rings"" to satisfy even the most obsessed Tolkienite or Tolkiendil.

""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy tells the story of the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his journey to dispose of a powerful ring controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Frodo and eight companions must make their way to the edge of the fiery Mount Doom through deadly trials and tribulations. They meet up with different characters and creatures throughout their long journey.

The best way to describe my feelings about these films is summed up in ""Clerks 2."" There's a lot of walking and then they drop the ring into Mount Doom before walking home again. Alright, I'm partially just kidding. I do like the movies but in no way am I an uber-fan.

Do I think they could've been edited down to a shorter running time even in their theatrical versions? Absolutely! I've never made it through any of the movies in one sitting. Basically, I can only take about an hour and a half to two hours of each film before I have to give myself a mental break. I found the three hour long ""King Kong"" easier to sit through and more entertaining.

My opinion of the films doesn't mean anything in the long run. What matters is that millions of people across the planet absolutely adore ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and just can't get enough of it. The release of the extended editions of the films loaded with bonus material is a present to them.

Each one is presented in pristine high-definition video and audio. The picture is as clean and polished as you've ever seen it. The 6.1 surround mix will fill everyone's home theater system with the sounds of Middle Earth. Every growl of an Orc and whisper of Sauron jumps out of the speakers at the viewer.

1310197,3,B00003CWT6,Does anyone really need to know what I thought of this movie? It was great but the books are better. I think Frodo and Sam's relationship is poorly done in the movie. I thought Frodo seemed effeminate. Elijah Wood did a poor job. But over all it's an amazing portrayal of some of the greatest novels of all time.,1346889600,,312,4.305084745762712
1310198,4,B00003CWT6,"It really irritates me when Amazon combines reviews for a particular title, regardless of the many mediums it's available in.

This review is for the 5 disc extended edition blu-ray set for the first film. Not the trilogy blu-ray set, in case this somehow ends up on that page as well. This review will be posted for all three films since most of what I'm going to say pertains to all of them, but any film-specific information will be kept to that respective film. Once I've found 37 hours to have some friends over for a marathon I'll return and give my opinion of the upgraded format. For now this is just a review of the packaging and other things I noticed that might impact someones decision to buy or not.

I ordered these separate extended sets because I had read many reviews for the extended trilogy blu-ray set saying 'the Fellowship' has a green (I think it was green) hue prevalent throughout. I did read one review saying the issue could be resolved with some TV adjustments. Beyond that inconvenience I was hoping two things would be different with these sets: first I thought maybe the green issue would be fixed (I'll let you know if that's the case in my update for 'fellowship'), and second I was thinking maybe a more understandable reason for a re-release would be to make all 5 discs (15 between three films) blu-ray. This is not the case. That was the first thing I checked and all the non-feature discs say DVD, while the two discs for the main feature say blu-ray.

To sum up, I am happy I bought these sets if only for the beautiful cover art on each. If you don't care about the cover art, if you're not worried about having 15 blu-ray discs total, and if the possibility of a green-less 'fellowship' isn't a big deal, then it probably doesn't matter if you buy these sets or the whole trilogy blu-ray set.

I'll update hopefully soon with info on the films themselves.

Update - 09/09/12

So I just finished the movie and I forgot how much I love it, especially after a long absence. Anyone reading this review has most likely seen the film or at least read other reviews of it, so I won't get into it.

What I will say is that I noticed no green anywhere. So either my TV is set well enough to rid the picture of any green (which I doubt since it's not a high-end set or anything, just a Samsung plasma I could only afford cause it was the floor model), or the issue has been remedied. All I saw was the movie exactly as I remember it from my special extended edition DVD sets, but now with a slightly better picture and better audio. I'm sure some video and audio snobs will give specific likes or dislikes here but personally I think it's not worth getting heated over. Unless you had the two versions playing side by side you won't consciously notice a dramatic change. Just enjoy the movie. It's still great. I'm not sure I can say any more, but if anyone has specific questions before they buy just comment. :)",1346889600,6,2944,4.410681399631676
1310199,2,B00003CWT6,"- and the moving camera, which for the last 20 years has been an over-used method of filming almost anything on a big scale, often draws attention to the medium itself when used as it is here, and as much as it is here. Also drawing attention to the medium itself is plenty of disgracefully bad editing/continuity in many places, and a great deal of unnatural voice dubbing, especially of Gandalf and Aragorn.

When I heard they were making a film of the book I didn't look forward to it with any pleasant anticipation, even though the book means more to me than any other prose fiction. My fear was that it would be conceived visually much like any other recent big budget fantasy type of film; that the music would be the usual sort of thing we get in all big films; and that much too recognisable faces would be cast in the leading parts so that suspension of disbelief would be difficult.
With the partial exception of the last all my fears were confirmed, and the voice dubbing was much worse than I could have foreseen.
And I had been naive enough NOT to have foreseen the weak attempts at comedy for the family audience. What on earth made me think that Tolkien would be spared that?

Peter Jackson should have understood as a first principle, the book being the very special kind of book it is - i.e.the most fully imagined 'sub-creation' yet achieved, set in a wholly imaginary ancient time and place, and most especially, a book in which the deep subject is the concern to experience, with fresh appreciation:
a) LANGUAGE (which includes the noble simplicity of Tolkien's prose and all the songs/poems about Middle Earth and its stories) - this could have been conveyed by an atmospheric narration etc.,
b) SPACE (landscape and geography) along with the simplest and most basic aspects of nature and physical reality like grass and trees and water,
c) and the dimension of TIME as revealed by the long history of Middle Earth constantly referred to by Tolkien, and the long journey across the geography of Middle Earth),
- that it would need a complete rethink of the way such a film would need to look (and sound) so that it would register somehow as different from other films of adventure, history or 'fantasy' made in the last twenty five years. I don't mean the costumes or even the design of the sets etc. I mean the way the camera is used, how it moves or, alternatively, observes transparently, what sort of distance it keeps, the rhythm of the editing, and of course the framing. When a film has exactly the same sort of filmic style (the current industry standard), as any other big feature film it is not easy to feel that you are observing what Tolkien called a 'secondary world' (see Tolkien's major essay 'On Faery-Stories in 'Tree and Leaf' or in the new expanded edition on its own).

As for the music, regardless of its actual quality as music, it wasn't what is needed to capture the ethos of the book. It should ideally have been 'ancient' and small scale like Early Music (i.e. medieval to Renaissance) or Chinese, Japanese, Indian classical music, or the music of Mali West Africa - not the usual bombastic overblown all-purpose film music which even committed the further idiocy of making the Hobbits Irish - I suppose Shore had the half-baked notion of leprechauns in his head.
If they had to commission a full orchestral score for this film they could, in view of the ambitiousnes of the project as a whole, at least have chosen a distinguished composer of serious music who would have come up with something different and on more of a level with the book - Robin Holloway, Colin Matthews, Maxwell Davies, James MacMillan, Thomas Ades, or even Birtwistle perhaps. There was a time when it was properly understood that a film of this importance would be given a score by one of the leading composers of the day, a Korngold, Walton, Bax or Vaughan Williams. If ever a film called for a return to this practice this was it.

Whatever was gained by heavily disguising McKellen was lost by close-miking his voice and having him mutter under his breath in a way that normally signifies stream-of consciousness interior thoughts. Just as all recent films use far too many close-ups so they also rely too much on post-production voice dubbing, or sound engineering, to create false drama and hypnotic immersion (at least for those susceptible to such methods).This compounds the problem created by the close-ups and makes it even more difficult to experience Tolkien's 'sub-creation' (a term Tolkien used for his kind of secondary world) as anything different from ordinary primary reality. But I would also have much preferred a completely unknown actor in the key role of Gandalf, and in the other important role of Bilbo - and I think they would probably have made a better job of it.
The worst case of bad casting to my mind was Frodo, who apart from anything else, was at least 10 years too young, even making allowances for the longevity of Hobbits. In other cases it was more of a case of the actors being encouraged by the director to play it for self-conscious comedy, something which is depressingly the case in almost all commercial cinema apart from gangster films.

There were of course many good things about this and especially the other films. Some of the casting was spot on: Aragorn, Boromir, Arwen and Eowyn (such fine noble women). I had no problem with the design of the weapons and costumes although I was disappointed with the art direction of many scenes because of very average framing (compare it with the 1960 film 'The Alamo' for example, which in addition had a magnificent and perfectly appropriate musical score). Of course with the camera moving about so much, and so many close-ups of faces, actually framing a shot was probably the last thing on Jackson's mind, or on the mind of his second-unit director.
I found the big set pieces quite impressive although some of the 'monsters' were too big - as usual the film industry can't resist going over the top.
But I was not at all impressed by the way landscape was used, and indeed not used, especially in the first part where there was very little sense of the long eventful journey through a slowly changing landscape, or of what should have been at least in the first stages a very English landscape. Even the extended version didn't add to this sense as I had hoped - the Sign Of The Prancing Pony is reached all too soon. Language and landscape and the more subtle aspect of time are the most important ingredients of the book and sadly landscape and time came off as poorly as language. But at least there were a couple of magical scenes in which Elvish was spoken, with sub-titles on screen. In those scenes the magic of the book and the otherness of Middle Earth suddenly shone out and made my skin tingle.
I was also irritated by the frequent sloppy continuity due to bad editing within scenes taking too many short cuts, and deliberately oversaturated colours in many of the scenes of the Shire in the first film. This first of the three films was the weakest for several reasons although many people like myself will feel that in the book as a whole it is by far the most important part of the story, and the part we want to re-read most.

Leaving aside Gollum of course, I can only single out one male performance as especially well judged and convincing and that is SEAN BEAN's as Boromir. He was so impressive it came as no surprise that just after the release of this film he appeared on the London stage as Macbeth.

Ridley Scott's 'Kingdom Of Heaven' is a far superior film, and at least until its last 25 minutes or so, even his 'Robin Hood' is also a better piece of film making in many ways, but there is plenty of bad editing in the action scenes, some clumsy voice dubbing of Russell Crow which may be bad 'Voice acting', and the music is even worse. Unfortunately I have only been able to find one example in the last 15 years of a commercial 'historical' film with a decent score, and that is Besson's 'Joan of Arc'. In 'Robin Hood' there was far less reliance on close-ups which is a lazy way of directing a film, and instead of these intimacies (especially inappropriate for epic narratives like Tolkien's) we get some real effort to create some context and atmosphere with some impressive framing of images. You cannot create the special magic of a secondary world with close-ups and close-miking of voices - there has to be some distance.

If you have read the book and love it then I would advise you to stick with the image you have in your head and not to see the film. It is a GREAT book, it is not a great film and in no way did it capture the essential ethos of the book. But perhaps the scenes in Elvish with Liv Tyler, and the last battle and death of Boromir are worth seeing if you ask a friend to show them to you and spare you the rest.

Jackson may have been the right person to produce this film but he wasn't the right person to direct it, or be in charge of post-production.",1346803200,,9026,4.570105003088326

1310203,5,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring was a powerhouse of an ensemble film, featuring an all-star cast, fantastically detailed sets, an almost insane attention to detail, and gorgeous cinematography. It's no wonder that while only released in 2001 it immediately vaulted to the #50 spot on the new AFI Top 100 listing, while other classics like Doctor Zhivago dropped off the list completely.

I should caveat first that I grew up reading and adoring the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I re-read it probably once a year. I absolutely adored Aragorn, and all of my daydreams were about me as Aragorn's loyal companion. In the books, you see, Arwen hardly appears. She's a footnote in an appendix. This first book is all about men, men, and more men. I suppose Galadriel shows up at one point, to pass around presents, but that's about it.

So when I went to see the film, it was almost a religious experience. The Weathertop scene, where the hobbits are calling out ""Strider"" in panic, had me shiver. These were my dreams coming to life.

The attention the WETA workshop put into every scene is legendary. They literally had the book open and were reading the pages to know what to do. They hand carved proper Dwarvish ruins along all surfaces of the caves in the Mines of Moria. Viggo learned to speak Elvish and lobbied for more dialogue in the language. They tended to the gardens at Hobbiton for a full year so it had a ""lived in"" look.

Yes, they had to cut out some of the book. Heck, the movie was already 3 hours long! I do not mind that at all. And I also do not mind that they gave Arwen a part! Up until now we had ONE FEMALE. That was it. One. I realize the book was written in the ""dark ages"" of 1954 but still! Surely there could be more females involved. Even with the TWO whole females in the movie, they never even interact. They are both there solely to be foils to the menfolk.

Still, one cannot blame Jackson at all for that. The responsibility for that goes back to J. R. R. Tolkien. Some purists were already upset enough that Arwen got to speak in the movie :). I imagine a hostile rage would have erupted if more than that occurred.

So absolutely I adore Lord of the Rings, and I own all the different versions on DVD. I highly recommend watching it. It is glorious in its own right, and so much of what it shows and says has infiltrated its way into modern culture. Watching TV, reading novels, or going to movies can often involve an expectation that you ""get"" the references involved.",1346025600,3,2516,4.4233261339092875

The cast is great, though the elves are too cute and should be more menacing - that would also bring some suspense into their characters - and the female ones are more skin tonic commercial models than beautiful - great especially Gimli, but also Aragorn and Gandalf in particular. The movie has retained some of the books' more philosophical passages, like when Peregrin Took has looked into the Palantir, becomes a Guard of Gondor and Gandalf assures him, that ""it (death) is not so bad"", one of the movie's most wonderful moments, I think. However, the character of Saruman, which Gandalf (in the book) goes at great length to explain when he reappears in Fangorn's Wood as Gandalf The White - and even Gandalf cannot analyze Saruman fully - has become totally one-sided. In the movie Saruman is a stupid sadistic fan of Mordor, not even thinking in long-term strategy, in possession of primitive powers of sorcery such as ordering Old Cahadras The Mountain to force The Fellowship to turn back and venture the Caves of Moria instead. In the book Old Cahadras acts on its own much like Treebeard and other forces of nature. Like people in the real world people, trees and mountains in LOTR have different motives for not meddling at all in the big affairs of the times or for either joining or opposing Mordor. Much like World War II when some joined The Nazis only to get even with the Soviets or for some other reason that gets lost in the efforts to stage everything as Good vs Evil - in the words of one president (of the United States) ""either you're with us or you're against us"". 20 words about the product: It's a bargain at the price, the selection of scenes are fine, but most of all the artwork is exquisite like the movie itself.

Action, Adventure, Fantasy, 208 minutes (Extended Edition)
Directed by Peter Jackson
Starring Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellan and Elijah Wood

The Lord of the Rings book trilogy has sold an estimated 150 million copies and Peter Jackson's films have raked in a further $3 Billion worldwide. Add in the home media revenue and it's clear that people care about The Lord of the Rings.

It's an epic story which focuses more on the setting than anything else. Tolkien created a world, a language, and then populated the world with countless characters both good and evil. It's essentially the story of a journey to destroy an evil ring, but it includes themes such as love, friendship, loyalty, and belief. It's not my favorite series of books, but it's one that I am glad I own. It's unlikely that a work of fiction will ever have a bigger impact on the way stories are told. This is a series that changed how we perceive fantasy stories.

Imagine being given the task of adapting such a beloved story for the big screen. It's impossible to please everyone when something has such a devoted following. There's also the problem of time. How can you adapt a story told on over 1,000 pages into a coherent film? The sheer scale of the story is daunting. Thousands of extras would be needed to create realistic battle sequences and some of the settings would have to be created by hand. The use of CGI makes a lot of things possible, but Jackson faced an enormous task.

So how did Jackson fare?

The end result is impressive and pleasing, but is not without a few flaws. Purists hate the fact that Tom Bombadil does not appear in the films. Other beloved sequences were either left out or altered, and the sequence of events was changed to fit the needs of the film trilogy.

The setting is just about perfect. New Zealand was an excellent choice and the opening scenes showing Hobbiton set the mood for the first part of the trilogy. We spend almost an hour in the Shire and it helps us realize what's at stake. The sets throughout the story are convincing and fit the overall mood.

The music is powerful too, and the film just wouldn't have the same impact without it.

There are a few things I didn't like, but that's down to personal preference rather than any kind of error:

I would have liked more dialogue and characterization so that I came away knowing these characters intimately. Instead, the emphasis is placed on battle sequences. That makes for a great spectacle, but, for me, it's not the most interesting part of the story.

I respect what was done to make the battles convincing, and the epic scale, but the story should have focused more on the journey. To be fair, it did succeed in that aspect with Frodo and Sam.

My third minor complaint is that the Orcs and the hobbits came across as a little too comical. I understand that hobbits are supposed to love life, but there were a few too many jokes. The same was true for Gimli.

But, despite those quibbles, I think Jackson achieved something remarkable. It's unlikely that we will ever see a better version because of the work involved, and I don't think we need one. I did feel as though I had entered Middle Earth and it was much as I imagined it.

The acting ranged from good to great. My favorite performances came from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Ian McKellen as Gandalf, but there were so many noteworthy performances from the wonderful cast.

This first part of the trilogy is my favorite because it focuses more on story and characterization than the other two parts. It gives us our first glimpse of Tolkien's world. It's quite a commitment to watch all three extended versions of the trilogy. You'll need to set aside around 12 hours to see the whole trilogy, and that's not counting the special features.

I recommend Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring because it's a timeless story told on an epic scale. The time and effort that went into making it was not wasted and it deserves your attention.",1330473600,2,4045,4.583102493074792

1310413,5,B00003CWT6,"So many times nowadays, there are books that are absolutely ruined by the movie adaptations. Due to this, I'll bet a lot of people were anxious about this movie coming out, especially since The Lord of the Rings is one of the best pieces of literature from the 20th century; one would think it would be impossible to do this epic trilogy justice and still let it be successful.
  And one would be wrong.
This movie received 11 Academy Awards for a reason. With the beautiful music, which sounds like it came straight out of the books, the awesome acting, the majestic landscape and sets, and the epic storyline from Tolkien's imagination, this movie is sure to please any fantasy fans.
 Some people read a book, and want to see the movie. I am the opposite: When I see a movie I like, if there's a book, I'm interested. After seeing this movie, I started reading the books, and I loved them. I hadn't liked poetry until I read The Lord of the Rings.
 This movie is the perfect conclusion to the series. When I first saw this movie, my heart was flying. After all, at one time or another, almost every kid dreams of adventure, knights in shining armor, and love. But this is even better, because it is laced with symbolism of the real world.
 How many people today would take such a burden as the Ring upon themselves and go destroy it, even if they were tempted horribly by it, and knew that they were putting their own safety at risk even though they would get nothing out of it? And how many people would willingly offer to accompany that person, even if they knew they might never go home again? Very few. And yet, Frodo goes, and Sam follows. Their friendship is a shred of light in a world where we seem to have friends only for our gain or our own happiness.
  And I also love the symbolism of suffering in this movie. Our culture seems to see any suffering as a bad thing, something to be avoided. But what they don't see is that every piece of our lives have a bittersweet part to them. After returning from the war, the hobbits are maybe even better off than they were before. And I think anyone can see the symbolism of Frodo's departure to the Grey Havens at the end of the movie. After doing battle and succeeding, tired souls find rest in Him. I wish every person who watched that movie could see all that.
  Plus, there are epic lines that were not in the book, such as, ""Never thought I'd die side by side with an Elf.""
""What about side by side with a friend?""
  ""Yes. I could live with that.""
Or Aragorn's speech at the Black Gate. ""This day we fight!""
  In a way, it's kind of sad that the story ends here. But then again, I know I'll never get tired of watching the movies and listening to the music, or reading the books. Because even though the end is predictable, ""They all lived happily ever after,"" that's all I want to hear.",1327622400,,2848,4.330827067669173
1310414,2,B00003CWT6,"If I were asked by the author's nemesis to adapt the author's popular novel for the screen, I could ask for no better model than Peter Jackson's film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.  With its loving attention to costumes, set design, locations, and casting, the film has mesmerized even self-acknowledged Tolkien fans with its soulless charms.  Of Tolkien's 394-page book (not including the 4-page Forward and 15-page Prologue, none of the former and only four pages of the latter to which the film even alludes), less than 22%, or material from only 86 of the 394 pages, appears in the film.  What better way to undermine an author than to use less than 22% of his book?  Peter Jackson might answer, by using less than 22% and then distorting and even making-up characters and plots to fill the three-hour running-time of a film that purports to tell J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved tale, but in fact tells that tale as though captured by Saruman.

It's especially ironic that the end credits include the claim ""based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien"" (2:50:45).  That's quite a stretch.  Unlike the Harry Potter movies, Peter Jackson, despite his purported love for Tolkien's work, makes very free with it, apparently considering his own imagination superior to the author's.  I certainly understand that film adaptations of books often need to leave out subsidiary plots and such, in the interest of making the film a standard length.  While I'm disappointed with the absence of the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil chapters, for example, it's reasonable that they would be absent, since they are unnecessary to the primary plot of destroying the Ring.  What I object to is the invented plots -- including a great deal of Saruman and orc nonsense -- and altered characters -- cf. feminist Arwen and wishy-washy Aragorn -- added at the expense of Tolkien's wonderful writing.  It's a pity, because everything but the screenplay and score are done so well in the film.  As a book adaptation, the film earns 2 of 5 stars.  If it were a film from an original screenplay I'd give it an extra star.

A scene by scene analysis appears below, comparing the film to the book.  Chapter and page references are taken from the Second Edition (4th Printing) published by Houghton Mifflin ( 1965).

Scene 1 - Prologue
0:00-7:15 - The CGI battle of the alliance versus Sauron is so very artificial looking.  The bodies flung by Sauron's mace seem insubstantial, as do the countless numbers of pixel soldiers.  In the film, Isildur cuts three fingers from Sauron (~4:00), thus defeating him.  His army (orcs and all) dissolve.  In the book, Sauron is defeated, then Isildur cuts the Ring from his finger.
In the film, Isildur is ambushed as orcs leap upon him and slay him (~5:00), apparently dumping him in the river, now shot full of arrows.  In the book, Isildur is ambushed, tries to escape by wearing the Ring and is betrayed by it when he swims in the river (Anduin), whereupon he is shot full of arrows.  Despite the falseness of the CGI battle, and the liberties taken with the story, the Prologue does provide a quick and reasonably solid background for the story that follows - not that this background is necessary at this point, since Tolkien provides all we need as his story unfolds.  It should be mentioned that the film prologue bears no resemblance to Tolkien's own (pp. 10-25), except for touching upon part 4: Of the Finding of the Ring (pp. 20-23).

Scene 2 - The Shire
7:15-11:35 - Hobbiton looks wonderful.  The set design is impressive, and it's remarkable how well the film-makers seamlessly mingle the ""big people"" with the hobbits.

Scene 3 - Very Old Friends - Book I: Chapter 1: A Long Expected Party (pp. 29-50)
The first 4 pages (29-32) and the last 5 (45b-50) of this chapter are omitted.  The middle 12 (p. 33-44) are nicely used, however.
11:35-15:35 - This scene between Bilbo and Gandalf is nicely handled, with warm touches of compassion and humor.  Bag End is simply beautiful, and little things - like Gandalf bumping his head against the chandelier - add to the overall effectiveness of the scene.  It's nice to hear lines straight from the book, such as Bilbo's complaint that he feels like ""butter scraped over too much bread.""  I do dislike the pseudo-Irish turn to the film score here, with the tiresome penny whistle.  The film scoring is so sadly clich, and there is far too much music throughout the film in general, yet this scene isn't badly marred by the music.  It really is a fine little portrait of Gandalf and Bilbo.  Scenes 3, 4, and 5 correspond with pages 33-44 of Chapter 1.

Scene 4 - A Long Expected Party
~15:35-20:00 - Bilbo's birthday party is well-done, with just a few minor additions that aren't in the book (Sam trying to work up the courage to dance with a hobbit-lass - presumably Rose Cotton - Merry and Pippin getting into the fireworks, Bilbo telling children about the trolls).  Still, these don't clash with the character of the book at this point, and add humor to the scene.  Again, it's nice to hear dialogue drawn right from the book, as Bilbo's preposterous speech.

Scene 5 - Farewell, Dear Bilbo
20:00-24:30 - This faithfully-enough covers the relevant material from the book, without egregious departure.  The film really does right by Bilbo and Gandalf in this first half-hour.

Scene 6 - Keep It Secret, Keep It Safe - Chapter 2: The Shadow of the Past (pp. 51-73)
~24:30-26:40 - Here is where the filmmakers begin to take great liberties with the story.  This scene between Gandalf and Frodo, and the treatment of their interactions with The Ring, strays from the text (Gandalf will not even touch the ring!).
Scenes 6-7 are drawn, as much as they are, from the 5th page (p. 55) and following of the 2nd chapter.  Here the book gives us the background of the rings (paraphrased in the film's Prologue).

Scene 7 - The Account of Isildur
26:40-29:20 - Scene of Mordor and Black Riders (Ringwraiths) added.  Gandalf studies the papers in the archives at Minas Tirith (this is mentioned much later in the book, in Book II: Chapter 2 The Council of Elrond, pp. 264-267).  The Black Rider shows up in The Shire even before Gandalf returns to Bag End to confirm that the ring is The Ring.

Scene 8 - The Shadow of the Past
29:20-38:30 - Here we rejoin Tolkien's story, as it continued following Bilbo's birthday party and farewell.  Gandalf returns to Hobbiton and performs his test upon The Ring.  He and Frodo discuss its history.
~34:30 - Frodo immediately leaves Hobbiton, with Gandalf helping him pack.  In the book (p. 72 and first page of Ch. 3), Gandalf urges him to leave within the year, if G. hasn't returned.  Still, this scene does a reasonable job of summarizing Chapter 2.

The first half-hour of the film stays pretty faithful to the book, and certainly captures the rustic charm of The Shire.  The actors are well-cast, both for looks and ability, and the set-design and costumes are top drawer.  It's a pity that the film (and the series) loses its footing from this point.

Scene 9 - Saruman The White
~38.30-43:00 - Gandalf is off to see Saruman.  In the book, we don't know this until much later, in Rivendell (Book II: Ch. 2 The Council of Elrond, pp. 269-275).  Gandalf does not tell Saruman about The Ring in the book.  There is then a big, stupid confrontation between the two wizards, which is certainly not in the book.  This four-and-a-half minute sequence is largely made up.

Chapter 3: Three is Company (pp. 74-94) - The film omits this chapter entirely, except for pp. 83b-84, which are paraphrased at ~45:15 in Scene 10.

Scene 10 - A Shortcut to Mushrooms
43:00-47:00 - Merry and Pippin stumble into Frodo and Sam while M. & P. are stealing carrots from Farmer Maggot (~43:40).  There is then a flight from Farmer Maggot.  This 90-second sequence is made up.
~45:15 - Film skips Chapter 3 until (p. 83b), where the Black Rider appears and they get off the road to hide.  In the book, there's no distracting the Rider by tossing a bag, nor Sam keeping Frodo from using the ring, and no roiling of insects.  A few seconds of the getting off the road business is accurate, but the flight from the Rider is made up.

Chapter 4: A Shortcut to Mushrooms (pp. 95-107) - The film omits this chapter entirely.

Chapter 5: A Conspiracy Unmasked (pp. 108-119) - The film omits this chapter entirely.

Chapter 6: The Old Forest (pp. 120-133) - The film omits this chapter entirely.

Chapter 7: In The House of Tom Bombadil (pp. 134-145) - The film omits this chapter entirely.

Chapter 8: Fog on The Barrow-Downs (pp. 146-160) - The film omits this chapter entirely.

Scene 11 - Bucklebury Ferry
~47:00-49:15 - This chase to the ferry is entirely made-up, apparently inspired by the second page of Ch. 5 A Conspiracy Unmasked.  Most of ~38:30-49:15 is completely made up by the filmmakers.

Scene 12 - At the Sign of The Prancing Pony - Chapter 9 (pp. 161-174 - Film omits all but 6)
~50:00 - This scene is littered with errors, and is largely false to the character and content of the book.  To begin with, it's raining, unlike in the book (""white stars were shining"" p. 163).  The encounter with the gatekeeper is well-done, but just after, when we meet Barliman Butterbur, he acts as if he's not well-acquainted with Gandalf (there's no mention of the message from G. that's slipped his mind, for example).  This is complicated by the fact that the name Underhill seems chosen on the spot by Frodo, rather than given to him by G., as in the book.
There's an ominous quality to the film's Prancing Pony.  Filthy and ugly faces populate the room, and there is no ""chorus of welcome from the Bree-landers"" nor ""friendly and inquisitive"" Bree-hobbits, as in the book (p. 167).
~52:45 - Frodo has the silly temptation to finger The Ring and hears voices - who knows why the filmmakers felt they should add that.
~53:00 - Pippin starts talking about Frodo Baggins and Frodo trips in trying to stop him, at which point The Ring falls onto his finger, resulting in visions of the Eye of Sauron - very strange.  In the book, Frodo begins singing a song to distract the crowd from Pippin's loose tongue, and falls from the table he's dancing upon, slipping on the ring as he falls.
~56:00 - Without establishing any trust, the hobbits fall in with Strider and, presumably at his urging, switch rooms and thus avoid being slashed to ribbons by the Black Riders.  Yet, why would the hobbits be sleeping with Strider in the room, considering that they have no knowledge of who he is - since this important section of the book, establishing his identity and their trust, is left out of the film.  In the film, we first glimpse Strider at 52:00, but only ""meet"" him at 54:00, where-upon he grabs Frodo and throws him into a room.  Perhaps this is meant to establish trust?
In the book, Strider invites Frodo to sit with him (p. 169), and it is during their conversation that Pippin's tale-telling gets out of hand, whereupon, at Strider's urging, Frodo distracts the company by offering a silly song (pp. 170-172).  After the commotion caused by Frodo's abrupt disappearance, Strider asks for a quiet word with him.  This is all much different from the scene at the inn as portrayed in the film.

Strider - Chapter 10 (pp. 175-187) -- This chapter is omitted from the film.
~57:00 - Strider casually gazes out the window at the Black Riders in the street below.  He tells the hobbits about the Riders, and suddenly - without explanation - the hobbits are following him into the wilderness.
By omitting Chapter 10, the film has omitted any sense, any logic behind the hobbits taking up with Strider, rendering Scenes 12 and 13 largely preposterous.

Scene 14 - The Spoiling of Isengard
58:30-60:15 - Saruman is ordered by Sauron, via the Palantir, to make an orc army; he then rips up the trees at Isengard whilst Gandalf is prisoner atop Orthanc.  This is not in the book, though it is extrapolated to some extent from Book II, Chapter 2 The Council of Elrond.

Scene 15 - A Knife in the Dark - Chapter 11 (pp. 188-208)
This chapter is omitted from the film, except for the last two pages (pp. 207-8) and a bit of p. 199.
~60:45 - Strider gives the hobbits their swords, atop Weathertop, then Merry and Pippin foolishly make a fire to cook bacon.  The Riders attack, but Strider has left to have a look around, only showing up after the Riders have stabbed Frodo.  This differs a great deal from the book, where the hobbits have their swords from the barrow, and where they are now not even atop Weathertop.

Scene 16 - The Caverns of Isengard
~65:00-67:22 - Gandalf sends a moth message, while Saruman makes a mess of the place and creates the Uruk Hai orcs.  This is made up from whole cloth.

Scene 17 - The Flight to The Ford - Chapter 12 (pp. 209-227)
The first two pages of this chapter are summarized, after a fashion, at the end of Scene 15.  The remainder of the chapter is omitted in the film, apart from a glancing reference to the troll-hole (p. 217), and a greatly altered telling of the final two and a half pages (the flight to the Ford).
67:23-73:00 - The hobbits are sitting amidst the stone-turned trolls - without explanation.  Strider orders Sam to look for Athelas (Kingsfoil), though in the book (p. 210), he has them in his belt-pouch already: ""These leaves I have walked far to find; for this plant does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the Road I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.""  Having Sam look with him for Athelas in the dark, an illogical change the film makes, sets up the next foolish scene: Arwen (taking Glorfindel's role from the book) appears and puts a sword to Aragorn's neck (showing her superiority, one supposes, over a Ranger who should have sensed her presence).  Arwen approaches Frodo in a halo of angelic light, speaks to him, once more asserts her superiority over Aragorn (""I can ride faster"") and takes Frodo on her horse.  Sam once more scolds the increasingly unconfident Strider for his poor leadership ""What are you doing?  Those wraiths are still out there!""  Arwen and Frodo flee from the Black Riders, at which point Arwen says magic words to make the river rise, before praying for Frodo.  This whole account varies widely from the book.  It bears noting that Arwen only appears in The Lord of the Rings in a brief scene at Rivendell in The Fellowship of the Ring (p. 239), at the end of The Return of the King, and in the appendices.  We lose the character of Glorfindel and the account of the flight to the ford is much changed.

Scene 18 - Rivendell - Book II, Chapter 1: Many Meetings (pp. 231-251)
This chapter is omitted from the film, except for half of the first page.
73:35-75:30 - Gandalf is tortured by Saruman (74:30-75:30) and then leaps from the roof of Orthanc as the eagle swoops to catch him.  In the book, there is no indication that S. tortures G., nor that G. leaps from the tower when the eagle Gwaihir rescues him.

Scene 19 - Many Meetings
75:30-79:00 - Frodo meets Bilbo (~77:00) after seeing Merry and Pippin, vs. p. 243 of the book.  Scene 19 is a made-up scene of Frodo and Sam discussing their readiness to go home.

Scene 20 - The Fate of the Ring
~79:00-82:40 - Here we are given a made-up scene between Gandalf and Elrond, where Elrond belittles Men.

Scene 21 - The Sword That Was Broken
82:40-84:50 - This is a made-up scene between Aragorn and Boromir that furthers the film-makers' purpose to remake Aragorn as a wishy-washy, reluctant leader.

Scene 22 - The Evenstar
84:50-86:30 - Yet another made-up scene: this time between Aragorn and the whispering Arwen.  Aragorn's previous strength of character has been utterly bled-away by the end of this scene.

Scene 23 - The Council of Elrond - Chapter 2 (pp. 252-284)
This chapter is omitted from the film, except for two paragraphs from the last page.
86:30-93:00 - Almost none of this scene reflects the book's description, save for two of the last three paragraphs of the chapter: Frodo taking on the burden for the journey to Mordor, and Sam joining the Council and the quest.  This is a pity, for the chapter recounts the history of the Ring, as told by Elrond, as well as what befell Gandalf as he came to understand the nature of the Ring and approached Saruman for counsel.  While these tales were told in prior scenes in the film, after a fashion, they've been shorn of much of their substance, power, mystery, and suspense by the filmmakers' impatience and poor judgment.  Here again, as so frequently in the film trilogy, the basic character of the principle players differs from the book, with, for example, Gimli and Boromir far more hot-headed and unbridled, and Aragorn almost as neurotic as a Woody Allen protagonist.

Scene 24 - Bilbo's Gifts
93:00-95:20 - We are shown, in a way that differs from the book, the giving of Sting and the mithril coat from Bilbo to Frodo (The Ring Goes South, p. 290-291), yet the book describes no demonic flash of covetousness for The Ring, as the film shows on Bilbo's face.

Scene 25 - The Ring Goes South - Chapter 3 (pp. 285-307)
This chapter is largely omitted from the film.  The first five pages are skipped entirely, before we are given a riff on half of p. 290-291 (see Scene 24).  The next six pages are skipped.
95:20-97:00 - The company seem to be traveling by day, unlike in the book.  At a campground, Boromir teaches swordplay to Merry and Pippin, while Gimli urges passage through Moria to Gandalf, though these exchanges are not in the book.
97:00 - Crebain (birds) from Dunland fly over: in the film it is Legolas who first spies them, though in the book all but Sam and Aragorn are asleep; this is handled much differently there (see p. 298).

Scene 26 - The Pass of Caradhras
98:15 - 1 hour, 43 minutes - Journey over the mountain Caradhras: Frodo falls and loses the Ring, which Boromir picks up and reluctantly returns, after threatening gestures from Aragorn.  This is made-up.  We are then treated to scenes of the crebain reporting to Saruman, then Saruman's voice causing an avalanche and storm, then Gimli (once more) urging passage through Moria, then Frodo being told to decide the course of The Fellowship - all complete fabrication.
In the book, it is not Saruman who hinders their passage, but, as Aragorn says (p. 302), ""There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs, and yet are not in league with Sauron, but have purposes of their own.""

Scenes 27 & 28 - A Journey in the Dark - Chapter 4 (pp. 308-334)
The first 7 pages of this chapter are omitted from the film.
1:43-1:47:45 - The doors to Moria are nicely done, taken almost exactly from Tolkien's illustration in the book (p. 319).  However, Frodo figures out the password to Moria (not Gandalf, as in the book), the Watcher in the Water is depicted much differently in the book (not as this towering Kraken-like octopus as in the film), and Gimli makes absurd offers of Dwarvish hospitality, as if he didn't know that Moria was abandoned.
1:47:45-1:52:45 - They journey a bit through Moria, then Frodo sees Gollum, and Frodo and Gandalf have the conversation about Gollum that they had in Bag End in the book - at least this is a rare moment where the film uses Tolkien's actual written dialogue.  Overall, the chapter is pretty well handled in the film, capturing its mood and ""look"" well.

Scenes 29 & 30 - The Bridge of Khazad-dm - Chapter 5 (pp. 335-346)
1:52:45-2:01:30 - They arrive at Balin's tomb - and, simultaneously, the well - but Pippin knocks a whole skeleton, bucket, and chain into the well, rather than just a pebble, as in the book.
The fight at Balin's tomb is described quite specifically in the book (pp. 338-342): an orc leaps from the tomb, not Gimli, who would never show such disrespect for Balin by standing on his tomb; the cave troll is hacked at by Boromir as its arm is thrust through the door opening, and Frodo stabs its foot; Frodo is pinned by an orc spear (not the troll, who isn't green and scaly, as the book describes).  Frodo then shows the company his mithril coat.  In the book, this scene occurs in Lothlorien, when Aragorn tends the wounds of the company.
2:01:30-2:11:15 - Next, the film shows orcs swarming down the pillars of Moria like bugs.  The orcs surround the company and then abruptly flee back up the pillars after a growl is heard (the Balrog).  Gandalf is prevented from action here, because Director Peter Jackson wants a big fight.  The crumbling bridge scene - leaping the ever increasing chasm - is completely made up.  It looks like a video game - very much CGI.
The fight with the Balrog is actually well-done - quite similar to the book!  I especially like how the filmmakers achieved the combination of darkness and fire in the Balrog's body.
Aragorn yells at the company to keep moving, despite Boromir's protests that the hobbits need to mourn, very much unlike the book (see the first page of the Lothlorien chapter).

Scene 31 - Lothlorien - Chapter 6 (pp. 347-367)
Apart from less than one page, this entire chapter is omitted from the film.
2:11:15-2:13:15 - Frodo hears Galadriel's voice whispering, after Gimli spouts some nonsense as they enter the wood.  They are met by Lucius Malfoy and his duplicates.  (He seems to be the model for the film creators' idea of wood elves.)
2:13:15-2:17:45 - The film then skips right to Celeborn and Galadriel (Ch. 7).  Lothlorien and its elves are depicted as dark, creepy, and rather malevolent in the film, completely contrary to the book.  Made-up exchanges between Legolas and Frodo, and Aragorn and Boromir follow.

Scene 32 - The Mirror of Galadriel - Chapter 7 (pp. 368-382)
The first 2 pages of this chapter are omitted, before Celeborn asks of Gandalf (p. 370).  The next 2 pages are skipped, apart from Galadriel bidding them rest (p. 372).  The next 4 pages are passed over, before Galadriel leads Frodo to the Mirror (but not Sam, as in the book (p. 376).  The next 2 pages are skipped.  About 4 pages of this 14-page chapter are used in the film.
2:17:45-2:17:45 - Galadriel showing the mirror to Frodo follows the book pretty well (p. 379-381), but again, the whole feel of Lothlorien is dark and malevolent.
Scene 33 - The Fighting Uruk-hai
2:23:12~2:25 - Another egregious intrusion of Saruman and his orcs.  Not in the book, of course.

Scene 34 - Farewell to Lorien - Chapter 8 (pp. 383-395)
This chapter (13 pages) is omitted from the film, apart from one paragraph (top of p. 393).
~2:25-2:25:45 - The film in-authentically depicts the giving of the Phial of Galadriel (but not the other gifts) in a very brief (30 seconds) flashback as the company is on its way down the river.

Scene 35 - The Great River - Chapter 9 (pp. 396-410)
The first 13 pages of this chapter are omitted from the film.  Only the penultimate page is used.
2:25:45~2:28:30 - The Argonath (Pillars of the Kings) (2:27:15) from p. 409 are nicely depicted.

Scene 36 - Parth Galen
The Breaking of the Fellowship - Chapter 10 (pp. 410-423)
The first sentence is used (""Aragorn led them to the right arm of the River.""), but not the remainder of the first 2 pages; the film uses much of the next 5 pages, but not the next 4 (p. 418-421); in all, 6 of 12 pages.
2:28:30-2:30:00 - Gimli makes up some nonsense about how horrid Morder is, after Aragorn asserts that they're heading there once evening falls, in contrast to the book (p. 411).
2:30:00-2:35:00 - Frodo just wanders from the company without a word, rather than asking for an hour alone (p. 412).  He finds his way to the hill of Amon Hen, where he is confronted by Boromir, flees from him, and sits unwittingly upon the Seat of Seeing - all nicely done and quite in keeping with the book (p. 413-417).  Then, after removing the ring, Frodo actually offers it to Aragorn after hinting that Aragorn would have wielded it as Boromir wished to!  This utterly counters the book, where Aragorn doesn't even see Frodo again after Frodo leaves to ponder his path (see p. 418).

Scene 37 - The Breaking of the Fellowship
Here, we've left The Fellowship of the Ring and begun material from The Two Towers (book).
2:35:00 - Aragorn gives battle to the orcs, after telling Frodo to go to Mordor on his own (this made up from whole cloth).  An orc cries ""Find the haflings!"" though we've been given no reason why the orcs would know about the company, that hobbits are among them, or what the term ""hafling"" means.  If you haven't read the book, you're out of luck.  A big fight now ensues, with Legolas and Gimli joining in.
2:36:15 - Merry and Pippin espy  Frodo and tell him to hide with them.  Frodo refuses.  Then, M. & P. yell at the orcs to draw them away from Frodo - more imagination by these intrepid filmmakers.
2:38:20 - Merry and Pippin stand around in a daze as Boromir is shot with arrows.  Strangely, Frodo frequently takes out The Ring and holds it, keeping it in his pocket rather than on a chain around his neck.
Scene 38 - The Departure of Boromir
2:41:40-2:44:15 - This is handled very nicely in the film, in keeping with The Two Towers text.
Scene 39 - The Road Goes Ever On...
2:44:15-2:50:30 - We return briefly, and glancingly, to the Fellowship book: the final two pages (422-423).",1327104000,4,25322,4.608424336973479

1310417,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay.

In 1955 an English language professor named J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a series of books about an unlikely hero given a large dangerous task to accomplish; he set out with the aid of friends and magic and triumphed.

In December 2001, famed director Peter Jackson (later known for King Kong [2005] and The Lovely Bones [2009]) and writer Fran Walsh (who wrote for Lovely Bones) set out to make their magnum opus and what may well be one the greatest film series ever produced this side of Star Wars.

I call this extended DVD in particular the ""ultimate cinematic experience"" for a host of reasons.

1. The source material which the movie complements perfectly and even surpasses at times. The Lord of the Rings is in fact a single epic high fantasy novel often split into 3 parts: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. Published in England in the mid 1950s by Allen and Unwin, the book would sell like crazy and decades later spawn 3 animated adaptations, video games, trading cards, and a slew of imitations by countless authors and film-makers.

2. The epic in your face beauty of the set design, lighting, and costumes.

The set design for this film boggles the mind. From Rivendell where it's always autumn to Lothelorien where it's always twilight, there's something in the imagery for everybody.

3. The musical score.
Film composer Howard Shore orchestrated, composed and conducted a three hour extravaganza score for this movie. The Complete Recordings showcase his work.

4. The action and adventure.
Where else can you find this epic adventure, this massive battle for the preservation of the planet? No where else, that's what. The fight scenes are everything you could hope for...and more.

5. The extended scenes. From Bilbo's study to the passsing of the wood elves to the ten minute end credits musical suite, this DVD packs a massive punch to the senses.

6. The prequel/sequel to be released December 2012.

In closing, if you are looking for a great movie for the wife and kids, you gotta check this out. This defines movies. Buy it today and don't even think about looking back.",1325203200,,2133,4.784741144414169

1310587,2,B00003CWT6,"I happened to watch this movie again recently. One of my co-workers who is 25 told me he has never seen it, he hasn't read the book. Why didn't I recommend this movie to him? Very simple reason: the script is not good. This is the most typical issue of flawed movies. The story and novel on which it is based are remarkable. What primarily makes a regular movie (good or bad) is the storyline, and the chain of sequences from beginning to end within that storyline. Of course the quality of the actors, special effects, props, clothes etc... is important. We cannot deny most of those things are great in this movie. Nor can we deny that some of the action scenes are astounding (e.g. cave troll scene in the Moria), as well as  some of the intimate scenes (1st meeting of Boromir and Aragorn in the room of the broken sword). These are small islands. The ensemble is much diminished by badly thought out sequences that remove all mystery and suspense from the initial story. Examples: the whole storyline with the black knights, how they hear of Baggins, how they come from Mordor to find the Shire, pursue the hobbits, is poorly done, mostly because it is poorly scripted. Incidently, one of the most laughable moments is when they ride and force their way into the village of Bree, and the door falls on the gatekeeper as if he were completely flattened in the action. Although this is not shown, we end up imagining him as flat as a pancake like a cartoon character. The night scenes especially in the woods are also badly shot, with a corny lighting that reminds us of the lighting used in the X-Files TV series: we can always visualize the spotlights installed somewhere in the woods in the background. The scene that crushes any sense of mistery and suspense in this movie, though, is that of the balrog. The monster itself is greatly done. But the action sequence around it is boring. At some point the director wants you to believe that the 9 heroes are surrounded by thousands of ennemies (orcs) all with blades, bows and arrows at the ready; yet instead of finishing them of, this multitude decides to flee because of the balrog, which offers the heroes an unbelievable way to escape. Consequently, we end up not caring much about what happens to them next. The first hint that we are about to see some not-that-great movie is right at the beginning, in the birthday party scene. First the fireworks look fake and tasteless. Then, Bilbo's speech and the transition to his disappearance is a failed and fastidious moment that cannot be saved by the great actor who plays Bilbo. This is because, as in the entire movie itself, the writer and the director did not manage to foster any sense of compelling mistery or suspense, but instead, decided to make some predigested and overly safe movie. Why am I so harsh? Because I can see now very similar flaws in subsequent productions from the same director, such as the newly released (in Europe) Tintin movie. Let aside the initial story or imaginary world on which the movie is based, couldn't they write a good and compelling script first?",1320969600,,3097,4.630909090909091

1310590,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie has everything you could ever want: horses, a wizard, midgets with big feet, and an important lesson about saving the receipt (enforced by Balrog).  It took them 3 hours of wandering/being chased by several Ann Coulters in black cloaks and they still didn't return that ring.  It was a wild ride; they had to go to the customer service desk in the Mines of Moria and ask to exchange the ring, but couldn't because they did not have the box it originally came in!
I assume the sequel has them go to this ""Mt Doom"" where they got the ring in the first place (is that like De Beer's?) and I guess talk to the manager and see if they can at least get store credit.  I bet that will take at least six hours though, and will feature unicorns, talking sheep, and Leonard Nimoy.  I hear there is a third movie, so I assume the manager won't help them out (typical of no name stores like Mt Doom), and they spend 22 hours pawning it at Super Pawn.  It would be an awesome ending if Elijah Wood gets a secondhand guitar and starts a band with Hugo Weaving.  Overall, this is a great movie with a lesson that hit me like a ton of bricks:  buy from a reputable dealer and save the receipt.",1320451200,,1188,4.20704845814978
1310591,4,B00003CWT6,"I was tempted to give this movie three stars....but come on, it's Lord of the Rings!  This movie is obviously no match for the book, but I can't imagine how it could be.  My biggest complaint is length; I am one of those people who has a hard time sitting through very long movies - if it is going to be long, it had better be very engaging throughout.  This movie drags a bit in places (but to be fair, there are chunks of the book that have little ""action"" that translates well to the screen, that could not be ommitted).  However, I must say that I find this to be less true as an adult; I recall watching them when they first came out in my teens and having a very hard time (I actually never watched the third movie).....and this is less true now.  I also found the climactic scene to be a bit of a let down; however, I imagine that is the pitfall of any movie that is meant to be continued with further installations.

All that being said, I definitely recommend this movie to anyone, particularly any fan of the fantasy genre.  Everyone should read or watch (or both) the LOTR stories in their lifetime.  However, I will say this is not a movie I will ever watch frequently.  And, to anyone who had mixed feelings about the movie: I highly recommend you try the books.",1319760000,,1275,4.257261410788382

Try John Hurt in the old semi-animated version from 1978, or Robert Stephens from the BBC radio version of 1981-82. The budget on this production was comparable with the United States national debt.

When elves and orc fight for one ring to be destroyed, a man finds the ring off the king of the orc and runs away with it.  The orc search and search for him, find him and kill him.  Many years later, when two hobbits are fishing, they find the ring.  It gets passed on to a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.  Bilbo Baggins had the ring for years and didn't tell anybody.  He finally gives it to Frodo Baggins.  Frodo, and his companions, Mary, Pippin and Sam, are trying to find a way to destroy the ring.  But they need help.  So they all find a man, an elf and a dwarf.  Their names are Eragon, Legolas and Gimmly.  They go through lots of missions to try to destroy the ring.

The biggest issue people have with these movies is ""P J cut out too much, simplified characters, didn't allow characters to develop, etc.""

Yes, I'm sad that Faramir was crooked and Tom Bombadil didn't make it and Gimli tried to be funny (and failed).

Let's say someone tried to make a 100% accurate version of LOTR. Do you know how long it would be? LONG. I would LOVE that!

But the longer it is, the more expensive it grows. PJ had a limit of $285,000. 12 hours was as long as he could go.

When you have to cram a 1,137 page book into 12 hours, things have to get cut. Simplified. Changed for clarity. If every minor character had been left in, non-fans would have been hopelessly confused and bored. When you're trying to please the fans, the non-fans, the box-office, and New Line Cinema, it's a pretty tough juggling act.

With everyone PJ had to please, he did a pretty good job. Before you decide he did everything wrong, keep in mind that nothing is perfect, and we can't always have exactly what we want.

Even in the slowness, the scenery is just spectacular from the Shire (home of the Hobbits) to Rivendell (home to a clan of elves lead by Elrond (Hugo Weaving)) in the combination of artistic and natural beauty; and the woods of the lady of the woods, Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) in the magnificence of their domicile.

1310642,5,B00003CWT6,"I recently completed an English class at a community college here in California dedicated to Tolkien's books, mainly the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Hobbit. After having read all these books and discussing them in class, we compared them to the movie versions frequently. Now as someone that love movies but also enjoys reading, to pick the book over the movie or vise versa is a challenge for me. Peter Jackson has done such a wonderful job at turning these books into epic movies and as you who may have read the books turning something as magical as the Lord of the Rings into movies is no easy task. And in this reviewers opinion, I feel Jackson has made 3 films that someone who loves the books can appreciate. Now all the movies don't coincide with the books verbatim but it would be hard to do so when the time lines of the different members of the fellowship  run parallel to each others. Many parts have been shortened as well, mainly, The Council of Elrond, which was by far the longest chapter in the first book and was packed with details about members of the upcoming fellowship, as well as what Gandalf had been up too. However, its a movie and it serves to be entertaining and as  such I believe most of us suffer from a little ADD and that long bit of dialogue may have been a  death sentence for some of the movies watchers who wanna see excitement. But I believe Jackson captured all the important parts of the chapter and he manages to set the tone when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'.  Lets not forget the powerful ending where we watch the fall of Boromir, who after trying to take the Ring from Frodo becomes a hero saving Merry and Pippin, this scene was actually the first chapter of Two Towers but Jackson made it the end of the Fellowship to end the film strong and making movie watchers want more. When it comes down to it, Tolkien wrote a story about mankind, and how we treat each other and our earth. He told of mankind's corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope and the fact that the films can capture all that Tolkien meant to get across in his books, is a triumph for Jackson and his crew.

Probably everyone has some idea of the story: a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) inherits from his far-travelled Uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm) a curious ring, but doesn't find out until it's almost too late just what ring it is or what perils it places him in.  Willy-nilly he's forced to flee his native Shire with his loyal friend Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) and a pair of mischief-makers, Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan) and Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took (Billy Boyd), while Bilbo's old friend, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan), sets off to consult Saruman (Christopher Lee), the head of his order, for advice--only to learn that Saruman has gone over to the ring's original owner, the near-immortal Sauron (Sala Baker).  The hobbits fall in with the mysterious Strider (Viggo Mortensen) and after many perils arrive in the country of the elves, where a fellowship is formed to destroy the ring in the fires that created it.  But the ring has a sentience and an agenda of its own, as the company--Boromir (Sean Bean), a prince of the marches; Legolas (Orlando Bloom), an elfin archer; Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), a redheaded dwarf; Strider, and the hobbits--soon discover.  And Saruman has created an army of Uruk-Hai--hybrids of orcs and goblins--to pursue them.

Of course the real stars of the film are the absolutely unrivalled special effects (I think my favorite is the Balrog the company encounters deep in the underground domain of a massacred dwarven community), but the actors too seem perfectly suited to their parts and thoroughly immersed in them, and the whole look of the movie has been created with painstaking detail.

1310784,5,B00003CWT6,"I am so glad I decided to purchase the extended editions of the trilogy.  I watched The Fellowship today and wow, just wow.  I usually am so disappointed with extended DVDs, its usually boring garbage that totally ruins the movie.  Crammed in junk that makes you say ""I see why that was cut out in the first place"", but that is not the case with the Fellowship.  There are some extended scenes as well as some new additional scenes and its all great.  It truly enhances the movie.  Everything flows freely and IMO better than in the theatrical version.

What I really liked was the booklet that came along with the 4 disc set.  It breaks down the chapters of the DVD and labels them either as added scenes or extended scenes.  Since I haven't watched any of the LOTR movies in a while, it really helped me catch the extra parts. For example, there is a scene at the beginning titled Concerning Hobbits which is a narration done by Bilbo.  It gives a little more insight into the life of a Hobbit.  I don't want to spoil any surprises, but there are scenes that allow a little more background on certain characters.

The extras discs are incredible, just about as entertaining as the movie itself.  Lots of magical contruction and work captured.

1310785,3,B00003CWT6,"I'd read several reviews of this version of the DVD saying the movie skips at parts.  When I actually got mine, I played it and it did indeed have a few playback issues.  I played it on my computer and Side 1 froze several times during playback and I had to remove the disc and reinsert it to get it to continue.  The worst freezing happened after I began playing again when the film had been paused.  I checked the disc several times, there were no scratches or smudges that should have made it hard to read, but my computer had a very hard time.  Surprisingly, Side B played fine without any issues, even if I paused it.

I would still recommend buying this if, like me, you never purchased any of the Lord of the Rings films before and want access to both versions without buying them separately.  I did find the playback issues a bit troubling but overall the film does play and looks good, and it could have been a hardware issue that caused my problems.  Just be aware that several people have experienced this.  It doesn't make the movie unwatchable, you just might notice a couple of hang ups.",1297209600,,1101,4.384236453201971

1310787,5,B00003CWT6,"Long time ago in ancient times, Middle-Earth was troubled by the evil power of dark lord Sauron who caused various wars on the world for many rings for forged for many kings and lords but Sauron crafted the one ring to rule them all. After he was defeated, his legacy and spirit lives on within the ring for it is a cursed object that can corrupt those that wield it including a poor soul named Smeagol a.k.a. Gollum (Voiced and played by Andy Serkis) that has taken over him for 500 years until a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) took it away from him and had his adventure. 60 years later after the events of his battle against Smaug, he is celebrating his 111th birthday in a peaceful area known as The Shire owned by Halfling beings called Hobbits and after the party he leaves the ring to his nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) as he goes off to Rivendale for a long vacation/retirement to be with the elves. Longtime friend of both Frodo and Bilbo known as Gandolf The Grey (Ian Mckellen) who is a wise and powerful wizard later finds out the secrets of the ring and discovers that Sauron is back in Mordor sending out armies of Orcs, goblins, monsters and soldiers to make another major world on Middle-Earth. Frodo goes on a quest with his friends Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin), Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominac Mongahan) to destroy the One-Ring as they head all the way to Rivendale where they must learn on where to destroy it nd joins up with more new friends such as Aragon (Viggo Morgenstein), Elfen archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Boromir (Sean Bean) and Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davis) to go on the quest.

For many years, J.R.R. Tolkien's classic timeless fantasy/adventure novels have been considered unfilmable as even said so by Tolkein himself for studios have tried to bring Lord of the Rings to the screen. In 1969 United Artists got the rights as they wanted to have The Beatles be the hobbits with John Lennon as Gollum and David Bowie as Gandolf with Stanley Kubrick as director as he denied it and considered it unfilmable. Then in 1975 Ralph Bakshi worked on getting the books to the screen with Rankin-Bass doing the prequel called ""The Hobbit"" released in 1977 then Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"" was released in 1978 to decent box-office and mixed reviews as it covered only the first 2 books but was unfinshed since Bakshi wanted to do another movie but based on Return of the King as he denied doing it. So Rankin-Bass decided to complete the unfinished animated LOTR with 1980's Return of the King then in 1995 New Line aquired the rights to have Tolkein's books as movies for Peter Jackson was announced to write, produce and direct each movie since he is a huge fan of Tolkein's novels. From 96 till 98 work began on LOTR from writing the scripts, designing costumes, film location scouting, set designing, creature designing and make-up effects to animatronics especially casting. In 1999 till 2003 filming on all three movies started even on the amazing visual effects by WETA, i believe Peter Jackson has made a brilliant beginning to a masterful cinematic trilogy in the vein of the classic Star Wars movies.

The casting is just brilliant as i couldn't imagine anyone else but Elijah Wood for Frodo and the legendary Ian Mckellen is just right the part of Gandalf as well as his rival Sarumon The White played by Christopher Lee. Co-starring Liv Tyler as Aragon's elfen love interest Arwen, Hugo Weaven as her elfen king father Elrond and a cameo by Peter Jackson himself. The acting is just phenomenal and i also love the absorbing music score by Howard Shore who created his greatest score in his film history, it's been a wonderful labor of love for Peter Jackson who had a great cinematic task of bringing three books to the screen in glorious grand scale as i gotta thank you Peter Jackson for doing the impossible and doing Tolkein and his fans proud.

This Blu-Ray has brilliant flawless picture and awesome sound quality with great extras like trailers to this movie, TV documentaries on this movie, TV Spots, music video to Enya's ""May it Be"" song, preview to the next movie and Aragon's Quest game trailer.",1296259200,,4153,4.678522571819426

1310790,4,B00003CWT6,"FINALLY!

I got to see Lord of the Rings- the Fellowship of the Ring!  It only took me, what?  9-10 years?  Oh well, haha.

Despite all the criticism I received over the years for not bothering to check into this film (because I kept praising Harry Potter while ignoring the Lord of the Ring series- unintentionally of course) I finally got the opportunity to sit down last night and watch all 3 hours of this film.  I can honestly say... it's good.

I can definitely see why it was competing with the Harry Potter series back in the day.  They both focus on fictional and outdoor adventures containing all kinds of magical tricks and just overall amazing effects and production.

If you want me to *choose* between this or the Harry Potter series... well it's kind of difficult to pick a favorite.  I'd say this particular Lord of the Ring movie is a bit easier to understand in comparison to all the confusion I had with the Potter series.  The Harry Potter series had more characters overall I believe, so it was hard remembering everybody and their involvement in the storyline.  That's not really a problem with Lord of the Rings.  At least not *yet*.  Who knows what I'd think about the next three in the series.

As I said above, the special effects are brilliant. The enormous ape creature that closely resembles that huge monster from Resident Evil 4 is an astonishing piece of film work.  It really DOES look like it's real and attacking everybody.

The storyline is simple, and that's exactly how I like it when it pertains to adventurous fantasy movies such as these.  A young boy gets ahold of a very powerful golden ring, and as you can probably guess, there's an assortment of very bad people that would like the ring for themselves.  With the help of the boys friends, a wizard, and of course, lots of sword fighting action, they all set out on an adventure of a lifetime.

The only negative is that, just like in the Harry Potter series, there's the occasional fairly lengthy boring segments that involve hard to understand talking scenes.  They're hard to understand because they're so darn quiet.  Plus they take away from the nonstop action or special effects.  Another problem is that they tend to last about 5 minutes too long.  The first one appears right after the mysterious woman riding a white horse comes out of nowhere.  The one right before the lengthy walk up the snowy mountains.

Despite the occasional boredom kicking in from time to time, I was overall pretty impressed with it.  It stands up remarkably well in the storytelling, and it's a great film for anybody who appreciates a good adventure movie.",1294185600,,2638,4.665943600867679

The film project required a sustained effort of proportions as fantastic as the subject matter; Peter Jackson is to be applauded for his vision and dedication.

First the theatrical version dvd's, the extended dvd's, and the BR theatrical.  It's the way it is, and if your impatient like me you will plunk down the coin.  Being a big fan of movies these days is an expensive hobby.

Yes the quality of the first movie is not as great as the last 2.  That does not mean it is bad though. I think the reviews are a bit harsh.  It's not going to make to turn your head and recoil in disgust.  It's just not up to the quality of other BR discs. The picture is soft at times and for me 90% of it looked like a regular DVD, with the other 10% being the eye-popping BR eye candy.  Only on those certain sunlit scenes.  For some reason it seems the detail is great when the camera is on Gimli.  Like in a couple scenes when they are in the mines of Moria.  You can really see the detail in his helmet. IMO, the sub-par quality did not hinder my enjoyment of the movie whatsoever, and it did not distract or call attention to itself.  It just didn't have enough of those ""Wow, look at that picture"" moments.

The ""2 Towers"", much better.  Here it is more of a 85/15, 85 being the eye-popping detail.  As soon as I popped it in I said ""Wow, this is how it is meant to look.""

ROTK - soon.

I picked these up for $8 recently and they are worth it.  At regular price of $15ish, skipping the first one and picking up the last 2 on BR would be a wise choice.

1310936,5,B00003CWT6,"The three Lord of the Rings films [all directed by Peter Jackson] have clearly made film history, chiefly due to their marked overall excellence. This film trilogy, shot entirely in New Zealand, is breathtaking at a minimum. Here, I'm reviewing the *Special Extended Edition* [as opposed to the much shorter Theatrical Version] of the first of these films on DVD, *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

I'm sure that the story is familiar to most who would show an interest in this film but, for the unindoctrinated, this adult fantasy trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien chronicles a group of travelers which includes a wizard, two men, a dwarf, an elf, and four hobbits, ergo: ""The Fellowship"". They are traveling because two evil wizards have joined forces to eventually conquer and enslave all inhabitants of Middle Earth. At the behest of these dark and nefarious sorcerers are orcs, trolls, wargs, and other heinous minions.

One of the hobbits [Frodo Baggins] has inherited a magic ring from an aged relative [Bilbo Baggins, of *The Hobbit* fame, a fantasy written by Tolkien for young people] and it soon becomes clear that this is The One Ring which rules all other magic rings of power. It was created by The Dark Lord [Sauron, the more powerful of the two evil wizards] but it was inadvertently lost for many years. As The Ring [which can render one invisible, with certain negative caveats] ultimately ends up in the hands of Frodo, it becomes his quest (along with the rest of The Fellowship) to destroy the ring at Mount Doom, a huge volcano which lies within Sauron's sinister and well-patrolled realm of Mordor.

In *The Fellowship of the Ring* the viewer only gets to watch so far as the initial segment of the quest culminates in a partial dissolution of The Fellowship - it's at this point that the film concludes; however, one is not left altogether hanging - there is a sort of conclusion to the film.

Director Peter Jackson, the cast, and the crew got ever better as they produced the three films. Jackson sort of viewed his task as making one long film, thus the scenes were not shot in sequence, quite typical of film-making, but noting also that most films are not nine hours in length. My point is, even though sequences from all three films were shot fairly early on, it was chiefly the first movie that they had to get out of the way since a release deadline was looming on the horizon. Naturally, many changes were adopted within the scripts of all three films as time rolled along... and thus each movie clearly became better than its predecessor.

I think that most of the *MAGIC* of this film trilogy came from Jackson's inclusion of multiple technologies and special effects techniques - he did not wholly depend upon Computer Generated Images but when he did they were effected in post-production with perfection. Additional film magic was manifested through Howard Shore's magnificent filmscore for the trilogy. Of course the Special Extended Editions contain much more original music than the theatrical versions and it's all a great joy to the ear, including the gloom and doom facets of the three soundtracks. They are available as three individual sets:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-Of-The-Rings-Fellowship-Of-The-Ring-The-Complete-Recordings/dp/B000BNI90O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring (The Complete Recordings)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-Of-The-Rings-The-Two-Towers-The-Complete-Recordings/dp/B000IZJZIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (The Complete Recordings)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Return-of-the-King-The-Complete-Recordings/dp/B000V6BE6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (The Complete Recordings)</a>.

Perhaps the most important facet of my review is to encourage you to not bother with watching the theatrical versions of these films on DVD, and this is especially applicable if you've never read Tolkien's books. The theatrical versions are very good but they were meant more for theaters to collect from patrons for two showings per evening rather than to convey the details of Tolkien's complex story. The Special Extended Editions are perfectly edited to be both impressive and informative but they are never boring.

*The Fellowship of the Ring* provides us with a brief history of The One Ring of Power; an explanation of the need to destroy The Ring; the perilous flight of the four hobbits; The Council of Elrond, held within the safety of the realm of the Rivendell elves where decisions are made about the proposed quest; the commencement of this crusade of sorts, and; all the dangers and hazards which befall the Fellowship during this period. I mention all this to point out that the story is primarily a linear one where the viewer isn't bothered much with side trips or sub-plots. This aspect of the overall tale shifts radically over the course of the next two films, subsequent to the breaking up of The Fellowship.

Every facet of this film manifests the cutting edge of every aspect of film-making, from the technology, even extending to the acting [and motion capture] of Andy Serkis who plays the creature Gollum. We get to experience a broad range of acting styles from Orlando Bloom (who was cast for the role of the elf Legolis fresh out of acting school) to the venerable Christopher Lee [Saruman] who has made more films than anyone else that I'm aware of. To a person, all were magnificent in their perfectly cast roles.

This is probably a good juncture to detail what one gets in this boxed-set edition. There are two DVDs which make up the film and there are *multiple* sound tracks which can be brought up on each of these, depending upon whether you wish to watch the films themselves or listen to various available commentary tracks [for example, a track of cast member running remarks as the film progresses]. Two more DVDs make up the total of four: these are the appendices which beautifully depict exactly how this film was made, cast and crew interviews, details of the musical score, and so on. All this lasts for at least as long as would the film itself and it's all quite fascinating and well-done. Finally, the set comes with a small pamphlet inside which is a sort of map of what to look for on the DVDs and where.

I can hardly convey an adequate number of positive comments about this film except to say that the subsequent two movies [*The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King*] are even better! I won't say that this is the best film I've ever seen but I can honestly comment that I've never enjoyed any films *more* than those included in this Special Extended Edition trilogy.

Highly recommended.",1290211200,,6894,5.2355072463768115

The entire story line is incredible along with the fantastic special effects, computer graphic imaging, acting, and especially, the characters. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in sci-fi/fantasy. It is truly an escape from reality to visit another world filled with peril and treachery attached with adventure. If you like movies such as ""Avatar"" and ""Star Wars"" you will most certainly enjoy this movie. This movie is approximately 3 1/2 to 4 hours long, but there is never a dull moment as the storyline builds, and better yet it sets the stage for the next two upcoming films known as ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"". A quick tip for everyone; to enhance your enjoyment of the film it is best if you possibly have read the books initially then you will appreciate the film in lots of ways. Please be sure to read ""The Hobbit"" aka ""There and Back Again"". The Hobbit is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Even if you have not read any of the books I still recommend this film for anyone to view to enjoy such creativity from the mind of J.R.R.

Not the case here.

There are so many extra, and I should add, valuable scenes that have been added, and the only reason that I can come up with as to why they were cut to begin with is that the length of the movie would have been daunting to sit through in a theater.

Earlier this year, I was at Walmart with a bit of money, and was looking for a few movies to buy, I couldn't find nothing else, so I decided to give these a try, since they had all 3 films there, and wow, I am so glad I did as these 3 movies are just 3 of the best ever to be put on film, everything from the acting, to the effects, to the music and most of all, the directing are simply divine.

Believe me it is a nice surprise to see 3 modern films that are really great, I just finished watching 'The Return of the King' and of course after watching 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers' it left me in awe at the end, I couldn't believe the journey I had just taken part of, these for SURE lived up to all the hype they received AND THEN SOME.

By the way, I have never read the books, but now since I've seen these masterpieces, I am going to get the books, and I'm not much of a reader, but something like this, I will for sure read.

So there it is, I loved these films so much I had to put my 2 cents in, and there you have it, if you're into any kind of magic (like me being into the trading card game Magic: The Gathering) YOU MUST, watch these movies, even if you're not into fantasy like this, I urge you to watch them, because after you watch these, I'm sure your view on this type of fantasy will change.",1282953600,5,1685,3.91812865497076

1311104,5,B00003CWT6,"In 2001, one of the most anticipated movies in history came into theatres: ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy novel.

Since it was created by a talented but weird director who specialized in humorous splatter-horror, and based on a book that had never been successfully adapted even in part, no one was entirely sure whether it would bomb or succeed. But Peter Jackson's adaptation of the first of the ""Lord of the Rings"" novels is a sublime cinematic experience, rich with detail, powerful in its acting, and expansively bringing Tolkien's world to life.

When hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) leaves the Shire, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) convinces him to leave his treasured magical Ring, which confers invisibility to its wearer, to his young cousin Frodo (Elijah Wood). Gandalf soon confirms that the Ring is the evil One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, and tells the frightened Frodo to leave the Shire as soon as possible -- especially since nine dark riders are searching for someone by the name of Baggins.

Frodo, his faithful gardener Sam (Sean Astin) and his two mischievous cousins (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) quickly travel to meet with a strange ranger, and stumble into more dangers as they make for the Elven haven of Rivendell. But Frodo's journey is not over yet -- when he and a band of hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves and a wizard all volunteer to take the Ring to the only place where it can be destroyed: Mount Doom, in the heart of Sauron's domain Mordor.

For a long time, a convincing ""Lord of the Rings"" movie could not be made -- not just because of special effects and money, but because it is so difficult to translate Tolkien's work into something watchable. Goofy scripting, bad special effects, mutilated characters -- there was just so much that could go wrong. The ultimate triumph of Jackson's movie is that it is a high fantasy story with all the usual tropes -- a king in waiting, an unlikely hero, a dark lord -- which can be taken very seriously.

And Jackson and Co. outdid themselves with nearly every aspect of the films. They translated Tolkien's erudite prose into solid, poetic dialogue, with lots of humor and horror, romance and taut action. And it all takes place in the New Zealand landscapes, with lots of misty forests, towering mountains and charming rural villages. And Jackson takes full advantage of these, with his trademarked swooping shots that sweep past like a hawk, and wild camerawork for fight scenes (which are delightfully gory, especially where orcs are involved).

But the setting alone doesn't make a good movie, which is where Jackson's WETA Workshops came in. Sets range from the sturdy English hobbit towns to the airy elven tree-houses; and the special effects are almost shockingly realistic, including a rampaging cave troll, and a glimpse of the gruesome Gollum.

Elijah Wood is outstanding as Frodo Baggins. He runs the emotional gamut: fear, pain, horror, happiness, resignation, love and loneliness -- while Frodo is a bit too wimpy at times (dropping his sword?), he's ultimately a likable everyman hero caught up in terrifying circumstances. Sean Astin is equally good as the steadfast Sam, who is amazed by the world outside the Shire and determined to keep his best friend safe. And there's some comic relief comes with Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, as Frodo's loyal, chipper cousins who come along on a mission they don't fully understand.

But as lovable as the hobbits are, they do not dominate all of the screen: Ian McKellen is perfect as the grandfatherly wizard Gandalf, as is Viggo Mortensen as the mysterious, darkly grubby Ranger who has a hidden destiny. There's also Orlando Bloom as the acrobatic elven archer, John Rhys-Davies as a robust R-rolling dwarf, ominous movie veteran Christopher Lee as a malevolent wizard, as well as Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, and especially Sean Bean as the tormented Boromir, a warrior who desperately wants to use the Ring to save his home city.

Sublimely directed and powerfully written, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a true modern classic -- and it's merely the first part of this epic trilogy. Just be sure to have ""The Two Towers"" on hand.",1277596800,4,4287,4.893939393939394

1311176,5,B00003CWT6,"When I saw ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" the first time in a movie theatre, I was thrilled by the special effects, and the interplay between these and the dramatic sceneries of wild nature. However, by the time the Balrog appeared, I also felt a certain ""monster fatigue"". Still, I was sufficiently hooked to read Tolkien's actual novels, something everyone in Sweden does already as a kid - everyone but me, that is!

Reading the LOTR novels does explain a thing or two. While most of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" seems to be written for children, the sequals ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" are obviously directed at an adult audience.

This must have created serious trouble for Peter Jackson, who decided to solve the discrepancy by turning the movie version of ""The Fellowship"" into something more darker and more dramatic. In my opinion, this actually improved the original story! Thus, we are not forced to endure (in a movie for adults) how Gollum and Bilbo play a childish game of riddles, how Sam constantly wants to see the romantic elves, and how Frodo and Sam meets Tom Bombadil.

Yet, it also creates the ""monster fatigue"" problem: despite the great special effects and the suspense, I nevertheless felt a certain amount of tedium when the Balrog showed itself. Larger and larger monsters, all the time...

Despite this, and despite not really being a Tolkien fan, I nevertheless give ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" five stars. I found the hobbits convincingly comical and innocent. They really have no idea what they are getting themselves into, do they?

The ringwraiths are just as ghostly and ghouslih as I imagined them to be (I found them less scary in the actual novel, ironically). The elves look convincingly elvish and immortal, the orchs are suitably deformed and evil, and Saruman is the perfect crook. And yes, he is starred by Tolkien's biggest fan, Sir Christopher Lee, who apparently knelt before the old man the only time they ever met. Unsurprisingly, Lee is the only actor with a perfect Tolkienesque pronunciation! Frodo's bizarre visions when he accidentally puts on the ring add spice to the dish, as does the suspense ending with Gandalf being apparently killed by the Balrog.

Yes, this is how I imagine LOTR to look like. Or at least want it to look like...",1271635200,,2307,4.813131313131313

1311227,5,B00003CWT6,"As a life-long fan of Tolkien's work, I am not exactly unbiased.  However, this is a review of the Jackson film, so...
The film is not perfect.  I am not a big fan of the changes Jackson made in the story -- the sub-plot with Elrond and Arwen that was not in the book and the absence of the Scourging of the Shire story.  Nevertheless, overall the movie captures the essence of Tolkien's tale with brilliance.  Jackson's settings, costumes, cinematography, the acting, casting, directing, all were exquisite, to me.  Most old-time Tolkien fans I know have long held mental images of how they thought the story might look visually.  Nearly every one of these whom I have asked agree that the Jackson film matches their images nearly perfectly.  We got the movie we wanted and then some.  After many fits and starts over the decades, Tolkien's genius is finally done justice on film.

Normally I'd review the theatrical releases but I never got those and I can't really remember what wasn't in there before I bought this after I saw it theatres. The cast captures the characters perfectly, especially my favorite Christopher Lee, whose character, Saruman, doesn't feature in the first book at all (though I may be wrong, its been awhile since I read it). He tries to be friendly towards Gandalf (the part he orginally tried out for) and persuade him to join his cause but that ulitimately backfires and switches into evil, which the man plays very well. Elijah Wood plays Frodo innocent in the world at large and near the end, very mistrusting of the rest of the Fellowship, even Sam. The extended version captures the book better than what the theatrical release could (time constraints being the main problem) and I'm still very glad they didn't try to adapt the whole book as I'd probably still be in theatres now watching the second movie. There's just too many things that slow down the flow of the book and Peter Jackson trims at the fat and makes the story focus on Frodo and his journey and not the many side-trips he made like; Tom Bombadil (though a cherished character by fans I'm sure, his inclusion would've slowed the film down as the Hobbits spend quite some time with him even before they get to Bree) and I think there was an attack on the Fellowship by some wolves but then again, its been awhile since I read them. The action scenes, especially the swordsmanship I must point out, is some of the best I've seen next to the swordplay in Star Wars. The effects are also top notch, both special visual, the Balrog, the cave troll and the opening scene with the thousands of warriors imparticular. The make-up department, something I hardly ever comment on in my reviews, I must make a point to congratulate. It must've been painstaking to come up with so many different looks for the Orcs and Uruk-Hai. Howard Shore's score is one of my favorites, the Fellowship theme being fantastic and stirs a feeling of heroics within me (pretty much the same effect the Superman and Batman's themes make me feel).",1256256000,,2199,4.641025641025641

Frodo Baggins adores his uncle and is one of the few hobbits that has that wanderlust adventure.  Why hang out in The Shire when you can fight dragons and cavort with elves and dwarves?

But he gets more than he bargains for.  Frodo's uncle Bilbo (in The Hobbit, a soon to be made prequel) found the Ring of Power.  We're quickly escorted through the mythology of how the rings were made, what they're about, and how it snared men and Gollum to now want its return to Sauron of Mordor.

I know that Tolkein had a way with words in these books.  They were almost like a Victorian adventure that you happened to run into various things and peoples on your way to some goal.  Peter Jackson cut out the poetry and a few ghosts and trolls, notably Tom Bombadill, and created a rich fabric of special effects, characterization, friendship and loyalty.  And that friendship comes at a cost that will keep you riveted to the screen.

(This ""review"" is more a comment on film adaptations. Last paragraph I give praise)
I was disappointed last night with a movie. I saw the 6th installment in the Harry Potter series. It reminded me of the LOTR, for obvious reasons. First, it has wizards, magic, etc. And secondly both film series are adaptations of famous fantasy books. However, in the case of LOTR, something truly 'magical' and mysterious happened -- they somehow managed to do faithful adaptations and the movies didn't suck! _It can be done and Lord of the Rings proved it._ This is what stands out to me. Now I love some films that were simply based or inspired by a book- Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" come to mind. So I'm cool with not being faithful to books -in some cases- but I'm cool with it because those movies are fantastic. Nothing is worse then a movie that A) isn't a good, faithful adaptation (so lets down fans of the book) and B) isn't an entertaining, well crafted film.

I enjoyed each movie, but I guess Fellowship is my favorite. I like the beginning of the quest and being introduced for the first time to the characters and world they inhabit. Goes without saying the film was perfectly cast, the special effects with generous use of models are excellent -an absolute favorite of mine are the dwarf caves-, the soundtrack is just right. As for the wizards, special mention must be made to Sir Christopher Lee and Sir Ian McKellen (Hell why not mention their titles).",1248048000,,1840,4.473214285714286

I see that the main idea of the plot is followed correctly and some stunning visual effects are used, including pieces in the movie that you don't find out in the book without extensive reading and study... That said I miss the first time the character Sam meets elves (on their way from Hobbiton to Buckland) and I also would have loved to see the feature in the book of Tom Bombadil and the Old Forest with moving trees and the great giant old tree which tries to crush Merry and Pippin in that area. The Barrow Downs and the Barrow Wights animation was sorely missed also... but the general overall theme of the movie hed together very well, and it lead perfectly into the rest of the trilogy in which if Peter would have included all the details of the book, would have put all of the audience asleep.

I recently finished re-reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and broke this out to extend the experience.  This also gave me a chance to compare the film to the books.  Although some things puzzled me (like Aragorn's brief disappearance, or the decision to make the elves join the fight at Helms Deep), and some things I missed (like the barrow-wrights), I don't have the slightest quibble with Mr. Jackson's work.

1311377,5,B00003CWT6,"Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.

Now, years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films mulitple times each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best, and the version to have is the DVD Extended Version.  It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film. The sequels were good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts.

Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.

The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes.

1311466,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is a good representation of Tolkien's original work, but it is also a very well-made movie.  Just like Tolkien's book, The Lord of the Rings, has long been the standard to which most fantasy books are compared, I believe fantasy movies will be held against the movie trilogy for many years to come.  (Be aware that this review may contain some SPOILERS).

One of the biggest criticisms I see about the movie is some of the changes made from the book.  Yes, there is much more in Tolkien's book than is in the movie, but can it really be helped?  For the most part the movie stays very faithful to the book.  Yes, parts were left out (like the character of Tom Bombadil), but most of this was done so the immense work could fit into a movie.  And even with the abridgement, the movie is still over three hours long.  I caution audiences to keep an open mind and not think everything has to exactly match the book.  It's okay to like them both.

Here are all the good things about the movie:

The cinematography is completely AMAZING.  The locations were totally believable.  I was awestruck by the beauty of Middle-Earth when I saw it on screen for the first time.

The special effects were incredible.  Jackson and his crew went back to many of the techniques we have come to know as ""movie magic"".  In most movies nowadays, computer-animated graphics seem so overused, but in Fellowship of the Ring it appeared to only be used as a last resort.  (It was done very well, too.  In watching some of the special features, I saw a couple effects that I would never have known were computer animated without it being pointed out to me).

The music in the movie is a richly colored tapestry interwoven into the movie.  Howard Shore was able to create and convey many different moods and emotions with the score.

The sets, costumes, weapons, and props are all masterfully designed.  They are believable, graceful, and beautiful.

The writing and acting are both fantastic.  While the filming of the movie is great, they did not sacrifice writing for special effects.  The dialogue in Fellowship of the Ring is very poetic and intelligent (yes, there is a movie out there with intelligent writing).  And believe it or not, I didn't hear a single profane word spoken in the entire 3-hour-long movie.

The DVD has several hours of special features that are as entertaining as they are informative.  I think audiences will be fascinated in seeing some of the processes involved in making The Fellowship of the Ring.

If you want to discover an immense and beautiful world you have never seen before, I recommend this movie to you.",1228089600,,2677,4.636170212765958

1311468,3,B00003CWT6,"Why 3 stars? Pretty much everyone else seems to adore this film. And why not. It's visually beautiful, the cinematography is lush and necessarily pastoral, the music does a very good job of enabling the visual aspects of the film. So why 3 stars?

1) Peter Jackson is obviously a giant kid with toys. He's got a wonderful imagination and assembled a nearly great team of pre-pro, production, and post pro artists. But the man cannot direct to save his life. Everything is pretty much either a distance or 'long' shot in which effects and the input of at least tens if not hundreds of people went into them; these are indeed amazing and beautiful. But then, good old PJ's gotta ram the camera up the nose of all the actors in close-up after close-up as if this will convey to the audience a sense of character dynamic and develop a relationship with that character through close-up. Where are the medium shots, the shots that tie in those long shots and those close-ups? I see very few of them and by not having them, the film is not done the justice that it should have had.

2) Editing. Now, the editing does get decidely better in film's 2 and 3, but Fellowship is pretty much one big editing mess. The pacing in many of the scenes feels rushed and unbalanced. Examples: 1) The opening scene with Frodo and Gandalf; there is no linger, no friendly invite in the way that the editor(s) chose the shots. This perhaps can be partly due to the effects and the separation/distance effects in order to make Elijah Woods appear much smaller than McKellan. 2) The dark rider entering the Shire. Horse and rider enters frame and we cut 1 to 2 seconds shy of where the natural beat feels it should be. Of course, the music keeps up so it has the appearance of being natural, but the intuitive flow is just not there. 3) The dark riders being swept down by the river when Arwen summons the water. Again, the climax of the moment is abruptly taken away from us. After all, these Ringwraiths have been the main antagonists for the better part of 1.5 hours. Even just another second or two does the trick. This 'minimalist' editing goes on and on throughout the film and as a cummulative effect it starts to takes its toll on the picture. This opinion of the editing of FOTR is not just my own (as an editor) but is held by many editors that I know as pretty close to the same view.

3) Frodo is a wimp. I said it, Frodo pusses out, whines, and does a great deal too much crying. Where's my tough little hero who shines on the ringwraiths at the Ford? Where's the stalwart heart who confronts the ringwraiths at the lookout point? Not here.

4) The prologue. This feels like some sort of a big studio exec decision, 'we need some action cause we don't have any for almost 2 hours', or 'the story is so complex lets give it all away to our stupid audience so they don't really have to think at all or remember much.' However, it seems that PJ was the advocate of this prologue. Placing this prologue or much of that information in its rightful place at the Council of Elrond makes for a much more visual sequence.

5) Isildur is a doosh, and he is one right from the get-go. I had heard of the sequence they were going to shoot in which the Elf King (can't remember his name) and the Human King, Elendil were going to charge the near impervious Sauron, basically sacrificing themselves and that Isildur was going to attack Sauron. When Isildur slices off Sauron's arm the power shatters the kingly sword. There was a little more to the sequence but I got goosebumps from reading it, and then we're given a watered down, Isildur's a doosh/Sauron's a turd sequence.

6) Frodo dies forever. Considering that in the next film, The Two Towers, the writers can't think of another way to get Aragorn to see the 10,000 Uruk'hai except by 'fake' killing him off so he becomes separated from the rest of the group, and since Gandalf is also going to be 'fake' killed off towards the final third of this film, Frodo's 'fake' death, in super slow-mo is just too much 'fake' death for me to take. Make the moment stand out, sure, but don't make it last a ""life-age.""

7) Thousands of little Moria orcs have our brave fellowship surrounded, imminent death, and then the Balrog saves the day scattering a sure skewering crowd of would-be Moria orcs. Stupid, lame... how about make the entire sequence a chase in which our brave fellows are battling to the last, appearing to hold out against all odds in ever confined quarters as they start to descend narrow stairs, and THEN the Balrog makes his first appearance and crushes all hope of which even Gandalf is terrified of.

8) PJ can't direct action (at least in this film). When I first saw the cave-troll battle sequence online way back in mid-2001 I was somewhat excited. However, with it came the caveat that PJ better school the audience on how to direct action, each sequence getting its own flavour. And this 'hand-held' shaky-cam stuff, while having its obvious place in the frenetic close-quarter combat of the tomb sequence, doesn't really need to be used any more than that as there are countless other techniques to direct and edit said action. Nope. We get pretty much the same shaky-cam stuff for every action, confrontation sequence. Not as bad as say Bourne Supremacy or Ultimatum, but still lacking in the diversity that the various action sequences potentially calls for.

I could go and on and the films do get better but even with all the fanatic love put into the making of these films and I have no doubt that this is the best rendition of Tolkien's work that we'll ever see, I still feel that this first film only really deserves 3-stars. It should have been better than what was finally shown to us. Other people obviously adore this film and I'm very pleased for them. I just saw too many flaws where there was no need for such. All the pieces are there; at times the editing is flawless, at times the action directing/editing sings perfectly, at times Elijah is everything Frodo reads on the page, at times, at times... so why not all the time?",1225238400,3,6093,4.511775362318841
1311469,5,B00003CWT6,"This trilogy is fantastic. Jackson captured the awe, the wonder, and the homesickness for the Shire in this movie. The deviations from the books are very understandable. I have small quibbles, but the on the whole this is a fantastic retelling of the story. The most amazing accomplishment to me is the sets. Hobbiton, Rivendell, Mordor and Lothlorien are amazing. They are brilliantly realized on the screen.

I watched the extended version and the inclusions were very good. There was more singing, more background in Hobbiton, and it just gave the movie more of the feel of the books. The extra half an hour or so was well worth the time.

My only complaint is the conversations are hard to understand. Sometimes the background music is so loud it overrides it. Sometimes they talk in whispers. I might have to play with the settings, but we had it set to movie and we didn't have problems with other movies.

In summary, this DVD is well worth owning. Even if you saw it several times in the theaters and can quote all the characters, the extended scenes make it well worth the price.",1225152000,,1088,4.65625
1311470,4,B00003CWT6,"I'm an avid reader. I've read a variety of books, from epic fantasy to non-fiction, from contemporary fiction to classic literature. Don't flame me because of this, but I haven't read the first two books of ""The Lord of the Rings"". I've read SOME parts of ""Fellowship"" and ""Towers,"" and I DID read ""The Return of the King,"" but I'm mildly disappointed at myself for not reading the books before the movies came out. But anyway, I can see the differences betwen this film and the book: Tom Bombadil is absent in the film, the Moria sequence is much longer in the book, all of the events in Isengard are told during the council of Elrond in the book, etc.

I haven't seen this film for a very long time (probably back in 2005 was the last time I saw ""Fellowship""). After that, I read ""The Wheel of Time,"" ""The Farsser Trilogy,"" ""Don Quixote,"" ""The Kalevala,"" ""The Ramayana,"" and other books that contained lots of fantasy. I've also read contemporary works like ""House of Sand and Fog,"" ""The Feast of Love,"" ""The Ha-Ha,"" etc. Anyway, after reading all these books, I had a bit less admiration for ""The Lord of the Rings,"" mainly because it was starting to become cliqued (I know Tolkien put some originality in his own elves and dwarves, but I've seen too many elves and dwarves elsewhere). And plus, I got into Wagner's ""Ring Cycle,"" and being the avid ""Ring"" listener that I am, the 15-hour opera replaced ""Lord of the Rings"" as my new favorite epic. But then, just last night, I watched the movie again. And now, I can see it as a classic again. It has given me even more inspiration to become a novelist in the fantasy genre.

*  *  *  *

I saw the Extended Version after the original Theatrical Version. Many of the new scenes felt like they were ""just inserted in."" But later on, I can no longer see the weird cuts because the last time I saw the Theatrical Version was back in 2003. Until then, the Extended Version was the one I saw from now on. I got to understand Tolkien's universe much more.

Peter Jackson has done an extraordinary job with Tolkien's ""Fellowship"". He's brought so much famous material into this 200-minute film. The way he moved from the Fleeing from the Ringwraiths to the Journey to Mordor is just outstanding. And he chose the right actors and crew for this grand-scale epic.

Peter Jackson may not have been completely been faithful to the book, but you have to understand that in order to put it in ""movie"" format, some things had to be changed. Some sequences have been omitted for the sake of time, and it may or may not be a good thing to other people. Personally, it works well as a movie, but if I'm in the modd for the complete epic, I'll read the books anytime.

For the actors, I was a bit skeptical about Elijah Wood playing Frodo Baggins, and I stil find him to be a bit annoying. But he still makes a believeable Frodo, and I don't know anyone ese who can play the part. Ian McKellen is the perfect Gandalf: he has the voice and the appearance down flawlessly (kudos to the makeup and costume department). Christopher Lee is a brilliant Saruman, a character everyone loves to hate. Sean Austin, Billy Boyd, and Dominic Monaghan are excellent hobbits (although I find Austin's mediocre accent a bit distracting). Kate Blanchett will always be the definitive Galadriel. Gimli is right: she's absolutely gorgeous. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn gives one hell of a kick-@$$ performance: his swordfighting is amazing. And so does Orlando Bloom (as Legolas) with his bow and arrows. Fangirls have absolutely glomped the elf, and I don't really mind. I never expected John Rhys-Davies to play Gimli, but he is great for the role. Too many closeups of Liv Tyler's face (in all three movies) brings down one grade for Arwen: it's a B. Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, and Sean Bean as Elrond, Bilbo Baggins, and Boromir absolutely steal the show sometimes; great actors, all of them are.

The script is at times melodramatic, but that's what to be expected in epic fantasy (kudos to Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Peter Jackson). The camerawork, costume/set designs, and CGI effects are incredible. The beautiful scenery makes me want to go out and visit not just New Zealand, but the many national parks here in the United States.

Finally, we come to the music. To me, it's almost similar to that of Wagner's ""Ring Cycle,"" but not completely. I'm not sure if Howard Shore got most of his inspiration from Wagner, but he sure did a damn good job with the score. The musical themes range from objects (""The One Ring"") to characters (""Arwen""), to locations (""Lothlorien""), to motives (""Orc Industry""). I like him better than John Williams at the moment.

Overall, reading books both inside and outside the fantasy genre has affected my overall perception of LOTR. I can see the formulaic plot that's found in other fantasy novels (some authors put something new and others don't). I can see the two-dimensional characters (""The Wheel of Time"" has plenty of that). I can see the basic plot of good versus evil (I should read ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" soon). But I still like LOTR, because it's the first popular epic fantasy that every one has grown up on (""The Odyssey"" and ""The Kalevala"" don't seemto count just yet). And I'll still keep watching it.

Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Giml, and Boromir set out to Mordor to take it back to the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it once and for all! And it takes 3 movies to do that!

1311537,4,B00003CWT6,"This review refers to the version seen in the cinema and NOT the extended edition, which as we know makes a HUGE difference: most of my criticisms fell away after having seen the extended edition, but the movie I'm reviewing is the one Jackson offered us in the cinema, so that's what I'll go with:

Let me start by saying that I liked the movie a lot, though it has some quirks I was having problems with while sitting in the cinema at the time. The prologue was pure genius and really made me excited for what was to come.

I loved the Shire sequences and the whole cast was brilliant, with a standout in McKellen as Gandalf, which wasn't a surprise looking at his body of work until then. The problems start after that: the Nazgul were ok, but scary? Not really. The arrival in Bree, even though I knew the Bombadil and Barrows chapters had been skipped, still hit me as rushed. Pippin's and Merry's motives to accompany Sam and Frodo were not mentioned, they just do. The introduction of Aragorn was handled well and Vigo Mortensen immediately felt right for the part. Gandalf's duel with Saruman (who was magnificently performed by Christopher Lee) was rather ridiculous looking, as if they were in a break-dance contest. Orthanc itself however looked fantastic.

The scene on Weathertop didn't convince in the sense of Aragorn taking on no less than 5 Nazgul only armed with a sword and torch, while all other fellowship members look on helplessly. It very much reduces the level of threat you perceive coming from the Nazgul, if one guy, all be it an extraordinary guy, can hold off five of them.

I'm not a fan of Liv Tyler as Arwen; I thought her character was uninteresting and way too sweet, too American, though I must admit I never liked her character in the book either and much preferred Eowyn (always thought Aragorn married the wrong woman), so I'm not sure to what extend my dislike stems from Liv Tyler's performance. Replacing Glorfindel with her in this movie was no problem for me. Again not convincing how she could escape all nine Nazgul. Let me put it this way: I wasn't very impressed with these Nazgul and had I been Sauron I would have fired them (probably literally) on the spot.

The weakest part of the movie I considered the Rivendell scenes: The scenery was spectacular, but the buildings seemed as if they were designed by former residents of Bavaria, Germany, very fake. I couldn't take Hugo Weaving as Elrond seriously even for a second, as he looked and talked (intonation wise) exactly as in his role as Agent Smith in The Matrix, which was a letdown as I know the man can act; when the fellowship left I expected him to say ""Goodbye, Mr. Baggins"", in that voice we all know. The reunion of Frodo with his friends wasn't done very convincing and especially the one with Bilbo was very weak; Ian Holm was overacting as if his life depended on it and the effect of his face changing monstrously as he sees the ring caused the whole audience to laugh out loud in the cinema I was at (all three times I went to see the movie). The Council of Elrond was done very hastily and left no impression. The reforging of Anduril being omitted felt unforgivable at the time (I obviously didn't know at the time it was only suspended until the third movie), as we all know it's crucial and symbolic for Aragorn's part and place within the story.

Caradhras was handled brilliantly, great acting from Sean Bean, when he holds the ring; it even improved on the book I thought.

Moria in one word was breathtaking. Fantastic from the first until last minute. Visually very impressive and the Balrog very much exceeded my expectations. Only false note was Gimli's weeping at the tomb of Balin, which was badly acted, as  Rhys-Davies in general was one of the weaker links in the cast. The Orthanc scenes and creation of the Uruk-Hai was great and didn't distract me from the main story.

Lothlorien was done wonderfully and Cate Blanchet, as opposed to Liv Tyler, was completely convincing as Galadriel. A shame the fellowship only stayed there for such a short time in the movie, but well, that to me was the main problem with the movie anyway: At times you feel like a tourist traveling in a bus on a trip called ""See Middle Earth in three hours"" with ""... and there on your right is the Shire, oh and on your left you see Bree appearing and in ten minutes times we'll drive into Rivendell..."". This of course is one of the problems of turning this book into a movie; it's almost impossible to take the time to really breathe in this world and the people and creatures that live there. We jump from one high mark to the next, creating the strange effect that this movie feels both rushed and too slow at the same time. Rushed for the reasons mentioned above and too slow as three hours do leave their mark and by the end of it my legs were cramping up (not mentioning adding half an hour of commercials and previews).

Boromir's death was heartbreaking and brought tears to my eyes; top marks for Sean Bean; the most moving scene to me in the movie.

Summarizing: fantastic sets and scenery of New Zealand, which will likely have seen its flow of tourists quadruple after this movie. Just Rivendell's architecture didn't convince me. The acting in general was good to outstanding, with the exceptions of Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom (Legolas, though I loved his action sequences). Too little time for character exposition. The fellowship never felt as a unit to me and they've hardly come together before they split up again; you never really feel the connection between them. Howard Shore's music is fantastic, a bit too much in the background even at times, but this could have been due to the sound system in the cinema I was at as well as me at times really turning op the soundtrack in my home.

It may appear that I didn't enjoy the movie, but it was quite the contrary and I did go and see it in the cinema multiple times, which the movie can stand easily as there is so much to take in.
I have the greatest respect for Peter Jackson, who realized the hereto deemed impossible, bringing this movie to the screen in all its mind boggling complexity, artistically and logistically and was very brave to take such a huge risk.

As I said at the beginning of the review: these were my first impressions after I saw the movie in the cinema. The extended edition we got subsequently improved the movie to no end in my viewer experience.",1215734400,,6475,4.552405498281787

1311540,5,B00003CWT6,"Having been only introduced to the world of Tolkien about 2 years ago (through The Hobbit) I'm sure you would either call me clinically insane or very passionate, since I have in that short time seen each of these three films 17 times and read the books 4 times each. That's because the story of The Lord of the Rings is one of the most beautiful and detailed stories I have ever come across.

Having read the books before seeing the (extended) films, I was naturally a little skeptical because most movies based on books are at best subpar to the quality of the original novel. Fortunately, these movies (particularly these Extended Editions) are the exception to the rule; Peter Jackson has successfully brought the beauty of Tolkien's writing to the silver screen. I am grateful that my first LOTR viewing experience was the EEs, rather than the theatrical editions, because so many scenes that are either crucial to the plot of the story or just special to the book's fans have been added back in. My personal favorite extended scene in Fellowship is Galadriel's gift-giving, as Sam's rope plays an important part later on in The Two Towers.

Could there be a more perfect beginning to this trilogy of films than `The Fellowship of the Ring'? The cast is excellent, the storyline faithful to the book, the soundtrack exquisite and the special effects unlike anything to come before it.

1311594,5,B00003CWT6,"It is really truly sad when Hollywood double and triple dips with their multitude of movie releases. First comes the theatrical version, then the 'special' edition. Then, after everyone has spent all of their money, out comes the special Extended Edition; the way the film was SUPPOSED to be, before it was tragically chopped to satisfy corporate suits and an attention deficit American crowd. In most cases the scenes cut from films are of no consequence and in essence really don't do much for the over all picture and feel, but in the case of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', the extra and extended scenes really flesh out the main characters and make the film that much more enjoyable. Especially if you are a fan of the film and the book...

Though still not an exact representation of the book, 'The Fellowship of The Ring' extended edition is an amazing masterpiece, a true landmark in film making. There is over 30 minutes of extra and extended material, all seamlessly integrated into the picture. No, Tom Bombadil is still MIA, and a couple of other things are still absent, but certain characters and situations are largely fleshed out and make much more sense. Where as in the theatrical version things were made short and chopped, the extended edition feels like a finished product, and it is very satisfying to see the new material. A great portion of the songs from the book are present, though I assume they were originally cleaved out to appease more to the general public (who may or may not enjoy song in their action/drama/fantasy film); they do very well to complete the atmosphere and mythology of Tolkien's world. The extra material pushes the film well over 3 hours, and spans across two discs.

Of course, no special edition would be complete without bucket loads of special features, and this edition delivers in spades. 2, count them, 2 discs of special features come with this wonderful edition, chock full of behind-the-scenes shorts, making of featurettes, commentary and a whole host of stuff that will surely please the die hard fan. All of this comes in a really cool box that resembles a leather-bound book.

Director Peter Jackson's gift of his extended version of 'The Fellowship of The Ring' is a true treat and easily makes the theatrical cut obsolete. I cannot stress enough how truly complete this film feels with the extra material. While I do not agree with 2 or 3 different versions of a film, I do feel that THIS version of 'The Fellowship of The Ring' is well worth a double or triple dip.

Now, if we can only get 'The Fellowship of The Ring' Extended Edition on Blu-Ray...",1205971200,,2616,4.742857142857143
1311595,5,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring is my favourite movie of all time, especially the extended version, which is superior to the original theatrical release in every added scene. What is most amazing is its deep human drama in midst of all the special effects and its setting in a fantastic fantasy world. Many of the principal characters are very well developed, especially Aragorn and Frodo, with great performances by Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood. Also great are Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee.

The movie's plot is leagues beyond any conventional action/adventure film. Its structure is perfect from start to finish. In my opinion, the movie is much better than either the The Two Towers or The Return of the King of the Trilogy (in spite of the latter having won 11 Oscars). Two-third's of Tolkien's inspiration in the Trilogy was put into this first third of the Trilogy (eg. the ring's power to deceive Boromir and his subsequent redemption, and the sacrifice of Gandalf for the fellowship). It seems Peter Jackson, the director, also put more effort in this installment than the later ones (except for a last burst of greatness in the last 45 minutes or so of the Return of the King). The other two installments were overlong in some parts, and had some glaring weak moments (such as Sam's overdone speech in the Two Towers, and Elrond's surprise visit with Aragorn in the Return of the King).

The soundtrack works very well with all of the visuals. The special effects are better than those of many more recent action movies (eg. Spiderman, Catwoman). The DTS sound in the extended version (as with the extended versions of the other two in the trilogy) is demonstration class. The sound editing is also great. The cinematography is outstanding. A movie for all ages. I'm never bored of it after having watched it many times.",1205193600,,1831,4.828025477707007
1311596,5,B00003CWT6,"Can I give it more than just five stars? I love this movie!

It starts in Hobbitown, where Frodo lives with his Uncle Bilbo, who is celebrating his 1st birthday. When Gandalf, who is Dumbledore's brother, comes to Hobbitown, he gives Frodo a ring as a gift.

As it turns out, the ring is really from Gollum, who wants it back now. Frodo, who is selfish, would rather throw it in an active volcano. He leaves Hobbitown with Samuel, Pippin' and Mary, who I think are his brothers.

As they travel, the get chased by some guys on horses who happen to want the ring, too. They go to Bree to squish the gate keeper.

In Bree, Frodo causes a brawl in the pub, and puts the ring on. The eye of Sawron comes, because he wants the ring, too.

When Frodo takes the ring off, a prince named Aragorn takes him into a room to hide from the horse guys.

Soon, Frodo and his brothers befriend Aragorn, who eventually abandons them on a hill with the horse guys before coming back to save them. Frodo gets stabbed by a Mortal Sword, and needs to be taken by Aragorn's old flame, Arwen, who is an elf, to her huge estate in the mountains.

In an epic chase, when Arwen is riding from the horse guys, she gets a cut on her face. I cried.

Arwen's dad calls a secret meeting of all the b-list actors he knows, which is a kind of audition. Nine of them, including a dwarf, an elf, and someone who didn't know Aragorn was a prince and also wants the ring, decide to take Frodo to Mt. Saint Helens, the only place that the ring can be destroyed.

When they try to travel through the snow, an evil witch named Saryoumon, who also wants the ring, calls a giant snowball to fall on their heads. Because of this, the fellowship (which is what they call all these guys) decides to go through the minds of Moria, which was Gimli's (the dwarf) old house.

When they go, they find the house destroyed, and all of Gimli's brothers and sisters have turned into corpses. Suddenly, a whole bunch of goblins and a cave troll, who I think wants the ring, try to kill everyone. But Legolas (the elf), who used to be a pirate, shoots the troll in the mouth, so it dies.

After Gandalf fights the devil, he falls into a big crack on the ground. Everyone is crying and screaming, until they wander into the forest and are captured by elves. These elves are really pretty, and the queen is really a metal monster that can yell at Frodo. But she doesn't want the ring.

When they finally leave, they all get presents, like bows, swords, candles and hair. Then they get attacked by Urik-Hi, who wants the ring, too. In the best battle of the movie, all the bad guys die, and so do one of the good guys.

Finally, Frodo leaves in a boat, trying to escape from the bad guys. One of his brothers, Sam, comes to the boat. He drowns, and then Frodo pulls him into the boat. Together, they sail towards the volcano.

The movie definitely leaves it open for a sequel. I hope they make one! I'll be the first in line to see it.",1205107200,,2976,4.244247787610619
1311597,5,B00003CWT6,"""The Lord of the Rings"" is nothing short of brilliance.  The story, the imagery, and the messages all convey honesty and realism, despite the fantasy elements.  As a long time fan of the entire trilogy and of course ""The Hobbit"", I was looking forward to the release of this first film for several years after hearing a rumor about its production.  Lucky enough to attend the midnight showing, I spent the entire three hours completely strapped to my seat, eyes glued to the screen and fingers gripping my chair.  The entire theater was silent, perplexed by the visual and emotional treat in front of them.  The joy, evil and pain felt by the characters was very real in such a sense that it seemed everyone was frightened for their lives as Frodo and his companions hid from their first encounter with a black rider.  I remember I'd felt like I'd held my breath for the entirety of the film.

To this day, the effect is no less intense.  There are folks whose taste in movies didn't usually include fantasy adventures, but they enjoy this anyway.  In some cases, they're converted entirely and become obsessed fans.

Peter Jackson's interpretation of what has become a classic is close to perfection.  The casting, dialogue, costumes, direction, and disposition of the film are exactly what they should have been.  Somehow, Peter and his crew crafted a masterpiece that translates every necessary element from book to screen with ease.  This movie (and both of its following chapters) is one of the very few films that continually affect the viewer despite how many times you might have seen it.  Even though you might know the story, you can't help but be captivated and amazed at the technical and artistic marvel it is.

As others have already so elegantly stated, the special effects are truly top notch and easily blow everything else out of the water.

1311598,1,B00003CWT6,"Perhaps one day someone will make a movie of Tolkien's  ""Lord of the Rings"". Mr. Jackson, if one takes the general outline of Hamlet and adds some random dialog from Othello, King Lear and Twelfth Night you have not presented a Shakespearian play, you've created a worthless abortion. Examples abound; from the needless destruction of Faramir's character  to the absence of Merry and Pippin as developed characters to the addition of gratuitous scenes and the absence of ""real"" and lovely ones; it all points to the absence of understanding of the value of the work. Almost none of the characters of the book are presented as written; while it looks like the books, it's really not Tolkien at all.
  Mr. Jackson, if you have the work of a master why not attempt to display it ?  Why bother if not to bring it to the screen ? Did you think your actors could not realize Faramir ?  Did you really feel your sense of pacing and your sense of the dramatic were superior to the author's ?  This is a study, in part, of indulgence in mere Hollywood sensibilities  of exaggeration and simplification. The geography was simple and so it was held to. The worth of the book was more complex and so abandoned.
  I've have seen the extended addition and it's as fundamentally worthless as the original releases. If you care about the books don't bother with the film and  keep the images you've created pure in your head.

1311669,5,B00003CWT6,"In 2001, one of the most anticipated movies ever came into theatres: ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy novel.

Since it was created by a talented but weird director (who specialized in cult horror) and based on a book that had never been successfully adapted even in part, no one was entirely sure whether it would bomb or succeed. Fortunately, ""Fellowship"" turned out to be smashing cinematic success -- both financially and artistically.

When hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) leaves the Shire, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) convinces him to leave his treasured magical Ring to his young cousin Frodo (Elijah Wood). Gandalf soon confirms that the Ring is the evil One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, and tells the frightened Frodo to leave the Shire as soon as possible -- especially since nine dark riders are searching for someone by the name of Baggins.

Frodo, his faithful gardener Sam (Sean Astin) and his two mischievous cousins (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) quickly travel to meet with a strange ranger, and stumble into more dangers as they make for the Elven haven of Rivendell. But Frodo's journey is not over yet -- when he and a band of hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves and a wizard all volunteer to take the Ring to the only place where it can be destroyed.

For a long time, a convincing ""Lord of the Rings"" movie could not be made -- not just because of special effects and money, but because it is so difficult to translate Tolkien's work into something watchable. Goofy scripting, bad special effects, mutilated characters -- there was just so much that could go wrong.

So it's even more of a credit to Jackson and Co. that they outdid themselves. They translated Tolkien's erudite prose into solid, poetic dialogue, with lots of humor and horror, romance and taut action. And it all takes place in the New Zealand landscapes, with lots of misty forests, towering mountains and charming rural villages. And Jackson takes full advantage of these, with his trademarked swooping shots, and wild camerawork for fight scenes.

But the setting alone doesn't make a good movie, which is where Jackson's WETA Workshops came in. Sets range from the sturdy English hobbit towns to the airy elven tree-houses; and the special effects are almost shockingly realistic, including a rampaging cave troll, and a glimpse of the gruesome Gollum. He's the first fully convincing CGI character, and you can forget he is made digitally.

Elijah Wood is outstanding as Frodo Baggins. He runs the emotional gamut: fear, pain, horror, happiness, resignation, love and loneliness. Sean Astin is equally good as the steadfast Sam, who is amazed by the world outside the Shire. And some comic relief comes with Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, as Frodo's loyal, chipper cousins.

1311670,5,B00003CWT6,"I won't bother to explain why I think this is the greatest movie ever made. Nor will I mention the special features, except to say that they too are the best special features ever added to a DVD. What I would like to explain is why the so-called ""extended edition"" is far superior to the theatrical version. (It is not extended at all; it is simply the movie as it should be seen. The cinematic version is ridiculously truncated by comparison.)

Here are 10 reasons:

1. The relationship between Boromir and Aragorn, which is absolutely central to the plot, is greatly fleshed out. We see them meeting and clashing, then trying to resolve their differences - which are due to Aragorn's sense of duty and Boromir's loyalty to his father - which makes their break and ultimate reconciliation, and thus the climax of the film, far more meaningful.

2. The same holds true for another significant relationship, between Gimli and Legolas. The traditional dislike between elves and dwarfs was not made clear at all in the theatrical version, nor were their personal difficulties. This has important implications for their growing friendship, for the harmony of the fellowship, and for Gimli's relationship with Galadriel.

3. The hobbits get a chance to act as hobbits before they become involved in the serious business of being a fellowship.

4. The prologue gives some detail about Isildur's role in the finding, keeping and losing of the ring, which is absolutely central to the story and to Aragorn's character.

5. Celeborn becomes a real character. He is the Lord of Lothlorien, a very wise and dignified elf, and it was very demeaning to reduce him to an almost silent cameo role.

6. We get to see the gifts of Galadriel and Celeborn, including the elven cloaks with their leaf brooches, lembas waybread, Frodo's phial, Sam's rope, Merry's and Pippin's daggers, Aragorn's short sword, and  Legolas's new bow - all of which become very significant at various points during the three film.

7. The Council of Elrond gets to look like a real Council.

8. Aragorn's background is explained more clearly, particularly with regard to his mother, his relationship with Elrond, and the way his ancestry and his destiny have always haunted him.

9. The significance of mithril is explained. This gives far more impact to the scene where Frodo is saved.

10. The geography of Lothlorien is a lot clearer.",1199577600,3,2397,4.891358024691358

1311672,5,B00003CWT6,"For the longest time, I kept myself a considerable distance from ""Lord of the Rings"". But then, very slowly, I started to become interested. Finally I was convinced to watch the first DVD--all the way, from the beginning to the end--just to see what I would think of it.

To my amazement, I loved it! It was awesome--a bit violent in some areas for my tastes, but still awesome! I fell in love with Frodo and Sam (I am now officially a fan of Elijah Wood, and a fan of Sean Astin), and I was also intrigued by Gandalf and Aragorn, and the overall plot was quite fascinating. Even the music was incredible.

As soon as the movie was over, I had an overwhelming urge to watch the other two movies. I've now seen ""The Two Towers"", and a little bit of ""Return of the King"", and I can't understand why I ever disliked the LOTR series in the first place.

I very highly recommend this DVD to anyone who's a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, and a fan of fantasy in general. The only negative thing I have to say is that some scenes may be a little too frightening for small children. But if you're over the age of 13, you'll really get a thrill out of this movie!

1311730,4,B00003CWT6,"I don't know how else to contact Amazon to correct a huge problem in regard to the LOTR films, but they BADLY need to separate the reviews on the various editions of these films (e.g., the widescreen, the full-screen, and the Special Extended Edition version).

The Special Extended Editions are BY FAR the superior choices for anyone wishing to watch these great films and they're well-worth the money, but a LOT of folks don't know about them. With the additional footage, the movies make infinitely more sense, especially to anyone who has never previously read the Trilogy. All three LOTRs films are available in this format, plus, each film is on two discs, due to the added footage. In addition to that, each one is presented in a nice cardboard case, has an informational booklet included, and offers two ADDITIONAL discs which are ""special features"" sort of information. This is essentially a ""collectors' edition"" but, as I have mentioned, the movie itself (for more casual viewers as well as for fans) greatly benefits from the additional film footage.

So, since once you've reviewed ANY version of LOTRs, one cannot review any other version (Amazon software sees this as a second review of the same product by the same person!), I am placing this information here to the prospective benefit of other Amazon customers (and victims!) *.*

Now, on to the story:

This is the first entry in the film-trilogy of The Lord of Rings. I'm rating each one separately to yield a more honest opinion of the entire series. I'm rating this one 4-stars, 'The Two Towers' 5-stars, and, 'The Return of the King' 4-stars.

This film-series is a fantasy, fairy-tale sort of movie-trilogy, to inform the uninitiated. This first of the three films tells of Frodo  Baggins, a Hobbit of the Shire, and his quest, (along with a 'fellowship' of comrades), to save Middle Earth by destroying the ancient Ring of Power, which is in his possession. He can only do this by traveling to the Land of Mordor (a VERY nasty place) and by tossing the ring into the fires of Mount Doom, whence the ring was originally forged by an evil wizard (who is still evil and still around, and who is seeking to locate his lost magical Ring of Power big-time).

In this entry, Frodo makes it as far as the realm of the elves (Elrond's place) and gets a good start on his quest, even though he is plagued along his journey with the 9 ring-wraiths, very noxious and magically powerful entities on horseback.

Now, the CINEMATOGRAPHY in all three of these films will knock you out -- superbly contrived, second to none. The COLOR SATURATION will bowl you over as well. The script and STORYLINE is not at all hokey and comes off as quite coherent, which would have been a very difficult task as readers of the book(s) are well-aware.

I much appreciated the fact that the story remains close to the book(s), with few cuts and/or ommissions. Of course, this has made for a lengthy film, but one which will not bore you at all.

I am critical of one major area, and that is regarding the Hobbits themselves. Most of the other fantasy creatures are right on but I just couldn't accept the make-up folks version of Hobbits. I thought that the Elves could have been notably better too.

My final critique of the film is that the same primary theme composition  is used for all three films -- man, I got REALLY tired of that filmscore, even though other facets of it are brilliant. It's the up-front french horn one that I'm speaking of.

In the end, this is a very fine film, not necessarily for smaller kids, but A-O-K for teens. A last comment, don't waste time or money watching the FULL-SCREEN edition -- I've watched it that way (all three films) and you lose 2-stars when you do!

The scenes cause the movie to cleave more closely to the original novel, such as Galadriel giving priceless gifts to everyone in the Fellowship.

The special effects are incredible, the acting superb, the costumes excellent, the directing outstanding, and so on... It's classic adventure with strong moral lessons about selfless service to others, loyalty, courage, duty, etc.",1184371200,,369,5.065573770491803
1311797,1,B00003CWT6,"Let me begin by saying that I have been a Tolkien fan since I was in Jr. High School oh so many years ago. I, along with the rest of the known universe, eagerly awaited the film release of Tolkien's massive epic. To say I was disappointed in the end result is putting it mildly.

I suppose I have only myself to blame. After all, I should have known the cause was lost the instant I learned Peter Jackson was going to direct the trilogy. With all due respect to Mr. Jackson, he does not seem like the kind of person who could even comprehend, let alone translate on to film, the theology that lies beneath the adventure story that is the hallmark of the LoTR. After all, anyone who knows the first thing about Tolkien knows that he was a devout Roman Catholic of the pre-Vatican II variety and that his religious views profoundly influenced his writing.

My guess is that Peter Jackson, who would probably make a great Dungeon Master, knows little of and could care less about Roman Catholicism no matter what brand you are talking about. Hence, instead of timeless epic we are stuck with what amounts to warmed over Dungeon and Dragons that is the all too predictable result of his efforts.

Other reviewers have already done an excellent job of cataloging this film's (and the entire trilogy's) many glaring shortcomings so I will not regurgitate them here. What I will say is this. His worst offense in my opinion is not even the barely thought thru script, terrible casting (Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortenson, Cate Blanchett) and huge chunks of the book that were either left out (Barrow Downs, Tom Bombadil) or mutilated beyond recognition (Elves at Helm's Deep? Merry and Pippin tricking The Ents, Faramir as kidnapper and borderline pyscho instead of living saint). His greatest sin is that he manages to take one of the most interesting and exciting stories ever written and make it dull and boring. That for me is enough to warn any potentinal customers away from purchasing this product.

The plain fact of the matter is that the LoTR, because of its structure and length, simply does not lend itself to being made as a feature film. My advice to anyone looking to discover the great treasure of Tolkien's Middle Earth is to purchase the books and read them. You can't do any better than that.",1183939200,6,2296,4.6339066339066335

1311800,5,B00003CWT6,"This version of the Lord of the Rings as a movie is the best ever made.

Okay some ""changes"" were necessary to make it a commercial successful movie, such as reducing ""responsibilities"" for events to a minimum (result: somebody was held responsible for things in the movie, where somebody else was responsible in the book), Some characters and events (especially the first third) are just missing (to make the movie not too long and difficult for NON-Book Readers). They did not mention some locations and events from the first book and gave some information, which were not available until book 2 or 3.

Some Characters for Book 2-3 got also a role in book 1 (movie 1) to substitute characters from the original book (to keep it simple). In addition, some dialogs did never take place, but that is understandable, if you want to tell the story in a movie.

Nevertheless, they had to sacrifice something to make a good movie to tell Tolkien's story with real characters.

It is a fantasy world. You cannot expect that somebody spend 100+ million dollars, to make a 1-1 version of a book. A 1-1 version would require making 3 movies with 3-5 hour length. In addition, after part 1 would nobody (who did NOT read the book) go to watch part 2. Final Comment: Read the books! Moreover, if you do not read books, this movie version is the best you can get right now.

1311873,5,B00003CWT6,"Don't listen to all the movie geeks complaining that they don't like this version because it's ""a cash-in"" or ""lacks bonus features"", because they're not exactly the normal buyer. This version of Lord of the Rings is an excellent choice for those of us who aren't ""collecting"" the movies in any way, and just want to be able to watch the Theatrical or Extended versions without paying for a lot of extra junk. What the hell do I care about the behind the scenes featurettes? I watch movies to be pulled into a fantasy, not to nitpick and peruse every technical detail in the filmmaking process.

Simply put, if you just want to watch the movies in both their forms, this is the best, least expensive choice. The quality is the same as previous versions with the exception of DTS audio being absent (Dolby surround is still present) and the packaging is nice. Yes, because of the extended cut, you'll need to flip the disc. Boo hoo. This is a lot of movie, and I'd rather have a nice quality version of it than a super-compressed one on a single side... And at least this is on one disc, rather than being on multiple discs that needed to be swapped in the Extended version DVD set.

The movie trilogy itself is stupendous. Yes, a Tolkien fan might tell you it's a ""bastardization"" of the story, but really-- do not listen to them!-- They're being nitpicky because narrative was expanded and certain scenes were dropped for film. It happens to ALL books when they become movies because there's just no way to fit everything or make the narrative as it plays out in a book match the visual format of film. The ultimate Tolkien geek would have had you sit through a seven-hour ""Fellowship of the Ring"" if he got his way.

If you're a hardcore film buff who needs to know every behind-the-scenes detail, skip this one. If you're a Tolkien geek who has a tendency to place Peter Jackson in the same category as George Lucas in terms of merchandising, then skip this one. If, however, you're a well-adjusted adult who hasn't got a standee of Gandalf in his living room and doesn't care which brand of soap flakes they used to simulate snow in scene 23 (or whatever), then this may be the best version you could own until the switch to HD comes along.",1179014400,,2244,4.5085995085995085

To be honest, I found it hard to get into the movie.  An hour into it, I could have given up on it.  After seeing the first movie (I was a little disappointed to feel like I only saw an incomplete story), I am interested in seeing the sequel, but not so interested that I'm rushing to get it or where I'll feel I missed out if I never find out how the story ends (which I'm sure will be good being victorious over evil).

I've just explained why I only gave this movie four stars.  Now, let me tell you why it earned that many (in case you couldn't tell from the other 3000+ reviews).  The special effects were great.  But so was the acting.  Very effective was Ian Holm, Ian McKellan, John Rhys-Davies (remember him from Raiders of the Lost Ark?), Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortenson, and Christopher Lee.

Where was Glorfindel? Many little things are changed right from the start but this was the worst. What I heard was, Jackson was trying to be politically correct because of the lack of female participation in the book. Oh well.
You just have to try to separate the book from the movie, which I was finally able to do after a few weeks of recovery. Just watch it as a great interpretation of the original and enjoy the spectacular renditions of places like Helm's Deep, Moria, and Minis Tirith. And when Jackson follows the book, it truly is magical. He uses a lot of the dialog from the book and that made it more compelling for me.

1311923,5,B00003CWT6,"It goes without saying that some alterations between book and movie had to be made for dramatic purposes, but the overall effect is so good, so beautifully realized, that it is easy to forgive the encapsulation of the early parts of the novel as some things work better in books than in movies, and vice versa.

The characters of the fellowship are magnificently realized, and i was surprised and pleased to see the Christian messages of the story brilliantly realized without being obtrusive.  The character of Aragorn the King is as allegorical a figure as one could ask for, and in this film, he even looks like Jesus.  And I loved, loved, loved the imagery of Boromir as a man who finds salvation at the brink of disaster.  The portrayals of Gandalf and the five principle hobbits are inspired casting, and Legolas & Gimli are just so right!

I was less pleased with the Elves since Elrond seemed sterner than he might have, and Galadriel was too dark and creepy for the gracious Elven Queen Tolkien created.

Above all, the chilling central character in the story is the Ring itself, with a personality and a voice, something never fully realized in the books, but magnificently depicted in the film.  And Middle Earth itself is a central character, with its forboding mountains, rolling hills full of Hobbit Holes, and other perfectly depicted locations.

1312000,5,B00003CWT6,"This first episode of this cult saga has an essential function. It is supposed to set the community from which everything is going to start after the quick summary of what this ring is all about, power. We thus have to learn first hand about the hobbits, the dwarves, the elves, the kobolds, and of course enough to know they exist about the dark forces. It is also supposed to set the decor for magic. A good wizard and a bad wizard. This is slighty innovative on the great model as for wizards, Merlin. The bad one was a woman. Here the bad one is an friend of the good one, another male. No sexual innuendo. We are writing a saga for modern teenagers and kids, so sex is out. This first episode is also there to select the final heroes. We start from an accidental designation or appointment of one young hobbit. Then we move to a wider circle in some human town. It becomes the Fellowship of the Ring. They are nine, an ominous number but not necessarily bad. And the rest of this first part is the elimination of four of them. First the wizard because we are going to deal with power, force, courage, and no magic. Anyway the wizard was apparently very powerless and not very swift. Magic first and thinking second, like some kind of cowboy turned magician : shoot first and ask questions second. He got what he deserved, death in the grip of some underground devilish - horns, fire and all - monster. Then two hobbits are captured and taken away by the monster-warriors sent by the dark forces. And finally one of the two humans who was attracted by the ring and wanted to assume its power thinking that its power was neither good nor bad but that it depended upon the person who wore it. He is deadly wounded in the last battle. Then finally this first part enables us to separate the five survivors into two groups. In one boat the hobbit who is the ring-carrier and his friend the hobbit Sam who is looking after him. On the other hand, and on foot, one human, one dwarf and one elf. All that is supposed to entangle us into some unconsciously significant structures or patterns. A pair of identical beings who carry the ring and a trio of three different beings meaning the alliance of all against the dark forces without whom the mission cannot be carried out, but that are only supporting warriors, not the main ones since they do not have the ring itself. This general design unluckily carries too much the seal of christian imagery. The dark forces are seen necessarily as devilish, satanic, with hooves, horns and spitting fire, and then their warriors are ugly, gross, disgusting in all possible ways. They are of course not courageous, for on their side it can only be bestiality. On the other side you have courage, handsomeness, beauty, femininity though at a fair and cautious distance, friendship, faithfulness, the sense of an ethical if not even moral mission set to you not by greed or envy or some other of these deadly sins, but by a vast sense of destiny, progress, salvation, redemption, etc. That is very common today and  The Lord of The Rings  is the model of all the tales of the type. It associates fantasy, medievalism,  the basic war dynamic of good versus evil. But it does not reach the level of real fantasticity, at the most some religious marvelous or bizarre wizardry, at the utter most gothicness. It does not reach science-fiction because there is no possible link between this ancient world and ours. Humans are secondary and by definition stated from the very start as unreliable because they can change allegiances in no time : they are dominated by their passions, particularly envy, greed, jealousy or even love. That makes them unreliable. But this modern saga is heavily inspired from nordic sagas and of course the fundamental one in an Anglo-Saxon world, to know  Beowulf . Many differences exist but the link or links are numerous. But yet this total severance from our modern world makes it a story with no direct impact on us, no gate from there and then to here and now. We are not directly concerned in our very being, only in our sentimentality, or fear, in one word pathos. For real fantastic science-fiction fantasy we will have to wait for Stephen King and his Dark Tower.

I am NOT a couch potato.

Well, at least it was time well spent. Finally...some movies that really make the grade. I've been hard-pressed to find a good 5-star movie that I haven't seen. And here I've had these two sets of films that have been out there all this time that that for whatever reason I've had an aversion to. Silly me.

The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was movie making at its best. Especially considering that the movie had very high standards to live up to after more than 50 years of building such a loyal, cult following of the classic J.R.R. Tolkien book.

Hobbits, Elves, Men, Dwarves, Wizards, Orcs all co-surviving, albeit without much harmony, in Middle Earth. And all lust for the great Ring of Power made by the Dark Lord Sauron. But only little Frodo Baggins controls its Destiny. Thus is the 9-hour epic saga of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).

There is a terrific list of A-list actors giving A-list performances. It's a long one: Therefore, most notably you have Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Astin as Sam, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Andy Serkis as Gollum (what a performance!), Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli. I know. I know....How could I not mention Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler and all the others??? Well, that's the point. The whole cast was awesome. Even the no-names that played Orcs.

Kudos to Director Peter Jackson for going beyond the Hollywood standard of 120 minutes to tell each chapter of the story. Jackson kept a lot of the character development that usually isn't transferred from novel to movie adaptation. And Jackson was a master not just at directing his cast, but at getting the special effects perfect. The Lord of the Rings movie adaptation will be as classic as the novel because of Jackson.

If you somehow missed these movies as I did until recently for whatever crazy reason, I hope that my little review has encouraged you to add them to your cart. As for Harry Potter...well that's another review entirely, of course.

It turns out that both versions are on a two-sided disc. Hope you couch potatoes don't mind getting up to turn it over. The movie is broken in the middle for both versions, asking for it to be turned over. Oh, by the way, you have to deal with twice the wear and liklihood that the disc will fail. Really there was no editing of the prior extended version, just some new chapter stops s that the theatrical version would play. To the guys who edited this disk, I have to say, I really, really believe you can get the whole extended version on one side, so fork it over. I kind of am a little insulted that the back cover says that both versions are on one disc. OK, OK its true, but only enough to satisfy the lawyers. Oh, by the way, no one gave any thought to the cover art of disc 2. I give them 2 stars because the price at Best Buy was $19.95, so I can say that I saved some cash on a backup copy.

Lord of the Rings is quite a concept, originally brought forth by J.R.R. Tolkien decades ago.  Unfortunately, his book was 1,137 pages long, which is a daunting read.  Thankfully, his book has been brought to the big screen for more of a mainstream approach, and where more people can enjoy it.  If nothing else, it is easier to enjoy.

The L.O.T.R. movies are not short by any means, but if the other option is reading over a thousand pages, I choose the movies.  Besides, you will probably enjoy yourself so much watching the movies that they will not seem so long.

1312129,2,B00003CWT6,"Being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I was very much looking forward to these Limited Edition DVDs. Though I already have two versions of each movie (theatrical and extended), I bought this new set for the ""all-new"" documentaries.

I was expecting something along the lines of a look back, where cast and crew might record new material. I was expecting more insight into the movies and how they came to light. I was expecting, really, to be entertained.

However, what I got was a mish-mash of raw footage that felt like it was picked up from the cutting room floor after the appendices for the Extended Edition were edited together. Segments cut abruptly and new ones start with no rhyme or reason. There's no flow between what they're showing, and no real reason as to WHY they're showing it. Very little of the footage could be considered informative, or even interesting. Some of it is downright uncomfortable, such as a moment where hostilities flair over the film's budget. And even some of the footage is already seen on the Extended Edition's appendices, while other footage will only make sense if you've seen the appendices to begin with. Out of the (rounded up) one hour and twenty-five minutes, I'd honestly say only 10-15 minutes of the new material is informative and/or entertaining. It's just bland, and a ""star wipe"" away from being as bad as a junior high school film project.

I'd only really recommend these Limited Editions to die-hard fans who want them for collection purposes. For those who own no other version of the film, I'd say that for a VERY minor price difference, they would be better off buying the Extended Editions. You get a lot more out of your money. Or if your interest doesn't go beyond the theatrical version of the film, you have those DVDs available for a much cheaper price.

The only reason I give this editon two stars, is because this edition still has some merit to the rabid fan in me. I'm happy to have these in my collection - I'll just never, ever, have a reason to watch them.",1158019200,5,2044,4.622589531680441

1312131,5,B00003CWT6,"...I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re-release of these three films on DVD. A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again. Now I don't blame them. I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor. I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again. Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score.

In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they make a great buy. I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again. The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me. They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better. The only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc, you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie--which is really not a big deal. I highly recommend getting these to those that don't own them yet.",1157241600,5,1545,4.237288135593221
1312170,5,B00003CWT6,"The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.

I loved ""The Two Towers"" and ""Return of the King"" almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with some of the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.

For those of you who haven't seen it yet (what are you waiting for?!!) films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: ""The Fifth Element"", the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), ""Interview with a Vampire"", the ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" (with Johnny Depp), ""Logan's Run"" and ""The Island"". They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.

But after seeing ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.

It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come, and this Collector's Gift Set is probably the best way to date of marketing the movie, with the lovely, stone-like Argonath bookends, the extended edition of the movie (which, although I thought it was impossible at first, actually improves on the theatrical version), and the extra goodies that come inside, like the National Geographic documentary on the making-of, the keepcase and the beautiful outer packaging itself.

God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else. FOTR will always be MY most PRECIOUS of all movies.",1156982400,2,3065,4.565454545454545

1312173,1,B00003CWT6,"I just wanted to add a few thoughts to others' comments.  First to the user who complained that you would have to turn the disc over and ""hasn't technology come to the point where one whole theatrical film can be shown on one side of a disc, and the extended on another disc?"" The answer is yes and no.  No a regular DVD is not big enough to hold the extended editions on one side of one disc.  A regular DVD even using dual layer is only about 9 GB.  So you could either compress the heck out of the picture and sound which would make no one happy or have to switch discs/turn the disc over.  Yes technology has evolved though that is why HD-DVD/Blu-Ray are coming out, they can hold much more information on a single disc which means less compression, unfortunately you have to buy a new player, as for me I'm waiting for the format war to end before I commit.  Also I think you are confused about branching.  Basically the way branching works is that you will choose from the outset which movie you'll watch either theatrical or extended.  If you choose the extended edition you'll watch the theatrical version until the extended bits come along and then the disc will seamlessy insert those scenes.

Now as for Peter Jackson being another George Lucas I disagree.  You have to remember PJ doesn't own the rights to these movies the way Lucas does Star Wars.  This isn't PJ re-releasing these films, the blame for double-dipping lies squarely on New Line.  I agree that there should be a way for fans to purchase the documentaries w/o buying the films, all they're setting themselves up for is piracy as the documentaries will make the rounds in the torrent world.",1156809600,12,1667,4.501661129568106

Still, inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped Costa Botes documentaries, my advise to anyone buying LOTR for the first time is- DO NOT BUY THIS SET! Spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6.1 DTS EX glory, alongwith hours of endless in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest of your life watching!!

Please be aware, these new editions DO NOT contain DTS tracks, no commentary tracks by the director, Weta workshop or the cast. All you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc...AND NOTHING ELSE. It would have been a better idea had New Line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again....And even this is not the end, once the HD format gains a little more acceptance, they'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy!

Beware, Extended edition set is the ultimate LOTR experience, in terms of films or bonus features. Go get it...Its worth all the money spent!!",1156809600,24,1400,4.573705179282869

However, I have to respectfully offer a dissenting opinion.  Having seen and read the aforementioned glowing reviews, I decided to rent the DVD from Blockbuster.  After about 90 minutes I turned it off; I just couldn't ""get into it"".  Several months later, my wife and I attempted to watch it again.  She loved it, but I eventually left the room before the movie finished.  I attempted yet a third time to no avail.  While the movie was visually appealing, I found the storyline to be tedious and loathsome; it could not hold my attention.

Again, this is just one opinion in over 3500 at the time of this writing...one opinion that is clearly not congruent with most who have watched this movie.  I will not be so arrogant as to say all those who love this movie should be subject to psychiatric evaluation as far too many seem to do when offering negative reviews.

The scenery is breath taking, and the music fits with it perfectly, adding such an earth quality.  The Shire is a comfortable, homey place where you can snuggle up, and that is just the scenery of the beginning of the movie.  There are mountains, underground passageways, shrines, woods, rivers; any scenery you can name, they have, and it is beautifully shot.

The story itself is epic, but shone in a way that it doesn't seem ""too big"" at all.  This movie just doesn't miss a note!

1312244,5,B00003CWT6,"In 2001, one of the most anticipated movies ever came into theatres: ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy novel.

Since it was created by a talented but weird director, and based on a book that had never been successfully adapted even in part, no one was entirely sure whether it would bomb or succeed. Fortunately, ""Fellowship"" is a smashing cinematic success, with exquisite care given to every aspect of it.

When hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) leaves the Shire, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) convinces him to leave his treasured magical Ring to his young cousin Frodo (Elijah Wood). Gandalf soon confirms that the Ring is the evil One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, and tells the frightened Frodo to leave the Shire as soon as possible -- especially since nine dark riders are searching for someone by the name of Baggins.

Frodo, his faithful gardener Sam (Sean Astin) and his two mischievous cousins (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) quickly travel to meet with a strange ranger, and stumble into more dangers as they make for the Elven haven of Rivendell. But Frodo's journey is not over yet -- when he and a band of hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves and a wizard all volunteer to take the Ring to the only place where it can be destroyed.

For a long time, a convincing ""Lord of the Rings"" movie could not be made -- not just because of special effects and money, but because it is so difficult to translate Tolkien's work into something watchable. Goofy scripting, bad special effects, mutilated characters -- there was just so much that could go wrong. Instead, it was a cinematic triumph.

Jackson and Co. outdid themselves with nearly every aspect of the films. They translated Tolkien's erudite prose into solid, poetic dialogue, with lots of humor and horror, romance and taut action. And it all takes place in the New Zealand landscapes, with lots of misty forests, towering mountains and charming rural villages. And Jackson takes full advantage of these, with his trademarked swooping shots, and wild camerawork for fight scenes.

But the setting alone doesn't make a good movie, which is where Jackson's WETA Workshops came in. Sets range from the sturdy English hobbit towns to the airy elven tree-houses; and the special effects are almost shockingly realistic, including a rampaging cave troll, and a glimpse of the gruesome Gollum. He's the first fully convincing CGI character, and you can forget he is made digitally.

Elijah Wood is outstanding as Frodo Baggins. He runs the emotional gamut: fear, pain, horror, happiness, resignation, love and loneliness. Sean Astin is equally good as the steadfast Sam, who is amazed by the world outside the Shire. And some comic relief comes with Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, as Frodo's loyal, chipper cousins.

But as lovable as the hobbits are, they do not dominate all of the screen: Ian McKellen is perfect as the grandfatherly wizard Gandalf. There are also some meaty roles for mysterious Viggo Mortensen, elfin newcomer Orlando Bloom, ominous movie veteran Christopher Lee, as well as Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, and especially Sean Bean as the tormented Boromir.

This edition contains both versions of the movie -- the original, shorter theatrical version, and the second extended edition with lots of extra footage. While the first one has nostalgia value, the second is undoubtedly the best. The scenes cause the movie to cleave more closely to the original novel, and even when they deviate -- Frodo and Sam watching Elves walking to the Grey Havens -- they add to the flow of the movie. There is also a special documentary filmed behind the scenes, apparently to draw in completists who just need EVERYTHING.

""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a true modern classic, with exceptional acting and amazing direction from Jackson and his friends. Bravo!",1153353600,,3926,4.952887537993921
1312245,5,B00003CWT6,"You don't need to be a Lord of the Rings fan or a Tolkien reader to enjoy this film and appreciate it as a masterpiece.  I had skimmed The Fellowship of the Ring by Tolkien a year or two before the theatrical release because of the popularity of the novels.  I am not an avid reader, so I only remembered a few story points and descriptions.  I am also not a big movie person, and despite seeing some parts of The Fellowship of the Ring, I had not viewed the film from beginning to end.

Figuring it was about time, I went with the ""go big or go home"" philosophy and bought the extended version.  If the story and the film are such masterpieces why not?  It did not disappoint in the least.  The storyline, down to the last detail, is captivating.  The environments are amazing, and the action scenes are top notch.  The film is long (this extended version is about 3 1/2 hours), but if you enjoy the story and don't worry about catching every amazing detail it will be an experience.  The split discs also make it possible to view roughly half the movie without worrying about where you left off, and the discs split at a perfect spot to take a break.  While Lord of the Rings fans don't need to be told again, those who haven't bothered will not regret seeing this film.  For those looking for an action movie more than a storyline, this will be among the best you've ever seen (I hear the others in this trilogy surpass it even), though action fans may want to pick up the theatrical release and save themselves over a half-hour of what is probably mostly non-action as well as a few dollars.

The appendices, discs 3 and 4 of this collection, are also somewhat interesting.  While die-hard fans will love the features, speaking as a first-time viewer I also found what I dipped into somewhat interesting.  I'm convinced that there's no chance a story this rich and deep will ever be written in my lifetime.  It amazes me how J.R.R. Tolkien created such a masterpiece when today's authors are usually proud of getting their work turned into a cheap documentary or women's television movie.  I was not a fan of King Kong, but Peter Jackson's adaptation of Lord of the Rings, while seeming to follow a similar formula, definately produced a classic.",1153094400,4,2250,4.488943488943489

Instead, I'd like to pay tribute to Tolkien, whose imagination sowed the seed that has grown into the Great Tree of this trilogy and its cultural shade.

Although Jackson, Walsch and Boyens took some license in writing the script for ""Fellowship,"" the license they took was considered and limited.  Eliminating Tom Bombadil from the plot (he appeared in the written works) was an improvement, given the audience's limited attention span and his marginal role in the story as an entirety.  I do, however, miss the barrow wight.  But without Tom, how do you work it in?

Beyond this, the plot of ""Fellowship"" was left almost entirely intact, and the extended scenes version does the better job of vividly conveying it.  (The theater-length version offered a fairly cursory treatment of some plot events.)  Add to this two bonus discs' worth of production footage, and the vastness of Tolkien's imagination becomes apparent; Jackson and crew had their hands full producing such an amazing story in cinematic form.  Five stars for all the genius, from Tolkien on down through the history that led up to this film.

1312310,5,B00003CWT6,"A long absent evil returns to loom over the Free Lands of Middle Earth, and it needs only the One Ring to become an unstoppable force of destruction. Luckily, the One Ring of Power, lost for over three thousand years, has come into the hands of a humble, young hobbit named Frodo Baggins. With the benign wizard Gandalf the Grey to instruct him, Frodo and his best friend, Samwise Gamgee, travel with two other hobbit companions to the woodland realm of the elves, led by a mysterious ranger called Strider. Once there, the band of heroes is joined by Legolas the Elf, a nobleman named Boromir, and Gimli the dwarf, forming the Fellowship of the Ring. It is the quest of the Fellowship to take the evil Ring to the fires of Mount Doom, in the land of Mordor, to destroy it. It is a perilous journey, however. Along the way, they must face monstrous creatures such as Orcs, Ringwraiths, Cave Trolls, Goblins, and all manner of other horrors. But, they will also discover the distant majesties of their world, the fascinating cultures, beautiful beings, and awe inspiring landscapes.  They must always remain on guard though, because there are less obvious dangers lurking as well. The Dark Lord Sauron's demonic eye is ever watchful, his spies seek out the hobbits in search of the One Ring, and the ring itself is the greatest danger of all. Its wicked power seeks to envelop all who are near and lead them to certain doom.

Based on the renowned books by author J. R. R. Tolkien, ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is only the first in a three-part fantasy epic that is mindblowing to say the least! Director Peter Jackson, surprisingly coming from a no-budget splatter film background, brings the world of Middle Earth to fantastic and astonishing reality! Intense detail in every aspect of the filmmaking process has resulted in a trilogy like no other. It is pointless to single out performances here, for every cast member is perfection. The visual effects are flawless, the music is inspiring, and the settings are incomparable. The great attention to detail results in a medieval world that, fantastic as it is, seems 100% real. The languages are real, the various cultures are in depth, and at the heart of it all is the message that no creature is so small that it is insignificant or incapable of making a difference. This is filmmaking at its finest. Can any one film of the trilogy stand alone as a viewing experience? Yes and no. The films are each fantastic and plenty lengthy, though there is never a dull moment, but they are unquestionably all one single story. They must ALL be seen consecutively and in order (though you don't have to watch them all in one day). This Widescreen, 2-disc edition of the DVD presents the film as it was released in theaters, with a beautiful widescreen format and a fine collection of extras that include: 3 featurettes on the making of the film, 15 short web-featurettes, theatrical trailers and TV spots, a music video by Enya, a preview of the second film in the trilogy (Two Towers) and its video game, and, believe it or not, a preview of the extended edition of the DVD. That's right, some time after the release of this theatrical edition, extended editions of the already lengthy films were released on DVD. Those must be REALLY long, and they probably have some great extras too; maybe the audio commentaries or production art we don't get here. Regardless, even Peter Jackson refers to the theatrical releases as the ""preferred versions."" So, make your choice. You might even feel like owning both versions. Any way you go, you can't lose. Fantastic films!

In the past, there have been animated versions of the Lord of the Rings and the preceding tale by J. R. R. Tolkien, ""The Hobbit."" You may want to discover these for yourself. I can't wholeheartedly recommend them, as I haven't seen them since childhood, and I recall the animation being a bit weak to say the least. Still, it's been a long time, but don't expect them to come anywhere near these versions. Also recommended for ""Lord of the Rings"" fans: The Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Legend, The Last Unicorn, The Princess Bride, The Sword in the Stone, Excalibur, Dragonslayer, Merlin, the Harry Potter series, the Star Wars saga (still my favorite film series, but I'm a longtime fan), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Willow, Clash of the Titans, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and I'm SURE I'm forgetting many more. Also, check out a much younger Elijah Wood in ""The Adventures of Huck Finn,"" another of my all-time favorite films, and pick up Peter Jackson's ""King Kong,"" another extraordinary achievement! Oh, and visit my gallery at slave2moonlight.deviantart.com to read my Disney/Lord of the Rings fan-comic! It's only 7 pages in as I write this review, but it's somewhat entertaining if I do say so myself, ha.",1144713600,2,4905,4.768235294117647
1312311,4,B00003CWT6,"This film had a bucnh of hype surrounding it so I tried to temper my expectations when seeing it for the first time.  I watched the extended version and did NOT see the theatrical shorter version so this review is based on that.  Anyways...

This epic tale moves along very well for such a long movie.  I never got bored or tired and thought that the pacing was damned good.  The character development was done quite well, I started to actually care about each of the individuals that were part of the fellowship in one way or another.  There was enough action and battle scenes without it getting tiresome and the surprises kept coming as things happened that I was not expecting.

This is a DEEP, long story that does require our full attention span but I had no problem becuase it was interesting and because I liked the characters, I couldn't wait to see what went on next.  Like any epic, this had all of the elements you would expect: Trust, good vs evil, revelations, building friendships, faith, etc, etc.  I found myself constanstly thinking about what each character was going to do and what their ""take"" was on all of this.  Which characters, if any, would ultimately ""turn"" against Frodo?  Were any of them secretly aligned with the Evil Lord Sauron?  Very good stuff, very cool to ponder.

Also, the beggining of the film really sets up the story nicely describing the rings, how they came about, what they mean to potential holders of them, and why anyone may want the ring(s) in the first place.  Right of the bat I was sort of ""hooked"" wanted to get going with the film.  This was a nice way to kick things off!

The special effects are tremendous and so is the cinematography.  There were a FEW, and I mean a very few CGI shots that didn't look that great but most of this mystical world was captured perfectly by the films creators.  WELL DONE!

Like any movie, it's not perfect so let's get a few quick things out of the way that could have been better or changed:

- Frodo was a little too timid for my tastes.  He just didn't show enough emotion and at times seemed almost bored.  Maybe it was too much for him but his facial expressions rarely changed and I would have liked to seen him a little more ""fired up"".

- There were a few scenes were other people or characters were mentioned that didn't make any sense or I was unable to tie them to the film in any way.  Also, a few of the characters had really quick parts or their contribution was very limited so I didn't see why they were there in the first place.  Perhaps these things I mention will have signifigance in other films in the series?

That's really about it, it is very nitpicky and does not detract from the film at all.

The quality of the video and audio of this DVD are TOP notch, expecially for my widescreen flat panel LCD set.  The complaints about the discs not playing on peoples computers are probably based on downloaded, pirated copies so I wouldn't worry about it as long as your legit!

I Highly recommend this film, you'll enjoy it.  The ""short attention span"" crowd may think it's dull but that's their problem.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1143072000,2,3136,4.458699472759227
1312312,4,B00003CWT6,"The animated creatures special effects work is very well done in CGI. Still,
I lament that all is made with computor images, and not through stop motion
technique using real models. A computor image can be very realistically
made, but still lacks a certain something, a sense of real
manifested mass and presence. One of the last great stop motion creatures
used on screen was the dragon in the movie Dragonslayer; is was very
advanced and had a computorized mechanism called Go Motion to give it
carefully adjusted movements. Here the computor had, as it should, a
supporting role, instead of totally taking over. It is a pity that this
branch of effects work was abandoned for the less costly CGI. Because the
use of a model gives by itself a sense of presence on the screen, that can't
fully be achieved with the illusion of the computor image. A real model
brings an actuality of sharpness to movements, forms, colors, lights and
shadows. The continuation of the Go Motion technique would have been an
investment for the future, and led to many interesting discoveries
in anatomical and engineering mechanics, developed the knowledge of hard
and elastic complex materials, and would have been a major factor in the
advancement of robotics. Instead the film industry exclusively chose, for
financial reasons, the less costly road of doing make-believe illusions
within the computor.",1142985600,,1385,5.0
1312313,5,B00003CWT6,"I have seen all three of the Extended DVD Editions of Lord of the Rings, and
I can't help but ask the following questions:

How could a film team in New Zeeland, without prior experience of advanced
film making, be able to create the mastodont Lord of the Rings film trilogy?
How could Peter Jackson, who previously had done low budget splatter films
like Bad Taste and Braindead, pull this off? I am baffled.

How could this massive amount of visual material be created and put together
in such a comparably short time? How could it all be coordinated and
harmonized into such a consistent whole? How could the genuine feeling of
culture and history of a whole world be created in that short time? It
doesn't add up. It's not natural. And it doesn't matter that the film crew
in the extra documentary material on the DVDs tell us how dedicated and hard
they worked; it still doesn't add up. I am telling you, it ain't natural.
There must have been some paranormal or magical forces involved in the
making, or perhaps Tolkien's spirit coordinated the work.

How could they find so many actors that fit so perfectly into the roles, and
acted as if they actually were their role characters and not hired actors?
And all integrated with the visual environments and special effects work.
Incomprehensible. Supermundane forces must have played a part .

I can see some minor weak points in the films, but on the whole they stand
as a world on its own, above the reach of criticism. As with the books my
favorite is The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers feels a little like
transportation (I thought the weakest part here was the Ent. He felt
unconvincing and childish with his too obvious human characteristics and
expressions, like an illustration from a children's book. And some of
the orcs look a little too caricaturish with their long noses.)
When reading the books I imagine characters and environments a little
differently, more mundane down to earth, with ordinary persons put in
extraordinary situations, so that there becomes a strong contrast. For
example, the Shire countryside being mellow in tone, to contrast more with
the magic glimmering of the Elven world. In the film, all the main
characters glow with charisma, and everything is really intense, from colors
to acting. But that is alright. It is still very well done. And there is no
definite way, because everyone who reads the books has his or her personal
vision.
The Return of the King has grown upon me, and it is just as great as the
first film, but in a different way; it has grand beauty within the context
of war. Oooh, and that green dress Arwen is wearing at the wedding! A color
from beyond this world!

The Extended Editions have many great scenes added, especially in The Return
of the King. Who can forget the episode with Gandalf and Pipin atop Minas
Tirith, by the white tree, talking of days gone past? Or the Mouth of
Sauron!?

The extra material is very generous. Sometimes a little too generous,
because every magic trick is revealed.  But if you are yourself an artist,
or work with film, it is indispensible information, and very enjoyable to
watch.
Those involved in the films also tell us how difficult it was to break up
when it was all over. I can imagine the making of these films was a burnout
for some, difficult to top off. To them I can say that, the cosmos is
limitless, and there is always some new beauty around the corner.",1142812800,2,3429,4.620689655172414

I asked for the three platinum edition LOR box sets for Christmas, when I did not get them I bought them myself (in a fit of uncharecteristic indulgence).

 In taking the production apart in the making discs, I was given a new respect and deeper awe of how the films were crafted from conception to cutting room.  The ingenuity of P Jackson and his team astounded me.  In Fellowship, you must see how the troll scene was planned out(it was completely digitized, and put in a 3d simulation, so Peter Jackson could walk around an empty room, with virtual reality goggles on, and see and plan the camera angles -wild). I was enchanted all over again.

1312380,5,B00003CWT6,"A great film, not to be missed.  The music is wonderful and the special effects are great. In some respects, the movie is actually better than the book; it gives Arwen a bigger role, and moves the story along faster.  The cast is good.  Orlando Bloom especially shines as Legolas.  In the books Legolas is a surprisingly minor character.  Peter Jackson was clearly smart enough to see he had a real find in this actor and gave him lots of screen time.  Hard to believe now how unknown Bloom was before Fellowship of the Ring came out.

The movie does have its faults.  I thought the scene of the fight on the Moria stairs pushed the limits of plausibility.  I also thought Boromir's death scene was overdone; I can do without endless slow motion shots of striking arrows.  As to the extra shots in the DVD, some were good, while with others I tend to agree with the original decision to leave them out.

The Lord of the Rings films do a good job of harmless escapism.  They also have a more serious message.  Tolkien saw firsthand as he was growing up the destruction of the English countryside.  This process has now progressed to the point where there is hardly a beautiful and untouched place on the earth, only teeming humanity as our population goes up and up.  Is this really what we want?  Is it making us happier?  Seems more like the sort of plan Saruman or Sauron would have.",1139011200,,1385,4.4541832669322705

1312469,5,B00003CWT6,"Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is brought to life in this stunning, detailed, vivid, well-acted and directed film by director Peter Jackson and his fantastic ensemble cast.  We see here the beauty of the Shire, which Tolkien imagined as an English countryside.  Here, under a bright sun, the Shire shines in yellow and green and brown.  The Hobbits, a folk who average 3'6"" in height and who live in homes constructed into the earth (called 'holes' by Tolkien himself), are attired in colorful peasant attire, reflecting their simple, country-bumpkin lifestyle.  They garden, gossip, eat seven meals a day, and drink ale whenever possible.  In the midst of Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday party, Bilbo himself vanishes and prepares to leave his home forever.  Gandalf, a wizard and longtime friend of Bilbo, advises him to leave his magical ring behind.  Bilbo agrees, although very reluctantly.  Gandalf passes the ring to Frodo, Bilbo's young cousin, who is referred to in the film as his nephew.  Gandalf then learns that the very ring Bilbo owned was the ring of Sauron, The One Ring, and that through this ring, Sauron, an evil being believed to be long dead, still lives through the existence of the ring.  Frodo sets off with his gardener and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee to find a place to take the ring where it will be kept from evil's sight.  After a council involving, Elves, Hobbits, Men, Wizards, and Dwarves, it is agreed that the Ring will be taken to Mount Doom, where it was forged, and will there be destroyed.

Through the course of Fellowship, we are treated to beautiful scenery, stunning effects, and solid acting, especially for this type of film.  Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey is the heart and soul of the film, with Elijah Wood giving an admirably low-key performance as Frodo, and Viggo Mortensen is great as the mysterious but virtous Strider.  Sean Bean, a veteran character actor, shines as Boromir, conveying a great depth of emotion.  Sean astin is well cast as Sam, but his shining moments come in the following films.  Howard Shore's score is marvelous.  I recommend the Extended DVD for the added scenes, which flesh out the plot in great ways, and the extras discs, which are overfilled with documentaries of all sorts.  Final grade: A+ (perfect score)",1134345600,4,2296,4.888888888888889
1312470,5,B00003CWT6,"The movie is wonderful, with excellent sound and picture quality on the transfer.  The documentaries are a bit repetitive, but ""Welcome to Middle Earth"" has some great moments with the son of the man who published the books originally.  The best documentary by far is ""Passage to Middle Earth,"" so I recommend watching that one first.  The smaller docs that originally appeared online are also a delight to watch, but some of that delight wanes when you're selecting them one after another after another -- there's no bloody ""play all"" option.

Overall this should be the perfect edition for non die-hard fans; there's plenty here to keep people busy and a lot is learned about the making of the movie.  If you can't afford or don't have the patience for the Extended Edition, then this is the version for you, and it's not a bad option at all.",1134259200,,844,4.675675675675675

1312546,4,B00003CWT6,"I saw this movie in the theatres, and I really liked it. It was a bit long, but who cares? It was great. The fight scenes with the orcs and demons were stupendous, I loved how Frodo and Samwise were so brave and determined, I liked Gandalf the Grey a lot(obviously!) and there were quite a few funny scenes. Also, the ring was made so well you would think there really were a ring like that, and Bilbo Baggins was quite the funny old hobbit. Oh, I should add that the dark, scary night battles and the evil Sauron and his minions on Mordor were outstanding and stellar. They were full of malice and mercilessness. And they were very good at fighting. In other words, they were everything villains should be. On top of that, Gollum was quite the evil little sh%t, and he would do anything to get that ring for himself. Just to put a cherry on the sundae, there were some real memorable quotes  like: ""My Precious!"" and ""Stupid Fat Hobbits."" Also ""Underhill. My name is underhill."" and ""That will lead them straight to us!"" The only reason this movie doesn't get 5 stars is because the 2 sequels were better. Oh, and just so all you know? When the ones who made this movie made it, they did the same thing they did with Daredevil, Elektra, War Of The Worlds, Batman Begins, Alien VS Predator, the two Mortal Kombat movies, and the two Lord Of The Rings Sequels-they took an R-rated movie and mangled it.

1312548,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings is my favorite story.  I have the books of course, and a lot of figures, and even an audio version that I never listen to.

When I saw the prior LOTR movie, the animated one, I was extremely disappointed.  It didn't do the movie justice.

It's hard to satisfy an audience that adores the book.  Any deviation from the book is a negative.  And there are a few deviations from the book.  It can't possibly live up to the impact the book had on you.

But this movie comes reasonably close to putting the book on film.  I would have made a few changes, but Peter Jackson somehow never asked me to give my opinion.

One change I would have made.  Remember the scene where the four hobbits in the Shire are hiding from a Black Rider whose horse is sniffing around right near them?  I would have made that scene a lot scarier.  I would have made you feel the tension and fear a lot more.  That is supposed to really set up, for the viewer, what is at stake here, and they failed to do that.  The hobbits nonchalanted it too much.  They also could have helped by using music or sound of some kind to scare the bejesus out of you.  That scene required that kind of treatment.

I also would have differentiated Merry and Pippin more from each other.  While it is true that we got the point that Pippin was the meatball of the two, Merry's maturity didn't show at all, and they physically resembled each other far, far too much.  Merry was supposed to be the toughest of the four hobbits despite his merry name, and he should have been given a personality of his own rather than just playing the role of the utterly unimportant of the four hobbits.

I loved what they did with Sam's hobbit girlfriend in the Shire.  She was so adorable, strong and free, exactly what the movie needed.  She gives us a reason to love the hobbits.  The movie actually did a lot better than the book, than Tolkein himself did, at fleshing out the character of Rosie, Sam's girl.

It is a shame that time constraints apparently forced Peter Jackson to leave Tom Bombadil out of the movie altogether.  Bombadil and Goldberry are wonderful Tolkein characters, and this story isn't complete without them.

In the book, didn't the chase scene between the Black Riders and Frodo play out differently?  I don't think that in the book Arwen saves Frodo's hash when she races towards Rivendell with an unconscious Frodo draped over her horse.  Doesn't Frodo stand up to the Black Riders himself rather than being carried like a sack of potatoes?

I suppose Peter Jackson made a decision to give Arwen and Liv Tyler a more heroic role, having her save Frodo.  It emasculates Frodo though, because it doesn't allow us to see him take charge of a battle scene and stand up to the Black Riders himself, which as I mentioned before should have been set up better by making those villains more terrifying.

How many chances did Frodo have to do a battle scene with fearsome enemies?  He's usually just bearing the ring and keeping Sam and Gollum from killing each other.  I think his most macho-hero scene was taken from him and given to Arwen.  The problem is, I have seen the movie a few times, it's been years since I read the book, and I'm not 100% sure that Arwen didn't save Frodo.  Did she or didn't she?

I would have cast (or directed) Elrond differently.  In the book he was an elf lord of immense power and interest, but in the movie he really didn't come across nearly as powerfully.  He seemed a bit like a minor general and a has-been, and Tolkein didn't paint him that way.  I prefer him more powerful.

We also don't really see the transition for Gimli, in the movie, from despising elves to loving Galadriel.  I don't think it would have been that hard to make us see his transformation better.  The version of Galadriel that I saw in my mind's eye, from the book, was gentler, softer, prettier, less dangerous looking, than the one on screen, and a lot more likely to provoke adoration in a man's heart.

The battle scenes, particularly in the mines against the hordes of orcs, come off a bit phony because they make you wonder how so many orcs can be killed while not one casualty is suffered by the fellowship at the hands of the orcs.  Of course we are constrained by Tolkein's writing, and after all the orcs failed to seriously wound any of the fellowship, but if I had directed this movie I would have done something about that, to bring a little more realism to the scene, make it less of a ""good guys always win and never get hurt"" conclusion to the orc battle.

I didn't picture Saruman as Christopher Lee.  I pictured him as a shorter and shiftier man, a sweet talking salesman type with shifty eyes.  In the movie he resembled Gandalf too much.  One Gandalf is enough.  I pictured him as a short, overweight, shifty and treacherous man capable of being cowardly towards Sauron, bullying towards weaker foes, and shifty in his dealings with Gandalf, seeming to be a degraded wizard who still has a lot of tricks up his sleeve.

Peter overplayed the physical power of the elves, making them just as large as men, when it was important to make them no more than about 5 feet tall and very thin.  The orcs too should have been elf size.  Gimli should clearly have been a hell of a lot more powerful than Legolas, but the way the movie was done, Legolas was the big strong one and Gimli was of slight importance.  This is a fantasy, and they should have gone to the trouble of shrinking the elves and orcs, making Saruman's orcs almost man-sized.

All things considered, this movie does do justice to the book.  It's a wonderful movie.  Thanks, Peter, for a job extremely well done.",1127174400,4,5682,4.446272991287512

1312584,5,B00003CWT6,"The best in my opinion of all 3 parts to this. I've read the book (don't read it, very boring, the man sits around and invents his own language and world, wow) and the movie is a lot better in the fact that it summarizes the main part, even though it still misses many vital scenes from the book which would make it better. This is common for most book based movies, however. The movie is a fantastic first of the trilogy to the fact that it introduces people to the magical and incredibly well thought out world of LOTR, weither they are new arrivals or old patrons of this classic.

I just like the way the movie was built and set up, coming in slowly to introduce the story and characters so to let the viewers digest the whole setting and information thats being given, and began to speed up into a race for time itself, ending in an enchanting ending resulting in the capture of Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) and the dramatic and heroic death of Boromir (Sean Bean) in a mini battle between them and the Orcs.

2 hours and 58 minutes. Main characters are Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (sean Bean), Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Pipin (Bill Boyd), and Merry (Dominic Monaghan).

I would definately say this is worth watching, I watched it 3-4 times, twice on FOX. The best in my opinion and one that will stand high through the hands of time itself.",1123459200,,1457,4.5534351145038165
1312585,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition) is by far the best book-based movie adaption to date.  The movie follows the book fairly well considering the complexity of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpieces.  The extended edition is better than the theater version, and has nearly endless amounts of extras.

  The script follows the book well. Certain parts were totally left out (due to their unimportance or in an effort to save screen time.)  Even with all the cuts the important areas from the book are still present.  Changes were made at a few parts to make it more exciting and the fighting is expanded.  All-in-all the script is great.

  Using New Zealand as middle-earth was the only way this movie would have looked so good. New Zealand's landscapes are so breathtaking it seams as though the movie was actually filmed in middle-earth itself.

  All of the cast were carefully selected and there is not a single bad actor.  I can't think of any one besides Sean Astin as Sam or Hugo Mortisen as Aragorn.  Every last line is said with utmost care and the acting is stunning.

  The sets are amazing.  Hobbiton is so realistic that one would think such a place existed.  All of the sets are so detailed and extensive that they transport you to middle-earth.

  The extended cut of the Fellowship also delivers two whole discs of extras that tell everything about the filming and production process.

  This great upgrade to the theatre version is most-definately a must-have for fans and will certaintly make a great addition to any DVD collection.",1123286400,4,1599,4.804428044280443
1312586,5,B00003CWT6,"""Fellowship of the Rings"" is the first installment of a trilogy, so don't expect a definite conclusion despite the nearly three hour running time. What you will get, however, is a thrilling movie that will have you anxiously awaiting the next installment next winter.

A breathtaking opening sequence details the war between an alliance of humans, dwarves and elves against the dark army of Sauron (Sala Baker), who possesses the One Ring of power that is enshrouding the land in evil.

During the conflict, Sauron loses the ring, ending his reign of terror and restoring peace throughout the land...for a time. Sauron's ring, as evil as its master, corrupts whomever wears it and must be kept away from Sauron, else the dark army return and finish the conquest they began many years ago.

After bringing about the end of several would-be owners, the ring ends up in the hands of Bilbo the Hobbit, who is days away from celebrating his 111th birthday. Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen) returns to celebrate his friend's birthday, but soon realizes the danger Bilbo has unwittingly brought to the Shire.

Gandalf enlists Bilbo's nephew, Frodo (Elijah Wood) to journey to the Cracks of Doom, the one place the ring can be destroyed and with it, the threat of Sauron.

Three other Hobbits accompany Frodo, while in close pursuit are Sauron's lackeys, led by the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee).

To assist them, two humans, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), an elf, Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and a dwarf, Gimil (John Rhys-Davies) form the fellowship of the ring to forever end the threat of Sauron.

With the exception of the Star Wars saga and the Star Trek universe, perhaps no other fantasy series has a more avid following than J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lords of the Ring"" novels.

The thought of having to please such a large fan base and giving the trilogy the depth it deserves on the big screen has proven too overwhelming for many Hollywood directors.

Probably wise decisions because the animated television versions of the trilogy and its prequel ""The Hobbit"" released in the 80s, have been thoroughly panned by Tolkien's fans.

Director Peter Jackson proves he was the right man for the job by maintaining the delicate balance of developing the characters enough to make you care about them when putting them through the trials of their journey.

The scenes are truly breathtaking. Every locale looks incredibly realistic, an amazing feat considering so much of the film had to be enhanced via computer special effects.

While the acting is solid throughout, Mortensen and Bean excel in their roles and really stand out with their performances as the conflicted and all too human...humans.

That weird feeling you experience as the Dark Army begins their pursuit of the Fellowship? That's suspense, something far too many movies lack these days, yet Jackson captures it with every scene depicting the army's progress towards our heroes.

After the incredible opening prologue, Jackson spends a bit too much time in the Shire developing the Hobbits, especially since we only care about a handful anyway.

Jackson gets a bit too theatrical in some scenes with wide shots, as if to remind you that you're watching an epic movie, not ""Deuce Bigelow.""

As the first part of a trilogy, you can't ask for too much more than this - great characters, villains evil enough to make you wonder if your favorite will survive the battle and an epic quest that won't be easily accomplished.",1123113600,,3494,4.9674099485420244

1312648,5,B00003CWT6,"This first film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy has surpassed expectations and silenced all but the harshest of critics. The director, Peter Jackson, has taken a book that many said was unfilmable and produced a masterpiece. The Fellowship of the Ring follows the journey of Frodo Baggins and his companions in a quest to destroy the One Ring, the evil ring created by Sauron in order for him to rule Middle Earth.

Although there are some well known names in the cast, none of them are so famous that their fame intrudes on the character. Sir Ian McKellan plays Gandalf the Grey as if born to the part as does Viggo Mortenson as the ranger Aragorn. Sean Bean plays Boromir, representative of men, Ian Holm is the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins and Christopher Lee plays a suitably evil wizard, Saruman, ally of Sauron. Legolas is played by Orlando Bloom who, although unknown at that time, was catapulted to stardom by his sensitive portrayal of the young Elven prince.

This four disc DVD features an extended edition of the film which is over two discs and also two discs of extra features. The additional scenes are seamlessly inserted into the movie and they certainly add to the viewing experience by explaining some things that were left out of the theatrical release. The extras on discs 3 & 4 are too numerous to mention but include several featurettes, artwork, costumes, weaponry and characters to name but a few. In addition, the collector set has a terrific pair of bookends modelled on the Argonath statues featured in the movie. This is sure to become one of the greatest movie experiences of modern times and this collector set is a `must' for any fan of Lord of the Rings.",1121817600,2,1680,4.672297297297297

The Black Riders are awesome, and Peter Jackson does a good job representing the fear they bring with them. Also, the movie has good contrast from dark and gloomy scenes, to bright and happy scenes. This movie had few places it could go wrong since it is based on the magical Lord of the Rings books. However, this movie went above and beyond that and this made it into a wonderful movie, and it is sure to become a classic in the future alongside with the books. I don't think that J.R.R. Tolkien would have been displeased with any part of this movie. Also, this movie is able to do what few others have achieved. When watching this movie, you feel like you are there watching all these things happen of the scene rather than on the television. In other words, this movie transports you straight to Middle-Earth.

1312651,3,B00003CWT6,"Well, I kind of feel confused that soooooo many people love this and the two sequels. I have to admit that the cast is good but Elijah Wood's wimpy character Frodo bugs me, and the plot is very solid and is the cinematography. The visuals are gorgeous. Well I'm sure that everyone knows the plot but in case not, it's about a ""fellowship"" of people that join together to take an evil and very powerful ring back to where it was made to destroy it. (It can only be destroyed in the lava where it was made) Well, anyway, for one, the movie starts off very slowly. It's not for a while that there's some battles. Now, while the battles are neat and cool and all that, I just found the movie very boring. It's always a drag for me to sit through this 3 hour movie. Oh, and yeah right, like I'd ever watch the extended version. That's probably like 4 hours! The movie progresses too slowly and it's just really boring to me. And believe me, I sat through Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, and Black Hawk down without feeling bored. Those movies are all really long but not once was I bored. This movie on the other hand had some interesting moments and very cool fights, but it had many unnecessary moments which made it boring. I closed my eyes a lot during it because I was just bored. Also, how could any human being sit through all 3 of these at one viewing at the movie theather or at home? That's just sick! You couldn't even pay me to do that. Also, how does this movie make sooooooooooooooo much more money than Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, and Black Hawk Down? Those 3 movies are based on true events that probably our relatives participated in. Those are based on reality!

In the book he picked up the sword in a tomb belonging to one of Aragorn's ancestors people but that was cut out of the film.

I particularly liked the director's and writer's commentary on the DVD.  They shared their thoughts about how they pictured the developement of the film.  I shall have to rewatch with some of the actor's commentary next time.

1312724,5,B00003CWT6,"The story itself in Lord of the Rings is massive. Some authors will briefly backstory to certain events or why a character reacts a certain way but the author doesn't really go in depth besides maybe a paragraph or so. J.R.R Tolkien went nuts going into detail about the backstory to his Middle-Earth that you almost ask is there a point? Do we really need the backstory of Isildur's parents or describing some minor character's activities 30 years before the main story? Not really. The movie manages to trim it out and condense a massive story into an incredibly enjoyable start to a classic trilogy.

The film starts out with the prologue, explaining the backstory of the Great Rings of Power and the One Ring, created by the Dark Lord Sauron. During a big battle in Sauron's land of Mordor, the King's successor Isildur manages to cut the ring from Sauron's hand, ""defeating"" him. But the Ring actually corrupts your mind like a really bad addiction and it eventually gets him killed because it ""wanted to be found"". It ends up being found by Smeagol, a hobbit who quickly falls under its power and keeps it prolonging his age by a good 500 years or so.

In the prequel to the books, the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins of the Shire(a country I guess) finds the Ring only the Ring wants to return to Sauron. The Ring passes to his nephew Frodo who has to escape the Shire since he's hunted by Sauron's elite force the Nazgul(also named Ringwraiths). Accompanying him are 3 of his Hobbit friends and eventually 2 men, Frodo's wizard friend Gandalf, an elf and a dwarf.

In terms of pacing and set design, Fellowship is definately the best. It has the quiet pastoral Hobbiton, my ideal retirement place Rivendell, the ethereal majestic Lothlorien and the massive Dwarf city in Moria. The amount of detail is rather stunning, moreso considering most are actually models/minatures(nicknamed ""bigatures"" due to their size).

I find certain pacing issues with the next 2. Two Towers just felt long saved by the intercutting of the Ents/Helm's Deep scenes. Return of the King you almost feel like ""how long ago since I saw that one scene?"". Fellowship's pacing however is perfect. Story/character scenes are long enough without being watch-checking then a big battle will start.

The characters were wisely chosen, although personally Orlando Bloom looks the part of Legolas and can pull off the badassness but his line delivery seems rather flat at times. And I don't know if it's just me but I couldn't see Hugo Weaving as the big Elf Elrond. Gollum is heard and briefly appears and is seen heavily in next 2. My favorite casting as to be Elijah Wood. Bright and smiling at the beginning than really messed up as the story continues. I love his expression on the top of Weathertop when the Ringwraiths appear.

While the next 2 augment the size and characters, Fellowship is probably my favorite and shouldn't be passed up.",1118966400,,2912,4.767857142857143

1312726,5,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings is not an epic struggle between ""good"" and ""evil"". That level of analysis is more appropriate for pop trash, such as Lucas' Star Wars.

Lord of the Rings is about addiction. Any addict, or anyone who works with addicts, will immediately recognize the ring's affect on its bearer as quite similar to the affect of serious addictive elements on the addict, such as that found in heroin addiction, alcohol addiction, or religion addiction. There are numerous parallels between the power of the ring and addictive behavior: the transformation that occurs in Bilbo, Frodo, Gollum and the Ringwraithes; the insipient, all-consuming desire to use the drug, but also the fear to do so; Frodo's desire to see Gollum restore to Smeagol, so that Frodo may hope to also return to a pre-addictive state; the inability to return to a pre-addictive state, as with Bilbo and Frodo; the overwhelming temptation to use, even among those who are cognizant of its terrible descrutive power, as with Galadriel and Gandalf; the development of multiple personalities, as with Gollum/Smeagol; the isolation of addiction, as with Gollum living alone in the depths of the Misty Mountains for countless years with his ""precious""; the discarding of loved ones, as with Frodo to Sam or Smeagol to Deagol; the delusion of strength acquired by addictive usage, such as with Boromir and Faramir; the deterioration of perceived strength over time, and ultimate corruption of the soul, as with Gollum and the Wraithes. These are all highly correlated with serious addictions.

With this understanding of addiction in mind, it is a painful yet inspirational experience to view the epic journey that occurs in the three LOTR movies. So much is familiar. Even Frodo's and Bilbo's decision to accompany the elves across the waters to live out their days is indicative of a life that has been utterly and irreversibly changed due to past addiction - the addict is never really cured.

Thank you so much Peter Jackson, for bringing Tolkein's books to life. Now, how about The Hobbit?",1116374400,,2061,5.02046783625731
1312727,5,B00003CWT6,"`Fellowship of the Ring' is the first of the three movies making up the cinema version of the novel, `Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien. This is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as `Ben-Hur' and `Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, `Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's `Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's `Gone With the Wind'.

It is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes or movies by itself.  They do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. `The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time. There is simply no way the whole story could be squeezed into three hours. Ralph Bakshi's attempt to do it in the early 1970's was a total failure.

Peter Jackson can thank his lucky stars that so many people in his audience were familiar with the novel. Otherwise the cliffhanger ending to `The Fellowship of the Ring' could have easily killed any interest in the movie rather than, as it did, enhance expectations for the second and third installments. I can still remember overhearing a fellow audience member muttering that he wanted his money back upon leaving the theatre after seeing Frodo and Sam paddle off across the Anduin, Merry and Pippin being rushed off to Orthanc, and Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas dispairing over the collapse of the Fellowship.

This is not to say that `The Fellowship of the Ring' is not without its rewards. With all of the truly demoniac scenes in the second and third movies, not to mention Gandalf's heroic stand against the Balrog in the Mines of Moria, I really find the single scariest moment in the whole movie to be the one I read on a dark Saturday night alone in our house while the dark riders on their black horses were chasing Frodo seated on a white horse in front of the Elven warrior Glorfindel as he races towards the river guarding the approaches to Rivendell. It is no surprise that this scene is one of the most powerful in Jackson's movie. Jackson even improves on the scene by replacing the mighty warrior, Glorfindel with the very slender, delicate looking Arwen, who would seem to not have the snowball's chance in hell, elven magic or no elven magic, standing against the nine black riders. For me, Jackson has ably captured virtually every scene he touched by matching or improving on my imagination. He does a similarly excellent job with enhancing the most important event in the whole book, the confrontation with the Balrog and the apparent loss of Gandalf. And, as many have said before, the New Zealand scenery played a major role in helping to breath life into the words. Can anything have done so well in realizing the Misty Mountains?

While almost all the scenes in `The Two Towers' made it to the screen, important parts of both `The Return of the King' and `The Fellowship of the Ring' were understandably left behind when the film was done. Oddly, the single most interesting character of the volume, Tom Bombadil, was practically the only significant character left out of the movie. Bombadil is quite the `deux ex machina', as he rescues the four hobbits from their first two perils without being given much of an introduction, even by know-it-all Gandalf. Bombadil only crops up one afterward in the council of Elrond where it is said that if the magic ring is given to him, he will probably loose it and just as he was `the first', he will be the last to disappear under the shadow cast by ubervillain Sauron. In all my readings of Tolkien, Bombadil has always been the most elusive and interesting character, even more so than the wizards, as the wizards, the elves, and every other creature in Middle Earth (with the possible exception of the Ents) is subject to the evil of the ring. This suggests that all the peoples of Middle Earth except Bombadil and the Ents are immigrants from somewhere else. `The Silmarillion' tells in great detail how the elves came to Middle Earth, and it is clear that the wizards and the men of Gondor and Arnor came from places beyond Middle Earth, but not Bombadil. What's more, Bombadil seems to have power over the ring, as he seems to make it disappear before the hobbits' eyes. Bombadil and his soul mate Goldberry seem to be great archetypes for the hippie counterculture of the 1960s. In fact, of all the characters in `Lord of the Rings', the contrast between Bombadil and Gandalf are two of the most interesting archetypes relevant to modern humans. I certainly have less trouble identifying with these two than with the diminutive, hairy-toed hobbits.

While the driving energy of the story comes from the need to overthrow the great evil Sauron, the greatest interest comes from battles of conscience on a much more `human' scale, as it occurs in Boromir, Gollum, Faramir, Theoden, and Frodo Baggins. The most important instance in this film is the struggle of Boromir between his sworn allegiance to the quest of the fellowship versus his fealty to his father, Denethor, steward of Gondor.",1115942400,2,5676,4.671
1312728,5,B00003CWT6,"When the The Fellowship of the Ring came out in theaters, I greeted its' arrival with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation.  I love the books and I was hoping that the films would not underachieve and do an injustice to Tolkien's vision as the earlier animated film had done.  When the Galadrial narration began, I knew that there was nothing to worry about.  The opening battle sequences were phenominal, but it was something else that convinced me that these movies were something special.  Later in the opening as Gandalf and Frodo rode into the Shire and the hobbitt children accosted them wanting fireworks, the images on the screen brought tears to my eyes.  Later as the Black Riders attack Frodo, their screams were bone chilling and fear-inspiring. This was Tolkien realized perfectly.  While some parts of the book have been omitted, overall the The Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent movie.  Peter Jackson was excellent in his direction.  What also stands out in this movie is the excellent performances by the cast.  Ian McKellan's Gandalf was perfect, capturing the right mixture of compassion, wry humor and strength that the wizard needed.  I found the performances of Elijah Wood and Sean Astin as Frodo and Sam to be the most compelling in this first film.  Viggo Mortenson captures dead on the majesty of the exiled, hidden heir of Gondor.  Orlando Bloom is fine as Legolas, John Rys-Davies is able to inject a perfect mixture of petulance and bravery in Gimli.  Christopher Lee's Saruman is the perfect evil foil for the Fellowship.  Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd first begin to shine as Merry and Pippin and bring some humor to the film.  Finally Sean Bean's Boromir is perfectly cast.  He embodies the arrogance, courage, despair and strength of the son of Gondor.  When he is killed giving up his life for his friends it is one of the most powerful moments in the film, on par with Gandalf's sacrifice against the Balrog.  In a film that astounds with it's imagery and sound, whose story is legendary, it is the ability of Peter Jackson to capture the human themes of the story that make The Fellowship of the Ring and the Lord of the Rings trilogy such a remarkable series of films.  The fact that a film as original and ground breaking as the The Fellowship of the Ring did not win Best picture and Best Director is proof of the idiocy of Hollywood.",1115337600,3,2384,4.728813559322034

True some prime characters were left out and I did miss the return to the Shire and finding men had taken over. But for the conventions of movie making some things must fall by the wayside, and I think Jackson did a supurb job weeding out what little he did.

1312845,4,B00003CWT6,"This is the best of three of the three, in my opinion.  It has great action, and it followed the book closely; so we know that it has a good story.  Here is my one problem with it.  There was too much focus on the battles and the power of the dark lord.  THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH MAGIC.  Read the books, and you will know what I'm talking about.  When you read the books, you look forward to the fantasy magic feeling.  THis movie makes the battles the climax of the movie.  That's why I thought the beginning of the movie was the best.  It had more of the magical feeling, but then there goes the banging drums and violins and hack n slash battle.  That was not what the books were about.

Now, I don't want to complain too much because Peter Jackson still did a great job, and did a LOT of hard work on these movies.  There good.  But I definitely don't think that they were like the books.  The books are better and always will be.  Read them and watch this movie.",1113436800,2,963,4.102150537634409

Director Peter Jackson actually improes a little on charactar development, but at the same time delivers us the powers and horrors of the ring.

  There are so many great performances in this film though. I mean, wow. Great cast. Truth be told, there's far less action than in Return and TT, but we don't need action here.

1312848,5,B00003CWT6,"For those unfamiliar with the book, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" revolves around Frodo Baggins, a hobbit who lives a relatively peaceful life in the village of Bag End... that is, until fate and extraordinary circumstances send him on an important quest. In a beautifully-conceived prologue, it is revealed that in the distant past, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a ring with which he could rule Middle Earth. However, even though Sauron was defeated by an alliance of the humans, elves, and dwarves, the ring was never destroyed, allowing Sauron to survive and slowly recuperate over several millennia. After about 3000 years, the ring came into the possession of hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm of ""The Sweet Hereafter""), who kept it for sixty years.

However, the ring holds a dark power, and it soon begins to exert its evil influence on Bilbo. Under the advice of his long-time wizard friend Gandalf the Grey, the ring falls to Bilbo's young heir Frodo, who must destroy it by casting it into the fires where it was forged, atop Mt. Doom in the dark land of Mordor. Unfortunately, not only must Frodo avoid Sauron's soldiers, who are scouring Middle Earth for the ring, but he must also avoid the corrupting influence of the ring on both himself and those around him.

At first, Frodo is joined by Gandalf, his best friend Sam, and cousins Merry and Pippin. However, it soon becomes apparent that destroying the ring is the responsibility of all of Middle Earth, and so a 'Fellowship of the Ring' is formed, with the addition of humans Aragorn and Boromir, elf Legolas, and dwarf Gimli. And so this party of nine sets out on a difficult journey to Mt. Doom, where they must not only contend with the evil forces of Sauron, but also divisions within the fellowship that threaten to tear it apart.

A mythic quest, magic spells, elves, a dark lord of evil... true, these elements are nothing new, as they have been seen before in countless other fantasy stories, as recently as ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"", as well as other genres, such as the ""Star Wars"" trilogy. However, it was the literary works of Tolkien, such as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, that gave birth to the modern fantasy genre, giving it mainstream respectability and influencing a countless number of writers who would follow in his footsteps (even strongly influencing other genres, as evidenced by the numerous ""Lord of the Rings"" references found in the science fiction series ""Babylon 5"") . Tolkien, a major scholar of Old and Middle English at Oxford University, had a passion for languages and a keen understanding of mythology and lore, and during the Thirties and Forties, he channeled his energies into what would eventually become the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Drawing inspiration from ancient lore and age-old themes, Tolkien crafted an entire world on paper, with its own history, culture, and languages, crafting a literary masterpiece of unmatched richness and unparalleled depth. Like the recent ""Harry Potter"" phenomenon, ""Lord of the Rings"" achieved cult status first in the United Kingdom, and it would not be until the 1950s that it would reach the shores of the United States and achieve a similar standing.

As a film, ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is an astounding achievement. Jackson, who has great respect and admiration for the material, has crafted a rousing action-adventure that, despite its three-hour running time, never feels long or bloated. With the lush natural settings of New Zealand, breathtaking matte work, and the judicious use of CGI, the film transports the audience to Middle Earth, a world filled with wonder and spectacle. Some of the standout sequences include the opening battle scene that sets the stage for the story, Frodo's mountaintop run-in with a band of Ring Wraiths, the underground city of Moria and a run-in with the Balrog fire demon, and the climactic battle between the fellowship and an army of orcs. Yet despite such grand and epic sequences, the film's heart wisely stays close to Frodo's coming of age, and his gradual understanding of the heavy responsibility that has been thrust upon him.

To bring the characters to life, Jackson has banded together an all-star cast. As Frodo, Wood imbues the character with the right balance of innocence, vulnerability, and conviction, reflecting the transformation that the young hobbit undergoes during the course of the film. Holm is also quite good as the elderly Bilbo, who yearns to do so much with the little remaining time that he has, while Astin is likable as Frodo's ever-loyal sidekick. McKellan brings a stately presence to the production with his portrayal of Gandalf, while Mortensen conveys the honor and dignity of Aragorn. Among the supporting cast, standout performances include a sinister Christopher Lee (""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"") as the fallen wizard Saruman, Hugo Weaving (""The Matrix"") as the elf leader Elrond, Liv Tyler (""Armageddon"") as Mortenson's love interest Arwen, and Cate Blanchett (""Bandits"") as the beautiful Galadriel.

""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a fantastic start to a film trilogy, and if the next two installments ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" are of its equal (or better), ""Lord of the Rings"" may even end up eclipsing the popularity of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Godfather"". With its stirring story, rousing action set pieces, strong performances, and unparalleled spectacle, this ""Ring"" may very well rule them all.

Secondly, I think that this first movie is the best, as well as the truest to the book, in the series.  As to the complaints by fans of the books...artistically, and in order to make the movie succesful, certain things had to be nudged.  Arwen's role is amplified, but not terribly so.  They keep her character excellently well.  Other changes are very subtle and relatively unimportant.  My biggest qualm about the movie adaptations was that in the extended scene wherin the fellowship is given gifts by Galadriel, Boromir (my personal favorite, the most complex and human of all the Fellowship) is the only one who doesn't receive a gift (AHEM!  He gets a golden belt, for your information, Pete Jackson Sir!).  That was quite unfair.  But overall, it follows the book more closely than any other successful movie I've ever seen, excepting such classics as ""The Yearling"" and ""Old Yeller,"" which are both much easier to adapt to the screen than Tolkien's detailed work.

Then, I finally saw the film and was blown away. Of course, I only saw the mere fragment of the film that was the the theatrical version and, to add salt to the wound, I saw it in...FULL SCREEN! Sadly, this was how I would see the other two films as well. But soon, I decided to rent The Return of the King Extended Edition. But there were no copies left so I decided to start from the beginning. I rented The Fellowship of the Ring. Having read only scripts of the extended editions, it was a thrill to see them played out before me in reality. After getting the box set for my birthday, it was a thrill to watch the documentaries for the first time, having only seen most of the documentaries on The Two Towers.

Here are the specific reasons why I loved the movie:

1. The scenery is so breathtakingly beautiful. It looks so organic unlike other epics that take place on Planet Earth. The costumes and the sets look so authentically Middle Earth. Even the landscape of New Zealand looks more like Middle Earth.

2. The performances from the cast are amazing. All of these characters are practically channeling the characters from the book. Thanks to this movie, years later, I was watching The Aviator starring Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and I was thinking, ""Galadriel's playing Katherine Hepburn!"" My favorite performance out of all of these talented actors is Christopher Lee as Saruman. He is the main reason why I tried to rent The Return of the King Extended Edition.

3. The documentaries are fascinating unlike most humdrum making-of documentaries.

4. The special effects are amazing. Again, it looks so real.

If New Zealand's scenary doesn't take your breath away, the set enhancements, acting, effects, and musical score should.

It's rare that casting is so spot on that the actor's face is stuck in my mind as I continue to read the books.  Yet, this film actually brings what I imagined to life.

He leaves with his friend and gardner Samwise Gamgie along with two other hobbits, Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took. The four hobbits make their way from the shower to bree after being followed and nearly attacked by ring wraiths. None of the four hobbits have ever left the shire before this adventure and find Bree to be somewhat of a scary place filled with ""Big-Folk"" or human men.

While in Bree they meet Strider who later is revieled as Aragorn king of men. Much to the dislike of the hobbits he takes them to Rivendell. They stop for a night at Weathertop an anchinet watch place of men. While at Weathertop they get attacked again by the wraiths. Frodo get's stabbed in the chest by the witch king of the wriaths and Aragorn, Merry, Pippin, and Sam must hurry to get him to Rivendell to Lord Elrond a wonderful healer amongs the elves and ruler of Rivendell. They meet Arwen, daughter of Elrond. She offers to takes the wounded Frodo to Rivendell, and gives a thrilling chace with the 9 ring wraiths.

She makes it to the river that borders Rivendell just before the wound nearly kills Frodo. Frodo next wakens in Rivendell well and ready to go home. A council of Elrond is summond together with someone from each race present. They discuss what it is to become of this one ring that rules all races in middle earth and come to one decision. The Ring must be destroyed to save middle earth. Now the task is out and someone has to agree to take the ring to the fires of Morder and throw it in to let it be destroyed. After all argues Frodo realizes that he is the one who must do this.

He does not leave Rivendell alone, he has 8 more companions. Legolas, a prince elf from Mirkwood, Aragorn future king of men, Gimli son of Gloin - a dwarf from the mountains, Gandalf the Grey Wizard, Borimer song of the stuard of Gondor, Merry, Pippin, and Sam. Along with Frodo these are the 9 companions that set off to destroy the one ring. They go through the Misty Mountains and have several attacks with orc's and trolls, and meet an achient demond a belroc. A creature that is half smoke and shadow and half flame. Gandalf challenges the Belroc and is assumed to fall to his death.

The fellowship must still continue on their journey. They come to another elven community called the Lothlorien and meet white lady, Lady Galadriel. They stay the night in Lothlorien, and continue the next morning. They cross the river and continue on boat. They are attacked by a new bread of enimies called the fighting Urik-hai, bread for one purpose by the white wizard Sarumon. Bormire is killed by several arrow's, but before he dies he finally acknoledges Aragorn as the King of men. While Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Merry, and Pippin continue fighting the Urik-hai Frod and Sam head off to the Mountains of Mordor alone.

Merry and Pippin are taken by the Urak-hia as hostages to Suraman. They think the two hobbits carry the ring. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli take a vow to leave Frodo and Sam to themselves and save Pippin and Merry. And this where the fellowship ends...until the Two Towers. I love this movie, and the soundtracks. I also love pictures of this movie.

It stars: Sean Astin as Sam, Sean Bean as Boromir, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, Billy Boyd as Pippin, Ian Holm as Bilbo, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian McKellean as Gandalf the Grey, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Hugo Weaving as Lord Elrond, Elijah Wood as Frodo, and Marton Csokas as Lord Celeborn husband of Lady Galadriel.

There's little else I can add to all the well-deserved critical acclaim this film has drawn, except to urge any viewers who haven't read the book to do so.  As a film this first installment is pretty much flawless and by far the strongest of the trilogy, likewise with the book.

Having the read the trilogy many times over as a kid, I was impressed with 99% of this film version.  My only complaints: the part where they are in Moria feels like it all happened within one day in the movie, whereas in the book the slow passage of time as the characters move through its oppressive subterranean darkness over the course of 4 days is much better communicated.

Also, I simply am at a loss as to who on earth decided to cast Cate Blanchett as the Lady Galadriel, who in the book is described as a magical woman possessing the most ethereal and piercing beauty.  Blanchett looks anemic and just plain strange-looking...someone like Uma Thurman would've been far better suited for the role.

This film in particular makes me want to go buy an LCD projector in order to get the true huge-screen film experience, as well as appreciate my home theater system!",1109808000,3,1184,4.556603773584905

But the fight scenes go on and on and on and on. I got thoroughly bored and started fast forwarding. There was not much left. The fight scenes were pure Hollywood schlock, complete with slime and alien-style fangs. The movie is mostly aimed at the Bart Simpson mentality.

The characters are well played, the plot has almost no holes in it, and above all, the scenery is fantastic.

The creative story line which highlights the broader theme of good and evil, only begins to describe the Lord of the Rings--The fellowship of the Ring.  The landscapes in the movie are exquisit and breathtaking.  Like the Last Samari, where scenes of Japan are shown from a higher elevation, the footage provided in The Lord of the Rings gives the watcher not only higher elevation shots of mountains, valleys and amazing waters, but lower more close up shots of beutiful vistas.

The creative story and great views are equally surrounded by dramatic make up and character development.  Frodo, the main character, begins his journey which will define him as a person.  The film provides the viewer with amazing and challenging battles, each more surprising and better than the last, that begin to define Frodo's character.

The frendship and loyalty themes developed between the Fellowsip of the Ring are important messages for the targed audience as well.  For Sam and Frodo, two of the nine Fellowship members, perhaps the strongest and most lasting bond is made.  True, friendship has no boundries, not event the lack of ability to swim when Sam tries to catch Frodo as Frodo begins to row away on his journey to destroy the Ring.

Most trilogies make the first two movies good and the 3rd movie rubbish; Back to the future, Jaws, Terminator, Matrix, Blade. However, this trilogy, with all its hours for one story, couldn't even do that, let alone the 3 I hoped for.

Granted 'Fellowship of the ring' had me. But I had hoped to see Frodo stare, wide-eyed, at the same king knocking everyone about in 'Fellowship' by the end of return of the king. I did not want to see a big animal-like eye which had to be ripped off from the Lion-o sword as seen on 'Thundercats'. The wars were useless and a bit pointless as neither had anything to do with the ring being destroyed.

I would have been so much happier if they threw another 25-30 mins into 'Fellowship' and let Frodo fight Sam over throwing the ring into the volcano.... and then let either of the two throw it in.

If you want to see some green and some special effects. If need to stare at something for hours because you have nothing better to do and hope to feel a connection to other human beings due to its awards and some mild depression. This movie might be okay therapy for you.

1312929,5,B00003CWT6,"Well, I was browsing, and I came upon the review left by the "" Critic"" that claimed that the Fellowship of the Ring was ripped off from the Willow. HELLO? The Fellowship of the Ring was freaking written before George Lucas and Ron Howard were beginning to pick up a camera! It was written way before the Willow was created. So, Mr. Critic, please abstain from flaming things when you obviously have no real idea what they are about. The Fellowship is an amazing book, and makes for a lovely movie. J.R.R. Tolkein's world is richly painted with Peter Jackson's deft direction of this movie, it really captures the emotion of the book, if not, perfect canonical rendering. The cast is great- Viggo Mortensen especially, he created a Aragorn that I think no one could have possibly played again. The first movie is  but a taster...the rest just get better, and better. The story is timeless, and the film is as well...bringing back a little spark of the ideals which can be so easily lost in the chaotic world we live in today. The length intimidates people- but it is completely worth it. And anyways, you have to see the first movie to get to the second, and the second to the third [which I think is best], don't you? Better get watching...believe me, you'll find yourself hooked into the characters, and the storyline before you know it...",1106438400,4,1340,4.630252100840337
1312989,5,B00003CWT6,"First of all, in my opinion, they are epic, inspiring, and beautiful. The sets are sweeping and the score is memorable. Now, as for some facts. John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in 1892 and his epic novel, The Lord of the Rings was written around 1954-1955. The movie Willow, which this movie has been compared to, was made in 1988. Unless George Lucas invented a time machine, there was no way he could have plagerized the movie. Also, to clear up the misconception, the three movies are not sequels of each other, but a screenplay of a massive book divided into three parts. I hope that any ignorant statements about the Lord of the Rings does not affect anyone's viewing of the movie. The characters were well developed and the story was gripping. At times, the action slowed purely to develop the characters, but it was necessary and worthwhile. The telling of the tale almost gives a realisitc quality to this tale of hobbits and elves. You can almost imagine having a friend like Sam, fiercely protective, amazingly loyal, but always staying on the sidelines until he is forced to act. Anyway, I hope everyone tries to see the first movie at least once. The extended version may be too much for some, so as a newbie to Tolkien, you might want to see the original version, or even better, read the book. And, for all we know, the tale of Willow was inspired by The Lord of the Rings.",1106265600,4,1389,4.53784860557769
1312990,5,B00003CWT6,"My first glimpse of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy was a trailer in a movie theater.  I remember thinking what spectacular scenery and cool-a bunch of good looking men climbing up a snow covered mountain!  I told my dad and brother about it, because they are big Tolkien fans.  However, I was skeptical.  We own the animated version of The Hobbit, and I never really cared for it.

When it came to the theaters, I decided that I had to see it.  I went to the theater and sat in awe.  I had never seen anything like it-especially the orcs.  Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Elijah Wood as Froddo stand out, but the movie is a group effort with everyone providing stellar performances.  The brass band playing the theme during the ""evil"" parts is perfect-lending a gripping, uneasy feeling.  I fell in love with the story.  The story of good and evil, of friendship and hope is the best part-it stands alone.

Buying the trilogy on DVD means you don't have to wait a year to see what happens!  The extended version completes the story.  The Fellowship of the Ring remains my favorite of the three, because it lured me into its world.  It is a cinematic wonder.",1106265600,2,1155,4.45933014354067
1312991,5,B00003CWT6,"Now that I have all three Extended Editions, I will go as far as to say the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is my favorite entry into the LORD OF THE RINGS movie trilogy. It is obviously not to discredit the other two films by any means. THE RETURN OF THE KING is extremely comparable in emotional content, and comes a close second. THE TWO TOWERS is exremely important to the story and its exhaustive production merits its support. However, the FotR seems more entertaining and is full of wonderful cinematic expression. We see a story and character development that has few rivals. It is important to be welcomed to the characters properly and all are introduced well under Peter Jackson's direction, as well as Fran, Peter and Philippa's careful script handling. Not to mention the additional scenes are the most poignant or necessary of all three EE DVDs.

As it goes without saying, the extra features for the DVD were (and still are) absolutely amazing to behold in quantity and quality. Any relevant or trivial facts about the filming of FotR are crammed into two supplementary discs in addition to the two discs containing the actual extended film. Four seperate commentary tracks complement the movie itself. The absolutely vital stuff is covered by Pete, Fran and Philipa. And they are actually fun to listen to and can have a laugh about their work. The in-depth production work behind the scenes span the next two tracks with multiple people responsible for the work. The cast of FotR share the last track and is a favorite. The hobbits have fun remembering the process and enjoy a joke or two. The two wizards (Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee) are more punctuated on how they tried to interpret their roles for the movie.

The video and audio are on par with the best demo-reference material. This DVD is what home theater systems were made for. Hardly a video artifact to find. The colors are bright where they need to be and somber where they need but all of it is clear and sharp. And may I add of all the Trilogy, FotR uses a more expansive pallette than TT and RotK. Glorious Hobbiton pastures contrast dark, bleached mines of Moria. The sound is awesome and should be taken advantage of. Your subwoofer will beg for mercy when Sauron 'explodes' in the beginning prologue. Dialog is crisp and of course the music by Howard Shore demands your attention.

The real highlight of the EE DVD are of course the two appendice discs. As if the film itself isn't long enough, you'll spend hours pouring through the extras. Two or three sittings may be required by some. The extras just may make some appreciate the work put in by the production crew and cast. Granted, a generous budget made it possible, but it makes me proud to know WETA did not waste any of it by any means of the imagination. Anjd this is true of the whole Trilogy, not just FotR. For under $30, it is a must have. The Trilogy is maybe a cornerstone of film history and FotR is, in my opinion, the flagship of the series. And remember the other two DVDs are equally impressive productions to have as well.",1106092800,3,3077,4.611313868613139
1312992,5,B00003CWT6,"22nd December 2001, Saturday, 2h00 pm - I was at one of the greatest Lisbon Cinemas, So Jorge, to watch The Lord Of The Rings, The Fellowship Of The Ring!

I have had read the books years before and loved them! I bought everything that Tolkien wrote! And... when I heard that they are going to pass the books to the silver screen I get too excited! More than usual for a movie!

In that far far year I read all the newspapers who talked about the movie and I read also about the 25 minutes of the LOTR Trilogy showned in Cannes and the success they caused! More and more I was excited to see!

But I could not imagine that after 6 minutes of watching the  magnific LOTR logo and the prologue with Cate Blanchett as the narrator I was in for something special!

I KNEW in the first minutes that it was going to be a spectacular movie in all the way!

Everything is in it's right place - the actors, the score, the landscapes, scenery, visual effects... I believe Middle Earth is real! After watching the movie I really belive in the characters, in the places... Me and my friends run after the movie to buy the original soundtrack by Howard Shore! If you can buy all of them - especially the Leatherette Editions, wich now become a treasure to keep and very hard to find!

I didn't know nothing about Peter Jackson, the director/producer/actor/musician who also wrote the adapted screenplay with her wife Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, but who reveals a great talent to tell the magnificent Tolkien story! And a passion too great of the story and of J.R.R. Tolkien! Thanks to him!

Again, the movies are different from the books! Are different things! The Special Extended DVD Edition is much better because adds character development and more scenes and music as well - great ones! Aragorn in the tomb of his mother at Rivendell, conversation between Aragorn and Boromir, Legolas throwing lots of more arrows! The voice of Sauron at the Councill Of Elrond scene and so on...

I enjoy also the Appendices Part I and II! Explaining all that we want to know about the cast and crew and the big designer team with Alan Lee and John Howe, the Weta Workshop and the visual effects! The training of the actors, the son of Viggo tell his father to accept the role of Aragorn! Also an introduction at Tolkien's world and life! Adapting a screenplay bigger than anything! The problems in cutting scenes! I understand why they had to cut some scenes and give more depth to Arwen and not showing Glorfindel - Arwen's brother and Frodo's saviour as in the book! I accept ALL of their decisions and I'm glad they do so!

The last but not the least the package with the beautifull drawings by Alan Lee makes the edition much better also! Everything is good - fitted the story so well! That's why I have no words that fully describe my feelings about this movie!

This movie IS my all-time favorite! This movie is art! And surely it's magic!",1105401600,5,2926,4.491525423728813

  The 2nd DVD was perfect until chapter 39 when it just freezes.  It froze our DVD player and froze the DVD Player on my Powerbook.  Not fun.  So we are sending this back.

  I have got online and read other things like this about the Two Towers, so we are leaving that one sealed too and sending them back.  I hope nobody else has this problem and I don't know how we can live with not having this in our home any longer, I guess we'll try again.

The back cover said something along the lines of how the extra material isn't just deleted scenes but that it adds to the character development and I have to agree.

1313066,5,B00003CWT6,"As a self-proclaimed Tolkien enthusiast (my friends usually use a different adjective), it's hard to separate the book from the movie and judge the movie purely on its merits and not the stark and sometimes disappointing differences. The biggest example, as it is for most fans of The Lord of the Rings, is Arwen's amplified role. Watching her take Frodo across the ford was hard to watch, because her defense of him greatly diminished Frodo's strength. In the book, Frodo himself, struggling against the wound given to him by the Ringwraith, beat the Nazgul to the ford, and with great courage raised his sword against them in defiance. Also, no whisperings of Arwen brought the river crashing down on the Nazgul as they attempted to cross; that was the work of Elrond. And the figures of the horses the came out of the froth of the waves were Gandalf's added touch.

This may seem like a minor point, but it isn't. Tolkien was showing us the strength and resiliency of Frodo, and in a more general sense, that of the diminutive race of Hobbits.

That's the last I'll say about the differences (well, maybe). There were others, some bothered my greatly, others less, but...on to the film.

The construction of the Shire was masterfully done. When I saw the film in the theater, I'm not ashamed to say that a tear formed in my eye. They had done such a marvelous job of creating Hobbiton that I felt I was actually seeing it, as opposed to having read about so many times. It was beautiful and moving.

Since this is a fantasy, one thing is more important than all others. The magic. It has to be believable, and the people (or beings) who employ it must also be believable. That is where the brilliance of Ian McKellan came in. Without him, the movie would have been much less than it was - and I would imagine that most people either don't or can't comprehend why. That isn't meant to be an insult - it's just that not many understand how essential it is that the magic be believable.

Elrond seemed too harsh (and I'm not comparing Hugo Weaving's portrayal to my expectation) for the Lord of Rivendell, and the scene where Frodo accepted the burden of taking the ring to Mordor too short - and therefore difficult to follow. I saw the film with many people who had not read the books, and they all had many questions regarding that.

In my mind, almost all of my problems with the differences between the book and the movie were resolved once the characters entered Moria. I was absolutely blown away. There was only one moment where I doubted that I was under a great mountain, and that was when Frodo and Aragorn were standing together on the broken staircase, falling forward. I saw the ""blue screen"" effect. Otherwise, Balin's tomb, the tome Gandalf read from (and McKellan's delivery), the immensity of Dwarrodelf (which was the name that men gave for the underground city of Moria), the Orcs crawling out of ever crack and crevice like crawling spiders, and then finally the Balrog, were splendid creations.

Every ""Tolkien enthusiast"" that I knew was anxious to see how the Balrog was rendered in the film. Tolkien himself gave very little description of the creature, with the exception that it was winged, and that it was of fire and shadow, and that it was quite large. I don't know one person who was disappointed by the Balrog, nor by the scene on the Bridge of Khazad-dum. Again, McKellan displayed his brilliant talent, and Jackson and his team brought the scene to life more than any other in the film. For many who had never read the books, it was a shock to see the Balrog's sword shatter on Gandalf's. After all, for all they knew (according to the film, that is), he was an old man in a battered hat who leaned upon a thorny staff, dabbled in fireworks and pipeweed, and was inferior to Saruman (although he was most certainly *not* - that was my biggest personal peeve). When the light shone from him, like a halo enveloping an angel, they saw a small part of who he really was.

The frustration that I felt when I left the theater was mostly resolved with this Extended Version. After all, Arwen is still in the movie, but the additions that were made - one example being the elves singing a lament to Gandalf in Lothlorien - vastly improved the texture of the work, and brought it closer to Tolkien's intent.

It needs to be noted that Jackson succeeded at something that very few people could have. The Lord of the Rings was be one of the most difficult books to adapt to film, and yet he pulled it off (disparities notwithstanding).

I'm anxiously awaiting the Extended Version of The Return of the King, which I should be watching in about three and a half hours. I can't wait to review that, and talk about how the specific additions they're making improved that film. <grin>",1102982400,5,4804,4.575581395348837
1313067,4,B00003CWT6,"Let me start by saying that when I first saw this movie, I thought it would be the dumbest movie I'd ever seen.  While I will agree that it may be slightly overrated, I loved it.  Clearly, this is a movie you will either love or hate.  If you're not into fantasies, then I would not reccomend this movie to you.  If you are an open and imaginative person, then you will probably like this film.

I will not go into great depth to explain the plot, because many others already have.  Basically, this is the story of a ring (surprise) that is connected with an the spirit of an evil force, and wants to get back to its master, while Frodo Baggins (Elija Wood) is on a quest to destroy it.  Yes, it's a long film and probably could have been shortened, but I found it rather enjoyable.

This movie is not nearly as bad as some people are saying, but at least most of the negative reviewers seem to be people who actually saw the movie, so at least they gave it a chance.  Still, other negative reviewers anger me.  There are some who give the film bad reviews and haven't even seen it!  So those peoples' opinions mean absolutely nothing.

The costumes were all designed brilliantly, just how you would have imagined them in the book and a lot of metal was created just for the movie. It includes an awesome soundtrack enough to give you the fealing of doom. The biggest attraction to this movie is the scenery, it goes from sunny, grassy town shires to great forests huge empire buildings, elvish lakes and firy pits. It is another huge world packed full of orcs, goblins, humans, elves and of course the mighty Bellrock.

possibly the best movie I have ever seen I recommend that you see it, you will deffinately not regret it.",1102377600,5,1241,4.53125
1313069,5,B00003CWT6,"The epic starts here.

It was hard to fathom The Lord Of The Rings ever becoming a live-action motion picture. Two horribly failed attempts to animate the story (both failed so miserably the funding was pulled before they could be completed) proved the work was too big, too complicated and too adored by readers to be translated less than perfectly. On top of that Tolkien created this thick, complex world and languages that could not easily be shown or translated to the screen.

But Peter Jackson did it.

From the grand opening shots of the Shire, to the showdown with the Balrog, this is a moving, stirring, emotional spectacle. A masterpiece.

The episodic first installment covers the handing over of the one ring from Hobbit Bilbo to nephew Frodo, neither of whom know the rings powers or origin. A dark force, Sauron, who forged the ring of power to control the lords and kings of Man, Elves and Dwarves. Existing only as a powerful spirit, a great fiery eye, Sauron searches tirelessly for the ring that can bring him back to form and power. When Wizard Gandalf figures out the nature of the ring (in an abiding Duh! moment) he hurries Frodo - who is quickly joined by fellow hobbits Merry, Pippin and loyal servant Samwise - away from the shire so that Gandalf can figure what the enemy is up to, plot a course of action and find a way for Frodo to be released of his task of baring the desperately hunted ring of power. He fails, being capture by turned-evil wizard Saruman and does not meet up with Frodo at the designated place and time.

Frodo and friends being pursued by Dark Riders, the kings of men possessed by the one ring and now Ring Wraiths, is taken under wing by Stryder, a mysterious Vagabond who seems to know more about Frodo that Frodo.

The journey takes them to Rivendell, one of home of the elves, and master Elrod. A council of Man, Wizard, Dwarf and Hobbit is convened and nine go forward to destroy the ring, by carrying it into the stronghold of Sauron and casting it into the fire from which it was forged.

The Quest take Frodo and Company to the top of a mountain nearly brought down by Saruman to the mines of Moria, where the entire population of Dwarfs mining it have been slaughtered and the Fellowship must face an impress army of thousands of orcs, a cave troll and the satan-like Balrog.

In the end the story concludes by not solving anything, but leaving us open for the next film.

The ride is breathtaking, the sets are amazing, the costumes, acting, directing, music and sound are all dead on perfect. Peter Jackson never lets the camera stop moving and knows how to film action in a personal and involving way that is rarely seen. This grand operatic quest is on a scale never before seen and the DVD and Dolby or DTS sound are brilliant. There's nearly an over abundance of commentary tracks here, nearly everyone involved gets one, the actors and director / writer are the hands down best and worth the four hours to listen to.

Never mind the theatrical version, that was great this is grand. A must have.",1102377600,4,3062,4.540834845735027

Did he have something against the Orcs, who stink of urine and rat nests, or did he just want to give us more moments of boredom? I find there to be no redeeming values in this tasteless film which wants to simply reek in great amounts of money, win undeserving oscars and proclaim itself under the pretense of a great film, to be the best movie making experience.

1313071,5,B00003CWT6,"I have never seen a greater movie than that of Peter Jackson's The Lord Of The Rings The Fellowship Of The Ring Special Extended Dvd Edition. I have read quite enough of these ridiculous reviews that rubbish Peter Jackson as a director, so I won't review the movie in great depth as others before me have. If you would like to see an amazing fictional fantasy movie that takes you to another world far away from this one, full of wonderful creatures, unforgettable adventures, and amazing characters, than I whole-heartedly urge you to view this epic and give thanks to a movie director and cast for adapting the greatest story ever told into a motion picture.

I came across one person's review, (Andrew Radar,) that proclaimed the movie was to long, yet this same person entitles his review as ""An epic in greatness and length."" He takes a whole star away from the movie because of this.

It is well known to many that the movie probably could have gone for many more hours but it would probably cause fewer people to sit through the whole thing. Personally I look foward to when I will receive the final extended edition in The Lord Of The Rings, that being The Return Of The King Special Extended Dvd Edition, so that i may sit in the same chair for over eleven straight hours enjoying every second of these amazing movies.

Another reviewer ""Burlap Mcgee,"" states that the movie is not in the same league as others such as Star Wars. I had a good long belly laugh at that one. I have seen all Star Wars movies to date and there is more depth in five minutes of The Lord Of The Rings then in all of those tedious, unimaginitive, laser gun, spaceship movies that George Lucas became so famous for.

He also claims that the movies are typical Hollywood fare, ""you've seen them once you've seen them 100 times"". I would say that's another example of closed-minded ignorance.

This very same person complains that the movie has bland music compared to the Star Wars score. In my opinion the score in The Lord Of The Rings is very captivating.

Then he goes on with some ridiculous notion that the movie stinks of today's clinches and fads. This particular moron must not realise that Peter Jackson was adapting from a book that was written over 50 years ago. It's obvious to this reviewer that

Mr Mcgee has a keen perception that allows him to enter others minds and see that millions are amazed simply because of the pretty visuals. This level of ignorance is unforgettable, and I for one imagine myself still able to chuckle at his review even into old age.

Now believe me there are many more ignorant, closed-minded reviews but I won't waste anymore of my time reviewing them. I am just trying to let those of you out there that have not seen the movie know that it is a great masterpiece, that we are all lucky to be privy to.",1101600000,2,2832,4.50682261208577

1313074,5,B00003CWT6,"When the movies came out, I was familiar with The Hobbit, and that was it. . .admittedly.  So with basically an open mind, I went and saw this movie when it first came out with my brother who'd already read the books, but gave nothing away.

I was enthralled.  It was a fantastic story, with a few parts that just seemed a bit empty, but the casting, and the grand vision were spectacular.  And I already knew there were two more following, which would get more polish and enhancement.

Afterwards, I read the books . . . yes, all three, just to see how they were.  For a bit, I was a little disappointed like many fans in the parts that were omitted, or changed to give some characters more screen time, but I found that I didn't dislike the movie at all.  Peter Jackson did with the book all that he could and still release a movie that wouldn't leave you in a seat for the better part of 6 hours.

That's the breadth of Tolkien's world and skill at storytelling.  In order to make these books into a movie really telling the whole story, you'd wind up with a super-long movie.

So kudos to Peter Jackson for developing the books as he could into a rip-roaring yarn that folks who are both fans,or don't have any clue who Mr. Tolkien was can enjoy.  It's one of those movies you might be disappointed in if you go see it with high expectations of the way it is in your mind.  I can see that now after reading the books.  You might look at a chapter one way, and then Jackson did it Completely different for the movie.  Is human nature to look at them in different lights.

But still, I enjoyed this movie, and I'm glad I waited for the Extended version, because the extra and deleted scenes flesh out what was missing, creating a better overall picture and a Much better story.

The added features are a large bonus if features are what you look for in a DVD release, and I've enjoyed them as well.  Count me as one who wants to vacation to New Zealand some time in their life.

Now I'm waiting to pick up the second two movies in Extended version, before the obvious Total trilogy version comes in one big set, with bookends, or perhaps an elvan cloak or some other special movie momento :)

1313133,5,B00003CWT6,"'The Fellowship' was the second best movie of the three, in my opinion. The ringwraiths are portrayed perfectly, and they add a constant fear lurking in the corners of your mind. It had a few minor flaws, but not as major as those in the 'Two Towers'. Probably the most tedious of the three, as it doesn't have any major battle scenes in it, but a must-see if you are to see the next two parts. I think that the best acting parts are in the Prancing Pony, with Strider, and during the Uruk-hai attack. The soundtrack is the final element that adds to a near-perfect film. If you see this movie, stay for the credits, because they play two beautiful songs during them. If you see this movie but not the other two, it is much less exciting, and if you see one of the others before this one, they will make little sense.",1099180800,,817,4.27741935483871

For TTT, the extended version has a much better flow and just makes better sense...but in Fellowship, those extra scenes feel like just that - extra scenes.  The flow is weird.  The ""Concerning Hobbits"" sequence would've been better off as a separate feature...it's a half an hour into the movie before anything happens!!  One scene (when they are captured in Lothlorien) was filmed before the costumes & makeup were even finalized, and it really sticks out like a sore thumb.  Many of the lines in it are redundant, as well, and it seemed like they threw it in there ""just because"".  I do enjoy the rest of the Lothlorien extensions, but mostly b/c that was one of my favorite parts of the book.

I gave it 4 stars, though, b/c on the whole, it is a very good movie, and having it split into 2 discs is very helpful with the whole ""bathroom break"" issue.",1098748800,6,903,4.537037037037037
1313135,3,B00003CWT6,"I finally completed what seemed like an insurmontable task...I finished viewing the LOTR: FOTR without passing out and going to stage IV sleep.  This is the third attempt and while I came close a couple of times(especially since I went through the whole first disc before) I got through it intact and sane.  Let me tell you this, this movie is NOT worth half the fuss generated.  I'll go over the visuals first since they are easily the best thing the movie has going.  Everything is beautiful and striking with one notable exception, the troll encounter.  It was so cheesy when it came busting in as it doesn't blend in with the background and other monsters and characters.  If the orcs could be done right, so could the troll who felt drawn in.  The large-scale battle at the beginning gave the same impression but that is totally understandable.  Still this is a epidemic afflicting many modern movies and I just cringe whenever I see it.  One last thing some of the locations feel more like visual playgrounds meant for kids then actual worlds.  I'll turn to the soundtrack.  They got the theme down and a couple of very very good supporting pieces in.  The rest, however, sounds like the stereotypical hollywood force-fed epic soundtrack and it fails to seperate itself from others.  One thing this movie trips up hard at is character development.  Hell I got done watching the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre and cared more about those people when they got killed versus here.  Speaking of that a certain death scene in this movie also is poorly done and leaves a foul taste in my mouth.  A three hour movie with weak characterization is just unforgivable.  Snappy one-liners is not legit characterization fellas.  You can joke about food habits all you want it still doesn't change the fact that they just come into the movie with no valid explanation.  This is a huge issue with many of the supporting characters and in some ways the main character has this same problem.  Three hours people.  Still not enough time.  Doesn't make any sense.  Maybe they need to stop the endless close-shots of Woods enormous eyes.  Another big problem with this movie is that is drawn out yet still manages to fail on plot movement as well(I shouldn't sound so suprised, most movies with poor characterization *gasp* have poor plots).  Many things and events just ""flash"" by.  PJ took a lot of shortcuts so you have to do a lot of over-analyzing to figure out why is what happening on the screen.  What parts are obvious don't stray from the typical good/evil stuff.  Of course you need an imagination at times but this is plain ridicoulous.  The acting is solid, problems arise when you can't even understand what the hell is being said like they have a sock stuffed down their throat.  Overall this is easily one of the most overrated DVD's I have ever watched before.  I'm not saying it's horrible some things about it were well-done.  But as a cohesive whole the thing falls flat on it's face.  Even with low expectations I would consider this movie a overall joke.

The novel single-handedly launched the fantasy genre in literature. This film should have the same effect in the cinematic realm and will elevate the fantasy movie from the depths of the cheesy ""sword and sorcery"" movies the public has known in the past. The special effects created by the team at Weta Sideshow are ground-breaking and visionary. They seamlessly create an entire fantasy world populated by primordial forests and rivers, goblins, Balrogs, giant squids, and wizards. The scope of the massive battle scene in the first five minutes of the film lets you know that this is not your typical CGI. The computer animation gives the characters gravity and presence that is lacking in most effects shots of this type. Most of the time, CGI effects are so unrealistic that the illusion is lost and one can almost imagine seeing in their minds the zaftig, over-snacked computer programmer behind their creation. Weta's creations, however, skillfully enhance the illusion in the most grand and epic way possible. They literally take your breath away.

1313215,5,B00003CWT6,"2001 gave birth to ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", ending off the year with a slam-bang of a major wham and starting off the next year with the anticipation for the next chapter in the trilogy. The same pattern can be said for the following year.

But for those next two years, though the frustrations of waiting and compulsive disorder of being antsy was considerably high, the surprise factor slightly diminished. We all knew the next one wouldn't suck and would be equally amazing or even surpass the one preceding it. Though the fear of seeing a ""Star Wars"" redux was nigh to the heavens above, we all knew subconsciously Peter Jackson would never, ever make a mistake, much like what George Lucas did to the prequels.

So one great thing that I can say about ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" that I can't say about the next two that would come after it is that different kind of ""Surprise!"" factor. That feeling of ""Oh my gawd, I didn't know this is going to be utterly and freakingly cool!"". Nobody expected how amazing the whole LOTR Trilogy was going to be, let alone contemplating how mind-blowing the first was going to be. But that was exactly it. From the get-go, Jackson had already cemented the makings of classic cinema and boy, did he ever!

I was amazed and enthralled and on the edge of my seat during the long span in the darken theater. The smell of buttered popcorn, licorice and whiff of the misty cool AC in the air added a priceless element to the wide-eyed span of the equally mesmerized audience and the almost uncomfortable silence of hearing a pin drop. Not a cell-phone could be heard nor a child's cry disrupting the engagement. It was like a community sharing something spectacular, a communal feeling that no words could articulate. That is something that I will truly miss as bitterness and sadness continues to plug my sensitive heart, knowing that from now on, there will never be any LOTR movies in December anymore.

Meticulously done with passion, love and commitment for its source, satisfying the fans of the book, the geeky movie fanatics who haven't read the books and the average Joe-Six pack all at the same time, it's a big-budget blockbuster movie with a bigger heart that can usually only be found in independent films. Peter Jackson created a juggernaut of a milestone in recent cinema that will leave a lasting and permanent impression (""Seven Samurai"" or ""Gone With The Wind"" for our kids 30 years from now. An artifact of today's time that we'll always be looking back and experiencing the feelings it initially evokes, an art to be always admired and a guideline for many aspiring directors to draw inspirations from.

Faithful to the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien while sacrificing and tinkering some notable but not overly crucial events for the benefits of a different medium (not single qualm coming from me, although some Tolkien fans may disagree), Jackson made a tapestry of a long-overdue vision of a one true fan: the world of Middle Earth and its inhabitants. From The Shire, the miniscule Hobbits, Gandalf the Grey, the Balrog, The Ringwraiths, down to the costumes, horses and even hair and make-up . You name it, he got it. And all created in fantastic picture perfect detail. It's as if he knew what you've been conjuring up in your imagination all these years and just effortlessly transferred them on to a different canvas. Of course, it tremendously helped that he a.) opted for New Zealand as a setting and b.) chose Weta Digital, a non-Hollywood company to supervised the visual effects. The result is never a bombastic, garish and cold special-effects overdrive that usually plagues today's blockbuster movies, but a perfect combination of the flawless hard-beaten realism and delicate ethereality with a timeless ancient quality to it.

The music by Howard Shore, arguably his best work ever, brings the whole concoction to a perfect notch. Stirring, passionate, emotional with great usage of choir, angelic vocals and every instruments (well, except for electric guitar) imaginable, it's never fluff but as heavy and involving as the story unfolding on the screen. It's marriage made in heaven. The track called ""The Breaking of the Fellowship"" is powerfully heartbreaking and never ceases to bring a tear or two. In fact, I am crying right now. Sniff...

The direction of the movie is flawlessly articulate. The camera swoops and glides and flies, not a tool anymore, but a part of the world, along with the characters. Fast and furious in action sequences but intimate and personal in dramatic moments. There is that counterbalance that exists between the loud and the quiet, the brawns and the brains and the heart in this movie (and so forth throughout the rest of the trilogy) that tragically doesn't exists at all in today's blockbuster movies. Even so, like ""Spider-Man""  and ""Hellboy"", they can never top the mixture that the LOTR laid out.

""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" ranks on my list as cinema in its pure perfection. This is not just fantasy at it's finest, folks, but a serious Blockbuster movie with a heart and soul for the thinking man. Of course, rolled into one along with the following next chapters is heaven overkill. The Oscars won, always be remembered for its clean-sweep for ""The Return of the King"", rightly deserves their places on Peter Jackson's shelves. As a standalone movie, it is enough to juggle my inner geek to the core and I never cease coming back for more. Thus, I'll be going now for another fix. Toodles!",1095984000,3,5557,4.810471204188482

1313217,5,B00003CWT6,"Don't believe me? Especially Mr. Moneybags et. al? Find the hard to find biographical details on Lucas in creating SW. Lucas, Spielberg, the Beatles etc were all interested in doing a LOTR movie series since the late 60's. Bakshi got there first and his version bombed. In the year before production on Star Wars began Lucas along with Kurtz and Marcia Lucas were researching LOTR and fantasy in order to make a ""space fantasy"". They finally got their script written out and sent to his patron, Francis Ford Coppola who got Lucas going since USC as everyone should know. Using his clout since the ""Godfather""'s success, Coppola helped Lucas secure a studio backing for making Star Wars. Check out early early script drafts of SW and you'll see early versions of ""rings of power"", ""power crystals""(Silmarillion, Hobbit), and robed figures galore. Even Luke's moisture farms looks and feels like a hobbit hole. I watch my original 1989, sound improved only VHS version of ""Star Wars"" where Greedo still shoots first and the Death Star still has John Dykstras explosion that I loved as a kid. The effects and craftsmanship of Dykstra, McQuarrie and numerous forgotton artisans, along with Marcia Lucas' editing and Alec Guiness coaching of Mark Hamil(Guinness kept the other actors sane when Lucas' directing was lacking), still make SW a classic. However Lucas' directing looks amateurish just like in Phantom Menace , AOTC and Howard the Duck. Enough said.",1095292800,2,1455,5.04149377593361
1313218,2,B00003CWT6,"Then I must not like movies... but I do.  And I even like popcorn movies like the original Star Wars trilogy... but these Peter Jackson directed Lord of the Rings films just aren't in the same league as the original Star Wars films.  In LotR, some of the casting choices are inspired like Gandalf, Merry and Pippin, but many are so-so choices.  Viggo as Aragorn is boring... and the love story is *blah*.  Frodo, pretty good choice.  Sam, please throw him back.  For books that have inspired the imagination of so many young and old, the movies just seem ho-hum.  The books were so layered with countless characters big and small, with endless landscapes rich with history, and in subtext, morality, and mythology that I didn't completely catch when I was a kid, but still made the books seem alive with mystery and power worth revisiting.  The movies are typical Hollywood-fare - you've seen them once, and the only reason to really go back is to enjoy the pretty visuals or Gollum.  I can't even entirely put into words why the original Star Wars trilogy seems so great and LotR seems so ho-hum except for a few exciting sequences.  Something about the way in Star Wars the great music seems to stir up what I'm feeling when watching the story unfold and how in LotR, the bland music seems to cue me when I should feel this or that.  I certainly didn't make Star Wars or LotR and wouldn't want to undertake the gigantic project, so I don't presume to be able to do better, but I feel there's a big difference in quality between the two.  Star Wars gets cheesy, but in a good pulp way.  LotR cheesiness just stinks of today's clichs and fads.  And this is without going into a whole discussion as to how there are great movies that aren't just visual/cgi blockbusters.  I'm just so amazed how people consider these Peter Jackson interpretations of LotR's as these masterpieces for the ages, because it seems to me many have a shallow and narrow sense of what makes for great cinema and can't see beyond the amazing visuals to the Hollywood clichs lying right beneath the surface.",1094688000,6,2080,4.583783783783784

The directing was beyond my expectations. I anticipated lyrical beautiful directing as David Lean did with ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but instead Peter Jackson made The Lord Of Rings a cross between ""Gladiator"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" Elijah Wood did a great job holding his own in this film.

I've notice that Ebert and Roeper said the film was too long but it didn't seem too long to me; 2 hours and 58 minutes is not that long if the movie is good. I've seen almost every movie in 2001 and at first it was a toss-up between ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" for best picture of the year. But I thought about it while longer and I must say that Lord of the Rings was it for me that year. A friend of mine asked me whether Lord of the Rings was better than Star Wars. But there is a fundamental difference between the two movies. And because ""Star Wars"" is a Sci-Fi epic and ""Lord of the Rings"" is a fantasy epic, there is no comparison. I am not about to say that Lord Of The Rings is a better movie than Star Wars. Besides Peter Jackson took this saga from a book and George Lucas created Star Wars on his own. I have not read the book yet so the ending took me by surprise. Mr. Jackson said he's going by the book to make this film and I've only seen the animated version.

All of their performances were great, but some of my favorites include Viggo Mortenson's portrayal of Aragorn,  Ian McKellen's rendition of Gandalf, Christopher Lee's portrayal of Saruman, and Liv Tyler's take on Arwen.

One thing I was slightly dissapointed with was that it had a few differences from the book.  If you are a fan of the book, like myself, you should keep that in mind.

 Why? because on the Fellowship of the Ring(Ext.) you see small stuff that affects the Two Tower, and so does on this one, affects the return of the king. Examples are: where does Sam gets the elvish rope to tie Gollum?(FOTR) why do Merri and Pippin get courages at the end of the two towers?(TT) how does Faramir know his brother is dead?(TT)

 All in all, if you like the action, see the normal version.

1313293,5,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings is not just about men, elfs and dwarves fighting orc armies while Evil Lord seeks to regain his lost ring.

 It is about the resilience of human spirit. It is about us and our desire to survive against all odds. It is about our iron will and our capability to unite and fight against common enemy who threatens our kind.

 This is why Lord of the Rings has struck a chord with all those who dare to plunge into its dark depths and evil plots.

 If Tolkein's book was grand with graphic details about massive orc armies threatning the middle earth, Peter Jackson's movie is well, ""grander"".

 Director Peter Jackson brings to life what all of us could only imagine. True, some things are not exactly as they are in the book, but the changes are apt and in many cases necessary. For example, do you really want to hear all the songs Merry and Pippin sing in the books? I was relieved I didn't have to.

 Apart from that each and every detail of the book, from elf world to city of minas tirith has been beautifully recreated. Aragorn and owyn's fairy tale love, Gimli and Legolas' friendly, almost playfull rivalry and Froddo and Samwise Gamgee's deep bond of friendship bursts forth in a thousand colors and leaves you wondering how the director managed to do it all in such vivid details while maintaining the flow of the book and coherency of the plot.

 My favourity scenes include battle for Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith. My wife's include love scenes between owyn and Aragorn adorned with beautiful, almost delicate elf words. I am sure you will find your favourites as you watch the movies again and again.",1091491200,3,1629,4.541095890410959

1313296,1,B00003CWT6,"The only praise I will give Peter Jackson in his films is the beauty of his backgrounds and special effects. His adaption of the story and it's characters is apalling, however. True, Tolkien's masterpiece is lengthy by anyone's standards, and incorporating it word-for-word into a movie is an impossible feat. I never expected that he wouldn't have to cut things from the movie that were in the book, such as the hobbits' adventures with Tom Bombadil. It is not what Peter Jackson cut that bothered me, it is what he added. He changed aspects of the story unecessarily, and changed characters' personalities.

 For example, he placed Arwen in an earlier part of the story, and she stood with Frodo at the Ford of Bruinen against the Morgul Lord and his host. This was unneccessary and it robbed Frodo of one of his most important moments in the story. He was a sheltered, soft hobbit who had never set foot out of the Shire before, and yet he manages to stand alone against the Black Riders and defy them. It was one of those moments that proved his bravery and gave insight into his character. And it is ruined by throwing Arwen in there--unneccessarily. He robs Frodo of another poignant moment when he has all the Company tell him to leave on his own to Mordor in the end of the movie. In the book, Frodo chose to go on his own in secret so he would not put his friends into further danger. Why did this point have to change? It certainly wasn't to make the story easier to follow. It was a change that didn't have to be made. When actual parts of the story are cut in order to make additions of this sort, I get disgusted.

 Jackson's treatment of the characters in some cases bothered me as well. In the story, Aragorn was a capable and noble character. There was no mention that he was afraid of making the same mistake as his ancestor, Isildur, in regards to the ring. In the movie he was always second-guessing his resolve and his ability and this diminished his character drastically. Gimli he made into a rash, hot-headed dwarf who was of no more use than as a comedic extra. But in the book it was mentioned more than once that he was courteous in his speech, and gave thought to his words. ""It is said that the skill of the Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues, yet that is not true of Gimli."" True, there was tension between the Dwarves and the Elves, but in the movie that was greatly overblown.

 These are just a few of many changes I could mention. Many of these alterations took away from the story, the characters, and the original magic of the books, and they could have been easily avoided if Jackson had given more thought to the rendition of the story rather than the intricacy of his special effects. Many people would say that needless alterations such as these are minor, and don't matter much, and that's a shame. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but I urge anyone and everyone to read the books. The Lord of the Rings is classic literature and this Hollywood knock-off falls far short of the actual story Tolkien wrote.",1090972800,39,3076,4.47415329768271
1313297,5,B00003CWT6,"Using computer technology, Jackson was able to bring alive

 the world of Middle Earth full of monsters and wonders that

 Tolkein imagined in his epic.

 The film was full of special effects and awe inspiring screenplay.

 The movie starts out just like Tolkein's

 John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (J.R.R) novel starts

 of by telling us of the rings scattered across

 Middle Earth that are held by Dwarves, Elves

 and other monsters.

 However,one ring mangaged to reach the evil claw of Saron, an evil being bent on evil and destruction.

 Saron is defeated, though, by the brave prince Isadul

 however, Isadul becomes corrupted and evil by the ring.

 The ring as Tolkien describes has an evil life of it's own, it corrupts and makes evil anyone who wears it .

 Eventually the ring gets passed to Bilbo Baggins,

 a hobbit who is about to celebrate his 111th birthday.

 The costumes and effects for the Hobbits are terrific, from

 the camera angles you do see the actors as Hobbits.

 Eventually Bilbo himself becomes corrupted by the ring, but

 not before his friend Gandalf The Grey (Ian Mckellan) finds out about it.

 Gandalf being a very powerful and wise wizard eventually

 takes the ring from Bilbo, however, troubles arises

 as strange demons and monsters come looking for the ring.

 It seems that Lord Saron, is back and more evil than ever!!

 Gandalf eventuallys gives the ring to someone pure, someone who can't become corrupted by the ring.

 That person is Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) , a hobbit.

 Frodo Baggins now has the monumental tasks of finding a way

 to destroy the ring and stop the evil Saron from destroying

 Middle Earth...

 Throughout his journey he'll encounter strange creatures like elves, dwarves and powerful beasts.

 However, Frodo is not along in his quest and his desire

 to finish his quest will have you the audience breathless,

 and excited.

 The Lord Of The Rings is one of the best sci/fi, magical,

 special effects I've seen.

 Nearly over 10 yrs in the making, Peter Jackson and his

 special effects team, do the unthinkable and impossible:

 They do a great job of bringing Tolkein's story and vision

 to the bring screen with amazing results!!!

 The film has already being nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Special Effects, and Best Musical Score.

 Jackson has already finished his next 2 sequels to ""The Lord

 Of The Rings"" and judging from the tremendous success

 of this film , they are sure to be good.

 ""The Lord OF The Rings"" has also been made into several games including games for the Atari, Pc, and Snes systems.

 The Newest games for ""Lord Of The Rings"" are going to be

 for the XBOX, PS2, and Nintendo Gamecube!!!

The Fellowship, describes the finding of the ring, and shows the beginnings of Frodo and the Fellowships efforts to take the ring to Mordor to have it destroyed.  Exceptional performances all around from the entire cast help add to the exceptional work this film is.  The films cinematography and overall depiction of Middle Earth is amazing.  And the action, including ring wraiths, elves, and a Balrog don't leave anything to be desired.  One of my favorite parts is the fantastic introduction which describes how the ring is first made and how it is first used by Sauron.  Simply brilliant.

The extended DVD adds even more fuel to the fire.  The extended edtion adds deleted scenes back into the movie, giving more plot and backstory to the entire film.  In addition, the featurettes on discs 3 and 4 give the viewer an amazing background on Tolkien, the works of Lord of the Rings, and the entire making of the Fellowship of the Ring.

They are timid in nature and are passive in confrontations, but they rise to the occasion.
Unfortunately such notions like this are not found very often, because the hobbits are pushed to center stage. Rather than enlisting powerful men and wizards to help them in a perilous crusade, they're just being taken along for still a good reason - in other words the movie is more about powerful men and wizards. This isn't true to every scene or episode, but by the end of the movie, it adds up more to the swords and sorcery epic rather than realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's vision.

Watching Gandalf the mighty wizard take on the ancient demon sent shivers down my spine! The scene of the Bridge of `Kasadoom' (at least I think it's spelt that way!) in the Mines of Moria, with the fire surrounding it, shook me in my chair!

He is gifted with the ability of remote-viewing- he can see what is happening at the other end of town!

1313367,5,B00003CWT6,"If i were to write a couple of words describing peter jackson's portrayal of j.r.r. epic novel it would be that the movie is ""glorious, spectacular, innovative, and on the edge of your seat excitement!!!""
The camera directing, special effects and engrossing cinematography of lord of rings is beyond words.
The film had been in development for over 5 yrs so jackson carefully and effortlessly put his best effort for the film.
The basic premise of lord of rings centers on a hobbit named frodo baggins (elijah wood ) who has the task of destroying the rings that has caused destruction across middle earth, and the dangerous and fascinating journey he and his companions : gandalf the grey (ian mckellen), strider/aragorn (viggo mortensen) legolas greenleaf (orlando bloom )and others undertake to destroy the ring.
Peter jackson's film of tolkien's (j.r.r) novel starts of by telling us of the numerous rings across middle earth that are held by dwarves, elves and other creatures.  However, there is one ring though, that no one knows about that is in the hands of lord sauron, an evil beast, that will bring destruction to middle earth.  Sauron organizes an unholy army composed of demons, however, he is met by the army of king thoden and prince isildur's (harry sinclair (ii)) army.
Everyone is nearly wiped but in spectacular fashion, isildur chops sauron evil claw, thus removing the ring from him.
However,one of the messages of the lord of rings is that the ring corrupts everyone who wears it. the ring is a symbol of power, greed and evil.
Thus prince isildur comes under the ring's evil power until the rings kills him and falls unto another unfortunate soul. the next person to get the ring is gollum, a hideous ugly thing. after gollum, the rings falls to bilbo baggins (ian holm-(from the movie ""the fifth element""), a hobbit.  Baggins is celebrating his 111 plus birthday, however, during the celebrating, Gandalf, discovers Bilbo is hiding the ring and orders him to hand it over. Before this happens, we are treated to truly magical effects during the celebration. During one scene, Gandalf (McKellan) is smoking a pipe, however, the smoke turns into a really cool ship floating in air!!! Wow. Jackson's is already starting his special effects in grand fashion.
Gandalf then gives the ring to Frodo Baggins (Wood). Frodo is not your typical hero, however, his pure heart and bravery will be shown during the course of his journey. which is another of Tolkein's message.
It doesn't matter how you look in the outside, it's the inside that counts, and Frodo has a heart and character bigger than life, that echoes bravery, intelligence, and strength. It's no wonder audiences seem to love the Hobbits, they are small in size yes but big on heart, as the old cliche goes ""It's not the size of the man, but the size of fight in the man"".
Frodo and his hobbit friends Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee (Sean Astin) then leave the village of the Shire, in hopes of finding help of destroying the ring. Aragon (Mortenson) is the strider, ranger who saves Frodo and his friends. from when he is pursued from ring raiders at a local inn. A great line by Aragon to Frodo is: ""Are you frightened"", Frodo responds ""Yes"", then Aragon responds ""Not nearly frightened enough!"" All the actors in the movie Elijah Woods, Ian Mckellan( Gods and Monsters, XMEN) Liv Tyler (who plays Arwen the Elf) all give their best performances. In fact, no matter what good or bad movies these actors have done, this movie will be the best movie they have ever been in.
Frodo, Aragon and Sam go to reiverdale house of Elrod where the Elves are and meet Arwen Undmiel (the lovely Liv Tyler) who has magical powers.
In one scene, as she as taking Frodo on her horse to safety, a group of demonic ring raiders come after. As they approach a river Arwen says ""If you want him come claim him"", as the raiders come close using her powers ,Arwen unleashes a tidal wave upon the unlucky foes!!!
It's really a great combination of special effects, and good scripting and directing. Jackson delivers one memorable image after another using the Tolkein novel.
The elves of Elrod decide on having a council meeting to address what to do about the ring. At first, everyone has difference of opinions as to who should keep. Then it is revealed that ring can only be destroyed at the mountain of doom.
However, no one including the elves, dwarves or strider volunteer to go to Morod to destroy it. Then Frodo whose heart and courage surpasses his height, volunteers to go to the mountain.
Inspired by Frodo , Aragon, Sam Gamgee,Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) , Legolas , and rest of Frodo's hobbit friends, decide to join Frodo and thus the Fellowship of the Ring is formed!!!!!
This is not the first movie that has been put on the screen by followers of JRR. Tolkien, however, it is by the far the best!!! ""The Hobbit"" one of Tolkein other works, was made into animated film in the 70's (1978) by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr-Two geniuses who are legends in animated cartoons for kids of all ages. Unfortunately, ""The Hobbit"" was geared for kids and so much of the intensity and story of the animated film was cut off from the film, along with characters from the novel.
The effects for Lord Of Rings were done by WETA Ltd, The New Zealand effects company Jackson founded 14 yrs ago (the investment paid of).
Jackson of course made the remaining 2 sequels to Lord Of Rings (The Lord of Rings: The Two Towers, and The Lord of Rings: The Return of King) and they were both as  excellent as the first one, althought I personally think the first has an edge that the other two seem to lack as the movie nears it's end.",1088553600,3,5680,4.682682682682683

1313439,5,B00003CWT6,"It's interesting to see how many people say things like: ""Get the extended version because it has more scenes in it"" or ""Get the extended version because it has more 'extras' in it"".  Well sometimes 'longer is better' and sometimes not...
In the case of ""The Two Towers"" I would agree that the `extended' version was easily superior to its theatrical counterpart.  The extended version filled in many important plot elements and fully rounded out the middle movie.  Most of the `dangling' plot elements were far better explained in this extended version.
However, I cannot say the same for the `extended' version of the first movie, i.e. ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""  The extended version of `The Fellowship....' added very little new to the plot development with the exception of the `Lady Galadriel's Gift Giving' scenes.  On the contrary, the extra footage of the Shire in the beginning weakened the much tighter and far better Shire opening in the theatrical version.  Plus with the various changes to the musical score, the `extended' version of `The Fellowship of the Ring' just drags on too much.  I cannot recommend the `extended' version of  ""Fellowship"" over the theatrical version.  All in all, my view on `Theatrical' versus `Extended' is summarized as follows:
The Fellowship of the Ring:
1) `The Fellowship of the Ring' Theatrical Version:  4 stars, a very tight and well plotted opening for the Trilogy.
2) `The Fellowship of the Ring' Extended Version:  3 stars, moves far slower at the wrong times, strong scenes from the theater version end up feeling weaker and watered down.  The musical score is weaker as well.
The Two Towers:
1) `The Two Towers' Theatrical Version:  3 stars, rather disappointing due to too many unfinished scenes and the feeling that too many plot twists were left unexplained.
2) `The Two Towers'  Extended Version:  4 stars, fully fixes all of the elements missing from the theatrical version.  This one should have been released as the theatrical version.
The Return of the King:
1) `The Return of the King' Theatrical Version: 4 stars, Fully realized, beautiful ending to the trilogy, in spite of the lack of `The Scouring of the Shire'.  Hey, do you want to sit for another hour?
2) `The Return of the King' Extended Version:  Not yet released.  If it goes on too long, I'll have to build a bladder bag into the couch, but it's doable...Still, there are a few loose ends which it may well address, chiefly `The House of Healing', etc.  Once again though, even an extra half-hour is probably going to be too long, but we'll see...
Anyway, that's my take on `Extended' versus `Theatrical' so far.  It really depends on each and every movie.  Sometimes longer is better...sometimes not...",1086912000,7,2732,4.906318082788671
1313440,1,B00003CWT6,"I just don't get it. Why is LOTR getting all these awards and promotions when it's not even that good? It's not the worst, but still, it's pretty bad.
The responses to my last negative LOTR review is crazy, like 2/51. I just want to say thank you to those two people!
Like I said though, and I still stand by it, You either love LOTR or hate it. At least thats the hint I got from my friends and family. It's either ""OMG Lord of the Rings is the best thing that ever happened to me"" (Okay, slight exaggeration) or ""Lord of the Rings is a peice of ($...)I want to burn every single copy of the (d..n) thing!"" (No exaggeration)
Well, let's face it, a single opinion isn't going to matter in this world, but I just want to put in my input. Thanks for reading!",1086220800,9,756,4.114864864864865
1313441,5,B00003CWT6,"As a LOTR geek who's seen both the Platinum Edition and the Widescreen Editions several times, I would recommend popping out another five bucks and getting the more expensive item rather than purchasing this one.  Just the introductory scene about Hobbits is worth it, but the extra footage with Galadriel is priceless. When you factor in the excellence of the documentaries, the Platinum Edition is worth double the price.",1086048000,,423,5.130434782608695
1313442,5,B00003CWT6,"I thouroughly enjoyed the Extended Edition of the Fellowship of the Ring. The extended edition of the film includes about a half hour of extended or new scenes that are straight from the original text of Tolkien. The appendices cover the movie from its inception, to its interpretation from text to screen, to its intitial premier. It includes nearly 8 hours of details on all the intricacies of the Fellowship's filming. It is excellent, but this version of the film is only for those who enjoy extras as much as the film itself.",1085961600,,530,4.709677419354839
1313499,5,B00003CWT6,"First, let me say that I adore the books.  This extended version of the film adds many scenes that fans of the books (and also those who haven't read them) will enjoy.  A few entirely new scenes are added, including the hobbits having a jolly good time in their local pub.  Other scenes are much more fleshed out, particularly those in Lothlorien.  The extended version of this and the second film really fill in so much detail that they shouldn't be missed by anyone who liked the theatrical releases.
The appendices are also excellent.  As someone who has never been a big fan of how'd-they-do-that documentaries of films, I was surprised to find myself rivited by these.  Part I of the appendices deals with adapting the book to film - scripting, visualizing, and designing Tolkien's Middle-Earth.  Part II shows the more technical aspects of making the film - actual filming, creating the height differences between the characters, digital effects, and other post production.  The discs also have galleries of still photos and short video clips in addition to the main documentaries.  Knowing all the detail and hard work that has gone into these films makes me love them all the more.
Another feature of this edition is the packaging itself. The outside slipcover is made to resemble a leather-bond book. Inside you will find the case, booklet, and the discs themselves decorated with artwork and concept sketches from the artists who helped design the film. The onscreen menus continue the book theme and also show many wonderful sketches.
In short, I recommend buying this, as well as the Two Towers Extended Edition, and then joining me to eagerly await the extended version of The Return of the King!",1085788800,,1709,4.90625

This movie captures that. It captures the depth. It makes you want to know more. It definately makes you feel, and brings many of us to tears.
However, being an avid Tolkien fan- okay, beyond avid- obsessive Tolkien fan, how could I not want more? Yes, yes, I would have rate the theatrical version 3 stars, so the extended and new scenes do help tremendouly, yet some of the feeling is still missing. None of the characters are as noble as they are in the books. Peter Jackson seems to think you must make a character all evil to be corrupted, or all twisted to be a little off, or almost a god to be simply a good guy, or a complete clown to be funny at times.
So, to conclude, I was pleased with the epic feel to this movie, yet dissapointed with the missing details. I know what I am looking for is impossible to do, yet how could one not be?",1084924800,,998,4.3138297872340425
1313504,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is absolutely incredible! This is movie making to the utmost brilliance through every aspect.
Briefly, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the first chapter of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. It follows the charming hobbit, Frodo Baggins setting out on an immence quest - to destroy the Ruling One Ring which has fallen under his keep. He sets out on the journey accompanied by 8 companions - the Fellowship including the wizard Gandalf the men Aragorn and Borimir, the lovable hobbits Sam, Merry and Pippin and the comical duo Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf. Together they are dedicated to guiding the tiny Ring-Bearer along the trecherous road to the Cracks of Doom, the one place where the Ring may be unmade. However the Ring soon begins to take its toll on the Company and Frodo is soon left with a heart aching decision...
This film has been achieved through a great passion for the metaphorical pages of the story's legendary creator, JRR Tolkein. True, movies can never trully capture the brilliance that books already have, but it's time like these you must look beyond the books and simply marvle the movie's own uniqueness.
The acting of the film is executed to perfection. the cast include Elijah Wood, Sir Ian McKellen, Sean Astin and Viggo Mortenson and more wonderful actors. All portray their character's emotions to brilliance, beautifully resembling Tolkein's timeless characters.
The special effects are trully amazing. the lengths Peter Jackson and his team have sprinted to make the film as life like and as real as possible are phenomenal and the visual effects are just that. Even when I squirm to find computer images I simply cannot see where the special effects flaw. It is true that a movie's visual art can make or break a film's success, simply because viewers innocently want to feel part of the story. I think in ""The Fellowship"" you feel totally ungulfed in the world of Middle Earth. New Zealand trully delivers the beauty and essence of the environment, of which Tolkein describes in the trilogy with such passion!
I LOVE musical scores of movies, and I don't have to establish that the music of Lord of the Rings has defiantely become a world-wide musical icon! But aside from its famous theme, the music is beautiful, emotional and original and utterly relates to the story in every perspective.
""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a wonderful film about courage, faith and the bonds of friendship. I advise those who have not see any of the films, to see this one first, as it will make watching the others much easier. The One that began them all, winner of 4 oscars, this film is the perfect opening to the greatest masterpiece EVER brought to the screen.",1084924800,,2722,4.781316348195329

  The wonderfull journey for the magic ring starts here. The Two Towers may have greater fantasy and the last may have the most incredible batles but non other can surprise you as much as The Fellowship Of The Ring. This is the first and, specially if you never read the books, prepare to be amazed!

1313566,5,B00003CWT6,"I liked this movie overall, but would like to point out some parts that were my favorites.
My favorite part of this movie was the battle between the orcs and the Fellowship. Aragorn and Boramir wielded the sword phenomenally, Legolas used the bow and arrow like he had practiced all his life, and Gimli was an astounding axman! I liked when Legolas stuck one of the orcs with an arrow during the battle. Eventually, Boramir is struck down with arrows from the commander of the orc army (how could anyone take three arrows?). Aragorn sees Boramir just before the orc commander drives a fourth arrow into him. Somehow, the commander notices that Aragorn is watching, and the best sword-fighting in the movie ensues. The commander orc throws his sword at Aragorn, which Aragorn bats away. Eventually, Aragorn lops off the head of his opponent.
Other great scenes in this movie are the scenery in Rivendell. The scenery in the whole movie is outstanding, but even more so in Rivendell.
I liked the scene in which Arwen is escaping the Ringwraiths, as well. In this chase, my favorite part occurs when Arwen calls on the riverwater to cover the Ringwraiths.

1313572,5,B00003CWT6,"""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the first of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. And I would recommend that you watch them in order. In this movie we see the origin of the One Ring and how it comes into Frodo's possession. We see the formation and breaking of the fellowship.

This movie will introduce you to Middle Earth. There are breathtaking scenes in the movie when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. Peter Jackson did a great job in envisioning the realm and choosing the location for it. We first see Hobbiton, where the houses have flower patches and old fences, the roads look worn and made through decades of travel, and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. It made me believe I was there. And his wonderful creations that we get to explore with the fellowship; Rivendale, the Halls of Moria, Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. It lets us see the vast living world that is Middle Earth.

Tolkien's work is not faithfully followed. Certain characters are missing. As are some songs that are memorable from the book. But the movie does not let us down. And it is a good screen adaptation. I love that the elvish language that Tolkien created is spoken. And the casting is excellent.

This is much better than the original release. The movie has an extra 30 minutes added, which will help you flow easier to the second film. And the great bonuses included in this package include the making of the film, interviews with all the stars, drawings and interviews with Peter Jackson and the rest of the people responsible for producing this classic. As well as a good look at where the film was shot in New Zealand, behind the scenes stories and incidents that happened during the filming.

 Ha Ha! Just being funny! The theatrical edition of FOTR is a powerful and thrilling epic masterpiece. It brought out a lot of the images of the books that I imagined while reading them and it was like they just reached into my mind and plopped them right on the big screen. It is amazing!
 Frodo Baggins is living with his distant cousin Bilbo Baggins who he looks at as his uncle. Middle Earth is on the brink of destruction. The Dark Lord Sauron whose power is at Mordor, was defeated when a powerful Ring was severed off his arm causing him to implode into thin air more than 3000 years ago. His strength has returned over time as the Ring failed to be destroyed during the Last Alliance in Second Age 3441. The RIng passed out of all knowledge when a creature named Gollum found it on the bottom of the river and took it for himself and carried it and was corrupted by it for over 500 years until Bilbo found it and escaped with it.
 Now, with vast armies of Sauron spreading, The Ring must be destroyed in order to save MIddle Earth from doom but the Ring cannot be destroyed except where it was made, in the fiery chasms of Mt. Doom where it was made. Only then can it be unmade. Frodo goes on the journey along with eight other companions to form the Fellowship of The Ring.
 This movie is just awesome. I hate writing long reviews but this set however deserves one.
 This extended edition of FOTR blows the theatrical edition right out of the water. There are over 30 minutes of extra footage not put on the theatrical edition and the result is an even greater and more powerful masterpiece!
 The third and fourth discs are mind-blowing. I can never do justice with this review on all the treats that are on these two discs. I'm not going to spoil it wiht what's on them but with this review, I could never explain the treats on them. This Gift Set also comes with some really awesome miniature statues of the giant statues on the waterfalls stretching their hands into the distance.
 I also love the packaging that the ""GIft Set"" comes in too. In fact, I love it so much that I would never throw it away and use it for many things.
 The regular non-gift set ""Extended Edition"" is also great but doesn't include the statues nor the wonderful box set but even if you end up just getting that, you get plenty of good stuff not available on the regular DVD edition.

1313644,5,B00003CWT6,"Director Peter Jackson's absolutely rousing film version of JRR Tolkien's epic fantasy novel - once thought unfilmable by Hollywood producers - is a crowd-pleasing labour of love by an unmistakeable Tolkien fan who (fortunately) also happens to be an accomplished film-maker at the top of his game. The result is a satisfying distillation of the essential spirit and tone of Tolkien's story that amounts to the most definitive film version fans could hope for. The story of the rediscovery of ""the one ring - the Ring of Power"" and the conflicted efforts of the races of Middle Earth to destroy it before the final resurrection of its evil master, the Dark Lord Sauron, is engrossingly and excitingly told. With liberal dollops of action, adventure, humour and sentiment, Jackson unfolds a tale of unlikely courage, loyalty and friendship that is every bit an instant movie classic. So powerful and influential is his directorial hand that the Lord of the Rings story will in the popular public mind be as indelibly linked to Jackson's brilliant trilogy as it is to Tolkien's source novels. Benefits from repeat viewing - particularly in light of its two sequels (The Two Towers; Return of the King) which shed new light on references, events and characters in this first instalment (thus underlining the intricate detail and advanced planning Jackson must've invested to be able to tell the epic equitably across three instalments).

1313730,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings saga is well-known and popular for the wrong reasons. It is critically acclaimed for it's amazing special-effects and set-pieces (with, I don't deny, are incredible), and kids like it for it's great ""action"" (kids today are idiots), but people miss the great elements of Peter Jackson's movies.
The Fellowship of the Ring is the first chapter of an emotional story of a little person who finds strength in himself to do what he, and many others thought impossible. The person is a hobbit, and his name is Frodo Baggins. With the thought of rescuing his homeland from a growing evil as his motivation, Frodo volunteers to embark on and lead the quest to destroy the One Ring, the source of the dark lord Sauron's power. Should they succeed in destroying the Ring by dropping it in the volcano called Mount Doom (Orodruin), they will have destroyed Sauron's life-force and he will be vanquished. Should they fail and Sauron regain the Ring, the land of Middle-earth will fall to Sauron's evil.
Frodo is accompanied by a company of 8 others, and the one who sticks by him more than the rest is Sam Gamgee, another hobbit from his homeland who vows to stick by Frodo not mater what. At first the vow is inspired by the fear that the noble wizard Gandalf will punish Sam if he doesn't stick by Frodo. But over time a bond develops between the two, and Sam becomes ready to die for his friend Mr. Frodo.
The movie ends with a rousing battle at a riverside hill called Amon Hen. There a party of evil Uruk-hai kill a member of the Fellowhsip, capture 2 of the 4 hobbits, and leave everyone else scattered. In the midst of all this Frodo abandons his Fellowship, realizing that the trip to Sauron's black land is too dangerous for him to drag the others into. But, when he is on the verge of getting away, he is discovered by Sam, who isnsists to go with him. It ends with them walking down into the Emyn Muil canyon, where the two will continue their journey in the next film. As for the others, after the death of Boromir, the two-faced man from Gondor who over the course of the film had a strong desire to take the ring from Frodo, Aragorn, the other man, honors him and gives him as proper a funearal as possible in the situation. Then he, Legolas the elf, and Gimli the dwarf venture on to rescue Pippin and Merry, the 2 hobbits captured by the Uruk-hai, and that is how the movie ands for them.
The film has plenty of psychological properties to it. There is Boromir, who under pressure to serve his failing nation of Gondor, feels a terrific desire to take the Ring from Frodo and attempt to use it for the good f his country. There is the realtionship between Frodo and Sam, who learn that they need each other to fulfill the daunting task of destroying the Ring, and there is Aragorn, an old Ranger worn out by life, who realizes that it is he who must claim the throne of the falling nation of Gondor, but sees the country's shamefulness and greed and doesn't want to rule that land.

1313733,5,B00003CWT6,"When I first saw ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I was in awe at how great the movie was. I just was perplexed that such a great movie could be made! It was perfect.
When I watch this extended version, at first I thought that the new scenes(although great in and of themselves) sort of mucked up the film when added in. Someone else would say lines that were originally said by another character, the title ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was placed in a different spot, etc. Sometimes they'd use a different cut of the same scene. I had never witnessed someone changing their movie so much. Not even George Lucas had done that much changing to his original Star Wars films.
But, given some time I got used to it and realized that it's a better version of the film! And it helps flow into ""The Two Towers"" very nicely, setting up things for it that the original ""Fellowship"" does not, like the gift-giving in Lothlorien, etc. I now think that that was a mistake to leave that out of the theatrical version. We don't have a clear idea of where the lembas bread came from in The Two Towers, or why the rope burns Gollum, unless we see this extended cut of ""Fellowship."" We don't understand fully why their cloaks ""sheild them from unfriendly eyes"" at the black gate. All of that, and much more, makes sense when watching the extended version of Fellowship of the Ring.
And, there's more. This version is packed full of special features! Two discs worth. Everything is there to give you a second-hand look at just how much passion, effort, and love was put into this film. These special features really show how much the creative forces behind these films really care about The Lord of the Rings.

Perhaps Tolkein was too close to the project, having written the books and all - turning the films over to someone with a more discerning eye might have been a better move.  Whatever it was, the film would still have not succeeded without a larger budget.  I will definitely be missing the next two.  Stick with the books, Mr. Tolkien.",1080518400,7,441,4.544303797468355
1313736,5,B00003CWT6,"I take it if you're a fan, you've already seen the theatrical edition of Lord of the Rings. This 'edition' is for those who wants 'more of the Rings'. Before I get started, Peter Jackson himself said that BOTH versions are the real thing. Purists most likely insist the theatrical version is 'proper'. I disagree. Peter Jackson adapted a book. The Extended Edition follows more closely to the book, which is exactly what an adaptation is. It's great for people who want to delve deeper into Middle-earth and for people who haven't read the book. Not only do you get more special features, but you get an extra 38 minutes of footage seamlessley re-inserted back into the movie. The movie itself is on 2 DVDs. What more can a 'Ringer' ask for? The first disc ends when Pippin says 'Great! Where are we going?'",1080259200,,807,4.611111111111111
1313737,5,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the longest part of the Lord of the Rings, in the books. There is a lot of character establishment and a lot of little bits of Middle Earth history thrown around everywhere. This makes the book interesting although a little difficult to read. This movie is the best I could've hoped for for the book. Peter Jackson establishes the characters very well and makes you care about them right from the get-go. The landscapes and the cities came right out of the book (and from my imagination). This is probably the best work done with a movie set that I have ever seen. Everything is so vivid and so majestic you'll be taken away just by the visuals alone! Another thing Peter Jackson does well is setting up points of tension and then release, which is helped along by Howard Shore's masterful score (I wrote a review of the score too if you'd like to see my take on that).
Now, on to the plot. People who have read the book will realize immediately that the extended edition is much closer to the book than the regular edition. However, there is one major part of the book that is left out, and I can understand why because it is one of the less exciting or for that matter important parts of the book, the journey through the Old Forest and the meeting with Tom Bombadil. However, this does not take away from the movie and keeps it going at a steady pace of action and drama. Peter Jackson does highlight the relationship between Arwen and Aragorn quite a bit, which wasn't as prevalent in the books, but I still enjoyed it. And the last major difference I noticed was that he establishes Sam's loyalty to Frodo as coming solely out of friendship and love, actually, in the book it is in part due to friendship but also due to the relationship of Sam being a worker for the Baggins family and when he follows Frodo, he does it mainly because it is his duty and he remains loyal and true to that duty (I bring this up only because Tolkien was English and in England at that time, the servant to family loyalty was part of their culture). That's all of the differences I noticed besides the switching around of a few characters and whatnot. So, in short, whether you have read the books or not, this movie is fantastic and will bring you into Middle Earth jsut as assuredly, if only in a different way. I've read the books through nearly 13 times and I absolutely adored this film. fans of Lord of the Rings will be forever indebted to Peter Jackson for bringing Middle Earth and all it has to offer to a new generation and to people all around the world.
About the acting, let me say that all the characters are just as you would hope for them to be. Elijah Wood is a little over-dramatic at times and he could do more with his facial expressions but he is the only one I would give criticism to. Christopher Lee is perfect as Saruman as is Ian Mckellen as Gandalf.
All of the elements of a great movie are here. The acting is superb, the visuals are to die for and the music is absolutely brilliant. This extended edition is great and has a lot of special features and interviews which you may find interesting. This definitely THE fantasy-genre movie to get. I haven't met anyone who didn't love it. Highest Recommendation.",1080000000,7,3253,4.40531561461794
1313738,3,B00003CWT6,"Go see it if you have any feeling at all for the Tolkien books in your heart...you will not leave unchanged.  Even so, every reader has their own, cherished idea as to what these imaginary places and people look like, and some of this is reinforced by illustrations that have been around for a long time and so linger in the public consciousness even when Jackson and the hobbitses try to change our minds.  What follows is a by no means complete laundry list of what to look for...
Extended dialogue when there is room for silence...wonderful quotes from the book have been ignored or trampled upon.
Hobbiton is lovely and serene (Lothlorien, too), quite the contrast from the gruesomely rendered Isengard and Mordor scenes.
Spoken Quenya is a delight to the ear, thanks for including it.
Does Elvish architecture really include neo-Gothic traceries?  Just asking.
The Orthanc tower is superb...the definitive ""bad wizard"" residence.
Too many battle scenes, often too dark, going on for too long (more of this in Two Towers and ROTK, of course).
Partially enjoyable when Frodo enters the ""wraith world"" after donning the ring.  The ""orange eye"" has lost its subtlety, though.
Moria and the Falls of Rauros are painstakingly recreated and convincing as real places.  There is a reason these films are compared to ""The Wizard of Oz"".
Almost every character is memorable and endearing, with the glaring exception of Aragorn!  Someone should have cast the ""Isildur"" character as Aragorn instead.  Since when did a stoner/slacker type like Viggo inherit the Kingdom of Gondor?
Though the ending is jagged and uneven, the book itself closes in much the same way.  This is the one place we can blame Tolkien instead of Jackson.",1079913600,,1721,4.951388888888889

I am not a person who reads a lot of books but after seeing the fellowship of the ring I read the fellowship and the two towers before the two towers came out at theaters and then read return of the king (which made my anticipation unprecedented).

1313812,3,B00003CWT6,"First of all, I did my best to separate the film from the book. As seemingly inexorable as J.R.R. Tolkien may be from this story, the book and the film are not one and the same, and so there's no sense in juxtaposing the two. Therefore, how true the storyline of the film is to the book is irrelevant. (Although I wondered throughout if Tolkien's Frodo was as much a sniveling, ineffectual wimp and the Frodo on the screen.)
I have a deep admiration for Peter Jackson's work and commitment to this film. It certainly is gorgeous to look at, it moves at a brisk pace (178 minutes didn't seem so long after all), the fight scenes are dizzying and dazzling, and the New Zealand landscapes shimmer. But I think I admire the film a lot more than I actually like it. Take away the effects and the quaint medieval costumes and you have a pretty basic mix of a Western and a road movie - all the good guys ride the white horses, the bad guys wear black, the posse ambles west and meets with some adventures along the way. Tolkien didn't invent those plotlines (I think Homer may have beat him to it). If you take away all of the chases, the sets, and the battles, you're also left with a pretty thin script centered on a less-than compelling main character (see previous paragraph). And I'm not sure I'll ever fully accept this herky-jerky computer animation. It's hard to complain about something being unrealistic in a film so fantastic in nature, but those moments of the film dominated by animation look ridiculous.
All that being said, LOTR is good fun, with a spirited cast and some nifty set pieces. It would have been easy for this story to spin wildly out of control, but Jackson shows his skills as a director time and time again, reining in the film long enough for the audience (and the actors) to catch our collective breath.",1078963200,8,1830,4.482035928143713

For those who are not Tolkien fans, my wife thought it was enjoyable, though she would not see it again.  I think everyone should at least give it a try - fan or not of the genre.",1078358400,,578,3.991304347826087

1313815,5,B00003CWT6,"Having at last seen all three installments of Jackson's beautiful trilogy, I can say that the only problem would be picking the best of the three.  I have leaned toward ""Fellowship,"" I think, because of it's sheer beauty.  The greens of the Shire, the russet colors of Rivendell, the Silvers of Lothlorien...the Alan Lee and John Howe designs convey the peaceful, the powerful, the majestic and the endangered.
Perhaps because this film, like the book it is based on, is, for its first two thirds, the calm before the storm of action, terror, and violence that will permeate the next two films, it is the most able to convey total harmony in all it's parts.  The artistic design, the music, and the acting are all perfectly inspired and inspiring, fueled and fueling of one another.
So much has been said of these films that it is hard to add anything meaningful; but I would like to add my opinion here because I feel these films have been a gift, of a sort, to all whose hearts are open to their messages.",1078099200,3,1007,4.552486187845304

The Extended Versions of these films are in my opinion are superior to the theatrical cuts, just for the fact that I can't get enough of the Lord of the Rings.  Here is my advice if you've never seen LOTR before.  Watch the theatrical cut.  If you love it, come back and be ready to have your senses pounded because the Extended Cuts will rock your world.  If you have seen the theatrical cuts and are debating about getting this because you were lukewarm on the movie...buy it.  Don't even hesitate for a second.  Buy the extended versions.

1313854,5,B00003CWT6,"I was not especially taken with Peter Jackson's films, but was sufficiently intrigued by them to read the story, and wasn't especially swayed by that either - Tolkein's masterwork is a heavily over-written linear, episodic chaser providing the context for a devoutly catholic (and therefore fairly block-headed) rumination on good and evil - the sort of thing you don't see too often in these post modern times (and three cheers for that).
What did impress me, though, was Tolkien's complete universe of Middle Earth, with its different languages, cultures, history, literature and mythology. This is a collossal feat of imagination and erudition, and to my mind far outstrips the value of the stories which, as I said, I found for the most part pretty dull.
Having wathced the extended edition DVD has opened my eyes to Peter Jackson's equivalent achievement - not through a re-watching of the film (although the additional half-hour is a marked improvment), but by watching the two ""appendix"" discs dealing with the making of the movie. To say Jackson and his team (especially the Weta Workshop) have an loving eye for detail is to massively understate the efforts they went to to visualise Tolkien's middle earth. No detail was spared, and the pity is that (rather like the books) much of the effort, skill, wit and invention will go totally unnoticed by the cinema-going public: the metalwork and engraving on the elven swords, the cultural motifs embedded into the design of the various creatures' weapons, the architecture of the various cities, even the fact that one poor soul at Weta spent three years and 12 miles of plastic pipe handmaking chain-mail just so the dwarves' and hobbits' armour looked convincing.
Utterly amazing, and it gives me a new-found respect for the films - this is a labour of love as opposed to a reinterpretation, and on that level it is an overwhelming triumph.",1077667200,2,1898,4.990536277602524

However, I recall Sam finding the rope in one of the boats. His gift from Galadriel was not the rope.

1313859,5,B00003CWT6,"...that the movie doesn't? The vocabulary of praise has been exhausted; and I see no need to wax platitudinous. It is simply impossible to capture the feeling this amazing 16 hour movie generates in the heart and the soul. I'm not even going to try.
One cannot imagine but that the late Professor Tolkein and his late (?) son and archivist, Christopher, would have cheered this work of not one but MANY lifetimes.
Tolkein produced a richly textured mythopoeic millieu that should be real; that is, in fact, more detailed than the history of many nations' national mythologies. Who does not long for a world where evil CAN be driven from the Earth?
Jackson, et al, so nailed the entire book (and it's as one movie as it is one book) that he achieved a miracle our dim praise can add nothing to other than competitive effusiveness.
The wonder speaks for itself. We all have that sinking feeling in our guts that the self-proclaimed Academy is going to ""Annie Hall"" LotR as it did to ""Star Wars"" all those years ago. At least we can thank the stars Woody Allen doesn't have a movie in contention! Back to the sinking feeling: we all know the ""Academy"" is going to administer the proverbial boot to Messers/Mesdames Jackson, Walsh, Mortensen, Astin, Woods, Rhys-Davies, Ian McKellen, et al. The failure to nominate Astin as Best Supporting Actor was obscene enough.
I dearly, dearly hope I'm wrong. If a marginal, ephemeral movie like ""Titanic"" can sweep, then the greatest movie of the generation, by any measure of justice, can and must do the same.
Should things go the way they look to, long after this year's Oscar Lights have faded away, and even amazing films like ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Master and Commander"" are forgotten in the bargain bins at Wal-Mart, long after our children have left this Earth to our grandchildren, one ineluctable truth will remain:
These movies have few equals and no superiors.
Rather like Prof. Tolkein himself.
Bravissimo!
Furthermore:
The ""extended"" scenes--as a twenty plus year devotee to the man and book which made my wretched, early adolescence bearable--really complete the story magnificently in ""Fellowship."" I'm amazed that non-readers of the books can follow them with having the background of the books. The references come so thick and fast... But Boyens, Walsh and Jackson managed it beautifully. My lovely wife whose never read the books (tho' she's started) found it easy to follow the story (of course she had the advantage of my near-encyclopedic knowledge of Tolkeiana--I know, that was ugly, but neologisms are rarely pretty). Yet more evidence of this ""team's"" multifarious genius and creation of a standard that we children of the Seventies see equal the Godfather and Star Wars movies: it raises the bar to the invisible and won't be topped for a very, very long time.
If the ""Matrix"" asks important questions, ""LotR"" answers them.",1077062400,,2891,4.926229508196721

1313861,3,B00003CWT6,"What Peter Jackson did with this is very smart. You have the original theatrical version that nearly everyone has seen, then you have the extended editions. In the extended editions, they add at least half an hour of scenes that were originally cut. They added them in right where they should be in the movie. More than that, they took out a few tid bits from the other film to make the transition into the new scenes more steady. The scenes add to the development of the characters, as well as to the understanding of their surroundings and their journey.
 Also, there are many documentaries about the making of the film. For any fan who is, as well, a fan of documentaries this is well worth the money. I found the one about the costume design rather interesting, though they should have elaborated on it a bit more. Everything you need to know (or want to know) about the making is contained on the last 2 disks. Cast commentaries, interviews with the cast and crew, the making of their vision, the storyboards, designs, artistry, etc.
 Overall, I think if you're going to buy the film, buy the extended editions. You get more for your money, and a better understanding of Jackson's visions compared to Tolkien's.
 As for the film itself, this is the slowest of the 3. As with the book, it's mainly based around the character development and the reasons behind their quest, this history of the rings, and things of that nature. I read the books after I saw the movies, so I had't noticed how much they deviated from the original story. Of course you have to keep in mind that there's a time limit that they must follow. FOTR is a long, long book with many details that would take upwards 5 or 6 hours to put on film. They can't expect you to sit in a theatre for that long. They knew this, so they had to make the decision to cut out entire chapters of the book. After reading the book, I wasn't at all bothered that they took out Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-wights. That part was all a bit hazy to me anyways. Besides, if you watch the extended edition of The Two Towers, you'll notice that they paid tribute to him through Treebeard, and actually touch on why they cut him out.
 I think this a wonderful movie. The imagery is spectacular. The storyline, of course, is amazing (you can't give them credit for that, but they were smart to take on this project). It's wonderful to see Tolkien's vision come to life. I actually, before seeing the films, had never heard of Tolkien. I'm very very glad that did. Through these films, I found the world of Tolkien, and am now addicted beyond aid. It's a masterpiece, to put it plainly enough, that will live on for generations.",1076889600,,2675,4.475409836065574

sean astin does a fine job as sam.
what i disliked:  where's tom bombadil?  whoever says that tom bombadil's omission doesn't take away from the film is either 'un con' or they didn't pay much attention to the book.  how tom bombadil stays entirely content even with the ring on is important to the story (think of plato's story about gyges and the experiences of galadriel and sam when faced with the proposition of taking the ring).
where is glorfindel who took frodo to the house of elrond to evade the black riders?!?!?! instead, we get ugly azz liv tyler(i wouldn't have had an objection if it were jules from bend it like beckham).
leotard, glitter and pointed ears don't capture elvish gaiety.
frodo is 50 yrs old. if that's peter jackson's idea of what a middle-aged man looks like, proudfoot would have to be at least 40 yrs older than bilbo.
peter jackson isn't funny. equating a hobbit who is hit in the head with an apple as humor is quite childish. furthermore, peter ruined the characters of pippin and merry, they're annoying.
who gave peter jackson the poetic license to think that he was shakespeare. example from the equally drab third film, aragorn to legolas:  what is it that your elvish eyes see?
peter jackson, elijah wood and ian mckellan are arrogant azzholes (just like anyone associated with the matrix). from book to vision???
bree, rivendell, hobbiton and the like are poorly represented. try and tell me that the river (whatever it is) in the third film that gives off a flourescent green light isn't better suited for the wizard of oz.
ben stein has livelier expressions than the actors in this film.

1313957,5,B00003CWT6,"When I went to see this movie with my son I thought I was in for a long snooze.  How wrong I was.  This movie grabbed me from the start.  With amazing cinematography, special effects, acting, and a storyline that is compelling beyond imagining!  All this and a group of characters who are kind of like The Justice League of the comics.  Don't let the three hours daunt you as it is the easiest three hours you will ever spend!
The hardest thing about seeing this movie was that I had to wait almost a year for part 2.  Viewers that are seeing this for the first time are lucky because part 2 is already out on DVD.  More good news is that all three films were shot together so the actors don't age between films keeping the continuity.
That said let's talk about the story.  Balbo Baggins, a Hobbitt has a ring that tries to draw in men to the dark force (kind of like the dark force in Star Wars).  Balbo, nearing the end of his life passes the ring to Frodo.  Frodo now the keeper of the ring, has to battle the urge to put the ring on.  He wears it around his neck.  He is visited by a wizard who tells him that the only way to defeat the dark forces is to travel with the ring to their land, Mordor, and cast the ring into the fiery depths inside Mordor.
Frodo sets off from the shire with the wizard and three of his Hobbitt companions.  Along the way their band is joined by some of the most memorable characters in film history that includes a Troll, an Elf Archer, and a man.  The band battles zombie like demons, dragons, and magic on the way.  All the while the dark forces continue to tempt Frodo and anyone who comes near the ring, to put the ring on.  At one point, and I am not sure if it is in this film or in the second film, the wizard says that if Frodo were to put the ring on, mankind would be lost.
As good as this film is the second film is even better!",1075852800,3,1875,4.054347826086956
1314021,5,B00003CWT6,"Ok so how do I rate a product 5 stars but not like it?  Tell you how...
If you are new to Middle Earth lore and Tolkien, then the extended edition is for you!
If you are a serious movie collector especially of Tolkienian lore and must have all the details on laser copy... then the extended edition is for you!
If you know all about Middle Earth, were a dice shooting pencil wielding junkie on a 24 hour role-playing jag, felt the joy of slaying a ring wraith,  and felt really clever when Frodo hid under his cloak thinking ""KEWL... thats an elfin cloak!""  and don't want lore secrets spoon fed to you... Then the extended edition is NOT for you!
At the risk of sounding arrogant, thats me.  Had Lembas, been there done that.  And funny... I must give Kudo's to the Editor for the theatrical edition, as the editing was supurb.  The additional fleshing out of the sub plots was nice but additional explaination footage is not nescessary if you just like to figure things out and leave the spoon for the kids.  The only realy negative thing I have to say is that the ceremonials left me feeling alienated ala DUNE (80s version), hozanahs to the editor again.  The grand entries and presentations just did not make me feel closer to the characters, the dramatic scene of our hero's cresting the hill after leaving Rivendale was quite enough... rather replace that with the exit ceremony from Rivendale as Frodo gets a line in that makes him... um... more hobbit.
One other thing... After having heard the fell thunder of Saurans dark spirit uttering vile things, I would have been utterly terrified to even discuss using that ring... So editing out that part made Boromir seem a lot smarter and sympathetic character.
So if you're a collector or new to Tolkien, go ahead spend the money and enjoy!  If you know all about middle earth then depending on your viewing tastes you may want to consider if the extra footage is worth the extra cash.",1075766400,,1941,4.554597701149425
1314022,1,B00003CWT6,"LOTR is undeniably a spectacle; it's beautifully shot by an accomplished director, and it's clear that no expense was spared, and everyone involved cared deeply about the project.
So why was this film so dull?  And why did it seem endless from the get go?
Because there's nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, going on beneath the surface.  LOTR is an idealess wasteland, and the high language and creative geography don't hide the depthlessness of the story for very long.  Leaving The Shire for Mordor isn't any more gripping than driving from Cleveland to Cincy unless those locales or the journey are charged with some meaning.  Nothing's at stake in LOTR, and as a result, it's a breathtakingly tedious parade of costumes and landscapes.
Sure, movies can be escapist fare, and that goes double for any form of fantasy fiction.  On that level, LOTR might qualify as mindless weekend fun, except this movie (and its fans) insists that it's filled with deeper meaning.
Sorry, but it isn't.  For that to be true, LOTR would need stuff like, oh, maybe subtexts, symbols, and metaphors buttressing its story lines.  And a point of view wouldn't hurt--LOTR can't jump beyond nerdfest status without saying something about the REAL world, even if speaks though fantasy figures in imaginary settings.
But there's none of that in this flick--it's just good guys versus bad guys in the end, ones that aren't particularly interesting in their virtues or vices.  I wanted to like this film, and looked for more; my date was smarter, and fell asleep.
For an ironic comparison film, look at Peter Jackson's own Heavenly Creatures.  It's a terrifically creepy flick, based on a true story about two girls who committed a grisly murder in the 1950's.  It's a fantasy film, filled with spectacular costumes and imaginary characters.  But it's also about sexuality, sublimation and psychological disorders.  And it's got interesting things to say about the use and abuse of fantasy, and about the blissful/terrifying links between infatuation and detachment from reality.
LOTR, on the other hand, is all flash and no substance, which is why the most impassioned reviews listed here are about differences in details between the book and the movie, rather than the IDEAS behind Peter Jackson's version versus Tolkien's.
So if you like debates about the battle readiness of elves versus hobbits, get the DVD.  If you like stories that hit you on multiple levels, skip it.",1075680000,26,2448,5.0

1314024,5,B00003CWT6,"Whether you've seen the theatrical version of FOTR or not, the extended version is a MUST.  Not only the additional scenes, but the extended scenes make this version much richer than the already incredible theatrical release.  A few days after watching the extended edition I caught the end of the movie on TV, as it was playing Boromir's death scene.  Just as he dies, Aragorn stands, tears running down his face.  As I waited to hear ""They will look for his coming at the white tower, but he will not return..."" it cut to the next scene.  It was almost painful to watch.  I know that in the book the line isn't spoken for another chapter or two, but it made the scene far more powerful and emotional.  What is too bad is that New Line didn't feel that LOTR fans would tolerate another 20 or 30 minutes in the theatre.  I would love to see all three movies in their extended versions on the big screen.
Regardless, buy this movie and The Two Towers in the extended versions.  And let's hope it's not too long before we see Return of the King in the same format.
By the way, be sure to watch as many of the special features as possible.  Especially the cast commentary.  It's a riot!",1075420800,2,1183,4.3561643835616435
1314025,5,B00003CWT6,"The extended cut of The Fellowship validates the DVD format. You can't put together this kind of package on VHS (especially when you consider all the special audio tracks). The filmmakers have made the most of the digital format, using just about every option on a standard DVD player.
The film itself is fantastic. The extended version is superior to the theatrical release. And the documentaries are overwhelming --- in a good way. If you want to know how to make a blockbuster movie, watch closely. There's so much to watch and learn, it takes days to absorb it all. Special effects that appear on screen for 10 seconds are given 10 minutes of explanation (like the big rigs). They even spend half an hour on just the *sound* of the movie.
It's worthwhile to remember how risky the Lord of the Rings project was. After filming all three movies at once (more or less), the first film had to be a blockbuster or the whole project would've been turned into a salvage operation. The DVDs would have been quick-and-dirty attempts to recoup lost millions. But thanks to the success of the first film, the filmmakers could justify this lavish 4-disc set.
My favorite moments: The extended Council of Elrond, the early design drawings, the canoe stories, the construction of the Shire, and the biographical documentary about JRR Tolkien. The only things I didn't like: The color grading is over-done in Lothlorien (why is the forest so blue?), when the elves and the Fellowship stand on a ridge looking at Lothlorien in the distance they are looking at a painting, and I never understood the difference between orcs and uruk-hai. (Do they ever fight orcs, or are they always fighting uruks?)

The added material was the result of uncovering a whole additional layer of footage that was left out for time reasons, but with the same quality of the rest of the movie, just having been edited out because it was not critical for the purposes of telling the story, yet I'd argue that it complements it in such a way that I can't conceive the movie without these moments now.
As for the features, then again, the movie lent itself to a very broad array of things to share.

Based truthfully on J.R.R Tolkein's masterpiece, the movie adaption swipes through other unsuccessful triologies such as ""The Matrix"" and ""Terminator"". Triology Films have the unfortunate tendancy to lose its grip as the story through the films proceed, but Peter Jackson's ingenious version of ""The Lord of the Rings"" is by a milestone an exception, finally bringing the term ""Film Triology"" out of the darkness.
The ""Fellowship"" begins with an awe-striking prologue featuring revolutionary visual-effects so brilliant, not once do you think about them. Within the country of Mordor, the evil Sauron has forged, in the fires of Mount Doom the One Ring. In it he pours his mallice and hatred, powers so great it performs an immediate magnetic force upon the one who bares it.
Centuries after a great war to rid Middle Earth of the Ring fails, it finds itself into the hands of the most unlikely creature of all...
Here is where we meet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo.  The nephew of the famous Bilbo Baggins. By coinsodence the One Ring falls into the grasp of Frodo, who appears to have an unusual resistance to the Ring's evil. Learning of the Ring's terrible power, Frodo embarks on the journey that will eventaully toss his world upside down, and ventures towards the fires of Mt. Doom, the only place where the ring can be disposed.
Along the way, Frodo is accompanied by the Fellowship, a team of 4 hobbits, a man, an elf, a dwarf and wizard oathed to guide the Ring Barer through the perilous journey to teh heart Mordor. The quest is a road of fear, heartache and pain, and soon Frodo begins to feel the magnetic pull towards the Ring, realising that he must complete the journey alone with his guardian Sam.
This film is everything you look for in an epic: exquised battle sequences and intensity. The movie explores priceless themes, such as hope, friendship, bravery, trust and begins the unbreakable bond between two unlikely heros.

It begins to corrupt him day-by-day and one day he leaves it behind for for his one, Frodo Baggins.  His wizard friend Gandalf The Grey sets off to find about of the ring's past.  The ring belonged to a dark creature on Mt. Dune.  The ring was forged there and only there it can be destroyed.  When the creature was defeated, a warrior known as Eceildor took it and he was lead to the heart of Mt. Dune where it would be destroyed.  Eceildor kept it and the race of men had failed after that.  Drodo is told of its past, and he sets off on his own journey to get it as far awar from Middle Earth as possible for the black riders would find it.

I have waited my entire life for this film and let me tell you that my knee-length black trenchcoat nearly burst into flames the moment that The Fellowship of the Rings appeared before me on the silver screen!  I have been reading Tolkien for the last 25 years and I love all of his work! ( except all of that highbrow academic stuff that he REALLY wanted to be remembered for!) His writing provided me with a whole world of imaginary freinds and adventures  I even had an imaginary Elf/gnome  girlfriend when I was 24! His work made me begin work on my own one million page fantasy novel!
I really liked this film. I  think that the special effects are almost as good as the 70's version of the Lord of The Rings! I REALLY love that version too. My one complaint however, is that I always pictured Froto looking a lot like ME! Well, you can't win 'em all!
Maybe one day I'll meet a REAL Elf/gnome girl and ride off into the Narnian sunset and go visit my buddy Harry Potter....or My friends and I could find a ring and ZOOM-A-LOOM off in search of adventure!!!!!Oh, if only!

1314115,5,B00003CWT6,"First of all, take my advice, never, EVER see the theatrical version again if you buy this.  This is a much more in depth film and Tolkein's original masterworks shine through on a much larger level.  To list a few, you start to see Borimir turn against the Fellowship and Aragorn, instead of the sudden blow-up in the theatrical version which leaves viewers saying ""Wow! What just happened?"" Frodo and Sam see a band of elves leaving Middle-Earth while still in the Shire which I think more than anything starts the viewer off seeing both the beauty in the elves and the doom of Middle-Earth.  Frodo also dosn't seem quite so much the misunderstood hero upon leaving Rivendell (a smile plays at my face when I remember the scene in which the Fellowship leaves Rivendell with many expecting eyes on them and Frodo hisses to Gandalf ""Quick! Left or Right fork?!""
Hobbiton and the Shire are much more devoloped (as in the books) and before long one starts to think of the hobbit homesteads as the perfect picture of home and sanctuary.  Also, the viewer's eyes are opened to the race of hobbits in the beginning when Bilbo is writting the first chapter of his book, Concerning Hobbits, which many of you Tolkein fans will surely recognize.  Bilbo's every-growing obbsesion of the Ring of Power is portrayed and devoloped much more in this expanded edition than in the original release.
The expansion of this film is not just simply deleted scenes inserted, oh no!  The extra scenes are right up to the standards of the theatrical movie and they fit in perfectly.

1314205,1,B00003CWT6,"This is perhaps my favourite book, and even though I didn't expect the film to be completely faithful to it, I was not prepared for this hideousness!  All the nauseating hype beforehand, e.g. about the millions spent on recreating everything faithfully (I even remember the director being described as ""a hobbit"" - the hilarious Meet the Feebles tends to rebut that pretension!), served only to deepen my revulsion.
The book is full of beauty, depth, sadness, loss and grandeur, but it has been turned into just another Hollywood Blockbuster, with the violence amplified and glorified at the expense of all else (of course), with the egregious cod-Wagnerian soundtrack to boot.  For example, the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf never contained overt violence - Gandalf, having appraised the situation, did not resist physically.  Events and characters merely mentioned in the book (e.g. orcs being spawned, Sauron) are spelled out, and lose their power in one's imagination for having been done so.
The characters are not developed in the film, and, in the case of the Elves, are unrecognisable.  Elrond is reduced to a shallow, inhospitable, snippy irrelevance, instead of one of Middle Earth's wisest, with great depths of knowledge and insight.  The word ""Elf"" ordinarily has a somewhat effeminate connotation in English, but not in Tolkien's tales; but the creators of this film do not understand - it's as if pointy ears are all that's necessary to portray one.
The sets are claustrophobic, with Lorien, Bree and Rivendell particular disappointments - Lorien was full of light in the book, a place ""[without] sickness or deformity"", but is a dark, cramped and twilit hiding place in the film.  Bree is more like an imagined Victorian London than a rural outpost.  Rivendell seems reduced to some sort of ornate tree house.  And this is constant.  The film just misses the point.
Maybe harking back to the book is not the way to review a film!  But the story is such a large (and split) narrative, the film is almost incoherent without an understanding of the book.
The film tells of good and evil, but without showing the virtues of good, and while also failing to explain the evil.  You are expected to support the heroes, as it is showed from their side, and because the villains are uglier and more brutal.  No character in the film shows an understanding beyond the actions required in the narrative.  The roles of females are increased - because it is the Hollywood formula - which says it all.  It is an empty spectacle.

He has made three motion pictures of The Lord Of The Rings. A brief history of the author is in order i believe. In 1892 a man named John Ronald Reuel was born. 56 years later he had completed The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings. Many say these books are the greatest fantasy novels ever written. Others, say they were the key to the now opened door of amazing fantasy and fictional stories. Now back to the movies. The Lord Of The Rings The Fellowship Of The Ring motion picture is an amazing adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's book. The movie has everything. Hobbits, Wizards, Men, Elves, Dwarves and many other wonderful creatures. This edition is marvellously presented. It contains hours of enjoyable entertainment. I urge you to buy any Tolkien product especially this one. It has everything. This edition is an extended edition of the theatrical version and is even better. I never ever thought the movie could get any better but it does. I will not ruin it for you but it contains 30 minutes plus of additional footage that will keep you amazed for hours plus two more discs containing The Appendices which are amazing as well. All in all it is perfect, you will never ever...ever see anything like this in your life again, I promise.",1073606400,,2031,4.477088948787062
1314207,5,B00003CWT6,"I have to admit that the 1st time I saw this movie I thought it was a 3 hour waste of my time and kicked my self for paying for the ticket and told everyone I knew how bad this movie was. Then when the 2nd movie came I watched it on DVD (with a good surround system) and I hated it too. But my girlfriend who had never seen the movies wanted to see em. I tryed to convence her that they sucked but she wanted to see em regardless. Seeing the 1st movie again I more easily recongnized the plot and something meraculous happened. It was like a light had been turned on and I understood why everyone loved these movies. Needless to say I watched the 1st two movies (the 3rd had not yet been released) over and over again and fell in love with them. When Gandolof said ""You SHALL NOT PAASSSSSSS!!!"" it brought me a new meaning of chill bumbs :D The music which accompanies the movies is powerful and brillant and I would recommend the soundtrack as well. For all the people that just thought these movies are boring...I believe they should give them another chance. When recently seeing the last movie I was teary eyed in the end and wished that it would never end. I can't recommend this or any of the other movies highly enough.",1073520000,,1226,4.243589743589744

It is just impossible to love any movie more than I loved the Fellowship, but The Two Towers was completely incredible!  I absolutely loved the movie.  The characters are uinforgettable and the leading men are really really really gorgeous...  Legolas in particular, but anyway, everyone did a great job in that movie.

1314210,5,B00003CWT6,"It's difficult to review these films without lots of superlatives. If you are either a film lover, aspiring pro or a student interested in what makes a film tick, these DVDs are priceless. Many DVD sets have a director and perhaps a few pivotal cast members talking about their work on a film - this DVD takes the time to question the production designers and other ""below the line"" crew to ask them how they put LOTR together.
The documentaries here are excellent: a brief biography of Tolkien himself, all sorts of goodies on the making of this production, storyboards and crude computer animation for scenes, showing how the special effects were designed in certain scenes - you can even watch the crude animation and the finished scenes side by side! I particularly enjoyed learning about the Tolkien illustrators (especially Alan Lee) whose work influenced Jackson, and were then coaxed into leading the production design teams. Costume designers and illustrators will no doubt love the diverse galleries and pictures that are also available on the DVD.
You do get a sense of what an adventure the film was for the actors, especially the four younger men playing Frodo, Legolas, Merry and Pippin, who are all at the beginning of their careers (literally so for Bloom). Their exuberance is balanced by more seasoned actors like Mortensen and McKellan.
Elijah Wood rolls his eyes describing how Sean Astin overprotected him - just as Samwise Gamgee would - particularly on a helicopter shoot. I found this unintentionally funny in a dark sort of way (TANGENT ALERT). Both Astin and Wood grew up in front of the cameras, but Astin is 10 years older, more likely to know of the ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" helicopter accident which killed actor Vic Morrow (father to Jennifer Jason Leigh). (Weirdly, Bloom would win a role in ""Black Hawk Down"" around the time of ""LOTR"" playing Todd Blackburn, the young Army Ranger whose fall from a helicopter figured heavily in the Battle of Mogadishu. I guess Elijah didn't read *that* script.) Interestingly, Sean Astin, whose parents are John Astin and Patty Duke, used to study with Stella Adler, who promoted the Stansilaski method of acting, usually known as ""the method"". (I.e, the actor ""becomes"" his or her role, and Nic Cage has an excuse to eat cockroaches - yes, just read about his role in ""Vampire's Kiss"".) By the final reel of ""King"", he comes off as one of the strongest players, even outshining Wood. Sean, keep up with the air traffic control - especially if it helps your performance!
As far as the acting is concerned, ""Fellowship"" is so full of moments and terrific scenes that it really does seem to get better upon multiple viewings. A standout example is that of Sean Bean as Boromir. It's easy to dismiss Boromir as a weak, would-be Judas (particularly if you've seen ""Ronin"" or ""Goldeneye"", rather than his excellent British TV work as ""Sharpe"") but after the initial shock of his choice fades, on second and third viewings, Bean is touching, a troubled yet courageous knight who finally redeems himself. Boromir is even easier to sympathize with if you view the extended ""Two Towers"" DVD, which sheds insight into his father -the steward of Gondor- and the dark expectations heaped upon Boromir, his first son and heir. It also helps bridge the relationship between Boromir and Faromir.
All the ""LOTR"" films, but especially ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", seem more like historical drama than fantasy. The last piece to attempt this, the ""Mists of Avalon"" miniseries, does not come close in terms of depth and believability, despite being based on truthful historical trends (i.e. the passing of pagan Europe to Christianity and the ensuing turmoil).
The scenery is also breathtaking: Jackson's aerial shots of the snowcapped Mountains of Moria, where one of the Fellowship sacrifices himself for his friends, are absolutely stunning. Strangely, a ""pro"" review snippily suggested German ""mountain films"" as a major influence on the cinematography and film! If you're a non-film geek, a suggestion that something is reminiscent of a ""German mountain film"" is usually a back-handed swipe, since those stories are often lumped together with Nazi cinema. Leni Riefenstahl initially distinguished herself as a ""mountain film"" actress and later directed ""The Blue Light"" before ""Triumph of the Will"". These films had their heyday during Germany's withering Weimar regime, and anticipated a lot of the same themes (purity of man and environment, social Darwinism) that were later developed in Nazi propaganda. Ergo, Peter Jackson films a beautiful, snowy vista, and it's automatically a ""homage"" to these films and thus suggestive of Nazism? This is downright insulting when you consider that this entire saga is about a fellowship of different races uniting and saving Middle Earth.
Moreover, the love for nature is inherent to Tolkien's original text. Jackson has built on top of detailed, thoughtful words - creating a gorgeous, treacherous, seemingly real world. George Lucas's recent films have been just as beautiful visually - stunning, really - and yet they seem much more ""fantastical"", unreal, than what we see in the filmed LOTR. Moreover, not only do Jackson and company seem more passionate about the world they've created in these films, their characters are more passionate...fully-breathing, fully realized...as well. (And I say this despite being very excited about the third Star Wars prequel.)
After the popularity dies down a bit, expect some academics, especially those with a Marxist bent, to find lots of faults with the film - especially considering its large budget. (Again with the ""German mountain film"" suggestion). Some academic critics seem to believe the last good fiction film was ""Battleship Potemkin"". Don't let these people ruin your enjoyment of intelligent, beautiful films.
If ""Fellowship"" has an Achilles' heel, it's that it must serve as exposition and explanation for the second two films, as well as parts of ""The Hobbit"". Despite that, it manages to be a feast for the eyes, ears, and brain.",1073347200,2,6089,5.09
1314211,5,B00003CWT6,"I love Tolkien books.  But don't judge the films by the books.  Sorry, it's apple's and oranges - the best of each crop.  Who says you have to chose?  Not me!  I have seen this film so many times I could likely apply for Guinness Book of Records.  Hey even my cat LOVES this film.  Seriously, she will sit and watch this and The Two Tower hypnotised by the film!
It's is NOT a kids film.  Parents not paying attention - this is NOT Harry Potter.  This is a very complicated story, with very high ideas that are way over a kid's head.  There is violence, quite frightening, and you will spend all your time trying to explain it to small ones, so NO it's not a whole family film.
I think Jackson created something everyone needs in this ME-Generation disconnected-from-the-masses computer people.  People online connect, but they also are isolated.  This film reminds us there are things more important than our immediate wishes.  Like fellowship, love and the willingness to sacrifice yourself for the great good of people you care for.  It is a theme we needed to be reminded, and it touches our hearts.  Tolkien's world, vividly and beautifully created by director Jackson is a place where honour, good and evil are not just words, but are the forces that shape lives.
Brilliant filmed, marvellously acted, it has propelled Viggo Mortensen rightly into the superstar spotlight his talent deserves.  Aragorn is the role of a lifetime and he breathes such life into the character.  As does wonderful newcomer Orlando Bloom as Legolas. The bond between Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are friendships we all would wish to experience.  Ian McKellan, Christopher Lee, John Rhys Davies are as always brilliant.  But the hobbit bunch is great with Wood great as Frodo, but more surprisingly Sean Astin (son of Patty Duke and John Astin) as Sam, gives the film such heart.  Also, the growth of the jokers Merry and Pippin is deft conceived and acted.
If you are an Ring Addict and cannot get enough, buy the extended version.  If you are not a nitpicker who wants all the details, then this is a perfect version for you.
Me, sigh, I have both...and figure I will end up buying the Complete Collectors Edition when Jackson stuff all three into a single box.  Most of the time, when they do these repackages, I get ticked begin suckered into buy each incarnation.

I actually didn't see the film until it was released on DVD (the non-extended version).  I borrowed it from a friend.
I sat through it and boy was I ever shocked.  When the movie ended, I felt almost embarrassed because I actually got up in my living room, by myself, and clapped.  I could not believe that I missed this at the theatres where the impact would have been much greater.
I raved to everyone about how great this movie was - of course, they already had seen it.  So I felt behind the times.
I could not wait until the release of the Extended version on DVD, which I now own.
I learned my lesson and will listen to my friends on movies like this.

1314263,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is very good. I think this movie is one of the best movie with it's sequels, and books. Movies like Harry Potter or some other movie that has a book to go along with it is not as good. I have seen all the Harry Potter movie's and it's good, but simply not as good as LOTR Fellowship of the Ring. This movie has very good story. The book has more details with things but the movie is much shorter. But I like the fact that they made a movie and I finally got to see the novels in a motion picture. The amazing story with its' good action, fighting, and romance makes the movie like a masterpiece. I get all emotional and frustrating everytime I see someone dying or getting stabbed all the time (Frodo). The movie not only has good actions and great story, it has good looking actress and goos actors that really acts like a pro. Those actors really fit by their looks and roles. God, I'm so amazed. I have never seen a movie this good. Harry Potter seems like a kids' version of LOTR and other nice movies never have good story like LOTR did. Specially, I recommend that you get the full screen edition because you will enjoy it better than the widescreen editions. I really get annoyed of the widescreen editions. The bonus scenes are good extras and try to watch all the movies. The Two Towers, and The Return of the King (in theatre). You should also get the books and read it even though the movie is more fun the book has more details. Even the game if you are into it. I hardly recommend this movie.

However, if you have to decide between the extended version and this version, I would go for the extended version. Unless you're an obsessive fan and need both anyhow. After seeing the quality of the ""cut"" stuff from the Fellowhship EE, I realized the main reasons for their editing was either time or some sort of minor pacing issue Peter Jackson had.

1314338,4,B00003CWT6,"J.R.R. Tolkein couldn't have even fathomed that the magical world he dreamed up would be embraced around the world like it is today. Who would imagine that men and women from all corners of the world would be embracing hobbits, elves, and dwarves? The classic fantasy book series has gathered legions of fans over the years since their original release in the 1950's and that swarm is expected to grow with the release of the first film based on the series. But many doubts are raised among the Tolkein followers such as the no-name director heading the project and the lack of star power behind many of the roles. New Line studio is hoping these dilemmas will be quelled by the impending release especially with the $300 million price tag hanging over their heads for all three films. Those executives should have nothing to worry about granting that the film stays true to the classic books they were based on. If not, a great uproar will be heard round the world! Okay, that may be a little extreme but you get the idea.
The story set in the land of Middle Earth follows the adventures of a young hobbit who inherits a mystical ring that could bring about the end of the world. Frodo Baggins, an ambitious young hobbit, wishes to venture outside the Shire, the home he has known all his life, to experience the wonders of the world much like his Uncle Bilbo did. One night his wish comes true but he gets more then he bargained for. When his uncle leaves the Shire to live out the rest of his life, he gives a ring he discovered years ago to his nephew for safe keeping. But as the wise wizard Gandalf the Grey finds out, the ring is actually the Ring of Power that, if in the wrong hands, could bring about the end of Middle Earth. Frodo must now travel take the ring and through it into the fires of Mount Doom, deep within the lands of Mordor, home to the evil Saruron, where it was once created. Along the troubling journey, he encounters new friends, challenging obstacles, and terrifying enemies. The story of The Fellowship of the Ring sticks relatively true to its source outside of few instances here and there that aren't that noticeable outside of the true Tolkein legion of fans. The pacing of the film goes slowly in parts, which burdens the film a lot, before picking up in big action sequences before slowing down once again.
As it was said before, the cast is a relatively bunch of no names which brought fear to some fans of the fantasy series but luckily those fears are not realized here. Elijah Wood seems born for the role of Frodo Baggins outside of his relatively short size. Wood does a wonderful job at presenting an emotionally conflicting character who is afraid of the future but does what he must do to prevent evil from taking control of the world. Ian McKellen, who performs as Gandalf the Grey, is nothing short of spectacular in this role. The audience really connects with the grandfather-like character which makes his final scene the film all the more heart-breaking. Roles by other members of the cast will have to be determined later on in The Two Towers as their roles aren't as expanded as the previously mentioned two. But from what could be seen so far in this film, they do an excellent job and fans shouldn't expect less in the next two installments.
Overall, Tolkein's vision is fully realized in The Fellowship of the Ring in all its hobbit and elfish glory. The feature does have its share of problems but there is enough good material to outbalance any squabbles made about it. Such complaints would include the nearly three hour time length that feels dragged out by the end. Cutting it down by fifteen minutes probably wouldn't have hurt the feature but by the looks of the overall appearance of The Fellowship, Jackson seems to know what he is doing. Another problem is that the film tends to slow down quite a few times after large action sequences especially the journey through the mine. Other then those instances, The Fellowship of the Ring is a fabulous start to a film series with huge expectations. Those expectations should be met and exceeded by The Two Towers next year.",1072742400,,4135,4.589189189189189

I am not a fan of extremely long camera shots of facial expressions, especially given the limited range of expressions emotted by some of the hobbits in particular.  Liv tyler also only had one facial expression, her poker face.  I give LOTRF 4 stars and RETURN OF THE KING 5 stars.

1314341,5,B00003CWT6,"I decided to hold off reviewing this beloved epic until I have seen it in its entirety and now that I have I confidently and enthusiastically cry out a big WOW for the most impressive epic film ever made.
Every single aspect of this film is infused with Peter Jackson's (director) ingenious and exquisite vision. The colossal production is very evident throughout the trilogy and the mesmerizing special effects are exactly that ... mesmerizing. Filming this epic in one shot was perhaps the most brilliant idea Peter Jackson had for this film. Over the past three years, every December fans take off from where we left off the previous year without feeling a discrepancy here or there in the characters, the landscape or pace. It's as if we were suspended in the no-time zone for a year after year ready to experience the magic of the Ring.
The ensemble cast is magnificent as well. I cannot pick favorites (even though I loved Sam Gamgee) for that every single actor did an outstanding job depicting his/her character and together they played an ethereal symphony Beethovenian in caliber. J. R. R. Tolkien's characters represented the full gamut of human nature and Peter Jackson was able to recreate that on the screen with stark detail. From the peace-loving, innocent hobbits to the evil and sinister Orcs lies the perpetually confused, unpredictable man. The epic in a way represents the microcosm of life: a perpetually peculiar battle between perceived good and perceived evil.
Fall from grace, confusion, dilemmas, hard decisions, community strength, courage and triumph are some of the many underlying themes of this universally adored work of art. Some people have dismissed this film as a ""fantasy flick"", but in reality it is an epic with an incredible impact like that of Ben Hur's, Spartacus' and Gladiator's combined!

Jackson does an excellent job of integrating simple, yet important details into the movie without dragging it down or becoming redundant.  For everyone who complains that this still isn't true to the book, nothing is perfect, but as far as a literary adaptation to the big screen, I think this version gets very high scores.  Sure, Tom Bombadil was left out, but it would have been really difficult I think to make those scenes work in the movie.  Some of the extras that I like are the scenes between Frodo and Gandalf explaining the origins of the ring of power and giving more detail into Gollum's history.  In addition, I think the scenes with the elves are excellent, especially the distributing of the gifts to the nine and the scene where Gimli falls in love with Galadriel.

It's all bad acting from the word go, and the music can't hype up what the story lacks. I have a theory on why people love these movies; they feel that because the directors and actors and writers try so hard to make an ""Epic Saga of Biblical Proportions,"" that they (the movie-goers), must give the film makers positive reviews just for the effort. I am different. I will not give good reviews to a movie just because it's ten billion hours long. Good is good, fairyish is fairyish and my time is too important, as is yours, to be wasted on this midevil drivle. And now I will cast a spell. I call it the ""I'm to influenced by movie advertising and special effects to think for myself spell."" See, it's already working.

1314452,5,B00003CWT6,"I have seen all three parts of the trilogy. Clearly, the ""Return of the King"" (part three) is the best part. This is actually one ten hour movie rather than three movies. Publishing constraints and move viewing patience were behind the division. I am not a fantasy fan. Mention wizards and elves and I am as ready to run from you as I would from a Star Trek convention. But I enjoyed LOTR.  At ten hours, this is an alternate world rather than a 90 minute entertainment. And the finale not only satisfies completely, it throws light back on the earlier installments.  Saying that, I could have done without 3 or more hours of this saga. An editor would have been welcomed. ""Fellowship""  sometimes moves at a glacial pace. The constant run-ins with strange creatures and other obstacles gets to be repetitive. Ok, the journey to return the ring is not easy. I got the point after the first three or four challenges. Enough, already. This is not a problem in part three, which moves so fast you don't believe it is three and a half hours long. In parts one and two, you will need caffeine to stay awake through it all. I am very glad that I saw all three parts as I consider this a great movie with a spectacular ending.

1314453,5,B00003CWT6,"How long has it been since we last saw a quality Sci-Fi or Fantasy film? Most of the time whenever Hollywood makes a film about this genre it gets muddled up with special effects or gets too hyped-up for its own good. Now, along comes director Peter Jackson (The Frighteners) with his unique vision of this classic Tolkien trilogy, the Lord of the Rings.
I must admit that I had reservations about these films but after seeing both the threatrical version and the Extended Edition, I much prefer the EE. For the simple fact that the films make more sense with those scenes added back into the film. Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job in the way he handled this movie, keeping true to the spirit of the original novel and treating fans of this trilogy with the respect they derserve.
There is a special feature in this first set that I got a real kick out of; the Lord of the Rings: MTV Version spoof that appears on the first disk. Jack Black & Sarah Michelle Geller are hilarious in that little bit and this film with all of its special features comes very highly recommended.",1072310400,2,1081,4.4646464646464645
1314454,5,B00003CWT6,"I was worried that Peter Jackson might botch the trilogy up simply b/c his previous two films didn't work for me.  So, as the opening of the first LOTR film got closer and closer, I was really starting to wonder.  See, I knew that, comparing this to STAR WARS, that the fantasy genre would go nowhere in movies if LOTR bombed.
Fortunately, I was wrong about Jackson and the quality of the movie, so, I am gladly eating my hat.
FELLOWSHIP begins the tale of the struggle between good and evil in which the Evil Lord's ring, which is imbued with a great deal of his essence, is lost after good wins.  Through a series of incidents Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit, inherits the ring, but finds out that it must be destroyed or the world will end in fire.
The extended version includes extra footages like: (1) more fight scenes with the Uruk Hai; (2) a scene of Merry and Pippin dancing; (3) additional Shire material in the beginning; (4) more with the fight at Moria; (5) a bit more travel time and sequences at Rivendell; and (6) more backstory about Gollum.
But, the true treasure of this four CD set lies in the commentary of the creative team:
(1) Did you know that Galadriel is a great aunt to Arwen?  So, when she talks to Aragorn about his relationship with her, it's more of a big deal than we think;
(2) There's lots about the makeup of the hobbits and especially the hours spent on the feet and makeup;
(3) Details of how the orcs and other fantastic creatures were made; especially about the rock troll;
(4) Did you know that some of the people passing by the hobbits at the PRANCING PONY were acrobatic women on stilts?;
(5) How many times they rewrote the prelude which introduced Sauron;
(6) The makeup and design of Rivendell; why it was set with nature and many open causeways to the elements;
(7) How the director got some of the most famous artists, who did renditions of Tolkien, to work on the set;
(8) How the cast was chosen;
(9) It goes through the whole movie with commentary by the director and writers; and then another run through with commentary by the actors;
(10) Why the prologue with the battle against Sauron kept being taken out and then being put back in;
(11) How the director told Ian McKellan (i.e. Gandalf) to compare Frodo volunteering to taking the ring to having a son who just volunteered to fight in the WWI trenches.;
(12) How Sean Astin hurt his foot;
(13) The CGI and how it helped plot the story;
(14) Dwarf tossing remarks;
(15) The design of the Balrog;
(16) Why Tom Bombadil didn't make it in the movie;
(17) How the director and writers had to deal with the producers and studios to accomplish certain feats (i.e. like letting Gandalf smoke!)

  I really enjoyed the new opening sequence where it showed the map and Bilbo writing ""The Hobbit"" and ""Concerning Hobbits"".  I really enjoyed that, because it seemed to explain hobbits more and give a more enjoyable feel to the movie.
  Also, I'm tired of everyone complaining about Bombadil, he had 1 chapter!  He had nothing to do with the Ring or the Fellowship.  He was mentioned once in the Council of Elrond in the book, but Jackson only put things in the movie that had to do with the Ring.  Therefore, Bombadil was not needed.

The theatrical release of this first installment of the famous ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was everything I had expected and more.  Jackson added his own touches while still managing to remain REMARKABLY faithful to the books!  No easy task!
When this extended edition came out, I was first to pounce on it!
And the impossible occurred -- it was even BETTER than the original release!  So much was added, it was phenomenal!  Mostly, it's just thirty seconds here, a couple of minutes there, though there are some quite heavily extended portions as well.  But even the tiny things added SO much color and life to this already brilliant piece of cinematic art!  I couldn't help thinking, ""Ack!  How could they ever have left this OUT?!""
It is an absolutely incredible piece, I was immensely impressed.
The other thing I highly enjoyed was all the extras on the other two disks, the secrets behind the effects and the making of the film itself.  It was fascinating to see the inner workers of this movie, I loved every one of them!  I sat there for hours, just watching the entire thing, reveling in the mysteries of film-making, and marveling that someone could be that clever and faithful to their project.

I wish these movies will go on forever, but all WE have to decide is what to do with the experience that the producer and the cast left us with.

It is a rich and beautifully done rendition of Tolkien's work, more faithful to the book than The Two Towers. Jackson captures the ethos of Tolkien's vast subcreation, Middle-earth, with its rich array of people and places. From the warmth of the Shire and Hobbiton, to the idyllic beauty of Rivendell, to the terror of the Moria and Khazad-Dum, or the enchantment of Lothlorien, Jackson brings it all to life. The characterisations are excellent - who can imagine a better Saruman than Christopher Lee, a better Gandalf than Ian McKellan, or a better Bilbo than Ian Holmes? The extra footage in this film includes an extended gift-giving sequence in Lothlorien, and though the changes in details from the book seem unnecessary, one hardly cares or notices, it is so well done.

1314535,5,B00003CWT6,"Fellowship of the Ring is a great movie.  I know a lot of people were disappointed that there wasn't enough action or it didn't have much of an ending, but the thing people have to realise is that it's based off a book that was not intended to be a trilogy.  They also have to realise that it's the first movie in the series, and so of course there's going to be a lot of introduction as to who's who and what's going on.  People also have to realise that there's a lot of different story lines in the books, and you couldn't put all those different plots into a movie.  There's a lot of ways you could translate the books, and the movie is just one of those translations.  Jackson decided to go with the main plot, which was destroying the One Ring.  So there's things he cut out that don't pertain to that concept.
I think this movie has to be one of the greatest movies ever.  Steve Jackson is a great director.  He did a very good job of taking the books and bringing them to life on the silver screen
I know another complaint people had was how much that wasn't in the movie.  There were a lot of complaints about, say, Tom Bombadil not being in the movie.  Tom Bombadil was a great character in the book, but obviously if Jackson had put everything in the movie that was in the book, instead of watching a 3-hr. movie (4 if it's the extended version), you'd be watching at least a 6 or 7 hour movie (and that's just Fellowship!).
There's also some awesome acting in the movie.  I'm not one to go to a movie just because of the actors, but some of these actors I've seen in other movies, like Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom, and I have to admit that every movie I've seen them in, they've always done a great job.  There's also a couple actors that I haven't heard of before, but they also did a really good job of bringing the characters to life.
I definately recommend the extended version of Fellowship of the Ring to anyone that likes any kind of fantasy.  It is an hour longer than the version that was released in theaters, but it's worth it if you have the attention span for it.",1071014400,3,2090,4.221105527638191

1314537,5,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  It tells the story of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit from the Shire.  Frodo is given a ring by his uncle Bilbo.  This ring is the mythical One Ring that the Dark Lord covets (and once held).  He knows that the ring is in the Shire and that a Baggins has the ring.  The Wizard Gandalf sets Frodo on a path away from the Shire so that the Sauron (the Dark Lord) cannot regain the ring and overwhelm Middle Earth.  In the process, Frodo comes in the company of Elves, Dwarves, and Men in his quest to destroy the ring in the fires of Mordor.  This is the opening chapter of the epic tale.
This DVD is the Extended Edition.  What that means is that Peter Jackson (the director) took his theatrical version of the film and reinserted approximately 30 minutes of additional footage back into the movie.  Some scenes are snippets and extensions of existing scenes, but others are entirely new scenes.  This extended edition is, as Peter Jackson says, an alternate version of the film.  I feel that it is a much stronger, and richer version of Fellowship.  It feels more complete, and because of the additions, it is closer to the text of J.R.R. Tolkien.
Besides the extended edition of the film (which I feel is superior to the theatrical release), we are also given two bonus discs of special features.  These are various documentaries of nearly every possible aspect of the making of the movie.  One bonus disc is about how Peter Jackson (and crew) adapted the book and was able to make it into a movie.  The second bonus disc is how Peter Jackon's vision of the film was crafted into the finished product we saw on screen.  There are 6 or 7 hours of bonus material and watching all of the bonus footage, I was stunned by the amount of work that went into making this movie.  All the information that you could possibly want to know about the making of the movie, it's on the DVD.  These are no promotional pieces, but rather a detailed look at the filmmaking process.
If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, this is a must own DVD.  If you loved the theatrical version, you'll still want to check this one out, it is a subtly different movie and it has a richer feel to it.  As far as DVD sets go, this is one of the best.",1070928000,3,2290,4.30607476635514

Most of the changes made to the story in this movie are for the purposes of pacing, and the characterizations come through as solid echoes of the characters in the book. Aragorn could be less diffident, Arwen less manly, but on the whole the movie offers a great taste of Tolkien's vision. The scene on the bridge of Khazad-dm is probably the finest.

1314628,5,B00003CWT6,"Long had fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" novels waited for a film worth making.  The first in New Line Cinema's adaptions of Tolkien's novels, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is just that.  In fact, it is the best film since about 1994.
Elijah Wood plays Frogo Baggins, the young Hobbit who discovers that his Uncle Bilbo's (Ian Holm) magic ring is actually the source of a wild hunt which involves elves, orcs, and other creatures of Middle-Earth.  After being informed of the nature of this seemingly indestructable ring from wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen in one of his greatest roles), Frodo sets out for Rivendell while being chased by the hooded Ringwraiths.  When finally he narrowly escapes death and arrives at the city of wonder, it is decided that a group of people shall bring the earth to Mt. Doom and destroy it - led by young Frodo.  Thus the first live-action adaption of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" hits full-thrust.
Peter Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a beautiful masterpiece of fantasy adventure, filmed in gorgeous New Zealand to give it that ancient, mystical feeling.  Jackson's directing is terrific; he also scripted.
As a matter of fact, the script is the film's only problem, and a slight one at that.  Tolkien fans may find themselves disappointed, as about 1/5 of the novel has been deleted from the film; for those people, I recommend the Extended Version.  But true die-hard Tolkien/LOTR fans will find a gorgeous film.
Terrific special effects, terrific direction, terrific acting, terrific film.  Of course, there is also Howard Shore's finest achievement as a score and some beautiful contributions by new age favorite Enya.
The first installment of THE LORD OF THE RINGS is unmissable.  If you have not seen it, you have no idea what you're missing.  It is, possibly, the greatest film of all-time.  Leave it to one ""Ring"" to rule them all.",1070064000,,1954,4.834834834834835

The extended DVD(though still not a literal translation of the book) contains many of the moments and subtleties that I so wanted to see in the theater. Though still a compromise relative to the book the additional detail of the extended version adds much more to the story than the extra 20 minutes of footage implies (some additions in places amount to 1/2 to 15 seconds of footage within a scene, yet they contribute much greater depth to the story).
The commentaries provided are fun, fascinating and quite welcome to the acting/filmaking enthusiast. The production-side documentaries and reports are a huge treat--sets, props, costumes, makeup and the insight into everyones dedication show clearly the huge commitment made by the crew and their concern in staying true to the source material as much as possible whilst also translating practically the tale from written word to film faithfully.
There's nothing really wrong with the theater release, but for home viewing even on a small screen the extended version is simply better and more engaging.
I couldn't help but buy the standard version of The Two Towers--tired of waiting--but I have just ordered the extended version of it as based on my experience with FOTR Extd. I know TTT Extended will also be superior to the theater release (and with TTT it ought to be--the editing was a bit choppy).

The added amount of time doesn't seem terribly significant, but as it's spread out to include a 30 second bit here, and 15 seconds there, it adds up to changes to quite a bit of the movie.
The changes aren't dramatic -- if you didn't like the original version, I hardly think Merry and Pippin tucking into lembas bread the moment they sail from Lorien is going to change your mind -- but they do deepen an understanding of the characters and add a few scenes not included for the sake of not making the theatrical version any longer. In some cases, this makes the pacing not work as well, but it's never terribly problematic.
Beyond the additional footage, the DVD set adds more making-of specials and behind-the-scenes material than almost anyone could want.
Strongly recommended for those who simply cannot get enough of this version of ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""",1069113600,,988,4.75
1314710,5,B00003CWT6,"This is the best film of recent times, it's epic, it's moving and wonderful, but some Tolkien fans don't seem to like it... WHY? because of bloody Tom Bombodil. The exclusion of this totally superflous character who was added after the book was written, has them crying into their beer, again I ask why. In the original text, Tom was the nasty sticking point in the first book. The books pace from Hobbiton to Old man Willow is amazing, you are pulled along by the text. But when Tom appears, the pace vanishes and the book loses it's way. It's as if Tolkien stood up and let a 2 year old write the following chapters.
So Peter Jackson removed him, GOOD! The pace remains and we don't have to suffer the happy-clappy mentallity of Tom and his missus. So Arwen is used instead of Glorfindel..GOOD! She's obviously an important part of Aragorn's life (as evidenced in the indexes) and it makes sense for a character that will be a part of the story to help Frodo.
All kudos to Tolkien for the ideas and the work gone into the trilogy, but for a theatrical work, his book needed chopping. The pomposity of the text, the badly written fight scenes...(Boromir is disposed of off screen and dismissed with a single line)and some of the most stilted dialogue ever committed to paper needed these edits.
So all you Tolkien fans get a life and realise that your precious book can never be filmed scene by scene, without appearing disjointed and patchy.

1314780,4,B00003CWT6,"_The Fellowship of the Ring_ is a wonderful movie for all the reasons other reviewers have expounded upon.  However, I rate this version only four stars because the theatrical cut is superior.  Although every bit of added material is wonderful on its own, when you put it all together it makes the film too slow.  This is particularly noticable at the beginning, when it takes almost an hour of screen time before Frodo actually leaves on his journey.  While this slow pace works in the novel, in which the same events occupy 100 or so pages depending on which edition you read, I think it falls flat in the movie format.
On the other hand, the ""extras"" - commentary tracks, Easter eggs, documentaries, and other such things - are excellent.  But if what you're looking for is the movie, buy the theatrical cut first.",1069027200,2,817,4.645833333333333

1314782,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is an immediate classic, of a caliber and quality of filmmaking rarely seen when adapting literature to the big screen.  The Lord of the Rings novels, written by J.R.R. Tolkien, are immense in their scope, with multiple plots and an army's worth of principal characters.  It seemed that adapting these novels to film would be nearly impossible, if any justice to the original stories was to be served.  It has been done.
This Platinum Series Extended Edition of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a masterpiece of modern filmmaking.  This edition of the film, which runs approximately 4 hours in length, captures everything important about Tolkien's first installment in the Ring Series.  In this film, we are introduced to Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), nephew of Bilbo Baggins, and future ""heir"" to the ring of power.  By no choice of his own, Frodo is sent on a quest to take the Ring of Power to the Elf City, where it can be kept safe against the growing power of Mordor, who seeks to possess the ring.  Aided by the powerful wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan), a mysterious soldier known as Strider and a band of loyal Hobbits, Frodo begins his quest, which will ultimately lead him to the heart of Mordor, where he must attempt to destroy the ring.
Of course, this synopsis does the film absolutely no justice.  The film, which has the feel of a true epic, is full of rich characters, beautiful scenery, incredible special effects and enough plots and sub-plots to keep anyone entertained even when viewing the film multiple times.  The settings are incredibly beautiful, especially the Elvish City, set in a valley full of waterfalls and lust vegitation.
The story behind the filming of this film is also fascinating, and in this special edition DVD set, there are two Appendices disks included with hours of production material, including how the director attempted to faithfully recreate each character and situation from the books, using much state of the art special effects technology to transport the viewer to ""Middle Earth"" with a feeling that what they are viewing is completely real.
For parents considering this movie for their children, there are a few moments in the film which might be somewhat unsettling to younger viewers.  The orcs and goblins are frightening in their appearance.  There is little blood in this film, despite the many battle sequences.  Overall, the film is a powerfully positive experience for any viewer, young or old, and should be able to be enjoyed by the entire family.
This DVD set, which contains 4 disks in all, is truly a worthwhile collection to own.  For anyone who is an avid fan of the original novels, it should be noted that some material contained in Tolkien's Fellowship novel are missing, and others have been changed some to make the film more linear, but these changes in no way detract from the essence of Tolkien's story, and even the most dedicated Tolkien fan should enjoy this film immensely.",1067990400,2,2985,4.852362204724409

The folowing is to CAFFIENEOMAN or whatever his name id from ITALY you obviously didn't read the books because in the books it wasn't Legolas at all who saves Frodo it is in fact Glorfinel. although i know arwe does not save him either it would be to hard to put Glorfindels character into the movie because it wold just make it too confusing.",1067817600,,621,4.495575221238938

It may not all remain true to Tolkein's unique vision, well not on every level, but it scores on every level as a new fantasy film. I love the sequence with Galadriel and the woods of Lothlorien especially--and I see it as the truest fantasy moment in filmmaking history. Truly visionary directing here by Jackson, who is more of a naturalist then you'd come to see in a big time hollywood director. He truly worked hard to produce such a masterpiece which works on so many levels, and to see that the actors bring life to their parts--which could have been poorly handled by the wrong ones--i.e., MOST actors in hollywood!
My ONLY negative critism would be that the scenes are filmed very tightly. But when you look at the amount of story that is being made here you can easily overlook it. (The problem is corrected in ""Two Towers"".) The actors are not all polished up and everything--it has a natural grittiness to it. All in all I feel that this is a rare marvel and occult classic in the waiting. The best fantasy film sense Jim Henson's ""The Dark Crystal"", and if you don't LOVE this film, well, you must hate fantasy! A must see for all audiances!",1067817600,,1255,4.557522123893805

1314787,3,B00003CWT6,"While the visual effects were very good, the screenplay left something to be desired.  I enjoyed the movie greatly, however I regret having read the book before I saw the movie.  I do realize you could never cover the book in its entirety in a three hour movie.  However, the director took some sharp turns from the book, I suppose to make the movie watchable by people who haven't read the book.  There are several parts of the book that are left out, which in my opinion are pivotal to the overall theme of the story.  Also, there are situations added in that were never in the book.
The worst part is the way some of the characters were written.  Gandalf is written (in the movie) as a doddering old man with underlying power.  Gandalf in the book was never goofy like this.
If you plan on watching this movie, be sure to read the books AFTER you have seen it.  You will enjoy the movie much more.",1066867200,3,900,4.315476190476191
1314788,5,B00003CWT6,"This is a truly magnificent DVD collection. I would recommend it heart and soul to anyone who has even the slightest interst in the films or the books. The extended edition does a much better job of transferring the book to the screen than does the original theatrical release, adding in little nuggets such as the giving of Galadriel's gifts and the extended prologue which, when combined with the already well-made theatrical release, help to make the extended cut the only version of the film worth seeing.
In addition, the commentaries may justify the cost of the DVD's on their own. INteresting, humorous, and often very informative, the Directors commentary and the cast commentary are definetly worth the time it takes to rewatch the movie. The directors commentary will be especially intersting for those Tolkien purists upset with some of the movie's lackings, as it explains Jackson's rationale for many of the changes he made.
All in all, this collection is a must for any fan of the series, a wonderful extension of an already stunning work of visual art.",1066780800,,1067,4.933333333333334

If you ask me, if Peter(Jackson)were to go back in time and release this instead of the original, he probably would've made ""A Beautiful Mind"" look like the Lifetime Movie Of The Week (meaning Rings wins and Crowe loses). Plus on top of that, now I have this habitual expectancy that every disappointing movie I see from now on, seven months after its release onto dvd, will have its plots filled and its meanings emphasized. That may be a longshot hope from yours' truly, but if it's not, I can only hope that Adam Sandler and George Lucas are taking notes RIGHT NOW.",1066348800,2,779,4.379310344827586

1314867,5,B00003CWT6,"When someone announces they are going to make a beloved book into a movie I cringe, fearing another Interview with a Vampire fiasco!  I dislike most movies made from books, because our imagination is just so rich it is hard for a movie to match the level in our minds.  However, on occasion they do reach that quality and this movie does that.
I approached the movie as judging the movie as though I had never read the books.  That is the fairest way, though a bit hard not to draw comparison.  This movie, no matter how many times I view it never fails to draw me, compel me.
The actors are some of the best around, which speaks for the film off the bat.  The amazing Christopher Lee as Suraman the evil wizard, Ian McKellan as the kindly sage Gandalf the Grey,
Viggo Mortensen - the long underrated actor - is amazing as  Aragorn, Sean Bean - another underrated actor as Boromir, John Rhys-Davies so amazing as the dwarf Gimli, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel,
Liv Tyler so gorgeous as Arwen and Orlando Bloom as the elf Legolas Greenleaf ...I mean WOW what a superb cast and each does such wonderful jobs!
The movie touches so many emotions on so many levels...the near wistful perfection of the Shire, the fear evoked by the Orc and the Ring Wraths, the majestic scenery, the powerful darkness beginning to spread across middle earth...all work so vividly to create the true spirit of fellowship of the 9 setting on a quest to save middle earth from destruction.
It is so fast paced that you do not notice the length of the movie, yet it gives leisurely pace to the growing romance between Aragon and Arwen, the love of Elrond for his daughter, the hobbits devotion to each other, and especially between Frodo and Gandalf.
Well, I could go on and on about the perfection of this wonderful movie, but nothing I could say would touch the level of amazement you must experience.
I would caution younger viewers seeing the film without any form of guidances.  It is not a child's film, so please do not mistakenly assume it as such because of the fantasy element with dwarves, elves and hobbits.  It is often very dark and very scary and is quite violent in passages, so younger children not be able to grasp the complex tale and could be quite frightened by it.
For the imaginative adult, it is pure bliss.  I have seen Twin Towers and love it is well.  So am eagerly awaiting the holidays' release of the final episode.

1314868,5,B00003CWT6,"I'll make this short by assuming you have seen the theatrical release and are a fan.
Pros:
Bottom line is the extended edition (consisting of disk 1 & 2) is well worth the purchase alone. After seeing it, you get a lot more out of the movie (character development, storyline, etc.) These extended scenes were obviously cut out due to the movie running too long. They have done a good job adding them back in with the exception of only a couple of transitional glitches.
The VERY in-depth appendices (disk 3, & 4) provide you with everything from writing the screenplay to design and special effects by Weta.
Cons:
The packaging is done well, with a book style looking DVD case, holding all four discs. However, getting the discs out of the case is another story. If you have rented a fair amount of DVD's then you know what I'm talking about. You feel as though you're going to break the discs when trying to get them out; I guess not all cases are created equal.

1314869,5,B00003CWT6,"Let's start with the fact that the 'extended' version is a big improvement on what other DVDs try to do with 'deleted' / 'extended' scenes. Instead of having them as an 'extra feature' that is shown separately from the actual film, seeing these scenes in context (as a part of the whole movie) makes them (and the movie) richer, and their nuances much clearer. I can't even complain that the production company hadn't advertised in advance that the extended version would be out a few months after the theatrical one - because they had.
Except for the commentaries (which I'll get to in a moment), the extra features are just perfect, and should be an example and an insparation to other films. Instead of the usual behind the scenes ""blah blahs"" (or ""featuretes"") and theatrical trailers, we get a full account of how the movie was created - from the adaption of the book to a script to finding the actors, the work on the film itself (or rather - the films), and so on. This is done so thoroughly that no matter what interests you in the process of making this film, you will easily find it on this DVD set because of the well organized menus.
As for the commentaries, the casts' and Peter Jackson and co.'s were the most interesting. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the cast hadn't been given the chance to do it as a group (except for the hobbits, who commented together, and their group dynamics & discussions were fun and interesting). Viggo Mortensen's commentary about Aragorn was also sorely missed.",1065916800,2,1523,4.602941176470588

Anyways, I was able to make a grand total of 7 trips to the bathroom, and upon return, I found I missed nothing.

1314961,5,B00003CWT6,"Since the J.R.R. Tolkien authored books lodged itself as one of the most-read books of the century, The Lord of the Rings trilogy has long been considered unfilmable. There's a very good reason for this: the trilogy is practically a universe unto itself, with dense subplots, poems, languages and characters to scare even Cecil B. DeMille.
Fortunately, Peter Jackson took on the Herculean task and gave viewing audiences something that is very rare in American cinema: big action adventure movie in which ground-breaking special effects take a back seat to plot, character development and moral vision.
The film does not disappoint on any level.  Although some of Tolkien's more beloved characters are left out, Jackson still manages to strike the perfect balance between placating the fans and attracting neophytes.  Although I had never read the books before watching the film,  because of the films I have become a devoted LOTR fan.  For a film of its length and extent of plot, Fellowship of the Ring is still immensely watchable.

1314963,5,B00003CWT6,"Seeing ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" for the first time in a theater in 2001 was an awe inspiring experience for me, but seeing the special extended version on DVD with thirty extra minutes made the film come to life even more.  Director Peter Jackson, whose directorship of the film was superb, did an equally superior job in restoring those thirty extra minutes of film, which were completely seamless and exquisitely scored with extra music just for this version.  Equally deserving of praise are the fine actors whose performances breathed life into J.R.R. Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth, as well as the many people who worked behind the scenes in set decoration, cinematography, special effects and editing.
The story begins with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) coming to pay a visit to his long-time hobbit friend Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm).  Bilbo has lived a very long life for a hobbit thanks to a small item in his possession: a ring.  It's not just any ring though, it is the most powerful ring of power created hundreds of years earlier by the Dark Lord Sauron that Bilbo found in a cave when he traveled far outside of the Shire himself.  Unknown to most the being living in Middle Earth, Sauron has returned and wants his ring back; and the ring wants to be with Sauron.
Gandalf convinces Bilbo to give the ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood).  Frodo initially doesn't understand the power of the ring, but is soon forced to leave the Shire to prevent Sauron's dark agents from finding it and him.  Traveling with Frodo is his friend Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee (Sean Astin), who promises Gandalf that he will remain with Frodo until their mission is over.  Frodo and Sam are later joined by two more hobbits, Peregrin 'Pippin' Took (Billy Boyd) and Meriadoc 'Merry' Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan).  Frodo only wants to take the ring to a place where it will be safe so that he and his companions can return to the Shire, but fate places a much more difficult burden upon him.  To assist Frodo in his quest are Gandalf, his three hobbit friends, the humans Aragorn (a.k.a. Strider, Viggo Mortensen) & Boromir (Sean Bean), the elf Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) and the elf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies).  Other very memorable characters include Arwen (Liv Tyler), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Saruman (Chistopher Lee) and Elrond (Hugo Weaving).
Overall, I rate both the regular and special extended editions of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It is no wonder that the film was nominated for 13 Oscars and of those, it won 4 for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup and Best Original Music.

To further explain, if you are a collector of movies and a big ( but not true) tolkein fan, then maybe, just maybe, you should purchase this movie. Else-- Just rent it one time and be done with it.
Peter Jackson misses many of the main points of the written story. One of the main points of the Lord of the Rings (book) is that Aragorn accomplishes much of what he does to be worthy of the elven princess, Arwen.  In the book Arwen is praised as an evening star, untouchable my most mortals; yet Aragorn aspires to wed her, the most beautiful female on the planet.
The character of both the ent and Faramir are trashed by Peter Jackson works and the changes he made are poor choices in that the changes hurt the story and do not improve on the orginal text.

The additional material, especially ""concerning hobbits"" is a treat. However, the original release did include some ""making of"" programs which were nice, and are not on the extended DVD.
This extended release includes appendices about the story, design, characters, and locations. It also includes audio commentary by the cast, writers and directors, etc which was quite interesting to me.
As far as the movie, even with all the hype I still was amazed when I saw this in the theater. I was completely drawn into the movie, and it was very entertaining. I thought some of the special effects may have even been a touch over the top, but that's just my opinion.

1315016,4,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Peter Jackson, 2001)
Yes, I'm one of those people who's going to gripe about the exclusion of Tom Bombadil. Get over it.
Peter Jackson's epic attempt to bring Tolkein's classic Lord of the Rings novels to the big screen in live form (an animated version was done previously; it's decent, but nothing to stop the presses for) was the subject of Taylor Branch book-sized amounts of debate before it actually hit the screen. How long would it be? Would he manage to include everything? Who would play Elrond? All that sort of thing. Eventually, we learned it would be three installments released over three years of three hours apiece, with each movie corresponding to one of the books. Three hours per book? I knew I was in trouble already. I have long been of the opinion that a true capturing of The Lord of the Rings on film would take at least twice that long. And it's not as if the moviegoing public would have balked at six films; anyone who didn't realize the movies were going to make as much money as they have either has their head stuck in the sand or is in upper management at a film studio, not that one precludes the other.
I don't think I have to give a plot summary here. Everyone who's picked up a book has either read the Lord of the Rings, had The Lord of the Rings recommended to them and/or described to them by a fellow bibliophile, played enough Dungeons and Dragons to know what elves and dwarves look like (though Jackson's depiction of a cave troll, one of the movie's best pieces of CGI, is startlingly and wonderfully original), or some such. In other words, it's familiar ground. More of these thousand words can go to the good and bad points. The good points are many, the bad points are few, thankfully.
Because the bad points are few, we'll start with them. And yes, the main one is the exclusion of Tom Bombadil, which undercuts so much of the Christian imagery in the books (much of the rest of which was left in the movie; after all, you can't really get rid of your Christ figure and his descent through Hell and still have it be the Fellowship of the Ring). Aside from being one of the largest and most overarching pieces of symbolism in the novel, it also sets the stage for much of what comes after; without the Tom Bombadil episode, you also lose the first capture of Frodo and Sam by the dark forces. Whoops. (To his credit, Jackson massages the source material so that this point is covered.) The other main piece of groan inducement is the performance of Cate Blanchett. Had this been the first time I'd seen her, I would have opined that the woman can't act worth an orc's wart. Ms. Blanchett, however, proved her mettle in many previous films (you have seen The Gift, yes?), leading me to wonder what, exactly, Peter Jackson was thinking when he told her to act like Bette Davis on Quaaludes. Many people, both admirers and critics alike, have already chimed in on Elijah Wood's Clint Eastwood impression (there's a contract in their clauses that they're only allowed to use two facial expressions per movie), so I'll just mention it in passing.
The good things. The scenery is fantastic, but that's to be expected these days; they grow their cinematographers very, very hardy down under. Andrew Lesnie's pedigree is sterling; he was the director of photography on the weepingly good Dark City. Nuff said. He shows that he's just as comfortable with wide open spaces as he is with cramped cities here (which bodes well for his next project, the fourth Mad Max film). The whole supporting cast, with the already-noted exception of Blanchett, does a fantastic job. (It is, however, hard to reconcile the ageless elf Elrond with the old, bitchy drag queen in The Adventures of Priscilla, both played by Hugo Weaving. The worst part is, his hair looks better in this movie.) Viggo Mortensen does a sterling job in the role that will finally make him a household name (which he has long deserved); the two Ians, Holm and McKellen, are picture perfect, as is Christopher Lee. here are far too many well-known actors to go into them all here. Suffice to say they all do exceptionally well.
For a three-hour film, the pace is quite well executed. Jackson has already proven himself a master of pace by making The Frighteners far more than it would have been in the hands of a lesser director, so that was to be expected. There is no boredom to be found anywhere in this movie; if anything, it lacks suspense because there's way too much going on at any given moment. That, too, is to be expected when you're trying to cram a book like The Fellowship of the Ring into three hours, but the movie never goes the other way, either; it never feels like there's too much going on to keep track of.
Is it a good film? Absolutely, and well worth seeing. Does it belong at #6 on IMDB's Top 250? Well, no, but then nothing in their top 10 deserves its placing. No surprise there, either. *** ",1063238400,7,4969,4.533407572383074
1315017,5,B00003CWT6,"""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the first chapter in this amazing trilogy.  This is one of the best movies released in 2001.  The action scenes combined with the drama gives it a unique flavor.  The elaborate set-up proves that everybody worked hard during, before, and after filming.  It rightfully recieved 13 Oscar nominations, turning into four wins for Best Makeup, Best Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score.
Peter Jackson created this ensemble from the book version written by JTT Tolkin in 1954.  He led the cast and crew to express every detail.  It appears easy, but everyone spent about a year preparing.  He produced, directed, and wrote this movie brilliantly.  No other movie director could reach this quality point.  The creativity proves that he'll be a legendary director in a few years.
Every actor expressed their character wonderfully.  Ian McKellen rightfully received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Gandolf.  His wizard persona is flawless.  Elijah Wood's role as Frodo is his best in his career, proving that he'll go beyond child actor fame.  Viggo Mortenson, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, and others play unforgettable roles.
The audience will leave the movie amazed.  Some scenes will leave them mimicking various lines for weeks following.  Fans of this movie should watch this chapter before watching ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"", which is equally amazing.  Otherwise, one will be confused.",1062806400,,1523,5.180327868852459
1315018,5,B00003CWT6,"When I first viewed ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" in the theater, I was in awe at how awesome this film was. However, I only saw it twice in the theather within the first weekend it was out. So I didn't see it again until I bought the theatrical version on DVD the following August - about 8 months later.
I watched it tons of times on DVD when I bought it, and was extremely looking forward to this Extended Edition for three months straight.
When November 2002 finally rolled around, I picked up my copy of the Extended Edition. Upon my first viewing, I was a little let down. One must realize that since I thought of the theatrical release as a perfect movie, I found it hard to accept some of my favorite scenes changed around. Different takes or extended versions of already existing scenes, and new stuff added in to places I thought started off great(such as the intro to the Shire) - I found to be quite jarring.
I did, however, enjoy some of the new parts added in right from my first viewing of this edition - such as the gift givings, new background on Aragorn, Gollum floating with the log on the river, and others. So I wasn't entirely let down.
After a while, I got entirely used to the new version of the film, and love it much more than the theatrical version. Now, when I watch the original, I feel like I'm watching an ""Edited for Television"" version. It feels rushed.
This extended edition give you a better understanding of the story as a whole, fleshing out certain scenes to give them more depth and meaning. And certain scenes help other scenes in ""The Two Towers"" sequel make more sense - like Frodo swiping his elvish cloak over both himself and Sam to camoflauge into the ground at the Black Gate, the lembas bread, Gollum being burned by the rope around his neck, etc.
This is the version of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" that you want to buy. Don't settle for the ""edited for theater"" version. Settle for the version that we all were meant to see. There's 30 minutes of extra footage! Plus tons of great bonus material!
The only down side to this edition is that the film is split onto the first two discs. But that's such a tiny detail that's not worth griping over when you get so much more of the film! And it's all great stuff!",1062720000,3,2257,4.363420427553444
1315019,5,B00003CWT6,"Before you see the movie, you should read the books.  All 3 of them.  Quite a commitment.  Then, sit down and watch Tolkien's world come to life in a brilliant way.
It would have been VERY easy to ruin this unbelievable story in movie form, but the director instead actually brings the ENTIRE book to life.
It's the story of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit living in the peaceful Shire in Middle Earth.  He shares this world with Elves, Wizards, Goblins, and all other sort of characters.  He also shares it with Sauron, a being I can only describe as the devil.  Unknown to Frodo, he inherits a magical ring that makes you invisable.  This ring once belonged to Sauron, and if he gets it back, it's ALL over.  The world will be plunged into darkness and evil forever.  So, Frodo and company set out to destroy the ring.  The problem is, it can only be destroyed on Sauron's back door which is a long, long, LONG journey away, filled with perils.  Frodo sets out with many hardships to fullfil his quest, all the time having his mind poisoned by the evil of the ring.
Watching or reading Tolkien almost makes you believe this world did exist, in a history long forgotten and unrecorded.",1062720000,,1178,4.483568075117371

1315021,4,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson's ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is certainly an excellent swords and sorcery flick, with plenty of the combat that is the trademark of the genre.  If that is what you are looking for, you should feel free to buy any of the editions of this DVD.
Some Tolkein fans, however, felt that the theatrical release wasn't really true to the spirit of the Tolkein's book.  While the details were handled extremely well - lush and appropriate scenery for each part of the book, generally good casting of appropriate actors for each character - some of the subtleties of the book seemed lost.  Boromir, for example, comes across purely as a bad guy rather than the more complex character he is in Tolkein, and the portrayal of Arwen as a swordswoman rather than an elven lady seems to send an overly simplistic message that fighting is the only thing that is important.
The extended version in this special edition DVD does much to ameliorate these issues.  The restored scenes provide much needed characterization that was missing from the fight dominated theatrical release.  Boromir's good side is shown as well as his bad side; the relationship between Arwen and Aragorn is better handled; Galadriel is more than a two dimensional bit part.
Note that there doesn't seem to be a way to view the shorter theatrical cut from this set of DVDs, so if you're primarily interested in fight scenes and don't care too much about Tolkein, you might want to stick with one of the other editions.  But if you're a Tolkein fan, this special edition is probably the right edition to get.",1062547200,,1578,4.740875912408759

Like I already mentioned this is only for the fans of the books so if you didn't read the books you might get a little bored.

1315024,5,B00003CWT6,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" as it was released in theatres was an excellent film by itself, a near-perfect adaption of the first part of J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy epic.  Now, it's even better.  30 minutes of deleted scenes have been brought to the visual standard of the rest of the film and have been reincorporated into it, making the whole movie more faithful to the book.
  That's not all that makes this DVD set better from the original movie and the theatrical edition DVD.  There are also four audio commentaries to go along with the film (each the length of the film-- 3 and 1/2 hours) making up a total of 14 hours of audio commentary!
  Up next comes two disks worth of special features.  The first disk is titled:  From Book to Vision, and the second: From Vision to Reality.  The first includes 3 hours of documentaries which talk about J.R.R Tolkien himself, the adapting of the script, costumes etc.  The second contains 3 and 1/2 hours of documentaries talking about the filming of the movie and the adding of the special effects.
  Finally, on each disk there is an half-hour worth of storyboards and filming tests to go through, as well as art galleries on the third disk.  All in all, the disk gives you 25 hours worth of enjoyment!  Before you buy ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" theatrical DVD, get this one DVD to rule them all.  .  .",1061683200,,1385,4.476
1315025,5,B00003CWT6,"This is without a doubt one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of our time.  Peter Jackson has done an incredibly superb job of translating the first book (or in reality two books) of The Lord of the Rings 6-book ""trilogy"" to the screen.  Clearly there are parts of the book that could not, for reasons of time and continuity, be translated to the movie, but this does not take away from his accomplishments at all.
The extra scenes in this extended addition do so very much to add to the depth of the movie and actually can make some characters, primarily Galadriel, be seen in a much different light than the theatrical version.  There are also scenes that are only in the extended edition that help to make sense of certain scenes in ""The Two Towers"", not the least of which is the special rope that Sam has.  Why does it hurt Gollum?  Where did he get it?  Only the Extended Edition can answer those (and other) questions.
The extra music by Howard Shore is delightful.  (This marks the first time that extra music was scored for any kind of home video release.)  He truly knows how to stir emotion and feeling throughout the movie just from his unparalleled music.
Although the Aragonath bookends are nothing more than that, they are beautifully crafted and are an absolute necessity to and true Lord of the Rings fan.
Additionally, the extra special features are not the same as those on the theatrical release DVDs, which means that if you do not purchse the extended edition as well, you will miss out on a lot more of the behind-the-scenes featurettes if you just own the theatrical version.
The short of it is that this extended edition set is a must have for anyone who truly considers themselves to be a Tolkein fan.",1061424000,8,1732,4.58252427184466

I've seen the movie about 8 times, and the same for The Two Towers...it's the most amazing movie you'll ever see.  The casting is the best of any movie I've ever seen - what's even more amazing is that none of them had ever met, and some hadn't even read the books, and still they came up with this fabulous movie!  The scenery is amazing, the script leaves no gaps, never slows down, and is easy to follow even if you've never read the books.  Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Ian McKellen, and Christopher Lee are the most wonderful and talented actors and they combine to form a unique ensemble which will captivate you the entire way through.

The 4th disc is my personal favorite - it features ""A Day in the Life of a Hobbit"" which followed Elijah, Dominic, Billy, and Sean on their typical filming day, ""The Fellowship of the Cast"" which interviews the entire cast in turn, them telling their own little stories, and features behind the scenes footage, as well as ""Post Production Photos"" and ""Cameras in Middle Earth"" which takes you behind the camera during the filming of the Fellowship of the Ring.

A treasure wrapped up in a little box.
I so enjoyed this DVD better then the movie that my brother and I still talk about it!
Add this DVD to your collection you will not be disappointed.",1059868800,,214,4.0
1315168,5,B00003CWT6,Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than the original release....this was GREAT!!!! Much more accurate representation of the original Tolkien. I find myself lost in time while watching it. I truly wish they hadnt cut up the original theatrical release....the movie would have been soooo much better like this.,1059782400,,320,5.173076923076923

The story is extremely hard to follow, there's hardly any action and the whole movie just stinks.  I know you probably don't believe me, considering all the other 5-star reviews, but if you hate movies that you could've easily taken two hours out of because they had nothing to do with the story, don't see this!",1059609600,5,454,4.7215189873417724

1315258,5,B00003CWT6,"I am a devoted fan of the books ever since I was a kid. And I have one thing to say - spot on! The movie's wonderful, and the extended DVD production is probably the only thing that topped it.
The adaptation of the book to the movie was superbly done. You can see that the crew and cast took every aspect of this wonderful novel into the greatest of consideration, and really served us, the fans and viewers, as best they could, which was beyond my greatest expectations. The Fellowship of the Ring was very loyal to the book, while still serving as an admirable film on its own. Two thumbs up.
I've never seen any DVD special edition production done before. The amount of dedication and devotion that Peter Jackson's crew put into it is mind blowing. People who love the books and/or love film in general would have a true feast in all of the extra material provided.
First of, the film was extended, allowing people to get a deeper view on the story and the characters. I personally think that every added scene was an improvement, and helps us better understand and get into the world and people in it.
With this version, you get about 6 hours in additional material: a short documentary on Tolkien and the books, translating the book into script, visualizing the story, actually taking you step by step from designing the vast world which is Middle Earth and showing how the designs later turned into actual set pieces, prosthetics, makeup, wardrobe, miniatures, armor, weapons etc. You could sit for hours and watch it over and over again, while still discovering something new every time.
Great attention was given to the documentary of the actual production and shooting - how things went-on on the set. The cast and crew emanate such a feeling of devotion on one hand, and on the other hand you see how great an experience it was for them, even though many of them had to go through a rough time throughout (you'll see the number of hours the four hobbits had to spend in makeup, and you'll know what I mean). Finally, you get an extensive coverage on the post production phase - special effects, music, sound effects, editing etc.
In addition to all that, the DVDs include 4 different commentaries, featuring the writers, production team, design team and cast. I loved listening to them all, but most especially to the cast; apart from being enthusiastic - they are all so funny. It's just hours of sitting down, listening to anecdotes and antics pulled on the set. I like just putting it on and laughing with the guys. Wonderful.
So if you are both a film buff and like the movie itself, you are guaranteed hours of sheer pleasure. This particular DVD set is the most worn out in my collection.",1059523200,,2704,4.588842975206612
1315259,1,B00003CWT6,"Anyone who has actually read this literary masterpiece as a novel and not as a possible screenplay knows that Peter Jackson corrupted nearly every literary aspect Tolkien imbued into this wonderful story.  The motivations of nearly all of the major characters have been severely modifed to be contrary to Tolkien's explicit designs, and major scenes have been totally rewritten, again contrary to Tolkien's explicit intents, in order to introduce more ""Hollywoodesque"" scenes and plot devices, such as an active love story, which is completely absent among the main characters as a plot device.  Contrary to the main editorial reviewer, this is not a compression, it is an alteration, and a severe one at that.  We see precious minutes spent on dalliances which add nothing to the underlying story, such as Merry and Pippin trying to steal fireworks.  Which leads us to the complete farcification of those two characters, into slapstick comedy of the worst ""B"" movie variety.
All main characters are perverted into weak-willed people who are constantly searching for reasons to succeed.  We see Aragorn, the strong archetypal main character turned into a weakling fleeing from his responsibilities, to be called back and reminded of them by others.  Frodo, the main character, has been turned from the simple yet amazingly indominable typical Hobbit into yet another weak character who needs support at every opportunity.  Key scenes demonstrating his ability to withstand the compulsion of corruption beyond what even the Wise would dream possible are removed, to make way for the development of a non-existent love storyline between Arwen and Aragorn.  If you've read the novels, you know that Arwen is completely non-relevant in the action of the story.  Frodo's stand at the Fjord of Brunen, completely cut by Jackson from the story, is one of the most important scenes in the entire first novel, indeed in the entire series.  Frodo demonstrates his willpower in resisting the power of the ring, even while wounded severely and facing all nine wraiths at once.  This sets a very important theme which is called on repeatedly.  Instead in Jackson's (per)version, we see a helpless Frodo being carried along, unconscious and completely incapable of taking the slightest action.  We then hear later, in another completely unnecessary and non-existent dialog which takes time from Tolkien's brilliance, that Frodo is amazingly strong to live so long.  Wow, great writing and direction Peter.  How do you do it.
If you want to see a truly faithful redition, which does not compromise Tolkien's literary creation in the literary aspects, which are what is important, not an action plotline filled in with drama here and there in Hollywood style, then rent the animated versions.  In literally every respect they faithfully transfer Tolkien's brilliant writing and character creation to the screen.",1059350400,24,2895,5.247288503253796
1315260,5,B00003CWT6,"I eagerly awaited this movie, and wasn't disappointed; there is nothing negative I can say about this movie. It was absolutely breathtaking. At the end, I just sat in the theatre, stunned. When the dvd was released, I heard that an even better version would be released in a few months and that is what I waited for. It was worth the wait. I enjoyed seeing the additional footage, and seeing all the extra ""goodies"". This edition might be a little more expensive, but was well worth it.",1059264000,,486,4.534090909090909
1315261,5,B00003CWT6,"This speacial extended addition to the fellowship of the ring really is worth the hype, it fills in on what was missing from the thetrical release on areas of the book which deserved there place in Peter Jacksons Lord of the rings epic, when i first heard that they where releasing lord of the rings on DVD i thought that it would genrally be an impossible task and would produce a poor movie that didn't do justice to Tolkiens books however this version really does do justice to the book and only changes slight areas subtly such as Arwens roll is more played upon, whilst this may irratate some fans of the book at first it really does adapt with the story and fits in alot better than it would if it remaind strictly true to the book. This speacial extended addition includes so many extras on one of the most pre-eminent films of all time that it makes you wonder how they keep it so well organized and fit in all the information that it gives you. With this addition you got four discs one and two are the extended version of the movie and three and four are all the extras such as how the idea came about, how they chose the characters and the settings and genrally all the details about the movie right from the hobbit feet. The artwork that you get with this DVD is very well crafted and you get all the original illustrations and storyboards from the film and the discs and cd trays contain some amazing artwork. The balrog is the most interesting character adapted from the original storyboard to the final epic which you see in the cinema and on th DVD. Fortunatley this DVD is not overly pretentious aswell as it does not push the boundries as to what you would like the final output of the film to be like. On this extra DVD you will find the appendices which you will probably recollect from Tolkiens books these contain the two discs from vision to reality and from book to vision these contain hours of extra featurettes and information. It's amazing how much work actually went into these films and how strenuous and great it must have been to work on the lord of the rings but it has paid off to become one of the greatest films ever to have been released. I would recommened this film to anybody especially those who can actually tolerate long films and not get wrestless as it's a rewarding film to get into, So if you feel like getting an ambient, deep film with it's own world, stuctures etc and amazing story line then this is one of the quintessential films along with the two towers and the yet to be released Return of the King. The speacial features do the film justice and the film does the book justice.",1059264000,,2633,4.397540983606557
1315262,3,B00003CWT6,"Nearly everything in the film is perfect, Gandalf - Brilliant, Aragorn - Perfect. Computer effects, everything top-notch.
The Hobbits are a disaster. Elijah Wood - you are no Frodo (Ralph Baskhi had him down to a tee)
Sam isn't too bad. But Merry and Pippin! these two singlehandedly destroyed this film for me! I CAN""T STAND THEM!!!! especially the one with the scottish accent.
They simply aren't funny - And why did Peter Jackson think the film needed some light relief? If you're going to do it that way - do it properly, like you did with vast majority of this film.
Bilbo is fine, but even the other Hobbits in the Shire...... ARGHHH is it just that Jackson has a stupid sense of humour - everything is dumbed down in the Shire - that guy trying to flick away the ear-wax, and the fella being scolded by the wife for laughing at Gandalf's litlle firework display for the young Hobbits - and lines about carrots with a sexual innuendo.......WHY?????",1059004800,,954,4.617647058823529
1315263,5,B00003CWT6,"Just wanted to add my praise to the mix, as this is the definitve version of an already rich movie. The new and extended scenes add more depth to the characters and plot, and to the overall feel of Tolkien and Jackson's world. The DVD package also nicely labels which scenes have been added, which is very convenient. The extras on the last 2 DVD's will take you a whole weekend to watch, but it can be enjoyable to learn more about filmmaking in general. You really get to see how much talent and effort was tapped in making this movie. My favortite extras were the artist's galleries with commenteries by Alan Lee, and ""The Road Goes Ever On..."" where you see video Elijah Wood filmed at the movie's premiere. One of the best DVD's ever - and don't forget the 2 easter eggs! (A long trailer for LOTR:TTT, and a cute MTV Movie Award spoof of the Council of Elrond with Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar!)",1059004800,,908,4.410714285714286
1315264,5,B00003CWT6,"Ok, extended edition. A few extra scenes and a few that are longer. No big deal? Hang on there, Steely Dan! The new scenes are more than just extra tidbits. They are fully integrated parts of the movie with soundtrack and good plot points. Take the very beginning where you get a longer history of the ring and an all-new introduction to the hobbits in greater detail. Nice. There are far more worthy additions, but I will leave you to discover them for yourselves. Oh, and just for the thrill of it, the battle scenes are longer.
After watching this expanded edition, watching the ""regular edition"" will be like watching a familiar movie on TV: you know that some scenes have been cut to fit the timeslot.
Now, beyond the enhancements, there is the film itself. Masterpiece. Why? Well, this film does what so many others cannot: It tells a great story. But, more than that, it manage to do this, to captivate its audience for its incredible 3 and a half hour length, without (gasp!) any cursing or sex scenes! A monumental accomplishment in the modern movie age to say the least. Now, there is quite a deal of violence, but that is to be expected from a good vs. evil fantasy genre.
Finally, one must note that this work indeed does not follow the book (that the film is derived from) by JR R. Tolkien verbatim. In fact, there are notable differences. But, the movie is a well-crafted story that reflects and honors the spirit of ""Lord of The Rings"" from which it is derived. Most people, I feel, would enjoy this film regardless of any commitment they may have to the original work. Those who have not read the original book will have no trouble at all enjoying the film.
Acting is first-rate by all cast members. Ian McKellen is Gandalf.
Various other features and commentaries are included. (A total of 2 DVDs, 2 of them movie, 2 of them ""extra features"".) The Collector's Edition contains statuette bookends and an extra DVD (a National Geographic special on Dr. Tolkien).",1058918400,,1977,4.619318181818182
1315265,5,B00003CWT6,"This is THE best film I have ever seen. it has made me eager for the sequel, the Two Towers. This cast is awesome, the scenery is beautiful and rugged, and the special effects have no equal. But beyond that, this movie makes you feel every emotion, from joy in the Shire, to terror as the Fellowship is chased by Ring Wraiths and Orcs, to complete and total sadness at the raw pain of the characters. Elijah Wood is awesome as Frodo and Sir Ian Mcklellan rocks as Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen really is a great Aragorn and Sean Bean does an excellent job of portraying the very torn Boromir. Liv Tyler was great as Arwyn even though we don't get to see much of her and Cate Blanchett's portrayel of Galadriel sends chills up the spine. In short, from start to finish, this movie is truly one of the best films ever made.",1058745600,,816,4.339869281045751

The film stays true to the books in spirit and in flavor.  I can not say enough good about this movie...but READ THE BOOKS too if you haven't.  They are wonderous.",1058572800,,492,4.094736842105263

I myself had doubts about this superb cast and how they could all act togeather, but after I watched it for the first time, I was COMPLETLY hooked.  Superb acting by every person in this film.  Unbeleavable story that has been brought to the film thanks to director Peter Jackson, who has brought the greatest book of all time and actuly made it the best book and film of all time.  This movie had EVERYTHING. Acting, fights, story, love story, and villins.  This movie has (in my opinion) surpassed the New Star Wars movies and will become the greatest trilogy of our generation.

1315349,5,B00003CWT6,"As a fantasy reader, I've read The Lord of the Rings trilogy twice, and it is by far the best fantasy I have ever read. When I discovered they were making a movie out of it, a true-to-life live-action movie... I was excited, but also a bit wary. See, I didn't know of any of Peter Jackson's earlier work, and so I had no idea what to expect (I did learn that he directed The Frighteners and Dead/Alive later on, both of which I'm a fan of, but to any who know those films...this is a whole different animal we're talking about in this film). I was pleasantly blown straight out of my seat upon seeing it in theatres. I didn't have a single gripe about it, because, in essence, it was perfect. Or so I thought. Then, on Christmas day, I laid my eyes upon...the Extended Addition! *cue hallelujahs right now* And I was surprised that, by God, the movie got better! Now, one movie over two DVD's seems quite a bit, but the whole trip is well worth it. The added scenes are integrated perfectly and the extra time diminishes the film in no way. Though, I would have loved to see anything involving Tom Bombadil, who is in my opinion one of the coolest characters ever...why, I don't know, but he's not necessary to this film. The battles are amazing, the acting is mind-blowingly good, and the sets, effects, costumes, go above and beyond any expectations. The attention to detail is mind-boggling and lovingly done. So, I recommend this not to just fans of the books, but to anyone who loves a damn good movie. Come on, I know you guys are out there! And if you don't think you can stand going through 3+ hours, just give it a try, you'll still love it. And if you don't, I will hunt you down and bash you like an enraged Uruk-Hai!",1058227200,,1728,4.33641975308642
1315350,5,B00003CWT6,"Hmm, This is a hard one. You see, this movie is awesome. This set, well is a little more difficult to describe. It has the movie with about 30 minutes worth of extra footage, however, it has little else that appeals to all viewers. Beyond the movie, which spans across two discs, and two added bonuses including the MTV movie awards gag on the Council of Elrond, all thats left is about 8 hours worth of commentary and behind the scenes work. Now, I had never watched the type of supplementary material. This was a first, but definitely not the last. I awtched all 8 hours with the greatest interest. now not all could be able to do this. However, it is definitely worth a look. So, I say to you, that if you don't like supplementary material, don't buy this. If you do, or never have tried it, pick this up. It will be a treat.",1058227200,,828,4.280254777070064
1315351,5,B00003CWT6,"When FOTR was released, no one thought it would be as good as it is, including myself. But the surprise that greeted me and I suspect, many others, was a fantastical and magical delight that will reverberate for ages.
Star Wars and Spielberg got movie goers veered from the 60s epics like Lawrence of Arabia into entertainment blockbusters that has seen been the cornerstone of Hollywood commercialism for years. While Star Wars and the Indy films deserve their place in moviedom, I will never place them in the same league as literally and intellectually more challenged films like Lawerence.
Hence, the adaptation of LOTR must seem daunting, not least, almost impossible to surmount. Yet, Peter Jackson has created nothing short of a masterpiece. This is, bar none, the best adaptation cinema has ever achieved. Why? Simply, from the first frame until the last, every moment is pure cinema magic.
Great casting, superb performances and a well delivered script is just the beginning. The technical merits are almost singularly supreme. The Howard Shore score, the Andrew Lesnie cinematography and the wonderful production design by Grant Major ... one word. Brilliant!
But it is not just the various elements of this film that is excellent, but the sum of it all, seamlessly integrated by Jackson, carefully crafted and a labour of love by all involved that makes this film transcends all fantasy movies that comes before. And perhaps, after.
Not just this, the DVDs supplied by New Line is another remarkable accomplishment. The simpler 2-set version is far more luxurious than most other titles' 'deluxe' editions. And then, there is the Special Extended Edition (SEE).
Everything a DVD lover could ask for, the SEE delivers, and more. Best video transfer ever, and the best soundtracks in both DTS ES and Dolby EX are supplied over 2 discs just for the film, with 4 commentaries. That's both quality and quantity, in ample supply.
Then, there is the Appendices, the most comprehensive making of supplements we will ever see for one film, until films 2 and 3 that is. If you thought T2:Ultimate Edition was film school on a disc, then this surely must be the Princeton or Oxford for DVD supplements and special editions.
So much to gather from, from the background to the filming to post-production, there is so much to go through, yet not a single moment is boring. The DVD set has just taken the best and most innovative elements of DVD evolution over the last few years and fused them into one set, dedicated to one film, and a masterpiece of a film.
Forget the Pearl Harbor 4-disc set, this is the one to go for, and will set the bar so high, it will be difficult for others to follow. Long after you have gone through the entire 4 discs, you will come back, again and again ... just to relive the film and the making of it.
This is film making at its best, and DVD at its pinnacle.

1315354,5,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring, New Zealander Peter Jackson's first installment of a trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, is an entertaining and awe-inspiring movie.  With a multi-national cast, majestic landscapes, jaw-dropping special effects, and a riveting story, Jackson's visual journey to Middle-Earth is one of those rare fantasy films that lives up to the term ""instant classic.""
Jackson, who not only co-authored the screenplay with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens and was one of the line producers, directed Fellowship and its two sequels (The Two Towers and The Return of the King) in a single shoot (with scheduled re-shoots when necessary) so that there would only be 1-year intervals between each movie's release.  The intervening time could then be devoted to post-production and special effects work.  While this seems risky -- and moviemaking is a business where risk is involved -- the gamble taken by Miramax and New Line Cinema certainly paid off well.
The Fellowship of the Ring begins with a prologue that explains how Sauron, the Dark Lord, conceived Rings of Power to ensnare the various races of Middle Earth under his rule.  To control these Rings of Power, he forged in secret a Master Ring, the One Ring that could find them all ""and in the darkness bind them.""  But Sauron loses the Ring when he is defeated in battle against a final Alliance of Men and Elves, and for centuries the One Ring is lost and forgotten.
The prologue continues with an abridged version of an episode from Tolkien's The Hobbit, when Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) finds it -- providentially -- in Gollum's (Andy Serkis) cave.  Then, with a pastoral theme by composer Howard Shore and a corresponding change of scenery, we are introduced to the protagonist of the story, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood).
Like Luke Skywalker in Star Wars: A New Hope, Frodo doesn't realize that he is going to be tossed into a large conflict between light and darkness.  Yet, when the great wizard Gandalf (magnificently played by Sir Ian McKellen) enlists him on a quest to keep the One Ring from returning to its dark master, Frodo accepts the responsibility and goes off on his own adventure.
The standard 2-disc set released last summer presents this movie in its entirety on disc 1 -- with no extra features whatsoever --no director/cast commentary or foreign language audio track/subtitles.  There are two versions presently available of this ""regular"" edition, Widescreen and full-screen (pan-and-scan).  The sound is good on my regular Samsung TV, and the image is sharp and clear...even though I suspect the movie would look far better on a bigger television set.
 The extra features on Disc Two are all right but not earthshaking, either. There are short featurettes and trailers, Enya's May It Be music video, plus promotional materials for the Extended Version DVD and Electronic Arts' video game ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.""",1057968000,,2941,4.995910020449898

Moreover, the feature itself is just breathtaking.  I am a devoted fan of Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings.  Never in my wildest dreams did I expect the movie version of LotR to be so grand, so epic, so human, and so well done.  The casting is superb.  Ian McKellan makes for a grand, noble, and wise Gandalf.  The New Zealand backdrop is just majestic and the DVD does it justice.  If you love fantasy, you must own this.

1315394,5,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings- The Fellowship of the Ring was an almost exact replication of the book and was stunning! I tried reading the book, but was not succesful because it was taking a long time to read. After I watched the movie for the first time, I have to admit, I was not impressed. In fact, I despised this movie! It was partly because I had never read the book before. I decided to try and read it and watch the movie again, because I thought I would appreciate the movie more if I understood what was happening; I was right! After I read the book, the movie made complete sense and now I love it!
In Lord of the Rings- The Fellowship of the Ring, Bilbo Baggins has a ring that he adores and everyone around him notices that he is acting strangely. In fact, it is ruling his life. Finally, at his eleventy-first birthday, he disappears into thin air and appears at his home again. A brilliant wizard Gandalf, whom he has known for many years, is onto his secret and goes to his home after he disappears. Bilbo was going onto a long journey where he could finish his book and live forever as a faithful servent to the ring.
Gandalf makes Bilbo leave the ring behind, to his dismay, because he knows that the ring can rule the whole world and can control the ringbearer's minds. Gandalf trusts the destroyal of the ring to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins and assembles a fellowship to take him to the fires of Moria, where the ring was to be destroyed. The Fellowship of the Ring was to take the ring to the fires to be destroyed. This movie starts there journey where the fellowship encounters many life threatening, and at times, deadly challenges. A few die, but the fellowship continues.
The story of this book was already very good, but once put into movie form, the book came alive for me. Since I am a very visuale person, it was like I was risking my life to destroy the one ring. It was magical! I love the Lord of the Rings and can't wait to see the second and third movies. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone who is willing to pay attention to complicated details, but is also willing to see an absolutely magical movie.",1057795200,,2135,4.34
1315395,5,B00003CWT6,"I went into the Lord of the Rings not expecting much.  I had only recently finished reading Tolkien's famed trilogy and my previous experiences with adaptations of literary works told me not to get my hopes up.  However, this film must be respected even by those who have never heard of a hobbit.
The film is remarkable in many aspects.  Every frame is a work of art, whether showcasing the gorgeous New Zealand country side or using creative camera work to capture a particular mood, it is obvious that this is no slapped together bang for a buck blockbuster.  The lines are given more in the manner of poets giving a reading rather than actors trying to earn some dough.  The entire atmosphere of the movie is one of beauty and care.  Even rarer is that the characters in the movie often show  more personality in the books especially Aragorn.  In the novels, Aragorn aka Strider aka any other name you can think of, often comes off as a cold, impersonal dues ex machina but in the film he seems to have normal human emotions.  The casting is good, the score well deserving of its Oscar, and the plotting well done.  Overall, I heartily recommend this to fans of Middle Earth and abstainers alike, it is well worth the three hours.",1057795200,,1233,4.538461538461538
1315396,5,B00003CWT6,"More than fifty years ago, there was one question(s) that made the common LOTR fan (Tolkienus fascinationus) go crazy: ""When will they make a movie of 'The Lord of the Rings?' If they do, just how true to the book will they be?""  There were many failed attempts to transfer this masterpiece to the silver screen (Stanley Kubrick, The Beatles [who would have thought?], and even though Ralph Bakshi made it, it was still bad enough to be put under the category of ""WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!"")  But one day, a young horror (really!) director named Peter Jackson decided that, since nobody is doing ""The Lord of the Rings"", why not take a stab at it?  Thus, one of the greatest movies of all time was made....
  In the land of Middle Earth, there was a dark lord named Sauron (and for those of you who do not feel like reading ""The Silmarillion"", Sauron was once assistant to the original dark lord Melkor [even more evil than Sauron]).  He created three rings for the elves, seven for the dwarves, and nine to the kings of men.  Sauron made his own Ring and poured his own malice and hatred in to that Ring.  To make a long story short, elves and men got ticked off and fought the armies of Mordor.  Sauron got ""killed"", and the Ring got lost.  And 3,000 years later, a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) found it and hid it.  60 years later, Sauron's spirit gets upset and wants the Ring back.  Bilbo disappears to Rivendell (an elven city) and Bilbo's cousin, Frodo (Elijah Wood) is assigned to go to and destroy the Ring by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) with a fellowship of nine companions: the hobbits Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd); the humans Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies); the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Gandalf.  Together, they go through many trials, tribulations, and challenges together on their way to Mordor to destroy The One Ring.
  First of all, this movie couldn't have been done better.  And second of all, for those of you who think tht it could have been done better, I would just LOVE to see you go and make your own version and see if it makes over $300 million at the Box Office.  I'm sure that the general movie-going audience will probably say that they liked Peter Jackson's version better.  So just enjoy it as a movie, not a book.
  Sorry.  I had to get that out of the way.  Anyway, the movie is absolute perfection itself (my opinion; others have their own opinions).  The acting was top-notch, the plot was superb and original, and the special effects were....well, I can't think of a word to describe them yet....give me a second and I'll get back to you on that.  To make a long story short, it beat ""Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones in just about everything.  In this movie, we aren't fed with junk that has been used over and over and over again (visually ""stunning"", but overall just apalling). We aren't fed stupid and corny dialogue (""I truly, deeply love you,"" drones Padme` to Anaking before they are awaiting to be slaughtered in a ""Glatiator""-like fashion).  Instead, we are given something that will be remebered for decades to come.  It is only the beginning....

1315397,5,B00003CWT6,"This is certainly a film worth seeing! Obviously, cuts had to me made, considering the size of the book it was based on, but the movie remains faithful to the book for the most part, and completely retains the spirit. The directing is excellent, and the special effects make the movie believable--whereas an older film would have sadly failed to give a convincing image of this fantasy world.
  Elijah Wood is good in the title role, and does well at portraying an innocent Frodo getting thrown into a life of adventure, but Ian McKellan completely takes the cake as Gandalf the wizard. Viggo Mortensen makes for a quiet but combative Aragorn--his fight scenes with the Nazgul on Weathertop and the Uruk-Hai at Amon Hen are stunning. Sean Astin plays Samwise Gamgee to a tee, showing his simplicity, his kindess, and his bravery. Sean Bean, as Boromir, has the role of the character who is the most susceptible to the terrible pull of the One Ring, and he plays this with great skill. Orlando Bloom as Legolas portrays this athletic elf who never runs out of arrows excellently. John Rhys-Davies plays the role of Gimli, a grumpy and hard-fighting dwarf. I could go on, but let me just say that almost all the cast is good.
  Peter Jackson, the director of the film, ensures that he has us loving the Shire, fearing the Nazgul, championing Gandalf, applauding Legolas, gasping at Barad-Dur, and spitting all over the hideous orcs.
  All in all, quite a film.",1057363200,,1458,4.743083003952569

If you should ever completely finish viewing all of the discs, you will probably know enough about Lord of the Rings and epic filmmaking to make your own movie about any of Tolkien's other classic books. But there are better reasons to shell out thirty bucks than that.  First, there is thirty minutes of extra footage (like this wasn't long enough already topping out at three hours).  Most of the deleted scenes were scenes that, in one way or another, were important to the books but were deemed unworthy of the theatre audiences.  Throw in the fact that there are four different commentaries to listen to and that means you're going to be watching LOTR until you think you're in Middle Earth.  Good reason number two: there are more commentaries than you can shake a stick at.  The first DVD (the ""regular"" two disc set) was so big you needed a map to guide you.  This one should come with its own atlas.  Each disc contains a labyrinth of information so vast that six months after buying it, I'm still wading through everything it has to offer.  And, of course, you'll get the trailer for The Two Towers, which was released in theaters a month after the set hit store shelves.  This set has probably made someone, somewhere a very wealthy person, and with good reason.

The 'Fellowship of the Cast' documentary is one such standout glimpse at behind the scenes footage and interviews...after all, with such a varied and talented cast list its hard to go wrong!
Likewise the commentaries with Peter Jackson, and the cast are fun, detailed and a great way to see how this film functions as part of the trilogy.  Budding techies will rejoice with an entire seperate commentary hosted by the design and production team.
The film itself is presented in glorious widescreen, with crystal clear sound and picture quality...you'll be wanting to draw the blinds and crank up the volume for this one.  Yup, this was terrific in the cinema, but I defy you not to tremble in your armchair when you hear that first 'boooom' from the well in Balin's Tomb!
Throw in a dozen extra scenes, enough extra features to fill two discs and a handsome collectors case and you've got a DVD to be the flagship of your collection.

Truth be told, I've only watched the movie and looked at what the additional features are available (I have a new baby at home, so little time for DVDs). But just the additional and expanded scenes in the movie are worth it. They add depth to the characters and story which were lost on the cutting room floor in the theater edition.
After seeing this movie in the theater a year and a half ago, I read the entire series -- the movie had motivated me to finish what I never did as a teenager. I was so engrossed with the books that I hardly put them down until I finished. Now that I've seen the expanded version of the movie, I have to say that it does much more credit to the first book than the earlier version. To anyone who hasn't read the books, though -- don't just watch the movies -- the books are really worth the time and effort. In fact, I think you will enjoy the movies more if you read the books. This was true of the Twin Towers for me. I think I would have found that movie a little low on plot if I hadn't been so engrossed in the big picture and characters which I understood so much better from the novels.

It gives you a remarkable feeling of the wonder of Tolkien's world, characterization, and history, all within the space of practically three hours.  The images that the film creates are beautiful, and it's amazing to see the depths of Moria and the graceful boughs of Lothlorien depicted in color on the screen.  I would totally recommend this film to anyone; it appeals to all ages and all walks of life.  The extended DVD version of the film is also beneficial to Tolkien fans, as well as diligent viewers, because it explains some things that are boggling to those who watched the theatrical version in the theatre (including the size ratios and the gifts given to the Fellowship in Lothlorien, which is not explained even in film 2 when the cloaks are used).

1315496,5,B00003CWT6,"`The Fellowship of the Ring' is the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, based on the fantasy series by J.R.R. Tolkien; while the books may not appeal to everyone, especially the very young, the movies certainly do!
The story follows Frodo, a hobbit of the Shire, played by Elijah Wood, and his trusted companion/gardener, Sam (Sean Astin); his friend and adviser, Gandalf the Grey (played by Sir Ian McKellen) discovers that Frodo has inherited a ring of power - the One Ring of the Dark Lord, Sauron - and that it must be destroyed; Frodo, Sam and, eventually, two friends - Merry and Pippin - are sent by Gandalf to Bree, where he will meet them, after consulting the head of his order; along the way, they must escape the terrifying Nazgul - Ring Wraiths. At Bree, there is no Gandalf, but they meet a mysterious Ranger, who they later discover is Aragorn, the last heir to the throne of Gondor (played by Viggo Mortensen), and engaged to the Elvish Arwen Evenstar (Liv Tyler), who protects them, and leads them to Rivendell; from here, a fellowship is formed, and new characters are introduced, including the dwarf, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), the son of the steward of Gondor, Boromir (Sean Bean), etc. The fellowship then sets off, encountering much difficulty along the way, to destroy the ring...
All aspects of this movie - from the captivating story (action packed adventure, [after the first fifteen minutes to half hour, which is equally enjoyable]), the exquisite settings (from the peaceful, happy shire, the ethereal Rivendell, the dark, Orc-infested Moria, to the long abandoned weathertop - Amon Sl), the encapsulating special effects and CGI, to the superb acting (Viggo Mortenson, Liv Tyler, Sean Bean, Sir Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, Christopher Lee, etc.) - make for an enjoyable excursion to the limitless realm of imagination; an excursion that you'll want to repeat multiple times!",1056153600,,1917,4.975077881619938
1315497,5,B00003CWT6,"The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't too crazy about it, and didn't see why it was so popular.  The second time I saw it, my view on this movie changed.
Perhaps knowing that the movie won't have an ending after you sit there for  2 and a half hours had something to do with my change of heart, or maybe it was because I watched it over 2 days instead of sitting through the whole thing at once.  But now, since I enjoyed this movie a bit more this time, let's get to my review of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.
<u>LOTR- The Fellowship of the Ring</u> was based on the first book in the Lord of the Rings book triligy.  The movies story, without giving too much away, is about a Hobbit named Froto Baggins who inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo.  Froto's friend and advisor, Gandof the Wizard, informed him that the ring is evil, and if found by the wrong people, all of Middle-Earth will be destroyed.  Frodo then leaves so the ring wouldn't be found, and ends up at Elron, where The Fellowship of the Ring was formed to serve as the protectors of the ring before it is destroyed in the fires in Mt. Doom.  Since this is only part one of a triligy, the story ends abruptly, and if you're not expecting it, can be very disappointing.
This movie had great camera work, besides from a good story.  Some of the camera shots in this movie were <i>very</i> impressive, and it all worked well for the movie's advantage.  Then there were the special effects.  ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) had a big part in this movie.  There were the Hobbits, who were made to look like they were half the size as everyone else, and then the orcs, and Golum, and all of the other creatures involved in the story.  The scenery was hugely ILM influenced too.  While many shots were just straight impressive shots, others were impressive by the digitally added effects.  I don't disagree with the academy awards that this movie won.  It deserved it.
Overall, Lord of the Rings:  Fellowship of the Ring was a very well done, feel good movie with plenty of action, great special effects, with the moral that good always defeats evil (except in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King).",1056067200,,2177,4.378109452736318

About the DVD release:  true, it is amazing.  And true, the expanded edition of the film is better.  but there are tons of extras, which is generally a good thing, but I doubt the vast majority of those who buy this set will ever watch all of the extras.  So if you are concerned about the monetary expense, it might be better not to splurge and instead by the cheaper version, which is also pretty good.  Personally, I own both releases, even as there is no doubt the more expensive one is superior.

I was really glad that I waited the extra few months to buy this, instead of getting the two disc edition.  I can see why the theatrical version didn't have all the extra scenes because of time concerns, but what a difference!  (Like the elven cloaks, for instance, and the other elvish gifts.)  I was glad that there was a break in the movie when you have to change discs...  I found that watching it in at least two sittings made it easier to concentrate.  Ah, the luxuries of movies at home!  It's definitely worth the few extra bucks to get this one.  After all, you get so much more.  For the next two movies in the series, I'd also recommend getting the 4 disc edition.

Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings saga to the big screen almost flawlessly. Blending top notch CGI animation (most of which blows away anything offered by George Lucas), old camera tricks (to make the actors playing hobbits and dwarves appear smaller than humans and elves), and the beauty of New Zealand as a backdrop, Jackson has brought Tolkien's visionary Middle Earth to life, and old Tolkien fans could not be happier. Elijah Wood (Frodo), Ian McKellen (Gandalf), and Viggo Mortenson (Aragorn) are all fantastic in their roles (Mortenson will become a much bigger star than he already is), and the rest of the all star cast includes Liv Tyler, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davis, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Sean Bean, Cate Blanchet, and Ian Holm; all of which give quite memorable performances. The action scenes are nicely put together, but sometimes the fight scenes can become a bit blurry and incoherent, but that is only a minor complaint. All in all, even if you've never read the original books by Tolkien, you will find something to love with this first installment of the Lord of the Rings. This will be the Star Wars Trilogy for a new generation, and will be cherished for years to come.  This Extended Edition is lightyears beyond the original theatrical version DVD release, but it can be upsetting considering with the looming release of The Two Towers on DVD that a few months later an Extended Edition of that will be released as well.

It is a story of the bonds of love, family, and friendship. It is a story of war, hate, and loss. It is a tale of redemption. And it works like nothing I have ever seen before. The performances in the film are honestly touching. Aragorn is the conflicted soul, knowing his destiny but denying it in the face of possible failure..the familial curse. Gandalf, the loving ""grandfather"" terrified in the face of a barely perceived evil that he cannot stop. Frodo, the boy-man innocent to the world around him, but aching for an adventure he will one day regret. Sam...the loving friend. And...Boromir...the most powerfully portrayed character in the film. The lost warrior that fails the one true test he must face. His redemption is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. From the performances, special-effects, score, editing and screenwriting, this is the finest example of a group of people working toward one vision that you will ever see. Highly recommended.",1054857600,,1272,4.920930232558139
1315613,5,B00003CWT6,"This film version of the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkein's LORD OF THE RINGS will disappoint only the most hardcore Tolkein literalists, who won't accept even a single word being changed (and who probably wouldn't be content with anything short of a 300 hour long mini series). For the rest of us, seeing this film will be a remarkably immersive, moving, and impressive experience. Despite the fact that the series is incomplete as I write this (THE RETURN OF THE KING comes out this coming fall), I have to place this on my official list of my 100 Favorite Movies. In the interests of full disclosure, I will add that I am not what one would consider a Tolkein fanatic. I read the entire series in college, and later when my daughter was three-years-old I read her the trilogy aloud. I consider it to be a good, but hardly great, work of literature.
The movie does so many things so well it is difficult to know where to begin. One has, I suppose, to begin with the art and set design. I have never seen a film that paid so much attention to detail. The design of the tiniest objects onscreen appears to have been labored over. The jewelry, for instance, is both striking and unique. I especially like the clasps the 'fellowship' wear on the Elvin cloaks. The effort expended on the jewelry is typical of everything else. The make up, the furniture design, the boats, the weapons, absolutely everything that appears onscreen seems to have emerged from another world and from the most dedicated crafts persons.
Technically, the film is a marvel. The photography, the CGI scripting, the myriad of special effects is all very close to perfect. One never is bothered or disturbed or skeptical by the presence onscreen of the Hobbits and humans and dwarves. Other aspects of the production, such as the photography and music and sound, are also done about as well as is possible.
The casting is impeccable. Ian McKellan is perfect as Gandalf, my favorite character from the novels. Viggo Mortensen is a fine Strider/Aragorn. Elisha Wood still, even after the first two films, completely won me over, but it doesn't hurt the film as a whole. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies are great as an Elf and Dwarf respectively. Most of the rest of the cast is rock solid. I was especially pleased to see Ian Holm, who voiced Frodo in the famed radio version of LORD OF THE RINGS, portray Bilbo. Christopher Lee, who is not only a Tolkein fanatic but is the only member of the cast to have actually met Tolkein, does his usual capable job of being evil as Saruman.
My only real disappointment in the film, as I'm sure it was to many who have read the novels, was the decision to not include Tom Bombodil, unquestionably the most important character in the novels to be excluded. The Tom Bombodil sequence is one of the most delightful in the trilogy, and provides both a break in the long journey to the Elves and is crucial in making the journey feel long and eventful. As a result, in the movie that journey seems to take considerably less time than in the novel. I know that not every detail or scene in the novel could make its way into the movie, but that was one that I especially lament. Besides, Tom is such an outrageous character, it would have been delightful to see how they would have portrayed him.
Otherwise, I have no major complaints with the film. Most scenes and events are portrayed anywhere from adequately to spectacularly. I especially loved the way they handled how the world looked whenever Frodo put on the ring.",1054771200,,3526,4.598412698412698
1315614,4,B00003CWT6,This movie was great but why do you need two DVDs for just a 3 hour movie? The widescreen version is too small unless you ahev a 40 inch televesion. The added scenes that were directly put into the movie was a kool effect.,1054684800,2,222,4.068181818181818
1315692,5,B00003CWT6,"The deleted scenes really help flesh out the movie, and help a great deal for those who did not read the book.  I'll assume that you know what LOTR is about already, so I won't bore you with a recap of the movie itself.
The additional bonus material is very entertaining.  You get actor's perspective of the filming, location shots and the story behind the movie.  The scenery of New Zealand is stunning, so much so you get the feeling that New Zealand's tourism bureau had a hand in making the bonus DVD.
The DVD makes it easy to find additional scenes, or expanded scenes with the menu system.  You can also select different Dolby settings for the music.
The sound quality is terrific, and the movie begs for surround sound.  If you don't already own a surround sound system, this movie certainly justifies such a purchase.
All in all it is well worth the money, even if you already have the original DVD.
The set includes discounts on tickets and rebate if you bought the original DVD, but there is a time limit for both.  If you haven't bought the DVD set by the time the second movie hits the rental stores you'll be too late to take advantage of the discounts.",1054684800,,1166,4.450704225352113
1315693,5,B00003CWT6,"I'm not sure exactly what I expected from the extended edition of FoTR, but I'm
fairly sure whatever my expectations were, they were certainly exceeded.  Even
in the  introduction there were extra clips (of Isildur putting the ring on when
attacked by Orcs)...in fact, even the placement of the movie title was changed.
The movie actually opens with Bilbo writing his book, and then loads of extra
footage from the Shire. It continues on to the part where Frodo meets Gandalf,
but the dialogue is slightly different! Bilbo is actually narrating a lot of it
(evidently from his book), and the changes are brilliant! I didn't even realize
how many loose ends and abrupt scene changes there were in the original FoTR
until I saw how they were improved.
A sampling of a few additions include an extended tavern scene with the hobbits;
 woodelves on the trip to Bree;  hobbits and Strider (Aragorn) making their way
through Midge Swamp and a lot more. A lot of the additions were very minor and
hardly noticeable - but they improved the flow of the movie as a whole; things
like  an extra second of video here, or a couple extra words there pull
everything together in a great way.
The major additions would be in the land of Lothlorien. There was a lot of extra
footage from the point when the fellowship leaves Moria until they get on the
River. Not only do you get to see Galadriel giving the fellowship gifts
(although Sam's box of soil seems to have been skipped...), but you also get to
see Aragorn arguing with Haldir on a Flet, and you get to hear a lot more
dialogue (which closes a lot of loose-ends).
After Lothlorien, you get to see Gollum swimming with his log on the river and
you get to see Aragorn and Borimir angrily discussing the ring and the path
they'll take (ultimately, if you had any doubts concerning Borimir's motives,
they'll be extinguished here). There were also a few more snippets of fighting
in the end with Borimir's death.
The additions to the movie that Jackson made were great, this release will
probably make a few ""Tolkien purists"" reconsider the movie and possibly enjoy it
a little more. A few of the detractions I had about the theatrical version were
pretty much taken care of (In the original, the gifts from Galadriel and the
relationship between Gimli and the elves were sort of missing).
The actor interviews, which actually weren't all that enlightening still made
the boxed set fun and interesting.  All of the DVD extras are amazing - I now
know more about the movies than I ever thought possible...I can probably
describe in great detail how most of the special effects in the movie were
created.
This boxed set is worth the few extra dollars...even without all the DVD extras,
the changes in the film itself make it a worthwhile purchase.",1054684800,2,2784,4.659877800407332

This movie is wonderfully filmed, acted and produced. The special effects are often so good that they are unnoticeable.
One starts to believe that John Rhy Davies really is a dwarf or that Elijah Wood is really a diminutive, hairy-footed hobbit.
This DVD contains the theatrical release of the movie which, although significantly different from the book) is faithful in its characterizations and beautiful in its scope. The surround sound is extremely well done and the picture is wonderfully crisp.

1315698,5,B00003CWT6,"(This review of mines is just on the movie) My fantasy film taste would be changed forever when I first saw the first installment in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, entitled ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"". I was completely blown away by the out-of-this-world directing from none other than Peter Jackson. The directing and the landscapes of Rivendell, the mines of Moria, and the mountains, and The Tower Of Orthanc are breathtaking. It's also mind boggling how they manage to make the Hobbits shorter than the actors that portray as the actors are at least a foot taller than the characters they play while others are shorter than the characters they play. All of these things make this entire story come to life. This could as well be the ultimate movie trilogy off all time.
The power of the Ring is not to be reckoned with as others have fallen to its power with disastrous results. Many have tried to use it but terrible things happened to them, whether it was being killed or still being alive but being tormented, or tortured by its deceitful power. It's was now up to a young Hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins to destroy the ring by casting it into the fires of Mt. Doom where it can be unmade. Many dangerous obstacles lay ahead as numerous enemies hunt them down and the power of the ring gradually grows heavier showing how evil tries to all of it's might to continue to endure the heroic efforts of good and it almost runs parallel to the real life battle between good and evil and how evil is a threat to all life on earth and how greed and desire for power can corrupt even the highest ranking leaders of society. Also it even tells of how any ordinary person can be able to change the course of history.
This epic movie is outstanding on all fronts! I'm not sure how Tolkien would've reacted to the screen adaptation if he were still alive, but I think that no fantasy movie has worked so well in being adapted to the silver screen like LOTR has. The excellent Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is more like a children's horror cartoon by comparison and even the most recent Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones doesn't top ""Fellowship"" although the stunning special effects, and futuristic cityscapes do give Fellowship some competition. Enough of the film comparisons. I don't think that the cast could've been better. Ian McKellan was perfect for playing Gandalf. Gandalf has some hilarious lines during the beginning and shows unbelievable bravery and boldness. But then all of the major characters show these traits. No one in my opinion could've done a better job portraying the evil wizard Saruman than actor Christopher Lee. The four Hobbits by the name of Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrine Took, and Merry Pippin are great too. Over time, new characters would come into the picture. Overall, from my perspective, ""Fellowship"" is more of like an introduction to the individual characters and them interacting and with alliances forming and missions being laid out and this film is more of a warm-up to the cataclysmic events that would take place in it's follow up ""The Two Towers"" and what'll become even more cataclysmic with the epic finale ""The Return Of The King"". Legolas is astounding with his eye popping archery skills and I'll bet that he'll make girls everywhere fall head over heels. John Rhys Davies was perfect for Gimli's part. While I thought that Gimli in ""Fellowship"" was somewhat annoying and somewhat pompous in this film, he would go through vast improvements in the second LOTR movie, becoming much more entertaining, and become one of my favorite characters. More than likely there are other characters who aren't showcased in the movie and that probably disappointed some but the ones that were though were superbly portrayed. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job of directing the scenes.. All of these things make this entire story come to life. Bilbo Baggins is wonderfully played by Ian Holm.
What I find great about this movie is that while parts of the film are extremely violent in the battle scenes with countless villain Orcs being killed in battle, there is little blood and there is no splashes of blood that'll make one feel queasy and that really makes this movie even more astounding. This is the perfect example of making seemingly realistic battle scenes without much blood.
Boy I tell you, seeing this at the big screen was a hell of a visual assault to the imagination in a positive sense with incredible special effects, intense battle scenes, spellbinding scenery, both the landscape, the caves, The Shire, etcetera etcetera. I am so grateful that I did not miss out on seeing this one the big screen as when it came out on the small screen, the small screen robbed this epic fantasy film of much of it's power but that does not mean that it's no longer intense, quite the opposite. It's just that the big screen is like the events are almost actually happening before ones eyes and that, my friend, is epic fantasy filmmaking. No one alive today will ever see epic fantasy movies that are so astounding like the Lord of the Rings trilogy or surpass it. Things only would get better with the successor installment ""The Two Towers"" and I cannot wait for ""Return of the King"". Although Fellowship isn't as strong as its follow-up, this movie has already become one of my favorite fantasy films of all-time and should be in every movie lover's collection. Believe me, this was three hours well spent! I look forward to the day when I can spend over 9 hours watching all three LOTR movies straight through. I'm now finally exhausted of words to say now.",1054080000,3,5617,4.715157680569685
1315699,5,B00003CWT6,"Magnificent, is the word that best comes to mind. With Hollywood's history of bungled fantasy genre films, with very few standing out as above-mediocre, this film will redefine the genre as ""Star Wars"" did to sci-fi back in the 70's. As for general effect (filming, CG, musical score) this movie is exceptional. The blend of sets and the professional, even-handed use of CG in this movie puts the new Star Wars movies and Lucas' famed ILM to shame. The new Star Wars films should be this good. The cast of great actors: Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, John Rhys-Davies, Cate Blanchett, et-al... also lends itself to making this movie great. The actors are allowed to be very dramatic and really flesh out the charaters, rather than reading lines. Also, the use of Tolkien's fictional languages by the non-human characters is impressive and provides the depth that Tolkien created by inventing the languages in the first place.
Story-wise: THIS IS A MOVIE, it has a SCREENPLAY, BASED on the books by the esteemed J.R.R. Tolkien. As far as screenplay adaptations of a novel, this is one of the best by far, especially in the Extended-Edition DVD.
Tolkien purists will point out that the film adaptations do not go exactly by the book or trash some of the lines found in the movie, true there are no Uru-kai in the books but some lines like Aragorn: ""Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall."" in the new Two Towers movie, come straight from the book. It is the best mix I've yet seen of movie and novel and pays respect to the feel, story, ideals, and morals in the original novel(s). I urge viewers to remember that the books and movies are two different beasts. If you think that a screenplay that IS NOT a slavish, unyeilding devotion to each word in the books will offend you then I strongly suggest you avoid the film altogether and re-read the novels. For I have experienced both and find them equally a grand experience.
The extended edititon DVD is, itself exceptional as well, the menus are well done and not crazy. They are tasteful and easy to navigate. That is good because of the dizzying depth of background and production material to slosh through. It will take you as long to watch the movie as to delve into the bonus features. This is by far the most well done and polished DVD I've seen. Of course the film itself is excellent and presented in wide-screen letterbox.
One of my most favorite films and DVD's. The next two installments will, I'm sure be just as great.",1053993600,,2479,4.636363636363637
1315757,5,B00003CWT6,"One of the most comprehensive DVD's I've ever seen!
An amazing digital tranfer makes for pure movie magic in the astounding DVD Special Edition.
The extra scenes add to the story, instead of distracting you from it.  I've read the book, and these extra scenes give you a little more background on the specific scenes.
If you enjoyed the movie, spend the extra [$$$] and get the Special Edition before they're all gone!
The 4 Disc set comes in a great cover that makes it look like an old leather-bound book.  Looks more like a book on your shelf than a DVD.  I'm sure the next 2 films will be done the same way for the Special Edition.
The extras are unbelievable.  Over 6 hours I think.  I still haven't seen them all!  The only thing I wish that would not have been done, is putting a break in the middle of the film.  Probably to preserve the great digital transfer, they had to put the film on Disc 1 & Disc 2.  But it's only a minor issue.  Creates a great time to run to the bathroom before finishing the film :)
One DVD to rule them all!",1053907200,,1044,4.206030150753769
1315758,4,B00003CWT6,"Besides the movie, this DVD set packs in lots of goodies that Tolkein fans are going to love.  The interviews with the director and actors along with historians and literary scholars shed lots of light on the story and the mind of the author behind the story.  The goodies are incredibly rich and they make owning this DVD set worthwhile.
The movie itself is standard teenage fantasy fare, though.  Judging the movie as someone who has not read the books, I can't say that I thought the movie was particularly special.  The special effects and beautiful scenery indeed make up for the thin story, but the story's weaknesses show through the splendid cinematography.
First on the list of gripes is the soundtrack.  A little subtlety goes a long way, but apparently really loud symphonic movements make scenes easier to understand.  The music shoved every emotion and every atmosphere right down the viewers throat.  If the scene was happy, we get loud happy music.  If it's sad, we get loud sad music.  And if it's a fight scene, well, the music is just unbearably overwhelming.  Yes, it's supposed to be an epic story, but the director just needs to tell the story not jerk the viewer around with the music.
My second gripe is the story of Golem.  Rather, the lack thereof.  We are introduced to this character early on in the movie and then get little glimpses of him here and there.  We get to see the main characters fret over the fact that Golem is following them, and we know that Golem is interested in getting the ring back.  And...?  Where is the director going with this story?  If there is a story here, why isn't it explained?  If there is no story, why is it in the movie?  The Golem storyline gets a big 0 stars for being completely superfluous to the main storyline and not having its own resolution.
One other big problem I had with the movie was with the bad guys.  These guys are worse than Star Wars Storm Troopers when it comes to battle.  The director spends far too much time dwelling on these repetitive battle scenes where the heroes don't get a scratch but entire armies of baddies are wiped out in a matter of minutes.  Even in the final battle scene where (SPOILER) Boromir gets three arrows to the chest, he manages to take out an entire legion of super-orcs before finally succumbing to his wounds.  It's just unbelievable that the heroes would continue getting into these fights without getting hurt.  When Boromir dies and the elf archer appears with a big scrape on his forehead, it was laughable that the director who just spent 10 minutes showing how invincible these heroes are is now trying to convince the audience that they in fact do get hurt too.
The last big gripe I had was the lack of character development.  The characters that we are introduced to in the beginning of the story are the same characters that we see as the story ends.  No one learns anything, no one grows spiritually.  The only change we see is in Frodo who goes from being happy and carefree to fretful, but this change happens about 2 minutes after he becomes the ring bearer and does not get any deeper as the movie goes on.  Every time the chance to develop the characters came close, the movie decided that instead of doing that it would be better to introduce new characters.  So the audience is left with a thousand and one characters (996 of which are completely peripheral to the main story line) and a very shallow understanding of the main characters.
Is it a terrible movie?  No, but it is mostly saved by the cinematography which is simply magical.  Tolkein created a masterpiece in his creation of Middle Earth, but the Lord of the Rings story is one dimensional and is hardly lives up to the huge potential that the Middle Earth world provides.",1053907200,3,3769,4.573770491803279
1315759,5,B00003CWT6,"Normally I review music but I just had to add my voice, for what it's worth, to the over-three-thousand reviewers(!!) who have weighed in on this 4-DVD-set so far.  The movie itself, whether extended version or original, is a wonderful interpretation of a truly seminal work of literature.  But everybody knows that already, and it's not why I'm writing this review.  What truly blew me away here was the incredible plethora of bonus features--I'd give them TEN stars if I could.  It took me an evening to watch the film, but several months to watch the rest of the content!  Not only do you get the extended version of the film, but five (count `em, FIVE) variations of it, four of which contain full-length commentary by key people from the production team and cast, giving a blow-by-blow account (sometimes literally!) of how each shot was achieved, how the special effects were accomplished, and what was actually going on behind the scenes.  The result is utterly engrossing--like actually being there.  Some of the revelations are sobering, some hilarious, and some just mind-boggling.  As if that weren't enough, also included are 2 extra CDs containing the following: 17 original documentaries covering all aspects of the filmmaking process, an interactive map, examples of the computer wizardry used for the special effects, and galleries of photos, storyboards and artwork.  The talent, effort and professionalism that went into the making of this film are staggering, and I hope all of these fine people receive the recognition they deserve.  Thank you, Peter Jackson and friends, for allowing the rest of us into your world of magic-making.  Not only is this set of DVDs an excellent value for the money, but it's an absolute must for anyone interested in the craft and art of film-making.

1315760,5,B00003CWT6,"I've read tons of scathing reviews regarding this movie and the special extended edition, and I've noticed the phrase ""longest, most boring movie ever made"" pop up, in variations, many times.  This is aggressively annoying to me -- not just because I love this film (and ""The Two Towers""), but because it glaringly proves that the attention spans of our youth and/or moviegoers today have narrowed to the point where, if a character isn't being mutilated in the first ten minutes or a massive ""Speed""-style car chase isn't staged before the opening credits roll, audience members bolt for the nearest exit.
This is an EPIC, folks!  Look the word up in your Webster's -- it means LONG, SPRAWLING.  Dear God, could you see these same people trying to sit through 4 hours of Gone with the Wind or Ben-Hur -- they'd be foaming at the mouth!  Matter-of-fact, LoTR is on a scale with those films; it's a classic epic, with actual characters and story and lavish production and special effects that are present to serve the story, not the other way around.  And, I have to say, if given the choice to watch Gone with the Wind or Ben-Hur or LoTR, I'd watch LoTR anytime, anywhere.  And I'm not some fly-by-night moviegoer -- I'm a fanatic.

1315811,5,B00003CWT6,"JRR Tolkien, author of the Lord of the Rings, was a master at evoking the imagination. Most readers of his books probably have certain mental images of Middle-Earth and its characters. I certainly did. A film depiction of such well-loved books, thus, could easily fall short in many ways. I was ready to be disappointed.
But I'm happy to report the filmakers of Fellowship of the Ring have done an excellent job in bringing the story to life on screen. Most of the characters and places are, well, as I imagined they would be. And even though it's been a long time since I read it, the story was easy to follow and well covered in the film--no small feat since Fellowship of the Ring is a fairly long book. It seems those who haven't read the book might have some trouble following the characters and the plot but I don't know how it could've been done better.
As mentioned, the players are well-done, particularly the ringwraiths (chilling black creatures), the elves (elegant), the dwarfs (down-to-earth), the wizards (Saruman on top of his tower; he and Gandalf conjuring) and the hobbits (loveable homebodies). The nature scenes and the vistas are fabulous.
Having said that, some things were perhaps a bit overdone. The balrog and the 3000 year-ago Sauron were mere animations (think how older films, by contrast, would create imaginary things out of very little; a computer drawn creature leaves little to imagine).
The orcs were too monsterous and too complex in their form. Overall, I felt a bit of sensory overload with all the extended fighting scenes. A little less might have been more effective.
In the very last scene, Frodo and Sam look toward Mordor. I might have expected a darker, more forbidding view but maybe they are still far away.

1315814,4,B00003CWT6,"Before I watched this movie, and to this day, I've never read any of Tolken's books.  I tried the Hobbit when I was younger, but never got too far into it.
With that said, I was a little confused watching this movie.  I spent the majority of the time trying to figure the charecters out.  However, none of this ruined the movie or made it bad for me.  Instead, I realized for the first time the magic of Tolken.  He had an incredible ability to craft charecters, creatures, and new worlds out of thin air which I found amazing.
Even though I may not have fully understood everything through this movie, I still had the sense that if I kept with the series, it will make sense eventually.  And though the movie was long, I never got bored.  Tolken uses suspense amazingly to where you can't look away at any time.
In the end, I longed to see the sequel.  And to me, that's one sign of a great movie.",1052784000,,898,4.241176470588235

Upon reading that, I was furious. I'm here to say now that if you can serve up my words on a platter, I will eat them.
It still kind of bugs me that I almost bought two versions of this film, but the extended version does add so much excellent backstory and detail to the main film that I admit it was well worth the wait.
Not one person that I've shown this film to has not liked it. This is truly epic filmmaking and should be (not necessarily budget or special effects wise, but in vision, directing and acting) the baseline of what constitutes a ""good film.""
I cannot recommend this film any higher.",1052697600,,752,4.302816901408451
1315818,4,B00003CWT6,"I watched this movie on the big screen four times and at home at least that many.  It is a remarkable accomplishment.  The entire production team should be commended for the effort.  Director Peter Jackson's interpretation is much less subtle than Tolkein's own and also much 'darker' but some of this is the result of transferrance to the visual media.
Visually I liked the movie a lot.  The landscapes and battle scenes were spectacular.  The Hobbits were portayed in a way that exceeded my expectations.  The 'forced perspective' worked well for them.  I'm so glad midgets or gnome-like renditions were not used.  All the peoples were well done except two; the Orcs and Uruk-hai.  Jackson went too far in making them disgusting.  Sure they were a fallen race in Tolkein's world but they had personalities.  Remember the power struggle between the competing Orcs that captured Merry and Pippin (part of the Two Towers)?  'Listening' to them talk in Tolkein's writings was fascinating.  Watching and listening to Jackson's versions was revolting.  I just wanted them to go away.  Also Jackson made the Uruk-hai too big.  They should have been smaller than Men, not bigger.  My two favorite visual scenes were the Shire and Moria.  Moria was great.  The Balrog seemed perfect to me.
The musical score to this film creates just the right mood.  Excellent job.
My two biggest disappointments were the Nazgul and Saruman.  Visually the Nazgul are well done, esp. when the ring is worn and one enters their world.  The problem is the caricaturish way in which they are employed.  There is no subtlety or mystery; they should have all worn a sign saying ""You are supposed to be afraid of me"".  The 'chase' scenes are awfully contrived, esp. the Race to the Fords, and Aragorn setting them all afire on Weathertop is ... apocryphal ....  When I watch it on DVD I skip over these scenes.  Since there is a lot of good material that was left out of (even the extended version) the film this is a shame.  Given Peter Jackson's preference for 'dark/spooky' interpretations he could have done a great job with the Barrow Downs; oh well.
Saruman is portrayed as an overt servant of Sauron in this movie.  Maybe the film media is too hard to capture the actual role of Saruman, which was a renegade pursuing his own ends who more hurt than helped Sauron.
The actors generally did a great job in their roles.  Two I found especially good were the ones who played Sam and Boromir.  I actually prefer the Boromir of the movie to the one in books, he is so well scripted and acted.  Gandalf, Merry, Pippin, Elrond were well done.  The only actor who I think was definitely miscast was Christopher Lee as Saruman.  A perfect Saruman would have been the late Sir Alec Guiness though I'm sure there are others out there who have more charm than Lee.  Lee is too one-dimensional in his acting, the character of Saruman isn't.  The script is at least partly to blame for this.
Overall this is a very good film with a good shelf life.  Even Tolkein purists will get much enjoyment from it.  It would be an impossible task to make a perfect film of the Lord of the Rings.  This version does fall short but not by enough to be missed.  4 stars.",1052352000,,3219,4.6300884955752215

1315869,5,B00003CWT6,"I have read The Lord of the Rings, but that was back when I was a teenager, many moons ago, so much of the long and complex story has long since evaporated from my consciousness.  From this vantage point, I simply do not care how closely Peter Jackson's adaptation hews to its source material.  All I know is that The Fellowship of the Ring is obviously a landmark film, perhaps the best large-scale fantasy movie since Fritz Lang's Siegfried (based on a Germanic myth that Tolkien also drew on for LOTR, incidentally).  Fellowship was clearly a labor of love for everyone involved in its making, and it shows in everything from the art direction and set design to the cinematography, writing, acting and, especially, Jackson's impassioned directing.  It's surprising to read that Jackson says he prefers the theatrical cut, because the extended DVD is  clearly superior, fleshing out several small points and adding several wonderful scenes that, while not strictly necessary to the narrative, add texture and feeling to the film as a whole.  Very definitely the choice to make over the original version DVD.",1051833600,2,1109,4.967567567567568
1315870,4,B00003CWT6,"This first installment of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is visually impressive, well-acted, and technically accurate.  I cannot agree with those who insist the film is truly in the ""spirit"" that Tolkien intended.  More on that in a moment.  In terms of the story, the basic thread follows closely to Tolkien - the One Ring has been discovered (in the prequel book ""the Hobbit,"" filmed as an extended flashback), which the bad guys need to rule the world.  That it was found by a Hobbit is fortunate, as they are too pure of heart to be immediately subsumed by the power of the Ring.  To bring peace and order back to the world, a group of adventurers (the titular Fellowship) sets out to take the ring to the one place it can be destroyed, deep in the heart of the evil one's kingdom.
The members of the fellowship are well-acted, especially by some of my old favourites like Ian McKellen (Gandalf), Sean Bean (Boromir), and John Rhys Davies (Gimli).  In fact, the entire cast performs their characters as you picture them from reading the book (except Blanchett's Galadrial - see below).  The sets and locales are very reminiscent of those described in the book (Rivendell seems a little crowded, but never mind).  The climax of Book 1 - Aragorn and the Hobbits battling the Ringwraiths on Weathertop - is the highlight of the film, in its pacing, action, and sheer eariness.
Naturally, when adapting a 500 page book, much is lost.  Jackson makes the right choices for the most part - Tom Bombadil is gone, as are the Hobbits' journey with the Wood Elves, Frodo's Birthday party, etc.  In fact, it's detrimental to the film that Jackson did not cut out more - for example, there was no reason to show the failed crossing/snowstorm on Mt. Caradhras.  Further, the movie invests too much time introducing Bilbo and setting up his relationship with Gandalf, at the expense of developing the relationship between Frodo, Merry, and Pippen (the Frodo/Sam relationship is fine).  Likewise, the important ""interracial"" Gimli/Legolas relationship never develops.
In my opinion, Jackson makes two more significant errors in terms of the feel/spirit of Tolkien.  First is the unfortunate portrayal of Galadriel: the entire Fellowship (even Gimli!) is supposedly taken with her charm, patience, and wisdom.  As portrayed in the film, she is aloof and intimidating, certainly not Tolkien's intention.  Secondly, Frodo's decision at the end of the film is made with the consent, even encouragement, of Aragorn.  This implicitly undermines the courage and independence of Frodo as Tolkien meant it to be - in the book, Aragorn does not know of Frodo's decision, nor even Frodo's fate, which colours much of the action in Book 3 (the first part of ""The Two Towers"").
This 4-DVD set is truly impressive.  I have not listened to all 4 (!) commentaries yet, nor have I managed to wade through all of the 6+ hours of documentary material, covering all aspects of the making of the film.  The parts I've seen/heard, however, are very interesting and informative, if occasionally repetative.  It is obvious that a great deal of effort has been put into making these films look like Middle Earth, for which I applaud the filmakers.  A little more effort in the interrelationships between the characters would have made this film better, but you can't have it all, I guess!",1051833600,2,3380,4.886164623467601

1315874,5,B00003CWT6,"2001 was filled with an erratic slew of mind-degenerating movies. From the horrible acting of ""The Mummy Returns"" to the crude stupidity of ""How High,"" the movies was just not interesting enough to actually spend time for, but when it seemed that Hollywood was losing its grip on us, it saved its own hide with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.
""Fellowship of the Ring"" introduces us to director Peter Jackson's visual vision of J.R.R.Tolkein's epic. As the first installment of the trilogy (the second part in winter of 2002, and the third in 2003), Fellowship takes us into the story of Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit (picture a gnome with bigfoot's feet), who must rid the world of the One Ring. There's a catch though, the One Ring, which was forged by the dark lord Sauron, was created by evil, and therefore, corrupts all who uses it. To take on this enormous task, Frodo must band with his friends and the different races of Middle-Earth, including elves, men, and dwarves, and even an aging wizard. But don't let all the fantasy oriented characteristics fool you; this movie actually has real emotional quality.
Jackson's vision contains emotional depth, something much desired in other action films, with its subplot of brotherhood, seen especially in the first hour, and holds on to it for the rest of the trip. Ian Mckellen's portrayal of the aged wizard Gandalf is perfect. He says every line as it should be said, transforming from a peace-loving man, to a stubbornly adamant warrior in two seconds flat. Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortenson, also helps out the film by adding a loyal, ill-ridden hero to the mix.
""Fellowship of the Ring"" may have its moving moments, but this is not a peaches and cream movie. There is action. A lot of action. After the second hour, the fellowship combats blizzards, pugnacious monsters, and the infamous Ringwraiths, fallen kings forced to serve Sauron. And just because these guys are emotionally bonded to each other, doesn't mean they're sappy. All the members of the fellowship must go through hordes of orcs and Frodo takes more punishment than his sword does.
The movie is darker than a lot of other flicks, too. The Ringwraiths are not just your average sword-wielding villains, and the Ring's innate evil makes even the most noble heroes in the film untrustworthy.
Even with its superb depth and hand chopping action, the movie still has a few flaws. In the books, Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) is seen as a compassionate elf, but in the film, she goes on psychedelic rampages, with mantras no one can understand. Jackson also fails to describe the purposes of some items, things that made the books so intricate. But all these potholes are minor differences that still allow the film to keep its main intent.
With Jackson's eagle-eye shots and surrealistic lighting, the films direction could not have been pieced together in a better way. This combination of excellent effects shots and intelligent storyline should help Hollywood earn back some of its respect.
The DVD:
The Extended Edition is perfect in complimenting Jackson's vision, as the addition 30 minute special version of the film proves. 30 minutes might not seem like a huge change, but it really does make the entire experience something else. Jackson is able to get more out of his characters and their relationships to one another, while also subtly bringing in better action sequences to the mix.
The commentaries are tedious at times, and it's annoying to see such a wonderful movie split in two. Just when a revelation is made, the screen turns dark and asks the viewer to switch to the next disc. While irritating, it is only a minor setback to such a wonderfully created dvd collection.
The extra features truly give a fresh experience to the entire movie's magic. From viewing how much sweat and blood Jackson and his team put into the film's creation, we also get to grasp a little part of the cast's time on the set. The bonding that we see through the cast only gives us a piece of that magic. The collection is a great piece to allow fans to explore the epic film, as well as the effort behind it that made it all possible. It's one of those few dvds that is a must own.",1051228800,2,4210,4.760601915184679
1315875,5,B00003CWT6,"First off let me say that either the regular or special edition version of The Lord of the Rings(including the two Towers) [cannot compare] to the book. But if there was no LOTR book ever written and Peter jackson had just come up with LOTR out of his [mind] then this would be the best fantasy epic ever. As far as movies go this version is better than the theatrical version because we see more Tolkien and Middle-Earth. the original movie is just shy of 3 hours, making this movie 3 hours, 28 minutes(208 Min). The best part of the Special Edition is the added part in Lothlorien where they get the gifts. Unfortunatly we syill don't see Tom Bombadil or the barrow wights or Radagast and the Council of Elrond still is fruitless compared to the one in the book(although we see Gandalf get angry at Boromir in the Council of Elrond), and we see the same amout of elvishly beutiful Liv Tyler(awww).
Regardless of this movie still not matching up to the book, those extra 30 minutes make it a must buy for Tolkien fans. And as a final remark the special effects of Peter Jackson and his crew are almoust as good as my imaginations. I have never seen any movie look like the way pictured the book in my head. 5 stars for the special effect, 5 stars for the bonus 30 minutes, 5 stars for the 4 plus hours of boring/entertaining extra's, and 5 stars for the movie in general!...",1050883200,,1375,4.396078431372549

1315972,5,B00003CWT6,"Truly, this is THE best picture of the year, though not the Extended Edition; I do own both and I felt compelled to review this one.
Kudos to Peter Jackson for surfacing through the muck of the off the wall and quite ridiculous films he used to make, thank God.  His artistry and vision made for a compelling motion picture.
This film employed some of the best on screen talents.  First, one of the greatest actors of all time, Sir Ian McKellan shines in a role he should for which he should have won Best Supporting Actor.  Orlando Bloom shone through in his breakout performance, and got even better in The Two Towers, funny since they were filmed at the same time.  And Viggo Mortenson is the dark horse hero, the unexpected sex symbol in a very powerful role protraying a very deep character.  His is also a performance worth and Oscar nomination.  Sean Astin and Elijah Wood were great, but convinving me that Hobbits were real.
The cinematography was astounding, filmed in one of the most beautiful places on Earth: Australia.  The sweep and scope of the camera angles and sceneic images are awe inspiring and breath taking.  The visuals are mind boggling, the creatures that were created and the make up used on the humans (goblins and orcs and what not) was astounding.  The Hobbit feet, though gross, are painstakingly applied and mastered, so to speak, even though their feet.  Meticulous Peter Jackson, like Michael Mann and his Native American costumes in The Last Of The Mohicans.
The script stayed true to the classic fairy tale, using many of Tolkien's timeless word.  It was definitely a faithful adaptation of the literary classic trilogy.  It's is a subtle allegory to the Bible and much of it is allegorical to the First World War.  However, the allegory of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia is more evident.
The score is superb.  Everyone seems to have a theme song.  The Hobbits have a happy little ditty that demonstrates their generally jovial nature and happy lifestyle.  The fairy's have floaty numbers, airy and sweet, very passionate.  The dark forces of Saruman are represnted by percussion driven songs, very deep, dark and sinister sounding.
As for the end, it leaves you hanging.  If you haven't read the classic trilogy, you're gonna be mad, but you're gonna be on the edge of your seat because you want to keep watching and you just can't wait for the next event to happen.  But you found out you had to wait a year, or a few weeks, days, whenever, depending on when you first saw Fellowhsip.  But The Towers is well worth the wait.
All in all, The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is the best picture of 2002.  Unfortunately A BORING MIND stole the prize from the rigtful winner.  But I won't let that get me down and neither should you.  This is science fiction/fantasy as at it's very best and can only be outdone by the rest of the movies in its own trilogy.  This is a film with few peers and is truly a landmark of cinema, not just for the finished product but also for the uncommon practice of the process of shooting all three movies at the same time.  This is a film that you should not miss, a story of triumph over adversity, loyalty, faith, devotion, romance and good over evil.  This is a outstanding film and I give it my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.",1050105600,2,3319,4.592529711375212

1315974,5,B00003CWT6,"(This review of mines is just on the movie) My fantasy film taste would be changed forever when I first saw the first installment in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, entitled ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"". I was completely blown away by the out-of-this-world directing from none other than Peter Jackson. The directing and the landscapes of Rivendell, the mines of Moria, and the mountains, and The Tower Of Orthanc are breathtaking. It's also mind boggling how they manage to make the Hobbits shorter than the actors that portray as the actors are at least a foot taller than the characters they play while others are shorter than the characters they play. All of these things make this entire story come to life. This could as well be the ultimate movie trilogy off all time. The power of the Ring is not to be reckoned with as others have fallen to its power with disastrous results. Many have tried to use it but terrible things happened to them, whether it was being killed or still being alive but being tormented, or tortured by its deceitful power. It's was now up to a young Hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins to destroy the ring by casting it into the fires of Mt. Doom where it can be unmade. Many dangerous obstacles lay ahead as numerous enemies hunt them down and the power of the ring gradually grows heavier showing how evil tries to all of it's might to continue to endure the heroic efforts of good and it almost runs parallel to the real life battle between good and evil and how evil is a threat to all life on earth and how greed and desire for power can corrupt even the highest ranking leaders of society. Also it even tells of how any ordinary person can be able to change the course of history.
This epic movie is outstanding on all fronts! I'm not sure how Tolkien would've reacted to the screen adaptation if he were still alive, but I think that no fantasy movie has worked so well in being adapted to the silver screen like LOTR has. The excellent Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is more like a children's horror cartoon by comparison and even the most recent Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones doesn't top ""Fellowship"" although the stunning special effects, and futuristic cityscapes do give Fellowship some competition. Enough of the film comparisons. I don't think that the cast could've been better. Ian McKellan was perfect for playing Gandalf. Gandalf has some hilarious lines during the beginning and shows unbelievable bravery and boldness. But then all of the major characters show these traits. No one in my opinion could've done a better job portraying the evil wizard Saruman than actor Christopher Lee. The four Hobbits by the name of Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrine Took, and Merry Pippin are great too. Over time, new characters would come into the picture. Overall, from my perspective, ""Fellowship"" is more of like an introduction to the individual characters and them interacting and with alliances forming and missions being laid out and this film is more of a warm-up to the cataclysmic events that would take place in it's follow up ""The Two Towers"" and what'll become even more cataclysmic with the epic finale ""The Return Of The King"". Legolas is astounding with his eye popping archery skills and I'll bet that he'll make girls everywhere fall head over heels.  John Rhys Davies was perfect for Gimli's part. While I thought that Gimli in ""Fellowship"" was somewhat annoying and somewhat pompous in this film, he would go through vast improvements in the second LOTR movie, becoming much more entertaining, and become one of my favorite characters. More than likely there are other characters who aren't showcased in the movie and that probably disappointed some but the ones that were though were superbly portrayed. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job of directing the scenes.. All of these things make this entire story come to life. Bilbo Baggins is wonderfully played by Ian Holm.
What I find great about this movie is that while parts of the film are extremely violent in the battle scenes with countless villain Orcs being killed in battle, there is little blood and there is no splashes of blood that'll make one feel queasy and that really makes this movie even more astounding. This is the perfect example of making seemingly realistic battle scenes without much blood. Boy I tell you, seeing this at the big screen was a hell of a visual assault to the imagination in a positive sense with incredible special effects, intense battle scenes, spellbinding scenery, both the landscape, the caves, The Shire, etcetera etcetera. I am so grateful that I did not miss out on seeing this one the big screen as when it came out on the small screen, the small screen robbed this epic fantasy film of much of it's power but that does not mean that it's no longer intense, quite the opposite. It's just that the big screen is like the events are almost actually happening before ones eyes and that, my friend, is epic fantasy filmmaking. No one alive today will ever see epic fantasy movies that are so astounding like the Lord of the Rings trilogy or surpass it. Things only would get better with the successor installment ""The Two Towers"" and I cannot wait for ""Return of the King"". Although Fellowship isn't as strong as its follow-up, this movie has already become one of my favorite fantasy films of all-time and should be in every movie lover's collection. Believe me, this was three hours well spent! I look forward to the day when I can spend over 9 hours watching all three LOTR movies straight through.

1316027,1,B00003CWT6,"The worst film I've seen in years. A dumbed down version of Tolkien's magnificent work made to appeal to a mass audience. In other words a typical Hollywood film. Don't be fooled. There isn't an ounce of Tolkien's spirit in this film. The compositions and editing are at best pedestrian. In this film Mordor looks more like Mortal Combat. The musical score is derivative. The performances, with the exceptions of Sir Ian McKellen and Ian Holm, are wooden. The usually wonderful Cate Blanchett is completely miscast as Galadriel. Wait until you see her turn into a screaming blue meany. Blanchett honestly seems stoned. Elijah Wood whines more than Luke Skywalker. If this film were true to Tolkien's spirit, Director Peter Jackson wouldn't have allowed Elijah Wood to be carried across the Ford of Bruinen by Liv Tyler. In the book Frodo crosses the Ford of Bruinen alone and turns to face the Black Riders by himself. This is a key sequence in the book because Frodo is allowed to show his courage. He defines why he will be the ring bearer. This moment is pure Tolkien. ""The average fellow turning to face terrifying odds in the face of great adversity."" Having Frodo carried across the Ford of Bruinen by Liv Tyler reduces Frodo to a weakling. It destroys rather than enhances Tolkien's ideas. It is a given in adapting a novel to film changes must be made for the over all improvement of the film. However, if Peter Jackson gave Liv Tyler this scene for no reason other than he wanted to insert a romantic angle into the story, (The character she plays is barely in the book and not even in the Ford of Bruinen sequence) he certainly wasn't making changes for the better of the film or for that matter being true to the spirit of Tolkien. I'd rather watch a Gamera film. At least Gamera will be entertaining and not pretend to be anymore than it is.",1049846400,19,1853,4.618181818181818

1316029,5,B00003CWT6,"I recently recieved this LOTR gift pack as an actual gift, and let me tell you, it was probably the best gift I ever recieved.
First and foremost in the pack is the movie itself, which has over half an hour of extra scenes that, due to time constraints, never made it to the movie. The original version was a great movie, but this extended edition is fantastic, with the extra scenes giving so much more insight into the story and characters. One scene that I particularly liked was the one where Aragorn and Boromir were arguing on the night before the breaking of the Fellowship. Not only do we get a better insight into Boromir's character, but we also see the Fellowship 'breaking' somewhat already, and it also makes Boromir's valiant departure more meaningful. The extra scenes also help prepare the viewer for 'The Two Towers' more, especially with regards to the gifts that Galadriel gave to ALL the Fellowship in Lorien.
The next best thing about this DVD pack are the 'behind the scenes' sections, which take up 2 whole discs and are probably longer than the movie itself. These segments explain virtually every detail behind the movie, everything including the set construction, props, costumes, music, as well as extensive interviews with the actors and development team. The only disappointment I had with this section is that it does not feature interviews with either Hugo Weaving (Elrond) or Cate Blanchett (Galadriel), and I must assume it is becuase those two fine actors simply weren't available at the time.
The DVD also features four extensive film commentary sections, with the actors, the writers, the set/prop designers, and the post production digital teams. While I found the last two a little repititive after having seen the 'behind the scenes' things, the first two commentaries (with the actors and then with the writers), are extremely interesting. Peter and his writing team do an excellent job explaining why some things were different from the book, why they did other things, what they wanted aimed to do with certain scenes. After listening to the commentary, it is obvious to me that Peter Jackson is a film-making genius with an electric imagination. I also liked the way that Peter was so blatantly obvious about everything, if he changed something from the book, he goes right out and says it, and then explains his reasons for doing so. He doesn't do it arrogantly, he simply presents his reasons for doing so and lets the audience make their decision, once again showing his great humility.
The actors featured in the DVD commentary are also very interesting, and explain some of the features very well. Ian McKellan is a standout with his gentle tone and shrewd statements concering the various scenes he comments on. The Hobbit actors are also very amusing, and it's obvious that those guys had a lot of fun making these movies. Sean Bean (Boromir) is great to listen to, and he really made me appreciate the character of Boromir more. John Rhys Davies also speaks very well, and he really opened my eyes up to what he had to go through in order to act in the movie (his facial makeup was horrendous). Hearing John speak outside the movie helped to reinforce my belief that we should have seen more of Gimli (and the Dwarves in general for that matter) in the movie itself. But even so, having seen Gimli played by such a magnificent and dedicated actor such as John is a real treat.
The actual packaging itself is also wonderful. The outside box is simply too beautiful to throw away, as it shows drawings of the Fellowship's journey down the Great River. The DVD pack itself is beautifully made, and includes a map of where the Fellowship travelled throughout Middle-Earth, which I found very interesting. The pack also includes two remarkably detailed statues of the Argonath from the movie, designed to be used as book ends. These books ends are almost as terrific as the movie itself, and I'm sure that many proud LOTR fans will have them in their bookshelves for years to come.
Technically speaking, the DVD is perfect. There are no errors whatsoever, which simply adds to the excellence of this theatrical masterpiece.
Whether you are a an avid LOTR fan or simply a casual fan who enjoyed the theatrical release of the movie (such as myself) this is the DVD pack to buy. It may be expensive, but it is worth every cent, and I would gladly had paid twice as much for such a masterpiece.",1049760000,,4436,4.769830949284786

In modern times, fantasy movies have gotten a bad reputation, not only because movies like ""Reign of Fire"" and ""Dungeons And Dragons"". Wait... it's mainly because of movies like them.

1316109,4,B00003CWT6,"Several years ago, when I was told that plans were being laid to film J.R.R. Tolkien's massive literary epic ""Lord of the Rings,"" my response was instantaneous.
""Impossible,""  I said.
There were two reasons for my reaction. One is that I know of only one successful film of any novel of this size. That is Sergei Bondarchuk's all-night-stand version of Leo Tolstoy's ""War And Peace.""  And even Bondarchuk was unable to film that novel's second epilogue, which deals with the philosophy of history.
This leads to the second reason why I doubted the viability of  the ""Lord of the Rings"" film project. Probably no novel can ever be filmed in its entirety; what is lost is the point of view of the writer-creator.
The first two parts of Peter Jackson's film version of ""Lord of the Rings"" have now appeared; and I have, of course, been proved right. Jsckson has made changes that are bound to annoy true-believing Tolkien admirers.
For example, if my calculations are correct, Frodo is not a boy when he sets out on his dangerous, agonizing quest as the Ring Bearer. He is a mature hobbit of around 50 years of age. The pivotal role of Frodo's relative Bilbo Bsggins, who found the One Ring of Power in the ""prequel"" book called ""The Hobbit,"" is downplayed. (This probably leads to some confusion among people who have not read the books; they may wonder why this elderly personage is in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" at all.)
In the second film, ""The Two Towers,"" (not yet released for home viewing) the fate of the elvish Princess Arwen is depicted as entirely different from that delineated by Tolkien. Smeagol, or Gollum, who is always referred to in the books as black in color, is depicted by Peter Jackson as white.  And no doubt other such discrepancies could easily be noted.
But the amazing  thing is how very effective Jackson's filmed ""Lord of the Rings"" is. Actually, perhaps it should not be regarded as amazing at all. Jackson is an artist in another medium than Tolkien's words. He uses film, the instrument of his art, to create powerful variations on the great writer's portentous themes. The result is brooding and powerful--perhaps as brooding and powerful, in its own way, as the books the films were based on.
I recommend both the books and the films very highly. But if you want to introduce your child to the clash between good and evil, the ""Lord of the Rings"" films are a bit much. Better for you to pop ""Harry Potter"" into your machine for the little ones.",1048809600,,2479,4.663615560640732
1316110,5,B00003CWT6,"I have yet to read the books in this series and I am glad of that. I usually find books better than the movies they become, so I am usually let down by the movies. I will go out on a limb and say that I will probably find myself still very much appreciating the movie after reading the source.
This movie is very well done. It has a feel of reality to it and as you watch the bouns material, you will understand why. This is a long movie but, despite the length involved, it never seems to drag along. The combination of story elements with the grand scale in which Middle Earth is presented lends itself to an anticipation of what is next.
Many movies that I have watched on DVD claim to have bonus footage. For the most part they contain a few extra lines that do absolutely nothing to expand upon the story. Not so in this case. The added material here gives you more background on the characters involved as well as leaving in some material that is relevant to the following movies.
The appendicies have so much material it's too much of a good thing. I did watch everything except the still images. There is a lot to see dealing with the ""behind the scenes"" workings of the movie, and some of it is very interesting, but it may not appeal to all.
If you ask if I would buy this, I would say no. The only reason I say this is because I have heard rumor of a super-duper-hella-long fourteen hour version of all three movies to be released after they all have left the theatres.

few who were bored by the length, I would highly suggest you
check out this DVD set. It adds some vital bits back to the
story, giving you a better perspective into the lives of the
characters. There is about 30 minutes of added content, but
they managed to spread it throughout the entire movie. There is
also a new introduction to Hobbiton which gives you a better
understanding of the hobbits, Bilbo Baggins, and his book.
Overall, I would say this is a must for anyone who enjoyed
the movie. If you can't decide between the standard DVD release

1316114,5,B00003CWT6,"I'm biased in reviewing this movie, I really am. I didn't get bit by the Tookish side of me until I heard about the Rings trilogy from a friend who was eagerly anticipating the movie. When I read the first book, I really enjoyed it. When I saw the movie (the first time), I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it just as much on the fifth time, as I recall. In a little over a year, I've read the trilogy (several times), The Hobbit several times, The Silmarillion once, and was active in a Lord of the Rings study class in a local church. So people might officially label me a Tolkien-ite. But I can't achieve this status yet, not until I learn Elvish. Until then, let me share with you my opinion of this movie.
First, it's very difficult to describe the wonder and awe of the series by J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien weaves a fantastic tale of fantasy, adventure, and suspense that strikes a chord in anyone. The ""Tookish"" side that makes anyone want to travel, to journey, to have adventures and see or commit brave acts of valor.
The basic plot is Frodo Baggins, simple hobbit (if you don't know what hobbits are, you either need to forget reading these books or start reading immediately! :) ) from the peaceful land of The Shire inherits a simple Ring from his uncle, Bilbo Baggins. Through the counsel of Gandalf the Grey, traveling wizard and friend of the hobbit-kind, Frodo comes to know that this is more than just a Ring. It is The One Ring. The Ruling Ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron ages ago. Taken in battle, the Ring passed through different owners, almost all of whom have given in to its evil influence. Hobbits, however, though small in stature have extraordinary resilience to such evils. Frodo takes the Ring, and bears it away from The Shire, along with his four hobbit friends Sam, Merry and Pippin. He joins parties with Strider the Ranger, who assists in a conflict with the Nazgl, the dark phantom servants of the Dark Lord, whose sole purpose is to recover the Ring for Sauron, that He may again rule all lands in darkness.
The company reaches the protected stronghold of Elves, Rivendell. There is taken counsel, where The Fellowship of the Ring is formed. Great conflict lies ahead, for Frodo, for the Fellowship, for Elves, for Rivendell and for the entire land of Middle-Earth. You'll just have to buy this movie (and perhaps the books) to find out what happens!
Some worry that, as in the case for many with the introduction of the Harry Potter movies, whether the books could limit the imagination when a person who has viewed the movies goes back to the books again. In some ways, this is true...you probably won't be able to picture Gandalf or Frodo in any way but the portrayal of the movie's again. But the computer-generated enhancements/additions, and excellent actors, music, props, the whole thing makes it worth it.
As I said for the books, The Lord of the Rings gives wings for the imagination to soar into worlds far away, to dreams of heroes, conflict, beauty, grandeur, fantasy. (Hey, that sounds pretty cool!)
Now, for any young ones out there, I must warn the parents: This movie is rated PG-13 for a reason. No sex, nudity, or other immorality, but plenty of violence. The main enemy(s) are the Orcs that they fight. These are the prime targets of the sword, arrow, and axe action. They are shot, hacked, sliced, etc.
 The Ringwraiths are  frightening phantoms, galloping, screaming unearthly screams that, as another review put it, make you want to shrink down in your movie seat less they mistake you for a ""Shire"" or a ""Baggins"".
 The Fellowship that sets out from Rivendell meet blade to blade with orcs in the enormous dwarf-mine, and after vanquishing them, flee from a hideous (yes that word is used a lot here, but it applies a lot here) fiery balrog. There is also a scene where the traitorous wizard Saruman engages in sorcerous battle with Gandalf. Later, they meet blades with more orcs (technically, ""Uruk-hai"") at Amon Hen. (""Hill of Watchfulness"" in Tolkien's invented language)
One of their group is slain by arrows, and here also is the part which wasn't necessary to the movie, but they put in anyway. Strider defeats the lead orc by beheading him in the heat of battle. (I'll probably come across as talking this down, but I liked this movie, and I want people to know that when you think of the word ""behead"" you picture gruesome gory details. That wasn't the case in the movie. The blow is the equivalent of whacking off the head of a dummy-everything falls out of sight, isn't highlighted, and you don't see it again. It's ""whack!"" and Strider moves on. So it's up to your discretion, but I don't think it was as bad as it could have been)
 All through this, however, you do NOT even see much blood per se. Strider is hit in the mouth and it bleeds a bit, and when one of them is hit by arrows, his shirt is glossy and wet around the wound, but again, not emphasized. (I've even heard complaints from the Hannibal/Saving Private Ryan group that say they were disappointed with the fact that there was so little blood)",1048550400,,5079,4.590308370044053
1316161,5,B00003CWT6,"I never saw this film in the theater, as I bypass many new releases due to SO MANY distractions in any theater these days.  Any time of the day - just cannot do it.  I prefer great films in silence within my home theater and in the right ""mood setting"".
Since I had never saw this film, but had read the novel(s) when I was a teenager, I was anxious to see how modern technology, the craft of filmmaking and storytelling, and the state of home sound systems would make this film.  Simply, I was blown away.
The progressive scan DVD player and my HDTV made this movie so breathtaking and incredible.  The DTS soundtrack was perfect, the effects were photorealistic and in no way detracted from the storytelling (hear me, George Lucas?), and the casting was impeccable.  I honestly cannot think of anything negative, in any way, to say about this experience.  Never did see the ""theatrical"" version, so cannot comment there.  This 4-DVD set was my first exposure to it.  It is worth the price alone to see such wonderful actors as Sir Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee add to such masterful careers with this film.  All the other actors/actresses were cast just right.  Liv, Cate, Ian, Elijah, both Seans.....wow.
Based on all components of this film....actors/actresses, effects, sound, editing, immersive experience, color, music/score, this rates right up there with the best DVD I own, if not the best.  The T2 Ultimate Edition is right there also, but the story portrayed in this film, and all the Tolkien world brought to life makes this just an awe-inspiring film.
It's good I did not see ""The Two Towers"" at the theater either -will wait for a comparable DVD this year (pretty please????) and enjoy this story continued.
There are some things worth the money in this day and age.  $30 is a small price to pay for such an experience like this.
The neat thing is that I have not even explored the 2 extra DVDs for all the supporting material yet, or listened to the commentaries.  Want to relish the film for what it is before I take my time on those goodies.  This film and the two after it deserve every bit of praise and accolades they get.

However that is not saying that this package is perfect. First of all, the National Geographic DVD is pretty badly made (unexpectedly). Practically all questions posed at the back of the case (which hinted at a great Disc) went unanswered and the one-hour disc appeared to me like just a collection of excerpts from various other programs put together for a fast buck (or two).
Secondly, the finish of the Argonath bookends leaves much to be desired. I must say the bookends are what tempted me so much to get this Collector's Gift Set but the finished product loses much detail (on faces, hands, etc. possibly from a careless casting process) and has quite a bit of casting residue on the body.
I am not a TCG player but the 3 cards in the set do look pretty cool.
All taken into consideration, I still can't bring myself to rating this any lower than 5 stars due to the sheer superiority of the DVD (minus that sorry excuse of a NatGeo DVD) content.",1047859200,3,1166,4.47887323943662

 I've read the book several times over the years and I definately can say that this movie almost pulled every image that I came up with out of my head and put them onto the screen. The whole movie has a dark, and engaging sense of adventurism, intensity, and desperation that alot of other fantasy movies lack, simply because LOTR is so complex and multi-dimensional that it would be almost impossible to surpass for eons to come.

1316253,5,B00003CWT6,"I have waited for years to see a version of The Lord of the Rings which lives up to the grandeur of Tolkien's book.  After the disappointment of trying to sit through Ralph Bakshi's animated version, I was leary about ever watching a version of the Lord of the Rings.  However, when I first heard that Peter Jackson was working on this film, I started to look into it to see if it was going to be well-worked.
I was astonished to see that the production team for the Lord of the Rings was working as extensively as they were.  Most often, fantasy films are treated in such a way that it almost seems as though they are thrown together in a rush.  Not so with The Lord of the Rings, not so.  Indeed, this movie is the product of much work and good work at that!
The only day I ever skipped in my Senior year of high school (and my whole high school career for that) was the release day for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.  It was well worth it, though.  I was completely swept off my feet by the magnificence of this film.
Most importantly, The Fellowship of the Ring follows the plot of the book very closely.  It is most important in this movie because it sets the ground work for the other two movies which were filmed at the same time as the Fellowship.  Jackson and his team most logically sorted the story and included all that was necessary in order to make the movie full, while not completely overwhelming.
This movie is characterized by a high sense of adventure.  When I read The Fellowship of the Ring, I get the same feeling.  I feel that I am right on the paths of Middle Earth along with the Fellowship.  Watching this movie, I was engrossed in Middle Earth in the same way.
Also, Howard Shore, composed a most excellent soundtrack for this film.  It fits the mood of the story excellently and enhances the its mood, making it even more enjoyable.
Indeed, this movie is such a great buy that I bought both editions.  When the first, regular edition came out, I bought it on VHS because I knew that eventually the extended version would be released.  Having bought the extend version on DVD (If you can still find a collector's edition boxed set - buy it), I can without hesitation say that it even surpasses the original.  The added footage does not drag the movie down and make it more boring and weighty.  Instead, the movie flows even better and gives a fuller picture of Tolkien's work.  Also, the copious amount of commentaries and other extra features are well worth the extra cost (though overwhelming to try to watch them all since there are so many!).
There are few movies in this world which are 3-and-a-half hours long.  There are fewer of those movies which I can bear watching.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was not a chore at all to watch.  I have spent many hours of my life (perhaps days) watching and re-watching this movie.  If it were logically possible, I would give it 10 stars out of 5.  Since that is not possible, I am resigned to giving it 5 out of 5 stars.

1316255,5,B00003CWT6,"I have no problem at all comparing The Fellowship of the Ring to the original Star Wars. I feel that the Lord of the Rings films are and will be the Star Wars for this generation. Even though George Lucas is producing his second Star Wars trilogy right now, those films absolutely pale in comparison to Lord of the Rings. Comparing Fellowship of the Ring to The Phantom Menace is like comparing 2001: A Space Odyssey to Independence Day. The difference in quality is that huge. Fellowship of the Ring is a triumph of film making and storytelling in every respect. It is simply a perfect movie. Every detail, from the script to the actors, to the effects and production design, to music and photography, everything in this film is absolutely top of the line. Fellowship of the Ring is a far, far better movie than A Beautiful Mind and was far more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar. 2001 was a year that was filled with great films though, such as Mulholland Drive, The Royal Tenenbaums and Memento, but Fellowship was undoubtedly the most important and highest quality cinematic achievement of 2001.
This 4-disc Extended Edition DVD is a must-own for fans of the films or the books. How do you improve on a movie that was already a top-of-the-line, five-star classic? Well, the Extended Edition does just that. Thirty minutes of scenes are added, fleshing out the story and presenting more of the detail that is prevalent in J.R.R. Tolkien's books. My favorite addition is the new opening scene featuring Bilbo writing his book and talking about the meager lives of hobbits. With these new scenes, Fellowship is pushed to a three and a half hour running time. However, watching this movie is no chore at all. It is engrossing from the first minute to the last. Everything, presentation-wise is perfect. The picture and sound are excellent. This DVD has probably the most beautiful picture I've seen (including Attack of the Clones). The real treat, however, are the extra features. Two whole discs worth. I have not made it through all of the extra material yet, but what I've seen is very enlightening and entertaining. The behind-the-scenes footage and interviews are very informative. Best of all are the four feature length commentaries by cast and crew members. I've only so far listened to the cast commentary, but it is a joy to hear.
This splendid presentation could not have happened to a better film. The production of Lord of the Rings is one of the biggest, most complex and most important film shoots in movie history, and deserves to be documented as such. I hope that The Two Towers and Return of the King will recieve DVD editions as magnificent as this one.

1316257,5,B00003CWT6,"Well, this movie blew me away on two different fronts.  First, the film itself is a masterpiece.  I personally think LOTR has already surpassed any potential present in either Star Wars trilogy.  The complexity of characters, production design, acting, and cinematography were far above anything I have seen in a fantasy film before.  If by some strange chance you have not yet seen this film, please go and see it as soon as possible.
That brings me to my second point:  see it on this DVD.  This is what DVD should be like for every film made.  First, the film itself has deleted scenes inserted into their proper places in the film.  And unlike some deleted material, this is actually worth seeing!  It adds background story to the main narrative, and in some cases just looks amazing!  Also, it is followed by two DVDs of informative, humorous bonus material that answers some of the ""how'd-they-do-that"" questions that I had after seeing the film.  Finally, the film is accompanied by four different audio commentaries, each of which is ACTUALLY WORTH LISTENING TO!  Compared to the audio commentaries I have heard before (most of which sound like the director and stars drunkenly discussing the film at a bar after shooting has just finished), these are informative and amusing.  This DVD is an incredible bargain, and it is also a chance to own one of the cinematic milestones in fantasy film.",1047254400,2,1400,4.831932773109243
1316258,5,B00003CWT6,"I am one of those people who has read ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy at least once a year for more than thirty years. I consider it the greatest work of literature of the twentieth century. The writing shows an complicated world and makes you believe it is so real it could be history.
The movie series is incredibly good. It is completely true to the central themes of the book trilogy, and can be completely enjoyed by someone who has not read the books. The special effects and capture of scale for the 4 foot and under hobbits with tall men, elves, and dwarves are visually stunning.
Some liberties were taken with the book, and some of the characters are changed considerably (Arwen), but the story is very true to the central themes.
The trilogy of movies will become the standard of comparison for future entertainment. The richness of middle earth is captured in the movie. The effects come close to what you see with the mind's eye -- and that is high praise
This was a set of movies made by someone -- Peter Jackson -- who loved the books and wanted to bring them to the screen in a way that was worthy of J.R.R. Tolkien.
If you like a good story with good special effects, get all three of these as soon as they are available. Get the EXPANDED edition and see the story as envisioned, not shortened for theatrical release. A 4 hour movie makes sense on DVD where it would not in a theatre.

1316259,5,B00003CWT6,"Staggering movie, gorgeous, just incredibley beautiful. Extended version conquers the theatrical version by a clean sweep-don't bother with the original cut. Easily the best fantasy movie I've ever seen, surpasses by leagues my old childhood favorites: Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back. It's silly to compare really, they're very different kinds of movies. But I can say, I haven't felt this excited about a movie since I saw Star Wars for the first time in 1977, at the age of 7.
For book fans this cut is especially worth owning. It's like having breathtaking living illustrations as a supplement to the book. For me it doesn't spoil any of my own imagined images as I read the trilogy, it only inspires me to read them, again and again, for their incomparable depth of detail and weight of meaning.
In my opinion the strengths of this movie far, far, outweigh any weaknesses or deviations from the book. We're experiencing a very special and rare moment in movie history thanks to Peter Jackson & Company's efforts. I was shocked, literally, how well Jackson,et.all did translating Tolkien to living images, most notably in the extended version.
By so excellently bringing J.R.R.'s vision to the screen Peter Jackson has served us jaded moderns a sip from Tolkien's goblet: overflowing with beauty, myth, inspiration, magic, true and noble characters, filled with such deep enduring meaning it boggles the mind in what these days I experience as a largely desolate, mindlessly flashy, empty and money driven Hollywood landscape.

1316260,5,B00003CWT6,"let me say from the start, I am a great fan of Peter Jackson's movie interpretation of the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and it was the movie that inspired me to read the book.  It is the mythical worlds that Tolkien has created and which are brought to amazing life by Jackson that do it for me with this movie and elevate it to lofty heights. Jackson's depiction of  Tolkien's sumptuous and complex mythical world really has no cinematic comparison. The depth and detail to which he has gone into, parallels the movie ""Titanic"" and exceeds it in scope. The many lands, races, languages and creatures are just glorious in all their pageantry and it is all laid out for us in a way which makes us feel that it was always so, and will always be. Tolkien's unique storyline is complimented by Jackson's ability to bring to life emotions such as fear, sadness, terror, and joy along with qualities such as loyalty, bravery, perseverance, doggedness and humility. The movie is literally dripping with all these ingredients. This movie has something for everyone, including action buffs, with wicked sword play from Aragorn and masterful archery from Legolas to name but a few highlights. One of the traits of Tolkien I have had to battle with when reading ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", is his flowery writing, in particular his tendency to burst into song (or at least his characters do) on a very regular basis. While obviously somewhat relevant to the development of the story and a key part of Hobbit culture, I found the plethora of poetic singing in the book rather tedious at times. Jackson's movie contains none of this, and for this reviewer anyway, it is was a welcome relief. This movie is a masterpiece, truly deserving of classic status. It has been very nicely presented in an excellent DVD package with a nice set of extras.  Everything about the movie, the merchandise, the presentation and now the DVD, is superb.",1047081600,,1920,4.74251497005988
1316261,5,B00003CWT6,"What can I say but awesome! This movie is one of the best DVDs out there, in both DVD quality & movie quality! The movie is based on Tolkiens Lord Of The Rings, and has been done in episodes, as the book are done. The movie leaves off, to where The Two Tower will pick up. The movie really dosnt have an offical ending in a sense. Peter Jackson filmed all 3 movies (Lord Of The Rings, The Two Towers, & Return Of The King) at once, in a course of 2 years. Peter Jackson really went the extra mile to make this movie as good as it can be! The cast is very strong, and special effects are top notch. If your not familar with the story of Lord Of The Rings, you will probably need to watch the film a few time to pick up things youve missed. The story is catching & will leave you hungry for the next film. The 5.1 Dolby EX sound track, is probably the best in a DVD Ive heard! It really shines through on a true 5.1 surround unit. The picture qulaity is top notch as well! This is a must have DVD!",1047081600,,995,3.9306930693069306

I wouldn't have paid the extra [money] on the bookends & National Geographic DVD, but that's just me.  Though I like the bookends a lot, when you see that they make up the bulk of the price difference you'll see that they're overpriced.  Regardless if you LOVED the movie and you have money to spend, go right ahead and get this version.",1046995200,,545,4.356435643564357
1316321,3,B00003CWT6,"I have seen this movie four times so far, and each time it has gotten a little bit worse.  In fact, I might have been tempted to give it a full 5 stars after first viewing.  Heaven only knows what I will grade it after seeing it a few more times.  It simply does not hold up to repeated scrutiny, in my opinion.  I have moved beyond the razzle-dazzle of the effects, which are admittedly pretty special.  The considerable charm brought to the picture by the cast seems to wane upon repeated viewings.
I like to think I have finger on the pulse of today's youth culture.  While I myself am not a mother, my ""day job"" is daycare for a number of young kids.  They keep me young at heart and well informed what young people are interested in.  I didn't want to accept it at first, but it is true that The Fellowship of the Ring is a Boy's Movie.  Just because they threw in a few token female roles doesn't mean the producers really had the female crowd in mind.  I happen to think that Viggo Mortensen is rather studly, but don't tell my charges that!  I was made fun of for days.  (He does make for a handsome hero, you have to admit!)
But my problem with this movie lies in what I see as a major flaw in the genre:  fantasy.  No logic is required to get the heroes out of a jam.  Just cast a spell!  Hey, with Gandalf around, who needs creative storytelling?  If you think about it, never once are any of the ""good guys"" ever in any real perilous situations.  I want some real suspense, I want high drama.  Again, once the awe-inspiring special effects have become old-hat, these flaws really come to the fore.
Overall, recommended for rambunctious boys.",1046908800,,1653,4.29126213592233
1316322,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie could never be ideal, no matter how great it might be, because there is the book to compare it with. You cannot beat Tolkien at his own game.
However, I believe that this is about as close as it's possible to get. It's clear that the actor's have been chosen carefully (there is not one I feel doesn't fit his role). The SPIRIT is there; Tolkien wrote about noble and brave people (and other beings), which is exactly what we see in the film. What seemed to me a special treat was the episode in Moria (which was one of my favourite bits in the book as well) when after one of the hobbits drops the stone there is a silence and then the sound of drums. Of course, it's nowhere as good as in the book, but overall well dealt-with.

No worries!  As a film-maker, Peter Jackson's vision and planning are every bit as panoramic and meticulous in their media as were Tolkein's in the written word.  The hours of documentary showing ""The Making of..."" evoke awe rather than demystify the process. The extended version is well worth the extra moola.",1046476800,,755,4.913385826771654

1316373,5,B00003CWT6,"Movies almost always pale in comparison to the books upon which they were based.  For years I had hoped to see a movie adaptation of the Lord of the Rings, but always knew I would be disappointed, as a book with the scale of detail, character development, and creative input that this book posseses would only be watered down in a movie format.  However, Jackson has made a very admirable attempt - this movie is a real thriller.  There are many dialogue changes in the movie, such as quotes said by Gandalf in the book now being said by Aragorn in the movie, and many scenes have been left out or re-written, such as Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel.  We can excuse these however in order to enjoy the movie, as the changes were necessary to reduce it to a consumable timeframe (which could otherwise be 12 or more hours!).  I had originally bought the theatrical release DVD, and soon after, learned about the upcoming extended version.  As a result, I sold my first copy on eBay, and bought the extended when it came out. The extended version of the DVD is excellent, and many scenes have been extended, and some omitted scenses re-added.  The introduction of Boromir to Aragorn is a good example (didn't happen  in the book, but is neccessary in the movie, and was left out of the theatrical release), as is the departure of Lothlorien.  I'm not so interested in the extra two discs of ""Making Of..."" documentary, as if you've seen them once, that's enough.  But the extended version is a must have just for the extra scenes.

However, there are plenty of reviews to discuss the merits of this must-have DVD. My main reason for writing this review is to let readers know about a terrific ""easter egg"" (hidden feature, for DVD novices) on disk one. Go to the chapter menu, scroll down to The Council of Ellrond (chapter 27, the last chapter on the disk), then push the bottom arrow to scroll down to underneath this chapter and push enter.  This will access the easter egg, which is a really funny short spoof of the movie that played at the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, featuring Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar, and (bonus!) it's briefly introduced by director Peter Jackson.

Or when Elrond tells Aragorn that the skill of the elves can reforge the sword, if he would accept it as his destiny. And this is just the movie!

1316378,5,B00003CWT6,"OK! I admit it. I have loved the LOTR trilogy for decades! AND, I was disgusted by previous attempts to make this masterpiece into a movie, and had dispaired of anyone ever getting it 'right.' Guess what? They did it right! Perfectly cast, with attention to detail which boggles the mind, The Lord of the Rings/ Fellowship of the Ring extended edition is about to close to perfect as is humanly possible.
Starting with Bilbo's explanation of Hobbits (added in the extended edition) and their character, the film captures the character of JRR Tolkein's epic adventure. The Hobbits are extremely well cast and contrast well with the murkier world outside their protected little world of peace and bucolic quiet The 111 th birthday of Bilbo and the party for him draw the first distiction between this quite normal and (to us) understandable world and a much more dangerous one just beyond the edges of the Shire. Gandolph (Ian Mclean) is perhaps the best cast of all the characters in the film. Seemingly a simple player of magic fureworks and parlor tricks he rapidly emerges as one of the Powers of Middle Earth. The Nazgul Black Riders are suitably Evil and are the first hint that the easy world of the Hobbits is not the place to form an impression of the world. Strider the Ranger is not quite the larger than life tall dark heir to the Sea Kings in exile that he is in the book but he is engaging and develops as the leader as the story progresses. The interlude at Weathertop in the ruins of Amun Sul is well done and leads to the first diversion from the book (which is excusable.) The flight to the Ford and the defeat of the Nazgul by the power of the River protecting Rivendale was an extraordinary powerful scene. The movie next perfectly captures the feeling of fading grandure of the elves of middle earth. Earily beautiful, but ages old and not renewable, the Elves retain their majesty and magic but clearly to the viewer their time is near for their departure. The cast is augmented here with the introduction of the rest of the fellowship: Boromir from the last  bastion of the humans, The city-state of Gondor, Gimli the Dwarf from the lonly mountain kingdom, Legalos from the forest elves in Mirkwood. Together each of these representatives of the free peoples of Middle earth set forth to destroy the One Ring in the cracks of doom.
The world of middle earth expands for the hobbits as the journey becomes increasingly dangerous. We journey through the mines of Moria and find that the Kingdom of the Dwarves has been destroyed and occupied by trolls and Orcs. The special effects in these scenes are the best in the movie. The battle with the Cave Troll seems stunning as a visual and home theater sound delight, but the next scene tops even this. The Balrog, a Demon from the second age, is beyond even the elven power of legolas to defeat. Gandolph suddenly is revealed in his power and stands between the fellowship and possibly the most horriffic creature ever portayed on film. Gandolf defeats the monster but is lost to the fellowship. Lorien and Galadrial are visited next. In the extended edition, Galadrial is revealed as one of the Ring Bearers (one of the ""elven"" rings of power). Much expanded in the extended edition, the gifting scene is a moving movie experience. Leaving Lorien the fellowship travels down the great river Anduin and passes the great statues of the ""Kings of Old"" revealed as Aragorn's ancesters. This leads to the great closeing battle and the breaking of the fellowship. Sam and Frodo strike off ontheir own, Boromir is slain defending the hobbits, Pippin and Merry captured by Orcs and Gimli, Legalos and Aragorn leave hot on their trail. We end the movie as each group heads into their own part of the story.

1316428,5,B00003CWT6,"For once the hype was right. Peter Jackson's first part of the collossal LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is nothing short of a brilliant masterpiece, with incredible SFX, great characters, and staying true to J.R.R Tolkien's story while altering some of the book's elements to make it more suitable for film.
Deeply rooted in the fantasy genre, Fellowship of the Rings sees a young Hobbit Frodo Baggins inherit a powerful mystical ring from his cousin Bilbo Baggins. The ring, worn by the Dark Lord Sauron, has been passed down through many people until it reaches Bilbo. The mighty wizard Gandalf and a troop of dwarfes, elves and hobbits set out on a journey to destroy the dangerous ring by casting it back into the lava of Mt. Doom. But of course, there are bad guys, in the form of Saruman the White, played with relish by the brilliant Christopher Lee and his army of Orcs and Ringwaiths.
Director Peter Jackson (The Frighteners) has taken Tolkein's story and molded it into the perfect fantasy adventure. Some characters that were ciphers in the novel have been elevated to main characters, and while some purists may be upset over the loss of some characters, Jackson does do service to the story's originality. And the result? In a Hollywood summer of dissapointments, Fellowship was the standout, one of those rare films that come along like THE MATRIX that remind us of why we like movies in the first place. In comparison to that other cinema-changing trilogy known as STAR WARS, this is possibly the biggest competition George has ever come against. This, more than the recent SW prequels, wins out for it's action and acting. The fantastic casting of Christopher Lee, Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood are inspired. It's a sign that the actors have done their job when you stop saying Ian McKellen and start calling him Gandalf. As to wether the next chapter, THE TWO TOWERS will be even better is debatable, but since the whole trilogy was filmed as one big movie, the stunning film-making should continue and for once, an event rare these days, the sequel looks better than this one.
In a film as ambitious as this, all the key elements are in place, the masterful storytelling, Jackson's brilliant visionary direction, superb acting (especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo), incredible visual effects and the wealth of imagination from Tolkien's extraordinary tome. The supporting cast is great too, with John Rhys- Davies as Gimli the dwarf, Sean Bean as Boromir and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. The best facet about the whole thing is that it's so real that you really think that all this happened long ago. And that, more than anything else is a bonifide sign that this is not only one of the greatest cinema acheivements ever, but it's now entered into the cultural zeitgeist.
The film takes us where we've never been before, Tolkein's world of Wizards, elves, ringwaiths, orcs and all the other imaginative creatures on display are a thrill to watch. For such a huge scale, the use of CG is of course neccesary, and like STAR WARS, every incredible vista is truly breath-taking and the visuals are incredible, utilising state-of-the-art technology to create entire landscapes, creatures and battles. The most outstanding scene, where our intrepid fellowship travels into the mines of Mordor is a fantastic tour-de-force of incredible movie magic. The seamless blend of FX and amazing cinematography is absolutly breath-taking. Howard Shore's brooding score adds another layer of excellence to the myraid of adventurous escapism. There are problems; the film may not sit well with purists and the ending feels somewhat of an anti- climax after the climactic Mordor, but we all know that the real battles are yet to come. This is a film that takes you far beyond your imagination. What lies ahead for THE TWO TOWERS will no doubt be even more amazing and draw the millions of eager fans out once again to witness the second part to one of the most amazing films ever made.
For people who managed to hold off the temptation to but the first DVD release, this platinum series ""extended"" edition is worth the wait. Discs 1 and 2 have a unique version of LOTR with over 30 minutes of cut footage incorporated into the film and new music scored by Howard Shore. The extended scenes range from breath-taking ( More views of Lothlorien) to perfuctonary (Bilbo's introduction). But for the most part, the added half hour is fascinating stuff for affeciandos, and while the re-instated scenes slow the pace sometimes, it fills in the gaps and makes for an even more fascinating experience.  Also included are four feature-length audio commentaries by director and writers, the design team, the production team, and the cast featuring more than 30 participants.
Discs 3 and 4 contain some of the most comprehensive extra material ever on DVD. Disc 3 has the doco ""From Book to Vision"": Adapting the book into a screenplay & planning the film, Designing and building Middle-earth, storyboards to pre-visualization, Weta Workshop visit including creatures and miniatures from the film, an awesome interactive map of Middle-earth tracing the journey of the Fellowship, an interactive map of New Zealand (yay!) highlighting the location scouting process, galleries of art and slideshows with commentaries by the artists, guided tour of the wardrobe department footage from early meetings, moving storyboards and pre-visualization reels.
DISC 4 has the doco ""From Vision to Reality"": Bringing the characters to life, ""A day in the life of a hobbit"", principal photography: Stories from the set, scale: Creating the illusion of size, galleries of behind-the-scenes photographs and personal cast photos, editorial and visual effects multi-angle progressions and sound design demonstration. One could point out that perhaps there are one too many different releases of LOTR on DVD, but fans love the extra-extra stuff. One of the best, if not THE best DVD releases ever!

I love Fanatsy films alot actually i'm upsest with that genre this movie featured sequences that I would never had thoght could fit you see many of the past fantasy films that I have seen like steven spielberg's Hook and Ridley Scott's Legend don't have so much the adventure type and the action of course i understand that these movies were made in a time when it was not possible to create vast scenery and creatures with alot of detail like today with computers but still they were great movies with awsome storytelling and enjoyable music and i do recomend these movies to as thay made an impact in my life they made me have a love for these kinds of storytelling. The fellowship of the ring had all the kind of stuff I love to see in movies weather it is the score or the special effects it all blends in beautifuly. When I went to go see the first one I knew that I had taken a risk in going to see something that I was not familiar with but I'm a risk taker so I went and saw it after I was in shock and awe by the whole movie I became upsest with the whole Lord of the rings thing. I could not tell you how anticipated to get this DVD I was in I just had to get my hands on it and I have never gotten like this with any movie but this one was so great it was very well put together and well I just thoght it was really cool.

While the picture quality is excellent on this DVD, it is not quite up to ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" quailty. Nevertheless, the transfer is very well done.
However, the soundtrack is what makes this DVD really shine. The DTS-ES 6.1 soundtrack is simply amazing. The surround speakers are continuously active throughout the movie, the LFE (low frequency effects) will have your subwoofer jumping, and the musical score will take over your emotions. The soundtrack is like nothing you have heard before. During any battle scene, you'll be impressed at what your home theater can really do. And since this DVD is mastered on the ""hot"" side, you'll notice that you'll have the volume nob lower than what you normally have it at.
The extras are also very well done. They provide many hours of information on how they made ""The Lord of the Rings"" come to life, and even include a hidden ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" trailer! And not the mention the MTV spoof, very funny!
Overall, this is a DVD to own. It has excellent audio and video quality as well as tons of extras. Definitely a must-have DVD!",1045699200,,1276,4.6755555555555555

THREE!! and that being the case i suggest watching this movie at your own risk.  what i really am most disappointed about in this movie is that it was really long . . . and i wasn't expecting that.  i just wish i was warned about that. and i haven't seen the sequel and and don't know when i will . . . only after it comes on cable a couple of times . . . because the sequel is longer than this one,1045526400,,477,3.6116504854368934

This should have won an Oscar for best picture, actor, director, and even supporting actor. All of the acting was great, and everyone was perfect for their role. The only problem of this DVD are the theatrical trailers: there weren't any. In the two-disc DVD, there were theatrical traiers, and all of the TV commercials. That was great and should have been on the four-disc set. What's the point of having four discs for one DVD, if all the  special features the buyer really wants aren't there? Hopefully, the four-disc extended version for The Two Towers will have all of the previews and commercials. Overall, I would recommend this DVD to everyone.",1045440000,,740,4.6923076923076925

The added bits to the story are important and they don't seem to increase the length of the movie (like some directors' cuts do).  They are melded seamlessly into the movie and improve the flow of the movie.  Its too bad that movie studios don't like it when movies get too long, because this is the version that should have been released in the theater.
When Two Towers comes out, I'm not even going to bother with the theatrical release.  I'll just wait for the extended edition.",1045440000,,754,4.2377622377622375

1316487,5,B00003CWT6,"Although not quite as successful as the ""Star Wars"" films, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a very good motion picture that puts the recent entries into the fantasy genre such as ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"".
A young hobbit, Frodo (Elijah Wood), reluctantly inherits the task of bearing a beautiful golden ring that has a dark mind of its own. There, he, his friend Sam (Sean Astin), wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) and two other hobbits, Merry (Billy Boyd) and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan) embark on a long and perilous journey to destroy the evil ring in the fires of Mount Doom.
First - let me state that I have never been a fan of the Tolkien books myself, they were overlong and never seemed to gather any momentum (plus the fact that I have only read 'The Hobbit' and only half of 'Fellowship' before I abandoned the books altogether). Nevertheless, the movie adaptation is more stirring, more exciting, and indefinitely more enchanting than what the books conjured up.
Never has a movie been so perfectly cast. Elijah Wood does an exceptionally good job as Frodo, Viggo Mortensen effortlessly captures the rugged toughness of Aragorn, and the other actors do a fine job as well. The person who outstrips everyone in the movie (including Cate Blanchett) is the mind-blowing performance of Ian McKellan who immerses himself effectively in the role of the wise, wizened Gandalf the Gray - earning himself a deserved Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.
""The Lord of the Rings"" boasts strong directing by Peter Jackson, stunning cinematography and astounding visual effects that makes us believe that we're actually in Middle-earth. Never had I had been so breathlessly entranced.
The writers - Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson - effortlessly condense the 365-page book into a smooth, intelligent script. Some of the liberalties that they have taken with the movie are not as obvious in the book (such as the fireworks display at Bilbo's birthday celebration), they're more like something Tolkien would have added. Alas, despite all the lavish praise, ""The Lord of the Rings"" loses steam and momentum during the final 30 minutes and character threads are left open - not to mention that the sudden dropoff is especially anticlimatic. Nevertheless, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a breathless, enrapturous piece of modern cinema and holds up extremely well after repeated viewings.
The special edition 4-disc DVD collection is truly a special edition of the film, it is packaged in a special box and there is a lavishly illustrated booklet telling where you want to go. On the first two discs there is a special extended version of the film (30 minutes longer from the theatrical version), with missing/extended scenes seamlessly integrated into the whole, which breathes more life and understanding of the picture. This version gives a whole new meaning to the picture, but it's no less entrancing or diminished.
In the special features section, there are three audio commentaries that you can listen to over the film. One has the commentary track of the cast, the next a commentary from the visual effects department and the final commentary from Peter Jackson and fellow screenwriters.
The other two discs contain documentaries on how the movie was made and how long it took. Also included are documentaries on the actors during their filming duration in New Zealand... all of them are worth watching, just to see how the trilogy of films were made and the labor of love it took while getting there.
Buy it - it is worth the money to pay for this lavish 4 disc DVD set of this film. Never since the release of ""Beauty and the Beast"" on DVD came out, have DVDs been so grand and lavish before. Good movie - fantasic DVD. Either way, you will be pleased.",1045180800,,3761,4.896551724137931
1316488,5,B00003CWT6,"It's like this-
This movie is a visual masterpiece of epic porportions. It has an amazing cast, who do amazing jobs as actors. The crew who did the pre- and post-production work should have been payed a great deal more for the work they put in. Peter Jackson was okay, even though the books direct themselves. To put it kindly though, he surpasses George Lucas and Steven Spielberg any day with his limited use of CGI special effects.
This version of the film is a must see if you wish to see ""The Two Towers."" If you've read the books, you're okay. This version helps to explain the Lembas bread, amongst other things.
Also, it adds more of a story to what we saw in the theatres of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" It gives amazing insight to the characters, and helps to fill in certain timeline gaps.
The documentaries are amazing, and are a must see for book/movie fans alike.
Finally, if you buy this, check out the Easter Eggs. There is an MTV spoof of the Council of Elrond, as well as a full trailer for ""The Two Towers.""

Flawless victory and then some. What I most enjoyed was the cast interviews and commentary especially from Christopher Lee who is a great Tolkien fan. To hear him speak about the project was so cool. I was also blown away by the Weta Workshop features and the sheer enormity of their tasks.

One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them""
Extract from ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".
Stories may come and go but it takes an extraordinary tale to excite the world and bring moments of sheer magic to generations, decade after decade. Tolkiens classic story has finally hit the screens with the first part in the trilogy ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". The other two parts to follow, one later on this year in December and the final part following in 2003. Peter Jackson the films director, himself an avid Tolkien fan, took on a huge task in bringing this literary masterpiece to the big screen. Surprising, as it may seem, others were not keen to invest in this moment in history and Jackson ended up funding virtually the whole project from his own personal funds. Fortunately the movie is proving a huge success and Jackson will receive a nice financial return for all his hard work, but that was never the reason behind his motivation. Only a true believer could do this epic tale justice. Has he succeeded? So far, yes! Will he continue to do so in the following parts? Only time will tell but I believe this trilogy will prove to be just as popular if not more so, than the books from whence it came. It is difficult to review one third of a story, I will however, do my best!
In the land of Middle earth a race of creatures known as hobbits merrily go about their business. Most of which consists of entertaining each other, eating, smoking and enjoying a quiet and comfortable life. Leaving adventuring to the hardier races in the land. This is of course, until one hobbit Bilbo Baggins, goes on an adventure by accident and through this journey discovers a ring. This ring contains immense power far beyond its more obvious ability to make the wearer invisible. Should this ring fall in to the wrong hands it would cause chaos and disaster throughout the land.
One evil and vile creature seeks the ring more than all others, Sauron the Dark Lord. Should he obtain the ring then all the land will suffer. Only one thing can be done to make sure this never happens. The ring must be destroyed in the fires of the Mount Doom. Responsibility for the destruction of the ring falls heavily upon the shoulders of Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's favourite nephew.
This is where the story begins in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Frodo must travel across the land with a loyal band of friends and protectors. Facing all manner of evil creatures and life threatening situations. Constantly being chased by Saurons elite soldiers, the ""Ring wraiths"" Frodo frequently proves that strength and courage can often come from the unlikeliest of heroes.
Part one of the trilogy focuses on the group sent to protect Frodo, how they meet and bond with eachother through adversity on the first part of the journey. In parts two and three the story moves on to more epic proportions!
The cast is a mixture of new young talented actors mixed with older more experienced thespians. The lead role of Frodo is filled by Elijah Wood, a relative newcomer to acting. His character is guided on his journey by Gandalf an elderly wizard, played by Ian McKellen. McKellens experience as an actor shines through and it is obvious that his influence evokes outstanding performances from the rest of the cast. Jackson deliberately avoided using big box office names such as Bruce Willis, Sean Connery, etc as leading actors, enabling the viewer to focus on the characters. Considered commercial suicide by many, Jackson is proved correct in his choices. I was able to see the characters as Tolkien described without thinking about previous characters portrayed by the cast in other films. Established actors do crop up in more minor roles, Ian Holm as Bilbo, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, etc but McKellen is the only real star to feature in the film. Jackson took a chance and it paid off!",1045094400,,3913,4.680696661828737
1316551,5,B00003CWT6,"The Platinum Series Extended Edition DVD of the Fellowship of the Rings sets a new standard for fantasy filmmakers, novel-to-script adaptations, and DVD content.  Enough ink (magnetic and otherwise) has been spilled over what a great adaptation Peter Jackson and crew have created that I don't need to praise the movie any more.
Jackson goes the extra mile with this DVD by providing over 30 minutes of scenes, both new ones and extensions of others that address more of the book's story and flesh out character depth.  Boromir in particular is given more screentime, and his actions and motivations are both ominous and noble.  The extension of the Council of Elrond and the Gifting scene also add a great deal more meaning to each scene.  I don't know about you, but I would gladly watch the extended version in the theatre.  Maybe they'll re-release it, that would rule.
Where this DVD really shines is in the two discs full of behind-the-scenes info.  In extremely thorough fashion, these discs address the books and their author, going into his motivations and influences and his personality, all of which shaped the Lord of the Rings into the story that so many people love.  Next, they address the long journey of a live-action LotR movie from concept to reality, as well as the difficulty of adapting the books to film and the near-constant script updates that occurred during the filming.
The most stunning aspect of the special features is the massive effort this movie required and got out of the special effects and art direction teams, from renowned Tolkien Artists John Howe and Alan Lee to the young and talented designers at Weta in New Zealand.  The scope of their vision is of course reflected in the beauty of the film itself, but being able to see how it came to be and the sheer volume of work these people (many of them young kids working to make a name for themselves) undertook successfully makes one appreciate the film all that much more.
The actors are all quite articulate and fun to watch as well, and many of their anecdotes are laugh-out-loud funny (such as Sean ""Sam Gamgee"" Astin playing Air Traffic Control on a windy NZ peak).  We get to see a little bit of everything that it took to make the movies, and we get to see that the actors had as great a time doing it as we did watching it.
In all, if you liked the movie, I cannot recommend this DVD version highly enough.  The extra footage alone is worth the price of admission, but the special features almost feel like stealing with the amount of content they provide to you.
Thanks, Peter, we're already waiting for the Two Towers DVD.",1045008000,9,2623,4.658008658008658
1316552,5,B00003CWT6,"Excellent, excellent, excellent! This is what everyone has been waiting for since the release of the animated version, which was also quite good. Elijah Wood couldn't have been replaced by another to play Frodo. One of the most astonishing films of my time and generation! Peter Jackson has done it!",1045008000,,299,5.0
1316553,5,B00003CWT6,"On second thought, I'll keep that one for the bonus material, which is totally different from the 3 extra disks (including the Nat Geo special) in this set.  About the bonus material in the extended edition:  I spent an extended weekend swimming through the ocean of material, but just the other day, I was surprised to find ""new"" stuff that I had missed before.  I'm wondering how they are going to match this effort when they release ""the two towers"" DVD.
The extended/new scenes alone are worth getting this set, if you are a LOTR fan.  They chopped a lot of important stuff to get the theatrical release under 3 hours.  I have no reason to view the chopped version ever again.
Alright, alright, I'll admit it.  All I really wanted was the really cool book ends.  They're too small and light for books (and not flat-sided, like a functional bookend) but it looks cool on my entertainment center holding this dvd set, the NatGeo special, the theatrical version, and the 3 animated LOTR/Hobbit dvds.
OK, so Peter Jackson re-wrote a lot of the story to make it into a movie (what's all this Arwen business?) but I'm rating this DVD set as 5* on it's merits.  I'm not rating the movie (4*)",1045008000,,1188,4.544600938967136
1316554,5,B00003CWT6,"Like all the rest of you, I bought this DVD when it first came out.  The original release was just as the movie.
  Now, Peter Jackson has released the Platinum Edition with much added footage.  Especially, The Shire part of the film has much added to it; and we really get to know those characters better.  I bought it even though I had the original in both wide and full screen, and am not sorry in the least.  You also get 2 discs full of extras on just about everything in the film, plus a National Geographic DVD on LOTR's New Zeeland.  I just have to add that you get a beautiful collectors' box; but even better, you get actual stone statue bookends of the human kings of old from the ismus the group paddled through on their quest.
  You won't go wrong buying this.",1044921600,,772,4.268965517241379
1316555,5,B00003CWT6,"I can't say enough good things about this movie. Firstly, if you are considering which version of this movie to purchase, I would recommend that you get the extended version. I know that Peter Jackson has to keep the theatrical release under 3 hours for the sake of the box office, but the additional material here is fantastic. It is seemlessly added to the film and upon watching it, you will feel like it was a more complete story than the original version.
That being said, I don't think that I've seen a more impressive use of the cinematic form in many years. This is a story that utilizes everthing that makes the movies magical. From the sheer size of the story, to the makeup, to the special effects, to the cinematography, it practically single handedly restored my faith in the ability of Hollywood to produce a quality product that is not only entertaining but visionary.
I think that it was great disservice to Peter Jackson that he was not given the best director Oscar last year. I'm sure that he will be denied that honor again this year, but I can truthfully say that I believe that his achievment with these first two movies is on par with what Coppola achieved with the first two Godfather movies. Obviously they are very different movies, but the mastery of the cinematic form is very obvious in both. The storytelling is magnificent and I am sure that when the trilogy is done, it will be remembered as one of the greatest achievements in film history.
If you have ever read the books, then you know what a thankless task this was. There seemed to be no human way to convey what was on the written page. Peter Jackson has not only given us Toklkien's vision, but has turned it into pure magic on film.
I hope that he eventually wins the Academy Award for the third film in this triology because it would be a shame for this kind of achievement to go unrewarded.
Go out and buy it. You won't be dissapointed. If you have a widescreen TV and a good surround sound system, you will be treated to one of the best presentations that you have ever seen or heard. It's a real demo disc to show off any system.

The extra scenes are totally finished and edited to production release quality and emersed completely with the film. You cannot tell from the images and sound that the extra scenes were not in the original theatrical release. There is an extra hour of new footage.

When the action really begins is when they go to Rivendel (where the elves live) and that is when the fellowship is made. The fellowship has 1 wizard,4 hobbits,2 human men,1 dworf,and 1 elf. Legolas is the elf who like all elves is talented when it comes to the bow and arrow. Gimley is the dworf who is swift with an axe and is very small. Boremiere is 1 of the men who is good with a sword and shield. Arragon-Strider is the other man who is good with a sword and the bow and arrow. Gandolf is the wizard who is the only one who knows the way to Mordor. Mary and Pippen are the hungry hobbits that always mess up but will do anything to help the fellowship. Sam is the scared hobbit that is best friends with Frodo. Frodo is the main charecter who holds the ring and will do anything to destroy the ring. This is a long movie that may get slow at parts but it is worth it but if you want an all out action movie with pretty much no slow parts, that is The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers.

1316600,5,B00003CWT6,"There are few high fantasy or serious fantasy movies in existence.  Of those that exist, even fewer are very good.  ""Conan the Barbarian"" might be included in this very narrow genre, as well as Sword & Sorcery.  ""Ladyhawke"" and ""Excalibur"" would probably both fit as well.  In fact, many have considered ""Ladyhawke"" to be the best high fantasy movie prior to ""Lord of the Rings"".
""Lord of the Rings"" seamlessly blends indoor and outdoor sets with special effects to create the most incredibly believable fantasy world ever, setting a new standard of excellence for fantasy movies. The cinematography gets five stars plus.
The actors were well-chosen for their parts.  There has been some criticism of the humor that was injected into the movie both from the choice of actors and some of the lines.  However, Tolkien had a very wry (and British) sense of humor that was frequently expressed in his novels.  To have avoided that humor would have been to avoid one aspect of Tolkien.
The special effects in this movie have set a new state-of-the-art. The flow between special effects and set effects is invisible. Probably the most evident special effect to me was the Balrog, which, while very good, still had somewhat of an animated feel to it. The effect was still good enough that you felt the fear of the characters and for the characters. ""Run!"" you wanted to yell...okay, I did yell run. The special effects are so good that I want to move to Middle Earth!
The translation from the book to the movie was performed very well.  The visualizations enhance the book well, and new dimensions are brought out in the movie that are difficult to visualize in the book.  As always, the book and the movie are different, but they are different mediums as well.  I was very impressed with how well the essence of the story was captured without trying to exactly mimic the books.  I think Tolkien would have been impressed with the realization.
This series of movies will be able to do what all other movies have not, tell a single story of incredible scope in 3 separate 3-hour movies, each released a year part. Only made-for-tv miniseries have previously had the luxury of such extended length.
When I reached the end of this movie, my only disappointment was that I had to wait for two years to see it to the end.
This movie is a must-have for any serious fan of fantasy, and for fans of Tolkien. Fantasy has for many years taken a backseat to the development of ever-better science fiction movies. With the release of this movie, the opportunity to create movies to match the vision of other great fantasy books can at last be realized.",1044403200,,2633,4.6898047722342735
1316601,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is one of my favorite movies.  Clocking in at just under three hours, Fellowship never stops rolling, whether it be in the green pastures of the Shire, the beautiful city of Rivendell, or the dark, evil mines of Moria.  Based on Tolkien's novel, this film by Peter Jackson should not be missed.
 The movie tells the story of the One Ring, the ring that could destroy mankind.  It centers around Frodo Baggins, the nephew of Bilbo Baggins, made famous by The Hobbit.  Upon hearing from Gandalf the Grey what the ring really is, Frodo sets off on an adventure to destroy the One Ring in the fiery pits of Mount Doom.  Frodo battles the Ringwraiths, countless Orcs, and even himself as the ring tries to take him over.  The nine Ringwraiths are truly great villains without even saying a word.  Even at three hours, the film is a nonstop ride through the Middle Earth.
 Great roles for Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Kate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean as Boromir, a man greatly tempted by the powers of the One Ring.  Excellent musical score, incredible scenery, and likable characters.  The DVD is unbelievable with too many extras to even count.

It should light up and you can select it. It is quite a funny scene from an MTV awards show (I think). It is a parody of the Council of Elrond and it is introduced by Peter Jackson.
Enjoy this secret scene.",1044403200,,433,3.9885057471264367
1316604,5,B00003CWT6,"Chances are, if you're considering purchasing the[$$$] Extended Edition of ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", you've already seen the theatrical release, thus, I won't comment on that release, since you can draw your own conclusions on the motion picture yourself. However, I will venture to say this is THE best DVD ever.
""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition"" contains over 30 minutes of added footage, which certainly adds to the picture as a whole. Nothing completely new (as in subplots, or new characters) is really introduced, rather the existing story and characters are fleshed out a bit. Highlights of the added footage include the elaborated Hobbit introduction, and the bestowing of gifts to the Fellowship by the dwarves. As far as supplemental material goes, there is a RIDICULOUS amount. One could easily spend 48 hours watching all of the featurettes, and perusing the wealth of images and text on board the discs. I have only listened to one of the commentary tracks (the cast), and highlights from the other three, but all seem very informative, and are actually narrated clueing in the viewer as to who is talking and what he/she has to do with the production. The featurettes on the supplemental discs, especially the ones on locations and special effects are especially well-done, and could easily be mistaken for a PBS documentary, being so in-depth and high budget. There are quite a few other featurettes, including several on Tolkien himself, and all are worth watching.
As expected, New Line has given ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring EE"" a great transfer and sound mix, boasting full DTS-ES 6.1, and flawless picture quality. There is really nothing to mention about the beauty of the video, since one easily forgets about the quality, and becomes immersed in the movie. The sound will also not disappoint, easily rivaling my previous DVD sound champ, ""Saving Private Ryan"".
The packaging is also quite nice. It consists of a heavy cardboard/vinyl cover (that is quite large), and a pull out four disc sleeve.
All in all, ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring EE"" surpasses the previous DVD release in every respect, and is certainly worth the cost, whatever it may be.",1044316800,,2259,4.9317585301837275
1316605,5,B00003CWT6,"I think it's needless to say this is one of the most exciting films ever produced. I would like to concentrate my comment on the Appendices in the Extended Edition in DVD.
Peter Jackson and his team present the delightful adventure of doing the three Ring films. Starting with a Vision by doing an extensive analysis of Tolkien's writings, the Appendices present every step in the film production of this Middle-Earth saga. Every step is carefully presented in one of the best documents of contemporary film-making. The Appendices present the struggles in generation of the script; the artistic design; the design of orcs, trolls, goblins, and fiery demons; the design of minatures and sets; the digital effects; the production of weapons -fake and real-; the selection of locations, and  all other steps of this magnificent feat of craftsmanship that is the production of The Lord of the Rings.

I must write that this box set of Lord of the Ring: Fellowship of the Ring takes DVD's abilities further than any DVD set I own.
Be prepare to spend several enjoyable evenings viewing some fantastic and in-depth ""making of"" material. This DVD goes even further than the standard 30-minute short by breaking the entire film making process into many 50 minutes in-depth and fascinating documentaries.
The DVD's are also loaded with a vast store of illustrations and sketches plus on-set still images.
The menus utilize LOTR illustrator Alan Lee's beautiful sketches and paintings to set a wonderful mood when browsing the content. (Similar to browsing the pages of a hand-illustrated old volume that the viewer has tucked away in an ancient library of forgotten works.)
And I also found the commentaries by the actors to be very enlightening and very amusing.
The interactive map of Middle Earth was extremely useful in tracking the journey and plot of the film from one region to another. A very clever and welcome bonus!

1316647,5,B00003CWT6,"The source material for The Lord of the Rings is among the most beloved stories in literature, so it's a noble undertaking by Peter Jackson and his team to have adapted it for the screen in the first place. That he achieves it with so much of the books' details intact is amazing. The performances are majestic, the cinematography lush, and the special effects are stunning. In short, it's the first truly ""epic"" epic I've seen in awhile.
However, I'll admit that while the attention to detail is commendable, there seems to be something missing in terms of emotion. The saga, the characters, all are archetypal, as was ""Star Wars,"" but while Star Wars had a dash of modernism and humor to enable a viewer to connect with the story on a ""you are there"" basis, the legend of The Lord of the Rings seems so removed and almost exclusionary by nature (""they"" are the fellowship, a band we are allowed to view without feeling like we're a part of the kinship) that I felt slightly wanting at the end -- not for more spectacle, of which there's plenty, but for more of a personal window into the story, so that I might better care about and appreciate it.
Even without that element, the movie is still a marvel to watch and highly rewarding from the popcorn level on up. The behind the scenes extras on the disc are fully encompassing as well, and fans of the story will doubtlessly have no trouble spending hours dwelling on every minute detail, as Tolkien and Jackson would intend.",1044230400,,1477,4.556390977443609

It's part like watching a Discovery Channel Behind the Scenes Special and part like being able to watch all the people who created this world tell you how they did it.

1316651,5,B00003CWT6,"I'm so glad I waited almost three (painful) months to buy the Extended Edition instead of the theatrical version. I think the DVD cut of the film it's a hundred times better than the original release. The latter, although three hours long, felt rushed when you compared it with the pacing of the book. Now, with all the new sequences and a few more lines in the scenes we've already seen, it's an even more faithful adaptation of JRR Tolkien's world to the big screen.
Discs 1 & 2 contain the 3:30 hour film split in two. This is the only thing I must complain about. It looks like the major drawback LaserDisc is coming back from the grave (they did the same to ""The Godfather II""). What ever happened to ""DVDs have a storage capacity of over 4 hours of superior quality video""? Yes, I know, maybe there wasn't enough room for so many audio tracks (Dolby Digital, DTS and commentaries) and so many cool menus, and maybe the only way to preserve the (very) high quality of audio and video of this movie was to separate it in two, but I really hate having to get up from my comfortable sofa, turn the lights on and change the disc. They better come up with some kind of solution before the Extended Edition DVD of ""The Two Towers"" is ready.
Discs 3 & 4 contain around 7 hours of behind-the-scenes documentaries and demonstrations that go into every little detail of the production stage, from conceptual art to the premiere day in Middle-Earth (yes, there was a place in this planet called ""Middle-Earth"" in December 2001... watch the documentary!) Being a die-hard fan of Star Wars it's very difficult for me to say this but... the extra material in these discs outdoes, by a really-truly-very-long shot, everything in the DVDs of Episodes I and II together. There, I said it.
I truly recommend the Extended Edition DVD over the original theatrical release DVD. Save up just a few extra bucks and go for it.",1044057600,,1907,4.546511627906977

THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE. THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS THE GREATEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN. THE TWO TOWERS IS ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING. IN FACT, THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS BEYOND CRITICISM. IT'S PERFECT.  Whew, ok. I would apologize about that, but I shall not, because it's how I really feel. The Lord of the Rings has touched my heart in a way I can't exlpain. The score by Howard Shore is so beautiful. It makes the grand caverns of Moria all the more wondrous, and it justly expresses the spectacle of The Fellowship. The Balrog! Oh, the balrog! He's so beautiful and hideous and scary. Peter Jackson has hit the jackpot! The visual effects in this movie are amazing. The performances are great. Ian McKellen as Gandalf... PERFECT! Christopher Lee as Saruman... PERFECT. Gimli, Boromir, Frodo, Sam, everyone is all cast perfectly. I love this movie. Let that be helpful to you. This movie will not disappoint you. And the lesson in this movie - stay away from power, stay away from industrialism! Love the earth!!! Love Tolkien's work!!! I love the Lord of the Rings!!! Go watch it now!!! Then you'll understand what I'm talking about. I'm not crazy!!! AAHHHHH!!!!!",1043971200,,1382,4.5951417004048585
1316692,5,B00003CWT6,"The extended version of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring definitely would have won the Best Picture Oscar for 2001 if it was played in theaters.  Peter Jackson did say that he was satisfied with the theatrical version, but I believe he was saying that from a movie goers standpoint.  What would a majority of people say to watching a 3 1/2 hour movie?  Hence the decision for the extended version was made to be brought out.
  The story is more comprehensible and more enjoyable thanks to the 30 minutes of extra (much needed) footage.  Many things added are things you needed to know about so you can understand some key parts in the Two Towers.  This version is so good, it is the only movie of this kind of length that you wouldn't mind watching again.  This is also one of the very few movies were you get the sense of how much dedication,love and care was put into this film, which is a first for me.  They even had Howard Shore, after winning the Oscar for Best Original Score for the original film, come and orchestrate new music for the new footage.  At times you get the sense of seeing a new film.
  For those who haven't seen the film in any of it's forms,  this movie is great for action buffs and drama critiques.  it is one of the very few films that combine flash with substance.  For you special effects people, these are by far the cleanest, most believable you will ever see, surpassing Star Wars: Attack of the Clones surely.  The attention to detail is astounding.  For you drama folks, the combination of great acting, (especially from Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, and Sean Bean) and great music blend to give great emotion and character (just see the parts near the end with Sean Bean and you will feel the emotion).  This by far is one of the best movies ever.  Watch it, you won't be disappointed, I promise.",1043884800,,1851,4.439169139465875
1316693,5,B00003CWT6,"This took a great fantasy film and made it a masterpiece that will truly be ageless and timeless. Probably the BEST addition to the film is the new intro wich starts much like the book. A simple introduction to the hobbits. The best part is that this version is not so rushed. The story takes time to question, talk, and truly care about it's characters. You learn more about certain motivations and you get to sit back and enjoy the movie on a whole nother level beyond the talk/action/run sort of thing the theatrical release seemed to be stuck in. Over all it's much more enjoyable and truly a cinematic masterpiece. i LOVE being able to absorb the richness of the Shire for 45 minutes before leaving it for the long arduous journey to destroy the ring. Almost all the locations are extended allowing the viewer to enjoy the richness of Tolkiens world and how Peter brings it to life so vividly.
If for some reason you don't like widescreen. You really should do your research. Every DVD has an option (Anamorphic widescreen) that will stretch out the picture without losing the sides. Full Screen does alot of things with the picture to fit it unaturally into the TV Square size.  You really miss alot when it's Full Screen. The black bars on your screen are only their because TV was never made to show Cinematic films. Thanks to Widescreen TV's that will no longer be a problem. But please, before you bash it, find out what your missing and how DVD (using Anamorphic Widescreen) has given every movie the ability to fill up the whole screen, even square tv's, but importanly WITHOUT losing picture.
I hope that The Two Towers is as enhanced with the extra footage in the Expanded Edition as this one was. It's a shame that the best versions of each film will rarely if ever see the light of a true theatre experience.",1043884800,14,1824,4.560975609756097

IOW, the editing could have been a little smoother. But the added scenes do fill in some of story missed in the theatrical version...The sighting of the Wood Elves...more of Gandalf's
fears of Moria...the fight with the Balrog at the Bridge of Khazad Dum (it seemed longer?)...The gifts given to the broken Fellowship by Galadriel...gifts which should become significant

I don't own the original version, but by just comparing the names of the featurettes you know that they didn't put those from the original version into the extended version.

However, there is a lot of movie-making-magic to explore in the DVDs.  I really enjoyed watching the costume design and weapons design featurettes.

There seem to be alot of action/adventure/fantasy fans, however, that are picking fault with the DVD for rediculous reasons.
1. It is too long.
The LOTR is a BIG story, in many ways.  It is simply not possible to fit the whole thing into a neat 1 1/2 hour feature.  I for one found that the 3 1/2 hours flew by.
2. It is in widescreen.  I just do not understand why anyone would want to watch anyone elses version of the film other than the director's (i.e the pan and scan editor's).  Why would you also want to loose 50% of the shot - especially that wonderful New Zealand scenery.  Call yourselves film buffs - GO AND GET A WIDE-SCREEN TV!!!
This DVD is absolutely gorgeous.  The casting is spot on, the script is faithful, the acting is magnificent, the cinematography is superb.
The fact that Peter Jackson has brought this ""unfilmable"" story to the screen and it in not a travesty is remarkable.  The fact that the film is remarkable is miraculous.

1316768,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay, I admit it:  I'm a big old, giant size, gooberific fanboy geek, and once I saw the second of Peter Jackson's LOTR movies, I rushed to the nearest computer terminal and bought the deluxe 4-DVD ""remix"" version of the first film.  Man, am I glad I did.  This film, in all it's various manifestations, is a fascinating study in how new media have adapted to meet different audiences.  When I saw the first film in the theatres, I thought, ""WOW."", but I still felt some nagging doubts about what I had seen. The film was spectacular, but felt like it was missing a little bit here, and a little bit there.  Well, it turnsout that all the things I was looking for were in the film, but were skillfully nipped out to make the big screen version a physically-endurable event.  The other, longer, more nuanced film is one that was made to be seen at one's own pace in the comfort of our hobbit-like little homes.  So there it is: the little links in the plot, the extra shadings of character, the elf-y stuff, the snug splendor of the Shire, the extra connective tissue that makes this film move along at a slower, more deliberate keel, and which makes all nagging doubts vanish like some subtle magical spell.  Both versions make sense -- the theatrical release felt just about right -- my attention didn't wander, and my [bottom] didn't hurt when I headed for home.  Then the DVD version felt more satisfying and has all the geely behind-the-scenes stuff that I'm still watching now.

The story is smoother, the expanded character development makes more sense, and the wonder that is middle earth draws you in far deeper than the original film. The extended version a rare treat -- it's longer but yet  feels faster than the original while magically also seeming more complete.
The small price to pay for these improvements is having the movie spread over two DVD disks instead of a single one. Frankly it's worth it. A wonderful film to own and cherish, I'd recommend it to anyone who loved the theatrical release.",1043625600,3,623,4.663636363636364
1316770,5,B00003CWT6,"There are so many reasons to own this version I can't touch on them all here. The new 30 minutes of footage are used well. It  slows the pace of the film down, making the film feel less frantic, so that when you're in the Shire, you get to dwell there a bit longer, absorbing the feel of the place and getting to know more about the peaceful ways of the Hobbits. Much more detail is given about Middle Earth, taking it a step closer to Tolkien's vision.
Lothlorien, which seemed  all but glossed over in the theatrical release, is seen as it should be from afar, golden and mysterious, and  we're given the added pleasure of spending a bit more time there. At last we get to see the gifts of the elves, which  makes sense later when they are used. It is wonderful to see each of the Fellowship's interaction with Galadriel (Cate Blanchett,) who is given considerably more screen time.
The hints of Tolkien's fondness of songs and the shots of the band of  hobbits and men sharing meals around the fire serve to fill in the feel of the books,as well as deepen character development. Both Aragorn and Borimir's character are more fleshed out by the added scenes.
Then there are scenes of great beauty, such as the Sam and Frodo's first glimpse of the elves, which may not advance the plot, but are breathtakingly gorgeous.
This is a rich, must-have item to watch over and over. Image and sound are first rate.  An added bonus is the appendices, which are voluminous and informative.

But there is something that I must say, it's not Tolkien, this was Hollywood's work.  Hollywood has had a long track record of ruining History, not to mention novels.  Tolkien would be so upset for he spent 12 years on his work. But to slap it on the screen in tree is so upsetting.  I belive that somethings are best to be read and imagined that seen.

The expanded version has 30 extra minutes to the original theatrical release. I didnot see the original so I really cannot compare the two but the longer movie gives a lot of depth to the story. There were many creappy characters and violent scenes that may be disturbing to small children. I had a friends who took their two small boys to see this movie and they said it was border line. They told me that the ""Two Towers"" is even more violent and darker. The ""Two Towers"" continues Frodo's quest to destroy the ring.",1043366400,6,1737,4.364197530864198
1316816,5,B00003CWT6,"The 4 disc DVD special edition is great. This is the version you should buy - especially if you have not read the book and found the shorter version a bit confusing. The irony is that the longer version actually feels shorter because the story is so much easier to follow. Special effects: here we are treated to all the good stuff that George Lucas failed to deliver in the Star Wars prequels - Jackson's effective blend of CGI, New Zealand scenery and a strong cast make the recent SW movies look like cartoons. FOTR is a great movie if you are willing to accept one major change: Jackson made a relatively fast paced action-adventure flick while the original LOTR trilogy is a rather slow flowing and philosophical novel. (For those with music video attention spans, ""relatively"" is the key term here. This is one looooooong movie, and the pace is fast only when compared to how slowly events unfold in the novel.)

1316817,4,B00003CWT6,I bought this movie with reserves as to how goo di thought it would be but it really proved me wrong.  There hasn't been a good fantasy series or movie for that matter in quite sometime and the LOTR has filled a much needed void.  With Harry Potter also out we have lots to cheer about with good movies.  The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars is because I felt some of the casting was a bit weak particularly with Strider.  He doesn't do a bad job but he just isn't as convincing of a leathal fighter.,1043280000,,505,4.070707070707071
1316818,5,B00003CWT6,"I really did enjoy the theatrical release of 'Fellowship' and thought that, along with many others, that New Line was doing 2 different DVD releases of the film to 'cash in' on the fans.
I still decided to pick up the extended version, and I feel like it was a good use of my hard-earned money.
First of all, the 30 extra minutes are well used, really expanding on the characters and the world of Middle Earth.  I don't really mind the fact that it's on two discs.  It's like the intermission that the epic films like 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Cleopatra' had.  It's a chance to stretch one's legs a bit.  It probably would have been impossible to fit the 4 commentaries, the Dolby 5.1 audio track, and a DTS audio track, along with the 3 1/2 hour film without the quality suffering. The picture and audio quality are great because the film is spread out a bit.
The actors that were cast in this film are fantastic.  Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, and Viggo Mortensen are particularly convincing in their roles.
The commentaries are a treasure for the film buff or aspiring film maker.  It is facinating to hear 4 different angles on the film.
The two discs of documentaries are superb.  I can't recall any DVD release covering the film making process in such detail.  Watching the documentaries makes me admire Peter Jackson even more than before.  He is a man who genuinely admires Tolkien's work.  He is not doing this to 'cash in'.  If he truly wanted to cash in, he could have just gone to Australia or England, found a sound stage and done the entire trilogy using sound stages and CGI. He didn't though.  He filmed the majority of the films on locations in his homeland, New Zealand, and many crews took many months recreating Middle Earth.  Peter Jackson has devoted several years to these films now and deserves the financial rewards that are coming to him.
A truly enjoyable adventure and one that I look forward to reliving many times.  This set is one that really exhibits the capablities of the DVD format.",1043280000,4,2018,4.584958217270195
1316819,5,B00003CWT6,"The Extended DVD Edition of Lord of the Rings takes everything that was great about the theatrical version and makes it better. The addition of Bilbo's trolls, the trek through the marshes, and the gift giving of Lady Galadriel had me reeling with delight. And the introduction (after the prologue), whew, it's completely redone... and the result is fantastic. Bilbo's voice-over Concerning Hobbits is glorious. The Extended Edition of The Fellowship moves at a much better pace than the theatrical version. The theatrical version just moved a little to fast; like when Aragorn and the hobbits leave Bree, they arrive at Weathertop in no time. There are many other added scenes, and I appreciated all of them.
  The technical specifications of this DVD are astounding. The DTS 6.1 sound mix is a work out for my home theater, and since the feature is now stretched over two DVDs, the picture quality is slightly better than the theatrical version DVD. The appendices are a feast. I got lost in endless amount of interviews with cast and crew members, and the insight on the making of the film is remarkable.
  It's safe to say that anybody with a DVD player should own this DVD set. The beautiful casing justifies the greatness of The Fellowship of the Ring. I'm sure an extended edition of The Two Towers will be out later this year... I can't wait!",1043193600,,1350,4.781115879828326
1316820,4,B00003CWT6,"The movie I watched in the theater was in many ways a disappointment, because I had read the Tolkien book(s) twice, to say nothing of the supporting supplements published posthumously.  In other words, I was a Middle Earth Junkie, and the theatrical version really hurt.  It was promising, but ultimately disappointing.
This edition makes up for it in many ways.  The Two Towers flows more smoothly from this extended edition than from the theatrical release.  In addition, there are nearly six hours of commentary from the actors and the technical folks that fans will appreciate.
The actors provide a running commentary, and the contributions of the hobbits and the Dwarf (Sean Astin - Sam Gamgee, and John Rhys-Davies - Gimli, son of Gloin) and Boromir (Sean Bean) are notable, as well as the occasional remarks of Ian McKellan.  (Viggo Mortensen is not featured in the commentaries.)
I echo the sentiments of the editorial reviewers and the other private reviewers; the extended edition is excellent in every way.  I think that the casting is superb.  The editing in this DVD leaves little to be desired.  A wonderful achievement.

1316821,4,B00003CWT6,"The first part of the trilogy was rather well done although it ivolved making some changes and skipping a large percentage of the book.  However, you would probably need at least six movies to satisfy all viewer demands.  (Each part (or volume) is divided into two separate books.)  Events like those in the Old Forest would be fascinating to see portrayed but do not seem as exciting as the adventures that were shown.  Of course, many people might prefer to see the Special Extended Edition of ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" which I have not yet seen at this point.  (Please keep in mind that this version is only thirty minutes longer and will still not include portions like the Old Forest and the Barrow-downs.)
  ""The Two Towers"" was also fairly enjoyable although some parts were boring.  I do not blame the makers for saving certain events in part two for the third movie since most of Book Six in ""The Return of the King"" involves events that occur after Sam and Frodo finish their adventures with the ring.  Unfortunately, I did not like the fact that the movie did not cover everthing that went on between Gandalf and the Balrog, which would have been short enough to cover, and hope that the company will do so if it produces a Special Exended Edition of ""The Two Towers.""",1043193600,,1283,4.592105263157895

I'm happy to have had an excuse to see the movie again.  But frankly, the scenes Jackson cut to make the theatrical cut slow the movie down without adding much richness.  If you want the whole story, read the book.  If you want one of the best movies of all times, see the theatrical cut.  If you want to see how a brilliant editor can make a good movie great, watch this cut after you've seen the theatrical cut.

1. If somehow they were able to put the movie on one disc (perhaps by putting putting the film on two discs, and putting two commentaries per disc) so you didn't have to change discs, but I'm no data-compression guru, so I can't complain too much.
and
2. If Cate Blanchett were married to me and not Andrew Upton, and were that she was on the commentaries, if she were to give me a ""shout-out"". But she was absent from the commentary. Okay, maybe that's two things, but the part about her being married to me instead of Andrew Upton is more of a non-disc related issue, and more of a ""I-need-to-get-a-life"" issue, so I decided not to list it as a seperate issue with this disc.",1043020800,,741,4.3768115942028984

A clear invitation to all who feel little, to feel great; all who feel alone, to feel accompanied.  The one story for those searching for inspiration and hope, The Fellowship of the Ring, is the movie we should watch...and even better, the book we should read.
But watching the movie in its DVD Widescreen Edition brings us the chance to perceive with extremely precision all the hidden aspects of this magnificent tale. Extraordinary direction by Peter Jackson and outstanding choice and performance of the cast, and of course, the excellent technical features that made this super production come to life, all these aspects make this, without question, ""the one movie to rule them all, for those who will live to remember"".",1043020800,,842,5.1838235294117645
1316873,5,B00003CWT6,"Despite its hefty 3 & 1/2 hour length, the 4-disc ""Extended Edition"" of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the absolute superior version, and, in my opinion, the only version. Peter Jackson and Co. didn't simply insert new cuts and scenes inbetween the original cut; the entire movie has been re-edited to accomodate the new footage. Viewers can choose between four different sets of commentary as well. There is much more to this film, for fans of the book or for people who simply liked the theatrical release and wanted to delve further into it. Though I was highly impressed with the theatrical release, I always felt that the movie was a little bit too hurried, as if there were things left unresolved, underdeveloped, or simply passed over. The new version is much more in the vein of Tolkien's whimsy and enchantment. There is greater depth in the character development, particularly Bilbo, Aragorn, and Gandalf. There are significant additions to the movie, some straight from the book, and events of great importance later in the trilogy- the deleted scene, ""The Gift Giving"" in Lothlorien, is of paramount importance to the rest of the story. There are also a lot of small touches here and there that all add up to a more substantial film- hobbits drinking and singing at the Green Dragon, elves that are leaving Middle-Earth, Aragorn singing by himself at night, and the Fellowship paying homage to Gandalf in Lothlorien. These are but a few of the numerous additions throughout the film that contribute to a more satisfying and memorable experience.
The supplementary discs offer many hours of information, regarding practically every aspect of the movie, from early concept to final cut, and there are dozens of interviews that add further understanding to the production. My personal favorite is the very first documentary, which, if the viewer doesn't know anything about J.R.R. Tolkien, or the mythological, philological, and philosophical nature of the books, is incredibly vital. The ""Extended Edition"" is the final say in fantasy film-making and totally worthwhile to anyone who even has a passing interest in the original version, and the supplementary discs are highly resourceful as well. 100% recommended.",1043020800,,2225,5.115384615384615

What will be even nicer is when the entire three parts are released and there is a super jumbo, seamless film on DVD for all of the ardent followers.

I don't have much to add to this statement. Only that the acting is good, the story is a great adaptation of the first part JRR Tolkien's classic novel, and that the effects aren't overly used or obnoxious as is the case with the new installments of the Star Wars series.
I have been a vivid Star Wars fan for some time now, but comparing the dreadfull episodes 1 & 2 with this film and The Two towers, my loyalty starts to waver.
In short: forget Episode III! When is The Return of the King going to come out?",1042848000,,713,4.136690647482014
1316877,4,B00003CWT6,"The only reason this DVD edition did not get 5 stars was because they separated the movie into 2 DVDs, which means in the middle of the movie you have to get up and put in the other DVD.  I find that just a bit annoying, unless you're one of those lucky people that owns a 5-disc changer DVD player.
Anyway, the movie is great.  It's about a hobbit named Frodo Baggins who acquires a ring which wields the powers of darkness over its owner.  Frodo and his companions must try to take the ring back to Mount Doom, where it was made and the only place it can be destroyed, before the ring's evil takes over Frodo and turns him to the dark side.  All the while, the ring's maker, Lord Sauron, has soldiers looking for the ring so that he can be restored to power and rule over Middle Earth.
This edition comes with 2 discs full of special features- interviews, pictures, and the ""how'd they do that"" type of featurettes.  The featurettes about how they made the Hobbits look small and all their visual effects were fascinating.  I don't think they included enough interviews with the whole cast.  It was mostly with the Hobbits.  They should have interviewed Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn/Strider) and Orlando Bloom (Legolas) more.
You are also able to listen to commentaries throughout the movie if you so choose.  There are a multitud to choose from:  the cast, directors and crew, and the visual artists or something.  The cast one was disappointing because they didn't even include commentary from Viggo Mortensen or Orlando Bloom, which are 2 of the 7 main characters in the story!  The commentary was obviously taped in several sessions, one with all the hobbits together and everyone else was individually, which means they insert it into moments of silents when the actors who played the Hobbits aren't talking.  Mostly, Elijah Wood does the commenting.  They exchange some funny stories about what happens on the set.
The restored footage to the movie is great.  It reflects more of the way Hobbits are, and there are some scenes which will help you to understand parts in the second movie, such as their daggers, rope, the Elvish bread, and such, which Galadriel gives them and they show them with these gifts in the second movie.
Overall, the package total is an A!",1042761600,,2268,4.663316582914573
1316878,5,B00003CWT6,"I enjoyed the film in the theatres, but must say I enjoy the extended version DVD even more.  A film to savor and the nice little additional touches have rounded the film out just where it needed.  Having seen the Two Towers now, I am even more impressed with what Jackson has accomplished here.  This is fine movie-making and a film-lover's delight.  If it all holds up through the 3rd film (which it is showing every indication of doing), we are well on the way to a masterpiece.
I am again so thankful it was all done at once, with the same cast, crew, and unifying vision.  It is going to make all the difference when seen in its entirety.  I am not a huge fan of fantasy, but this is such quality film-making I have been completely caught up in its story and magic!  I never read the books, so the nitpicking I see is the same old stuff when someone has to translate literature into a motion picture.  They have to make changes folks!
As to the extras on the DVD, they are wonderful.  I don't often watch a lot of the extras as I find them tiresome at times, and I often don't want to know how the magic is done.  The over 6 hours of extras here, however, were fascinating as you get a real look at the devotion and fanatic attention to detail that went into the production.  Likewise, I found it enlightening as to how much non-CGI in the form of elaborate sets etc. went into the making of the films.  That all the real and cyber stuff is so seamlessly meshed, as well as the added capability of later further tinkering  made possible by the computers, I found engrossing.  It's the best extras package I've seen.
All in all, it presents a fuller film version and a tribute to the hardworking folk that labored so mightily to bring this beloved epic to the screen.  Well worthwhile.",1042761600,,1789,4.33033033033033
1316879,5,B00003CWT6,"The Platinum Edition of The Fellowship of the Ring is absolutely outstanding and definitely worth the money. Here's why:
1) The extra 25+ minutes of movie footage adds depth and texture to the story as a whole without making it FEEL longer. The added scenes and segments are seamlessly interwoven with the movie as a whole and are largely comprised of small segments that augment a scene or chapter of the overall story. There is more detail about the hobbits' lives in the Shire, a large section added to the Lorien chapter, and more development of the Fellowship's characters before their journey. Indeed, Jackson and Ian McKellen continue to demonstrate with their work that they were completely robbed at Oscar time.
The full run time is more than 3 hours, 20 minutes but the movie is logically split between the first 2 DVDs of the 4-DVD set so that it is easy to view in two sittings (although that is blasphemous in some quarters). Overall, the added scenes make a very good movie MUCH better and further display the excellent direction, cinematography and attention to detail that made the theatrical movie release so good.
2) The DVD extras are very good. The A&E-Biography style Tolkien piece is interesting and pays suitable homage to the author. There are also heretofore unseen interviews with the actors and crew including descriptions of how Peter Jackson put together the movie, how the cast worked together, how the cast members essentially related to each other outside of work as they would while in character (like Liv Tyler being a real princess by making Orlando Bloom drive her in New Zealand because she couldn't stand driving on the left side of the road), etc.
3) The insight into the film process -- there is a fine piece on how the director started the film project from concept to the go-ahead from New Line to do three films at once (with credit to Miramax for sheparding the project along for a bit); there is also an outstanding piece on the hobbit doubles -- four small-statured people who dressed as each of the hobbit characters and doubled for them (this was especially useful for eye-level acting so the regular sized characters could affect a natural eye-level for the hobbit actors who were shrunken through editting and camera tricks) and the interesting relationships of the doubles to their primaries.
Highly recommended, and unquestionably worth the extra money.",1042761600,,2405,4.897058823529412
1316920,5,B00003CWT6,"The Special Edition DVD is far superior to just the regular edition.  I might go so far as to say that this DVD is even better than seeing the original in the theater.  The movie is enriched by extended and extra scenes that were not included in the original for time constraints.  It borders on epic length at 3 1/2 hours, but it is well worth it.  The film flows much more seamlessly and you really get more of a feel for the movie Peter Jackson wanted to put out but couldn't because it was too long.  This should be the gold standard for DVDs, because it not only improves on the film the extras are actually worth watching.  By far the best DVD I have ever seen.  Even if you are not an avid fan of the Lord of the Rings books or movies, this DVD is well worth the purchase.  I can't watch the original anymore because this film is so far superior it's like watching the Godfather III and not the first two.",1042761600,,912,4.142045454545454

Most of the actors were well chosen (except maybe Elrond) and I would have liked to have seen Glorfindel, but all in all I was satisfied (my brother, who has read the books about a million times, hated it but watched it several times anyway)  In particular i liked Liv Tyler as Arwen, and the CG and costumes are all very well done.  Some of the scenes could have been done better (in particular the council of Elrond) but like I said I did enjoy this and its about as good as you could do with condensing the book into 3 hours.  But Gimli didn't kick enough ... in Moria and Legolas didn't fire arrows nearly fast enough",1042761600,,716,4.242647058823529
1316922,5,B00003CWT6,"Probably the best DVD out there in terms of content.  The extended/new scenes were added seamlessly & actually provide more depth to the movie itself.  In short, the new scenes made sense or even clarified certain things for me.  In contrast, I remember watching the unnecessary & tedious extension of the podrace scene in The Phantom Menace DVD & asking myself why it was even put back.

Unfortunately for us without a multi-disc DVD player, the movie has been split into 2 discs.  However, that is a minor inconvenience compared to what you get:
- 4 different running commentaries to choose from to get better understanding on the making of the film (my personal favorite is the cast members---pretty entertaining).
- Improved audio & video quality compared to the Theatrical Release DVD --- OK, I admit that I can't really tell the difference.  But according to some DVD technical reviewers, this version uses less compression & offers more enhanced audio tracks, which translates to better visual & auditory experience.  Probably people with expensive audio/video equipment will notice it.

Two extra discs hold all the documentaries & behind-the-scenes exploration, and all are very interesting if you have an ounce of interest in Tolkien the author, how the book came about, how the book was translated into the movie by Peter Jackson & his team, and getting to know the actors who were selected for the roles.  It is actually in those 2-disc extras that will make you appreciate how much work & care they put into this film.  The quality of workmanship is unbelievable from the costume to the props & sets.

Movie-wise, I think this is a good interpretation of the book.  Purists will dislike it because it does not follow the book to the letter: A line attributed to Treebeard is now voiced by Galadriel; 40-year old Frodo is acted out by a (then) 18-year old actor; the absence of Tom Bombadil; etc. It should be understood that books & movies are different forms of media, and it's virtually impossible to follow every single detail of the book without slowing down the movie. How many LOTR readers have actually managed to read the book for the first time within a day & able to completely digest it?  So how can a 3-hour movie be able to squeeze in all the nuances of the book?  You'll probably need 10 hours!  And will a studio in their right mind allow that?  Of course not!  It is not commercially viable that way.  If you want to stay 100% faithful to each & every detail of the book, you will need to produce a TV-mini series.  Unfortunately, I do not think such a medium will be given a big enough budget to afford good actors, crew, & production effects equal to those people who worked on this movie.  You'll probably get a lousy Lord of the Rings that way.  And for those ultra-purists who think that LOTR should probably never had been made into a film, I beg you to stop being selfish.  I never read any Tolkien books before I saw the movie even though I like the epic-fantasy genre---I just never had the time nor the motivation.  After watching the movie, I've read & appreciated The Hobbit, the whole trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, and now will start reading The Silmarillion.",1042761600,,3205,4.6637010676156585
1316923,5,B00003CWT6,"My largest complaint about the original release of TFOTR was that it was obviously created by a horror movie director.  Other than the Shire and Rivendell, everything beautiful was cut and minimized, and way too much time was spent showing Uruk-hai crawling in the mud.  It lost way too much of the magic of Middle-Earth; Galadriel seemed vile, Lothlorien was a chilling, uncomfortable place.  Very unlike the world Tolkien wrote about.  But the extended version does much to rectify this.  The added scenes show the charm of the characters.  They show the beauty and warmth of Lothlorien and Galadriel, and there is no reason any of these scenes should have been cut to begin with.  If I were trying to cut the length of this movie, I'd hack out unnecessary scenes that had nothing to do with the plot, such as the Moria staircase scene or the ""Pep talk to Lurtz"" scene.  The added scenes are far more important to the development of the plot, characters, and world of Middle Earth than other scenes that Peter Jackson was obviously just more attached to as a horror movie director (not trying to badmouth P.J., he did a really great difficult job overall and in the end he did put together this very nice extended version).  This extended cut is very natural; the added footage isn't just ""stuck in there"" like some extended movies I've seen.  It is sewn into the tapestry of the film, and new dialog and music add to the film as well. Not just 30 minutes longer, but truly 30 minutes better.",1042761600,,1494,4.625
1316924,4,B00003CWT6,"George Lucas fumbled the ball with the Star Wars prequel trilogy and Peter Jackson picks up the ball!!!!
The Extended Edition of The Lord Of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an absolute winner and a good complement to the theatrical release. This edition really enhances the story by adding plotlines that deepen into the characters' lives, from Bilbo to Boromir, from the peaceful Shire to the ruins of Amon Hen.
Jackson's vision of Tolkien's mythology will never be unmatched, first for being the first to attempt it on a live-action movie not only with one, but with three hand-to-hand full length motion pictures. Second, for the carefully detailed closeness to that world. Third, for the precision in the visual, acting and technical visions.
On this edition, I only found one minor flaw: the sequence of Caras Ghaladon when the Fellowship is climbing the tree to meet with Galadriel, the mood is like a sunset and the next shot is completely by night...it's known by the books that those travels took them a lot of time, but to climb the tree in such long time?  maybe I am wrong.
The hidden easter eggs, absolutely wonderful. The documentaries well assembled in chronological and work process order shows the real artistry, hard work and passion involved in making a movie and completing the journey of bringing Tolkien's myth to life without leaving a single department involved in the production out of frame... the appendixes DVDs are a fitting tribute to the work and craftsmanship of all the movie's cast and crew.
And finally, the goodies in the gift's edition show that it's not bad to make merchandising when it's worth the money you are willing to pay for it, the Argonath are truly two pieces of art.

There's little bits and pieces added to already existing scenes, and a few entirely new sequences. (My favorite is when the Fellowship is leaving Rivendell to begin their trek to Mordor. Nothing earth-shattering, but little bits like that make the characters really come to life.) A lot of fans of the book complained that the Galadriel ""Gift-Giving"" sequence was omitted from the film- Well, here it is! The movie looks gorgeous, and takes up two discs by itself; Both discs are filled with multiple commentary tracks, by the film's stars, design team, writers, and Director Peter Jackson.
  Discs Three & Four are ""The Appendices""; I've never seen such a vast array of extras in my life! There are over 6 hours of documentary features, as well as huge galleries of conceptual art (Some with commentary by the artists themselves), weapon, costumes, make-up and sets. There are also tons of computer animatics to watch; It's like an animated version of the movie. There's a series of interactive maps of Middle-Earth that are a lot of fun, too. (Plus you'll find out just what a Weta is!)
  The collector's set comes packaged in a box with new art by conceptual artist Alan Lee, and includes a pair of bookends modeled after The Argonath, three Decipher trading cards, a ""Hobbit-Sized"" LOTR fan club magazine, a coupon for one adult admission to The Two Towers (Which is expired at this point), and an expanded version of the National Geographic LOTR special, which dwells more on the LOTR's relationship with real-life mythology; It's very interesting and informative.
  I've been watching these 5 discs for almost two months now, and I still haven't seen everything. It's a steal at this price, and I hope New Line puts out collectors sets for The Two Towers & The Return of the King. Highly recommended!",1042675200,,2121,4.823691460055096
1316927,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of The Rings in my opinion is the greatest fantasy tale of all time.  With all the stories in this field it surpasses all others with it's deep history, richness in characters, and completely breathtaking scenery. The story is one I beleive that will survive for many generations to come along with the movies to be considered masterpies for a long time coming.",1042675200,,370,4.6923076923076925
1316928,3,B00003CWT6,"This movie was definantly in the top 10 of all time, along with its sister the two towers. As far as movies go, I would give this a 5 star rating.
However, This is more than a movie. This is a movie based on a book. Roughly based on. For all of the theatrical briliance, it pales before the book it is supposed to represent. The charicters, with only a few exceptions, are but shades of the originals. They are lessened in dignity, valor, and shown as chaff before a very ""hollywood"" style set of heroes.
In addition, the loss of tom bombadil was most distressing. one can understand that in a theatrical movie based on a long book, some things will have to be omitted. But with 4 dvds of space, this most awesome of charicters, one refered to later as a being most powerful, is still completely omitted. It is a shame.
So, if youve never read the books, and are never going to, I reccomend this book 100 percent. If you can disengage your mind and allow the book and movie to be seperate then it will likewise be a super cool movie. If, like me, you grew up loving the books, and then wanting a movie as good as the books, then this may not be it. I guess my key disapointment lies there.
In addition, I am trying not to hold a grudge against this movie. It is so good that remakes are not likely for many many years to come, which means that a real good representation of the book will probably not happen while I am young enough to enjoy it.",1042675200,,1444,4.197841726618705

What a treat to hear about how scenes were shot, reasons for staging things certain ways, plus funny stories about what went on behind the camera.  Also, the additional/extended scenes were really a treasure to see and truly helped to tell the story even more.

Sure, we're excited to see the movie in all its widescreen glory, too. But the extra stuff is what really sets DVD's apart from VHS. This DVD version of the movie has it all. First, the movie itself has over a half hour of extra footage. And it's integrated into the film. They added the musical score and special effects to this extra footage. So you're really getting an extended version. Then there are two other discs full of behind the scenes stuff, interviews, commentary, etc. This extended version of the first Lord of the Rings movie truly raises the bar for movies on DVD, and I thank the producers for it. We originally bought Lord of the Rings in regular widescreen DVD, and I thought it would be silly to get another copy of the same movie. I'm so glad that we received it as a gift! Even if I would have gone out and bought the movie myself, it would have been worth every penny. The movie is an outstanding portrayal of Tolkien's epic.

But I finally relented and bought the extended edition too. Two things that held me back that I wanted to clarify - first you do not have the option of seeing the theatrical edition on the extended set. I thought you did, but you dont. Secondly, all of the bonus material is NEW and different than what you get with the theatrical edition DVD. That being said, it's worth owning them both if you're a fanatic like myself, as there are bonus materials on the theatrical DVD that you don't get on this new one. Packaging wise and content wish, this extended edition is simply phenominal. It's like a video book. I'll watch some here adn there and then remember the chapter where i was and pick it up later.

1316993,5,B00003CWT6,"I got the first DVD edition of the Fellowship, but knew I had to have this one based on all the plugs they gave for it in the first edition. Anyway, I have been very pleased with it. It includes the entire full-length director's cut which brings in nearly an hour of unseen footage, and gives the story a bit more depth than the released film version did. There is also more commentary and behind-the-scenes stuff here than on any DVD I've seen, and, not to be understated, they don't spend all of the time trying to get you to see the next movie! Given that the first edition DVD was basically just a big (albeit COOL) plug for The Two Towers, it was a relief to see that this edition just went back and showed all of the intricacies that went into making this film. If you're into Tolkien, this really is a good buy since they spend one entire disk talking about how to take Tolkien's text and turn it into the visual masterpiece that you see on screen.
Can't wait for the final film, and the special edition of the Two Towers!",1042588800,,1029,4.282051282051282
1316994,5,B00003CWT6,"I actually liked the theatrical version, and even after I've read the book, still liked the first DVD when it came out.  I don't agree with every addition and alteration the filmmakers made, and I still would have loved to see Tom Bombadil, but overall, this extended/platinum version answers most of the questions we asked.
I especially liked the part where Galadriel gives the fellowship members gifts.  Just the one I thought was sorely lacking in the original version.  And Celeborn plays a larger role, like he did in the book, setting Aragorn on the right path in a subtle way only Tolkien elves could.
If I have a gripe it's that when it came to the gift for Sam, the filmmakers deemed the rope more important than the box of Lothlorien soil.  Now that I've seen Two Towers in the theaters, I can see that even the rope wasn't put to much use in the sequel.  Certainly not as important as the part it played in the movie.
The transformation of Gimli and his moments with Legolas in the Extended version were wonderful too, but again, this poses consistency problems with the sequel, where he is back to his funny but irritable self again.  Mind you, this is not a criticism of the Extended version, it's just that because Peter Jackson had already finalized all three films, and since this Extended version came after, it just doesn't mesh that well with the sequel that is being shown in theaters.
And the battle scenes that most critics panned became even longer.
But then, this is way better, IMO.  It looks better too.  The Shire is gorgeous.  How do I book flights there?",1042588800,,1583,4.585106382978723
1316995,5,B00003CWT6,"This extended version of the literary masterpiece has much more detail than the theater version.  As a LONG time fan of Tolkien, I was happy with the way the film followed closely to the Book, but I am even more thrilled with this new version as it includes so many little things that made the story so interesting.
My only complaint is that there was not more!  :)

When I saw it on the stores for the first time, I knew that was a special product, but when it arrived at my hands I discovered that it's much more than I could expect.
Starting by the box of the DVD that is beautifully decorated with drawings. The menus are gorgeous, with great music and good animation. Everything well organized and the scenes added or extended are marked on the scene selection menu, allowing you to see exactly what's new on this version.
There are lots of audio options that go from the simpler Dolby Surround to the DTS 6.1, with options for all kinds of equipments. There are also 4 commented soundtracks, which will drive you to a deep journey on how the movie was made.
The National Geographic DVD that comes with this set is also good to any fan of J. R. R. Tolkien, the book and the movie.
The statues (bookends) are great with lots of details and look good in your office bookshelf.
If someone loves the movie and is a bit afraid about replacing the theatrical version of the movie by this one or just purchasing it, I will say that it's a great gift to yourself and at the end you will see that this was the best DVD ever seen.",1042502400,3,1299,4.284552845528455

1317030,5,B00003CWT6,"Whether you're a Tolkien fan or not, you cannot argue that this is one of the most hyped and ambitious films of the last decade. Aside from the new ""Star Wars"" and ""Titanic"" (both of which were horrible, in my opinion), Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is worth every inch of the hype. Enough to make it worth buying both the theatrical and extended edition of the DVD, something I have never done before, and not likely to do again.
First question: Does the extra 30 minutes really make a difference?  While the length of the extra footage varies between a few seconds to a few minutes, it does add a sharper edge to the movie. Some more frightening bits were added, as well as more background stories were added and a bit more violence is noticeable. It makes the movie meatier and more satisfying in the end. In retrospect, the theatrical version seems incomplete after viewing this extended edition. Though 30 minutes doesn't seem like a lot (especially when the movie is already 3 hours long), it really makes a difference.
Second question: Are all the extras good? Oh yes. While the theatrical release had some fine extras, the ""Extended Edition"" offers loads more. Spanning 4 DVDs, the last 2 discs are packed with extras, while the first two have a modest amouns. Most notibly, the commentaries. I always enjoy listening to commenteries, and there are 4 feature-length ones on discs 1 and 2. They're very entertaining, and cover all bases, from the technical, to the trivial, to the funny and outrageous. Aside from that, there are loads of documentaries, featurettes, interviews, storyboards, and every other imaginable detail. They really went all out for this version.
Last question: Is it worth buying if you already own the original theatrical version? The Extended Edition is a totally different package, and I have not seen any duplicate extras on either version. I love the featurettes and previews on the theatrical version, so I will definitely keep it. But for the meat and potatoes, the extended edition is definitely the version to own.
For anyone who loved the movie, from the casual viewer to the die-hard fan, should get the Extended Edition. This is a rare movie where the hype was well deserved, and a deluxe package is definitely worth shelling out $ for.",1042329600,,2285,4.814249363867685
1317031,5,B00003CWT6,"As many other reviews have been written about The Fellowship of the Ring, this review will focus mainly on the Platinum Series Extended DVD.  My only comment on the movie itself will be that while I was underwhelmed during my first viewing of the movie at the IMAX, the DVD extended version is much, much more enjoyable.
If you are trying to decide whether to buy the ""standard"" DVD or VHS version of the movie or spend the extra money and buy the Platinum edition:  Go for the Platinum.  Some of the most amazing scenes in this movie are the extended and new scenes that were reintegrated into the DVD.  For example:  ""Concerning Hobbits"" is a fascinating new scene toward the beginning of the movie that is reminiscent of reading J.R.R. Tolkien's works and provides a very fitting introduction to the movie.  It really sets the mood.  Extended portions of ""The Council of Elrond"" and ""Lothlorien"" were absolutely breathtaking.  And ""Gilraen's Memorial,"" a new scene, was also incredible to watch.
This DVD comes packed with about 7 hours worth of extras as well.  I began to enjoy the movie more and more as I watched the incredible amount of work that went into pre-production and production of this film.  From story-boarding to casting, from CGI to visual effects, the extras on Discs 3 and 4 of this series are absolutely riveting.  I was most amazed by the extensive use of miniatures and sets in this movie.  I figured a movie of this scale would have been predominately CGI, but it was not.  It was fascinating to see how all of the sets and miniatures were made.
Consequently, this viewer, who had a fairly unenthusiastic first response to LOTR on the big screen, is now ""hooked"" on the series after experiencing the Platinum series DVD.  I would imagine that this DVD would be sheer ecstasy for a die-hard Tolkien fan.
Since I enjoyed ""The Two Towers"" much more than the first installment in this series, I look forward to the Platinum series of that movie most eagerly.",1042329600,,1981,4.687861271676301
1317032,4,B00003CWT6,"I haven't read the Lord of the Rings books, so my opinion might not be as justified as others, but I speak for many people when I say Peter Jackson's interpriation of the story is fantastic.  The visual aspect of this movie is absolutely stunning and I found myself in tears one or two times due to the sheer beauty of it all.
The only thing I was disappointed with was some of the casting.  I think the movie would have been numerous times better if they had casted someone else as Frodo, besides Elijah Wood.  He seems to have the same expression on his face throughout the entire movie.  Also, I think everyone is making too big of a deal about the character, Arwen.  In my opinion, Liv Tyler has very minimal acting skills.  I believe that the casting director just put people like Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchette in the picture because their famous named would draw audience attention to the film.  But, I really don't have anything against Cate Blanchette.  She's a phenominal actress and she must have a lot of talent to play such a complex role as Galadriel.
I have to say, overall, the casting was pretty good.  I think Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf did a fantastic job and so did Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn.  The fact that Viggo did his own stunts is very impressive.  I can't really seem to find anything else to complain about.  This movie is complete genuis, save a few details.  The pace was a little slow, but the wonderful scenery and action-packed battle sequences made up for it.  It was all so believable, not like some other fantasy stories that look so fake.  New Zealand truly is Middle Earth and the art direction of everything was simply awe-inspiring.
The movie must be great to captivate the mind of a 13 year old, such as myself.  Especially one with quite a short attention span.  To say the least, this film is a true work of art and I would reccommend it to any fantasy fan.",1042329600,,1914,4.454022988505747

1317034,5,B00003CWT6,"Excellent movie, excellent story.  I'm sick and tired of the usual Hollywood fare of doctors, cops, lawyers, and serial killers.  We need more fantasy and science fiction in our lives because these are the stories that make us think and use our imaginations.  We need exposure to ideas that challenge our perspectives and beliefs, and to help us build tolerances for people and ideas that are different from the norm.  Having said that, I think it's important to encourage our entertainment industry to take on more such projects.  I'm surprised by the previous review, obviously a fellow fantasy fan, who didn't approve of the movie.  This is a hard genre to film, and The Lord of the Rings was not only a successful attempt, it's my favorite film ever.  But as a fantasy fan, I would be supportive even if it fell short of my expectations.  After all, what are my other options?  More doctor, cop and lawyer movies.",1042329600,,917,4.716981132075472

When in the book Gandalf leaves Bilbo's House and returns in 9 years to tell Frodo he has to leave and destroy the Ring.  Just minor details like that are skipped and changed which i feel is better or else the general audience will be lost.
This movie did it's job in making the Lord of the Rings ""come to life"".  I don't think any director could make it any better within this century.  Maybe in the cosmic future will a more accurate remake be made ?  The Nazguls (ringwraiths) were depicted as mysterious, powerful, evil beings, which i thought was very cool !  although i felt that they should have made the Nazguls tougher at the Weathertop scene fighting Aragorn.  Aragorn whipped all 5 of them up !!
 The only problem with this DVD is that the Widescreen borders are large !! the top and bottom borders are large making my 20 inch tv in my dorm looking like a 13 inch tv.  if i were to do it again i would have bought a Full Screen version.",1042243200,,1037,4.223350253807107

1317037,5,B00003CWT6,"WOW
This is the best adaptation of a book (and film) that I have ever seen.  Although Peter Jackson left out/changed a few parts form the book (like Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-Wright), they were for the better.  To all of the whiners out there that wanted a complete, word for word rendition of the book- it simply can't be done in a film.  Jackson expertly edited the script to include what was needed for the story. (and yes, I have read the trilogy five times over)
What Peter Jackson did show on film was incredible.  It was almost exactly what I had pictured when I read the books, from the scenery (New Zealand is beautiful) to the creatures and the characters.  The actors in this film were nothing short of AMAZING (and when I say amazing, I mean that there simply could not have been a better cast).  All of the hobbits played their roles to perfection, as did Ian McKellan (Gandalf), Sean Bean (Boromir), John Rhy-Davies (Gimli), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), and Christopher Lee (Saruman).  However, I must say that my favorite actor is now Viggo Mortensen after I saw him in his role as Aragorn.  I could write another 1,000 words on how great of a performance his was, but I will leave it at a few words in saying that he deserved an Oscar (and I have been a theatre actor and studied acting for years).
In addition to the visuals, the soundtrack deeply evokes the the spirit of the story and of Middle Earth.  It's soudntracks I've heard in a long, long time.
In all, this is an extraordinary film, especially in the extended edition with the 30 additional minutes seemlessly added.
To come to a point, what makes this movie great is that both the casual movie goer and the diehard Tolkien fan can love it.
(I'll be back when the Two Tower's comes out on DVD!  It's also incredible, although a bit less accurate to the book.)",1042243200,,1835,4.483483483483483
1317068,5,B00003CWT6,"I think the previous two reviewers must have been watching the old animated version that I watched when I was a kid, and are totally unjustified in their comments about this movie.
Peter Jackson has done a quality job in porting this book to the big screen, and in my opinion has done an even better job with the Two Towers, a movie that will be hard to beat. I also noticed that the film was slightly drawn out at times, but I think it only helped to capture the atmosphere. Tolkein would have been proud of this adaptation. It would be impossible to try to successfully map a book to a movie directly.. Just look at the first Harry Potter sham-of-a-movie. Adaptation is all about exactly that - adapting. Peter Jackson has to think of the wider audience. To map it directly would have produced a 6 hour film. Although I think it's a brilliant movie, and this trilogy will go down in the history books, it's only my opinion. I have a number of non-Tolkein fan friends, who didn't particularly like the movie.
If you have an imagination, you like a good blockbuster movie, awesome scenery and special effects, orcs and goblins, then this is the movie for you.",1042243200,,1159,4.497630331753554
1317069,3,B00003CWT6,"The biggest problem I have is with Liv Tyler as Arwen and I can only help but think that she was cast because the brunette girl from the Saved by the Bell TV show had a previous commitment. I've been wondering where the daughter of Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler came by her bogus English accent and hearing her in the extra features segments being her actual Valley girl self makes me believe she spent untold hours with a dialogue coach. The character of Arwen does no more in the book than wait around to be married, but the reason for her elevation to Frodo's saviour is cynically simple. LOTR has always fared poorly amongst females and New Line Cinema has made an obvious attempt to draw more women into the theaters by heightening her role. It doesn't hurt that chick flick cliches were written into the story by Tolkien himself (long before they were cliches) such as the Elven princess and her romance with the ragged wanderer. Pass the hankies please.
Peter Jackson also ruins the Mirror of Galadriel scene (he ruins a few other scenes but I don't have the space for a detailed criticsm) by having Galadriel turn into a poltergeist. It might have helped if a better looking actress than Cate Blanchett had been cast; .....
Mostly what surprised me was how derivative this movie is. The Uruk-hai look like Darth Maul of Star Wars, the little we see of Gollum makes him out to be first cousin of the old Crypt Keeper puppet from Tales of the Crypt, and the ""wizards's duel"" between Gandalf and Saruman is simply an excuse for Matrix-like special effects. But most of all it's clear that Jackson is a fan of Braveheart. I saw that movie not long ago and you can see the echoes of the Gibson film constantly in FOTR, especially in battle scenes but also in costumes.
Forget the ""DVD extras"". We've seen this garbage before. Actors tell you how great the director is, the director effusively praises his special effects team and before long we're drowning in a sycophantic cesspool. I had to laugh when Jackson pompously states that the printed LOTRis to be the authority and when anyone questions if something is appropriate to the movie he says ""it's in the book"". Tell me Peter, where is it in the book that Arwen rescues Frodo or Strider leaves the hobbits alone on Weathertop? I can name dozens of such examples, but this review is getting too long as it is.
There are things to like in this movie tho. The scenery is lush and makes Middle Earth considerably more appealing than Bakshi's 1979 cartoon film. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Ian McKellan as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo give strong performances. Sometimes (very few times unfortunately) Jackson's vision helped me see Tolkien's work in a different light. But please take other reviews of this movie with a grain of salt.

If you want to see a good movie--see the The Lord of the Rings.  Both should be judged independantly from each other and one should never attempt to determine if the movie version (of ANY story) is as good as the book version.  Really, how could any mere million or billion dollar movie ever compare with the flow of one's imagination when reading a great work?
The movie was good.  The special effects were great and fun to watch.  And the story is good, of course.  Do not let these nose in the air, too sophisticated for Hollywood magic boo-sayers sway you from seeing a good flick, because on a scale of one small popcorn bag to one large bag of buttery popcorn--I give this movie an extra large bag of popcorn with extra butter (and a free large coke) rating!  Plus I am glad that there is a good trilogy to make up for the disappointment of the new Star Wars movies.  Anyway, that's a diffrent review.
Again, the movie was good--the dvd is okay.  I am not sure why this dvd version required two discs--some of the documentaries it contains is repetitive.

Firstly, if you have watch it in the cinemas and you feel there is something missing, this is the one for you. It has everything that makes the flow of the movie smooth. Don't expect it to be just like the book. Besides, movie is movie, book is book.
The documentaries are more than 11 hours of watching, everything that you want to know about the production of the movie is here. There are over 2,000 gallery stills altogether and best part of all, this special DVD is shape like a book.

Regardless of your view they are great films, notice how the only whiners are people entirely ignorant of the book or entirely (religiously) devoted to it. To any other movie-goer all are great. Having said that, after watching them Ive read the books and they are better for it, none who watch the films should ignore the books for they at the very least improve the movies and at the most are superior to them. As the director himself would admit, myself knowing his other films well, he could never please everyone when turning such great books into film, but hes pleased me, end of story. Indeed without the films I may never have read L O T Rings, and that would be a shame. Even so, I do beleive they will be films best seen as a whole on DVD colection than 3 hours at the cinema, not least because of the extended versions.",1042243200,,1016,4.188775510204081

True, there were changes and characters and events lost, but one only has to reread the novel to understand why. Now this extended edition does what only more screen time could make possible: make the film even more enjoyable, vivid and three-dimensional. Once you see this longer version, it is impossible to imagine the film without the seamlessly added additional scenes. But more than that, the creatively and lovingly crafted additional material makes the 3rd and 4th discs almost as fascinating as the movie.

I have the original version that came out in August last year and then got the extended one for x-mas and w/o a doubt the extended one is better.  Scenes like the gift giving in Lothlorien have been included (since the gifts given play a role in the next two films) and so much documentary and behinds the scenes footage on the other two discs.

1317127,1,B00003CWT6,"Having read the Lord of the Rings trilogy when I was a teenager, I wasn't impressed with the story.  I thought I would give the movie a try thinking that maybe there may be something, alas I was wrong.  I cannot fathom which movie most of these reviewers were watching, but I didn't see that movie. No, the movie I saw was a poorly written, poorly acted, special effects mayhem bore.  This movie is simply a carbon copy of the typical fare coming from Hollywood these days. Dazzle them with special effects and distract them from the really bad script. Or maybe, no one really cares about that.
For those that love fantasy, I recommend what a previous reviewer said. Willow is an excellent choice.  I also recommend Conan The Barbarian (if there are some in a cave that have not seen it) As for a great fantasy book series, nothing beats the Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever series by Stephen R. Donaldson. Run, do not walk to your local library or bookstore and read all 6 books. You will not regret it. Lord of the Dings can be safely skipped without serious consequences.",1042070400,10,1072,4.538860103626943

I don't know what it is...it just does nothing for me (except induce deep sleep and cause my buttocks to go numb after prolonged exposure to the seat I've been in for the last 20394830 hours watching this thing).
It was fun and even interesting in some varied parts. The visual style of the film is quite impressive. The digital effects are seamless. Elija Wood plays a heroic hobbit, and the rest of the actors are also extreemly well-cast. It was fun and entertaining and I'm not such a cynic that I can't say I enjoyed some of it.
I just find this type of stuff to be boring and pretentious. This film tries too hard to be epic and important. In the immortal words of David Spade (who I actually [don't like]), ""It's called an editor...HIRE ONE!""",1042070400,,966,4.372222222222222
1317130,2,B00003CWT6,"I'd just like to have it on record that there are some people out here who don't think that The Fellowship of the Ring was a good film. I think it was badly written, badly directed, and highly overrated. Peter Jackson may be a great fan of the Lord of the Rings, but his view of the book must be very different to mine.
To establish my LOTR credentials, I've read the book many times, plus all the drafts and variants as edited by J.R.R. Tolkien's son Christopher. Does this make my criticism any more worthy than anyone else's? No; but I am a fan of the book who doesn't like what has been done to it in the film adaption.
I accept that books have to be adapted to some extent to meet the demands of a visual, rather than written, storytelling style. And for the first half hour or so of this film I thought it was pretty good. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there.
The production team do deserve praise for the locations, sets, and art designs. The casting was so-so. However, these were overshadowed for me by a host of other problems.
The main problem I found was pacing. This film was so slow and boring, I found myself sitting there grimly thinking ""I know the point this has to get to . . . how much longer can it possibly be?"" Jackson spent way too long on lingering shots of the landscape, Elijah Wood's face, people hanging from precipices and drowning, activities at Isengard, and pointless fight/action sequences that weren't even in LOTR. The result is that plenty of time was wasted that could have been used to explain and ground the narrative better, or to establish the characters. I know the story very well, and it seemed to me that the film was difficult to follow, with no real sense given of how vitally important the activities of the fellowship were, or even of how much time was passing. Where Jackson did change the story for his film (in plot, characters, etc.), it seems to me that he did so to no good purpose; none of the changes (of which there are a great deal) actually made Fellowship of the Ring a better story or a film. It's like Jackson can't see the wood for the trees. His film is more like a collection of elements and vignettes than a coherent story that has real respect for its source material.
The fact that someone dared to make a live-action film of LOTR does not automatically mean that what they made was a good film. I'm very tired of all the hype. It's unjustified. And as for all the merchandising . . . I don't think I'm unjustified in thinking that J.R.R. Tolkien must be turning in his grave.",1041984000,9,2557,4.3852631578947365
1317131,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson has again shown his genius.  As if the theatrical version of the Fellowship of the Rings wasn't brilliant enough, Mr. Jackson has outdone himself with the extended version of one of the best films of all time.  The additional 30 minutes of the film were seamlessly inserted into the original and they add greatly to the overall effect of the film.
The additional scenes in Hobbiton and the sequence where the gifts of Galadriel are revealed were particularly beautifully done. Of course, I am a fan of Cate Blanchett, so I would like to see as much of Galadriel as possible in the three films.

I purchased both the theatrical version, as well as, the extended version and I was not disappointed by either.  I look forward to similar dual releases for the Two Towers, which I saw last weekend.  Although darker and more violent, it is even better than the Fellowship..., if that is possible.
Thank you Peter Jackson, thank you New Line and thank you to the magnificent cast and crew who have brought Professor Tolkien's masterpiece to film.  I have been waiting for this for 30 years.",1041984000,29,1098,4.692708333333333

The uncut movie is amazing, and there's more of Gollum, who is so cool.  The DVD is amazing, and there are some cool hidden surprises.  One is about a 4 minute theatrical preview of ""The Two Towers,"" which shows several scenes that never made it into the actual ""Two Towers"" film.

The reinserted scenes were so appropriate to the storyline, and the emotional investment of the characters and audience, that I can only imagine the nightmare it was for both director (and editor) to cut them in the first place!
It is absolutely worth *every extra dollar* to see the movie as it was originally filmed in the expanded DVD edition.

In the two full discs of additional information, the cast and crew walk viewers through every detail of the movie-making process.  There is more information available here than anyone probably ever needed, but it is put together in such an entertaining fashion that you will want to watch every moment over and over.  In short, if you're just looking for a good movie to watch with family or friends, buy the regular DVD.

1317190,5,B00003CWT6,"Sprawling adaptation of the first of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy of science-fiction novels (and the first of a trilogy of films) that centre around the adventures of pure-hearted hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood), who must undergo a journey to destroy a ring that turns its bearer towards the evil pursuit of world domination and destruction. In the first of the three films made from these wonderful novels, Frodo forms a group of friends who accompany him on his journey towards the destruction of the ring he has in his possession, but it soon becomes clear that the jewel's power over weak hearts is too much for them and they end up possibly endangering him more than helping him. Beautifully photographed and designed, the film benefits mostly from director Peter Jackson's perfect pacing that never allows the film's lengthy running time of three hours to ever feel tiring or overindulgent. Another plus is the absolutely perfect casting, with an all-star roster of talented actors filling in the roles that dominate Tolkien's imaginary world: Cate Blanchett as a powerful elf sorceress will actually stop your heart, Liv Tyler as an elf princess is stunning, and Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean are terrific as the human men in Frodo's company who are probably the most susceptible to the ring's powers. Ian McKellen steals every single one of his scenes with his layered and gifted performance as the powerful wizard Gandalf, and the film is peppered with terrifying moments that you will never shake off before the whole adventure is over. Naturally, its being a part of a trilogy means that there really is no ending, but thanks to Jackson's incredibly good emotional structure the film has a healthy sense of closure before it ends, making the wait for the next adventure not so grueling (except for the fact that this movie is so good you will want the next chapter immediately!)",1041811200,,1880,4.9525316455696204

So when I heard New Line Cinema would adapt it into a trilogy movie, I was a little suspicious. But that was before I had seen it! Christmas 2001 I went to the theatre expecting to see another average movie...I was completely wrong!
The film was awesome, and I waited eagerly until the extended DVD Edition would be out (a long wait, since it took almost a year), but even with the few dollars more, the 4-disc DVD package is well worth the prize. It features a 200 minutes extended film with many new scenes like Galadriel giving the gifts to the fellowship on their departure in Lothlorien.
All together, the discs have more than 20 hours (!!!) of extra footage spread all out over 4 discs, and there are 2 eastereggs hidden as well!!!
Disc 1: - First Part of LOTR - The Fellowship of the Ring, you can also select the particular scene.
  - 4 First parts of Audio Commentary ( by Directors, Art Directors, Post Production Team & The Cast) during the film, this is extremely interesting, since they comment on each scene with sometimes hilarious facts, and it's 4 times the whole movie!!!
********- On this disc you can find the first easteregg: The Lord of the Rings Parodie made by MTV - for the MTV Movie Awards which has added hilarious cuts with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Jack Black into the scene with Elrond's council. You can view it by scrolling down to the end in the scene select menu, and click on the words ""NEW SCENE"". It's really funny!!!
Disc 2: - Second part of the Lord of the Rings, including new scenes again!
  - Second part of the 4 audio commentaries.
********- Second Easteregg: The Theatrical Trailer that was shown in the US at the end of the screening of the Fellowhip in cinemas of The Two Towers. It gives a 4 minutes preview of beautyful scenes the sequel to LOTR 1. You can find it in the ""Select a scene"" menu, when you again scroll down till the end, until in the right corner of the screen two towers light up from out of nowhere. If you click on OK, Peter Jackson congratulates you for finding this second easter egg.
Disc 3: - Features the First part of the Appendices: From Book to Vision. Everything you hadn't heard in the audio commentaries is shown here about: + The Creator: J.R.R. Tolkien
  + From Book to Script
  + Visualizing the Story
  + Designing and Building Middle Earth
  + Middle Earth Atlas, allowing you to see a short cut journey of how Frodo traveled with the Ring, and you can also trace back Gandalf's journey on his quest to find out about the One Ring.
  + New Zealand as Middle Earth: Which shows you what places and cities were used as Middle Earth sets on both the North and South Island.
Disc 4: - Features the making and filming of the movie. From Vision to Reality.
About:  + A Cast feature, the producers tell about how they picked the cast.
  + A Day in The Life of A hobbit: Very funny sequence, showing the things a hobbit goes through on the set in New Zealand.
  + Cameras in Middle Earth
  + Big-atures: Revealing what scenes in the film were shot with big-atures, beautifully made by artists.
  + Weta-Digital: Shows how computer artists made the visual effects and Digital monsters.

  + The Soundscapes of Middle Earth
  + The Road goes ever on... Shows the premieres of the Fellowship in New Zealand, as well as commentary of the cast and producers about their performance.
I hope that this review has helped any of you in your decision about whether or not buying this extended edition of the DVD.

1317243,5,B00003CWT6,"I bought FOTR (Fellowship of the Ring) on VHS when it first came out on August 6th.  My family then thought I was crazy because I wanted the EE (extended edition) on DVD.  I'm used to being called crazy though, so I didn't mind. ;)  I finally received the EE on DVD about a month after it first came out and OMG!!!!  Some of the scenes are incredible!  If you are a ringer (Tolkien fan) and you love the books and you were VERY annoyed that Galadriel giving all the members of the Fellowship gifts was taken out, you should definitely buy this.  For others who just liked the theatrical version of FOTR, I don't think I would really recommend this, because a lot of the scenes you really have to have read the books to understand.  AND some of them are very easy to see why they were taken out (e.g., Aragorn singing: he has a horrible singing voice!!!  Sorry Viggo).  One of my favorite scenes was ""At the Green Dragon"" (an inn in Hobbiton) with Pippin and Merry dancing on the table and singing.  It was sooooo hobbit-like.  One scene that I thought was strange was after Frodo is wounded by the ringwraith on the hill of Weathertop, the hobbits and ""Strider"" are sitting right under the trolls that Gandalf turned to stone in The Hobbit.  Sam is ridiculous though, saying ""Look Mr. Frodo!  It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls!""  Waaaay to upbeat when his master is dying.
The special features are amazing too.  I've watched all of them but two.  Again, if you really liked FOTR but you're not that interested in seeing little scenes that were taken out or how Aragorn's chain mail shirt was made (j/k!  I never saw if the chain mail shirt was Aragorn's or not), then you'll be bored by this.  Every single little weapon, piece of clothing, set, location, actor, actress, crew member, is described in pinpoint detail.  It's fantastic.
For other ringers, a point of interest is that a part of the special features has a section where you can see the early storyboards acted out for the Sarn Gebir rapids (when there was flooding on the river where the set was, the set was washed away), the orc chase into Lothlorien, and I think something else but I forget what it was.  This is definitely a must-have for all Tolkien devotees!

1317244,5,B00003CWT6,"I am quite surprised to discover how efficiently Director Peter Jackson interpreted Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings on film. As a film, it is visually stunning, lush cinema, embellished with a symphonic musical score, chorus, and actors who perfectly portray the characters. On DVD, the theatrical experience is unsurpassed. What Jackson has done is resurrect the trilogy on film, bringing it to the public audience, ringing bells of familiarity to those who have read the novels and taking up a challenge which directors have desired to produce for years,among them Disney and Stanley Kubrick.
The Fellowship of The Ring is the first film in the trilogy.
The story begins soon after Bilbo Baggins, from ""The Hobbit"", returns to the Shire and announces his retirement. But there is a problem. The ring of power, which once belonged to the Dark Lord Sauron, is in his possession and he is to destroy it. Because he is too old for adventure, the responsibility goes to his younger cousin, Frodo (Elijah Wood). With the aid of his Hobbit friends, Merry, Pippin and Sam, and the princely Aragon, as well as other warriors, composing a fellowship of nine. The evil forces of Sauron, and the Ring Riders, are all after the ring, bent on destroying the nine heroes. The most striking performance in the film is of course, Ian MckKellen's Gandalf, the benevolent sage wizard who meets an untimely death in the chasm at Moria. With a soundtrack full of gorgeous music and haunting chorus and a song by Enya, the Lord of the Rings is a great way to get young people into literature. Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece of fiction and I for one am glad that it is available on DVD with remarkable embellishments.

It packs in an extra 30 minutes of new scenes and also packs two more discs with special features.  Also if you have a wide-screen TV, I would recommend the widescreen edition.
Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring is the best movie I have ever seen.  It combines so many amazing special effects with the riviting story by J.R.R. Tolken to make a true masterpiece.  The score is fantastic and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire way.  If you have never seen the movie you may be a bit disappointed to find that there is no Tom Bombadil or the little poems and songs Tolken writes so often in the book.  Overall however, They did a great job with this movie.  If you have surround sound, this DVD swallows you up entirely and spits you out at the end completely amazed.  This DVD contains a sneak peak of The Two Towers and has separate interviews with each member of the main cast.  It contains 2 documentaries on the making of LOTR and also has trailers for LOTR FOTR the Game.",1041724800,,1167,4.211711711711712

The characters are given more, and you understand them more, and overall you love the movie more than what you did before. Personally I thought that this version should have been released. It gives you more insight to the characters and probably to Tolkein's story, and it also helps you better understand the Two Towers. There were a few questions I had in the Two Towers (like the cloaks...u'll see) that was explained in this version of the Fellowship. You learn a bit more about Aragorn, you see the gifts the Lady of the Wood gives the Fellowship (which I think was also important), you learn more about Bohomir's character (he's not such a sleezeball after all! LOL!) and I think you just get an overall better feel for the movie. I really enjoyed this version. LOVED IT GREATLY! The features are excellent. The stories the cast share are hilarious and gives you a much better appreciation for what they went through to make this great film. So yes, it's undoubtly the best bet to get, and once you see this you must see Two Towers again! I know I will!",1041724800,,1158,4.572115384615385

The LOTR The Fellowship of the Ring is great in its grandeur & magnitude. With that being writ you just cant stop there, many  words of praise would fit in describing it.  The dept of the story, the believability of its chracters and events in the film is strong.  Never has a film have a story this engaging been made soooo well. The voyages of Sinbad movies in the past were, well, good ones, if not bad, but somehow the LOTR story pale them in comparison - or, hey, maybe there cant be any point of comparison at all coz this, The Fellowship of the Rings is told so effectively its like watching a retelling of true events of long ago. They are so real, deep & engaging and not feeling like a very good invention at all. It just feels sooo REAL !!!

1317299,5,B00003CWT6,"I have previously thought that seeing some movies was like going to church.  Even the title ""Saving Private Ryan"" suggests a consideration of something more than merely winning WWII, a major conflict in the middle of the 20th century which might never rest in peace without this kind of sugarcoating.  The main effect of the commentary and additional information included in this set is to show how J.R.R. Tolkien's is more than an allegory for such situations.  As a popular series of book, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has an audience that rewards the highest expectations as much as most congregations that gather weekly for services together.  Among the people who worked on this movie were some fans known for the artistic recreation of Middle Earth, whose devotion to capturing the reality of forgotten things stimulated all who were involved.  It is reality, more than philosophy, which is the foundation for everything that lies so deep within our psyches that even the music *works* to the satisfaction of people who finally appreciate what has been created.
THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is mainly an introduction, and the theatrical version cut scenes mainly to maintain a momentum that hardly fit that role.  THE TWO TOWERS is more impressive in its theatrical release.  The ominous threat of wanton destruction is brought much closer to reality by the end of that movie.  Having these DVDs helped me appreciate the movie cycle as a set that is greater than any individual movie.  This is based on a set of books which was one of the most popular stories of the 20th century, which was when I read it at college.  Some people might have had college courses on Tolkien, and he taught in England, usually a long way from whereever I was at the time.  Educated people couldn't seem to come up with anything better than this.",1041638400,,1823,4.792332268370607

when first seeing this movie i thought it was ok, good but not outstanding.  but after seeing it a second time i was hooked.  i felt the emotions the characters on screen felt like i was the 10th member of the fellowship.  if you only have seen the movie once spend the extra 4 bucks to rent it again and see what you might have missed the first time.
i have read the LOTR series and it really helps in understanding the complexities of the movie and the subtle details in the world of middle earth. so if you haven't seen it yet...what are you waiting for? and if you have only seen it once...your crazy, see it again!",1041638400,,835,4.135802469135802
1317301,5,B00003CWT6,"I never read the books. I knew nothing of the plot. I didn't even know the meaning of the rings. I didn't even bother to see this move in the theaters. I'd heard the hype, and even the praise of some of my friends. But fantasyland is not my favorite movie genre. Curiosity eventually got the best of me, so I borrowed a neighbor's dvd copy one day during summer vacation. Little did I know what I was getting myself into...
Five minutes into the film and I could already feel its hook sinking into my flesh. LOTR transports the viewer to the world of Tolkien's Middle Earth - and it's more wonderous, beautiful, and horrifying than my wildest and darkest thoughts could ever have imagined. I found it nearly impossible to get the film out of my mind, for weeks afterwards. It is, perhaps, the greatest fictional story of all time.
To date, I've watched the Fellowship of the Rings three times through, and I love it more and more after each viewing. The film is absolutely beautiful. Tolkien's story is timeless.
The dvd I watched during the summer was the original theater cut. I bought this extended version the week it came out. The extra 30 minutes found on this director's cut is well worth the purchase. (Give your old copy away to someone who hasn't seen the film yet!) The extra time makes some points more clear (great for a Tolkein novice such as I), and elaborates on many important elements of the storyline which made my experience even more enjoyable. The two discs of bonus features are also very entertaining, and help one appreciate the scale and scope of this production.
There's also a fantastically funny ""easter egg"" on disc one - the MTV recreation of the Council of Elrond starring Jack Black.  Probably not appropriate for kids, however.  To view the ""easter egg,"" use the scene selection menu.  Go to scene 27, ""The Council of Elrond.""  While this scene is highlighted, used the down arrow on your remote to bring up a ring.  Select enter on your remote and the ""easter egg"" will play.

After all, it IS the movie that you want, and I doubt most folks would want to watch the movie and the 4 other discs each time they wanted to see the movie.
Perhaps the nicest extra in the set is the bookends, since they are pretty nice if you are a fan of the movies, but this set more than anything will give you more than you ever wanted to know.

1317352,3,B00003CWT6,"When historians finally have enough distance from our times to look at them upon with a certain objectivity, they will no doubt see a strange irony in the fact that, but a few months after the event that still lives so vividly in our memory that we scarce need even recall it by name, Americans would flock to the theaters for the first installment of a trilogy whose second part has no other name than the""The Two Towers."" Many, no doubt, find in these films only escape into a so-called fantasy world - as if the most flourishing products of our imagination, like our dreams, don't often press into the very heart of things. And some are perhaps so jaded that they will discover in the form our newly-baptized axis of evil. But hopefully there are others astute enough to realize that Bin Laden and North Korea (and perhaps some day we might even be so bold as to say the same about Hitler, Stalin...) are nothing more than footnotes to history, whereas its deeper core consists solely in the seemingly unstoppable advance of humankind's dominion over nature and thereby over himself, moving towards no other end than man's self-servitude to a power that has no other end than power itself. And they will likely wonder why the same people who seemed to gasp and shudder at sight of the Twin Tower's collapse, would take pleasure in its cinematic repetition - as if, in the fantastic privacy of the movie theater, we might confess what we dare not admit to ourselves: that we delighted even as we shuddered, and that our terror and sadness, however deeply felt, was not without a certain pleasure at the sight of something that, amidst all the endless hyperbole, finally seemed to fit the measure and key of the times.
 More than any other Hollywood ""fantasy"" epic that I can think of, this film had a chance to take a more reflective stance towards ""terror."" Gone is the vision of a ""good empire"" or ""confederation,"" and other such remnants of cold-war Ideology. Here, more than anywhere, it seems clear: all ""empires"" are evil, and above all the empire over nature itself. And yet it remains hovering in schizoid Hollywood delirium. The essence of Americanism, a philosopher once said, consists in the absolute lack of measure. The Twin Towers, the limitless extension of the ""American Way,"" are only the most obvious signs of this infinite immoderateness in everything. With every year, Hollywood's product become more gargantuan, more titanic - with subtlety, cinematic coloratura, silence tossed to the wind in favor of a string of gestures, each grander than the next. ""The Ring,"" sadly, is no exception. Hobbits notwithstanding, we find only destruction of the immoderate painted in such immoderate, fantastic strokes, that no space for reflection and questioning remains. .",1041465600,,2782,4.8691983122362865

The Aragornath bookmarks were a very special touch. Also, the National Geographic gives a descriptive detailed review of how J.R.R. Tolkien got started with the book and so does the four disc DVD. My child enjoyed it and has become a fan ever since. The extra two DVDs were great because it had lots of information from the cast and crew. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Tolkien fan or a Peter Jackson fan. But it is not for the impatient because the movie does take about three hours. The holographic cards were a special touch to the set. And the free movie ticket to go see the Two Towers was great.",1041465600,,787,4.184210526315789
1317354,5,B00003CWT6,"First, I should mention that I loved Tolkein's writings, and read the LOTR trilogy (along with the prequel, The Hobbit) probably 3 or 4 times while growing up.
I first saw LOTR in the theatre upon its release, and was mesmerized. For the most part, it really brought what I had read to life. However, the people with whom I saw the movie had not read the books, and I spent a great deal of time explaining things. I pre-ordered this extended version, first because of the additional footage, but second because I received with my order a coupon for a free movie ticket to see the second movie, The Two Towers.
Everything that was added to the special edition version is wonderful. Some of it is necessary to the story, other times it simply embelishes it. But there is not a part in this extended version that is not beautifully done. Peter Jackson et al decided to include some more information explaining hobbits in general, and this is quite welcome. They also added the scene depicting the wood elves leaving for the ship to sail West. I can't even begin to go over every scene that was added or extended. Suffice to say, though, every single one was nicely done.
Which brings me to my last point: all of the additional material is worked into the movie as it progresses. Howard Shore actually wrote and recorded music to go with the additional parts, and they are woven into the movie, rather than adding them to the DVD as a ""Deleted Scenes"" section. This, in my opinion, is what makes this edition perfect. Sometimes when I watch deleted scenes on a DVD, I'm left wondering ""Where did this happen?"". But the way this is done, you never have to wonder in what context something happened.
All in all, I don't hesitate a second when someone asks if this version is worth the extra few dollars. Without a doubt, this is one of the finest DVD's I own.",1041465600,11,1853,4.501483679525222
1317355,5,B00003CWT6,"It seems almost impossible, but Peter Jackson's film of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" achieves the very sense of the first book of in Tolkien's trilogy. In addition, it covers, cleverly, the events of ""The Hobbit"" by having Bilbo Baggins begin the film, writing his memoirs on the eve of his farewell party in The Shire. This is just one example of how the screenwriters were able to merge so much expository information into the limited time available during a film. The scenery is nothing short of amazing; this IS The Shire, looking like a fairy version of pastoral England (filmed in New Zealand, however) and the hobbit lodges are cleverly constructed. The camera and sets trick your eye into seeing the hobbits as halflings next to the normal sized Gandalf the Wizard.
Later on in the film, computer graphics help to create monumental battle scenes against the Orcs and Wraiths. The only problem is that these scenes tend to drag, and even though this is a magical story, fifty or so Orcs against the Nine of the Fellowship seems a bit hard to accept on the screen. And it is all too apparent that the filmmakers chose to slow the pace down when they went for a trilogy rather than a single film for the entire Lord of the Rings cycle. This makes the second half of the film, on the second DVD, a bit slow and dreary--especially as it is filmed predominantly in gray tones rather than the bright colors of The Shire.  You will need a bit of ""sitzfleisch"" (patience) to sit through the second half.
This is just quibbling, however. The script and the actors are amazing, the special effects and computer graphics dramatic and true to the book. Elijah Woods as Frodo never fails to capture the screen with his unearthly looks and fine acting. Sir Ian McKellen's Gandalf is just right--he doesn't dominate Frodo, but supports him ably. We are treated to a host of marvelous cast members, from Liv Tyler as Arwen, Sean Bean (Sharp's Rifles) as Boromir, Cate Blanchett as the unearthly elf queen Galadriel, Hugo Weaving (""The Matrix"") as Elrond well, I could go on but the cast is just perfect in every choice. ""The Fellowship of the Ring""  is a monumental achievement in film and will win over even those who are not fans of Tolkien.
Now, to the extras: the bio of Tolkien is a must-see. His childhood in Birmingham, England and his education at Oxford give important background into how he was able to create such a complete mythical world, with language, alphabet and sagas. His moral take on The Ring as a symbol of humanity's choice to follow Evil is enlightening. The interviews with the script writers is equally interesting. All in all, DISC 4: ""From Vision to Reality"" is an important adjunct to viewing the film. I wasn't a particular Tolkien fan, though I read the books as a child. I really now am interested in Tolkien, and this film did more than justice to a monumental classic.",1041465600,,2916,4.638297872340425
1317356,5,B00003CWT6,"I must admit that the first time I saw Lord of the Rings, I fell asleep.. assuming that my falling asleep meant I didn't like the movie, I didn't attempt to watch it again until I saw this DVD set and figured it was a great value for the price.
WOW, what I missed!  I'm glad that I never actually saw the original theatrical version, because this extended version of the film is true to the book I knew and loved as a kid.
While 4 DVD's seems like a lot to watch (and you probably WON'T watch them all in one sitting) there is just so much out there to see.  This was truly one of the most ambitious theatrical projects ever taken on, and the extra DVD's provide so much background on the story, the people involved in making the film (a cast and crew of thousands!) and the intricate attention to detail in every sword, costume and setting.  There are extensive interviews with the director, the producers, stars, artists and screenwriters and they all give their take on why the story and the film were so important.
For a few dollars (and a few hours) more, you really can get a fuller experience from the first installment of the film, and it makes the second film that much more enjoyable.  Can't wait for the third installment.

1317357,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson had a good idea when he relased the Special Extended Edition of The Fellowship of the Ring. Some of the additional scenes make the movie more compelling. For instance, Frodo and Sam watch a group of Elves go off into the after life, and Sam feels sadness in watching this. Also, the scene that shows Merry and Pippin fighting the Urak-Hai (spelling?) alongside Boromir before he is pierced by three arrows is more compelling. In the original theatrical release, they're just standing there watching him die, making it look like they're cowards. So, I was glad to see this footage added to that combat scene. Finally, the hours of additional background information provided in discs three and four give you an appreciation for what Peter Jackson and his crew had to do to bring this storyline to the big screen. In summary, the Special Extended Edition of Fellowship of the Ring is first rate, and I hope this carries over to the other movies when they're released on DVD.",1041465600,,985,4.766081871345029
1317397,2,B00003CWT6,"I am very familiar with the material, have read the books many times, including the Silmarillion (the sign of a true Tolkien fan!)  I don't understand how anyone could say the theatrical release was true to the original book.  I expect them to change a lot of the story, but in several places they mangled the story.  First, the fireworks scene where Pippen and Merry set of the fireworks and are left with soot on their faces!  Horribly written scene, since it seemed more like the three stooges than Tolkien, not to mention the fact that they would have received 3rd degree burns for their effort!
There are many other problems with the first half of the movie, especially the Council of Elrond, since they had nothing to really hold a council about by that time (anyone who's read the book knows the council is as much about the fate of Middle Earth as the ring, although the two are connected. There just isn't much to discuss here, leaving it almost superfluous. They should have left something to discuss, such as Saruman's betrayal, instead of showing it earlier in the movie.) Boromir actually licked his lips when he saw the ring (to demonstrate his greed) as if he were looking at a steak!  Beginnings are very important to me, since they pull you into the story, and even though the second half is much, much better, I was already disappointed by that time.
BUT READ ON . . . don't buy the first DVD release!  Buy the extended version Director's Cut!  It makes up for almost all the problems I've stated above and is so much better that I would rate it 3 1/2 stars instead of 2 (it would get 4 except that stupid fireworks scene is still there.)  I have never seen a DVD release that was so incredibly better than the theatrical release that is almost a different movie.

The additional footage is sprinkled throughout the movie and I found it entertaining and amusing.  I particularly enjoyed the addition of Gandalf's grumpy but humorous dialog with the Hobbits.  The additional footage adds about a half hour to the length of the movie, but it is not fatiguing at all.

This movie had stunning scenery, great special effects and good acting which is hard to find these days all in one movie.  The extended version of the DVD is even better.  There is more character building and more scenes from the book.  And even some not from the book but helped tell more of the background for those who haven't read the books.  I hope they do an extended version DVD for the next two movies as well!",1041292800,,665,4.357723577235772
1317402,5,B00003CWT6,"The first thing that strikes you about Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring is that the production values are incredible and it looks oh-my-god gorgeous.  If you didn't know better and hadn't seen some of the earlier abortive attempts, that could almost distract you from the fact that for once, this movie is almost TOTALLY faithful to the book.  If you liked the books, but were disappointed by the Rankin-Bass animated Hobbit or the confused, mangled 1990 animation-over-film Lord of the Rings that ended halfway through what should have been The Two Towers, you should consider this movie -- and especially, this VERSION of this movie -- a must-see.
OK, granted, there are minor changes here and there for filmability, and to adapt to the fact that it's not really possible to fit all the dialog of the original book into a movie people will sit still to watch.  But by the standards of any typical Hollywood ""adaptation"", this is verbatim chapter-and-verse.  Dear old Professor Tolkien would be proud.
The Shire is unmistakeably the Shire.  The Hobbits and Gandalf are perfectly true to character, Strider ""looks foul but feels fair"", the Ringwraiths are perfectly malevolent, and Rivendell perfectly beautiful.  (Not to mention Arwen Evenstar...  be still, my beating heart.  In the words of a good friend, ""Must remember:  Aloof, unavailable elf-princess.  Aloof, unavailable elf-princess."")  Caradhras is as threateningly impassable as ever, although in that scene you'll notice a significant divergence from the book.  (If you've read the books, it'll jump out at you.  If you haven't, you probably won't care.)  And then there's Moria ... and oh, my, there's Khazad-Dum.  You will dream yourself in Khazad-Dum.  It's breathtaking.  And then ... there's the Balrog.
So, you've been playing AD&D for twenty years, and you think you know all about Balrogs, huh?  Well, let me tell you, you don't know a Balrog from a hole in the ground, until you've seen Fellowship of the Ring's Balrog.  ""Who'll kill the Balrog, who'll kill the Balrog / You kill the Balrog, while I climb a tree...""
Buddy, there ain't no tree high enough.  Not even in Middle-Earth.  Fellowship of the Ring would almost be worth it for the Balrog alone.
I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Peter Jackson's production of Fellowship of the Ring, particularly in its full-length extended edition, has redefined the state of the art and set the standard that the rest of the movie industry will be trying to catch up to for probably the next ten years.  And without giving anything away, The Two Towers (which, at the time of writing this review, hit theaters two weeks ago) continues to set the standard ... it's at least as good, if not better.  I can hardly wait to see what goes into the extended version of The Two Towers.  And then we have another year to wait for Return of the King.
...Anyone got a time machine?  I'm not sure my heart will stand the suspense.",1041292800,,2953,4.869739478957916
1317403,5,B00003CWT6,"An amazing good vs evil adventure.  The hours flew by, I was totally immersed in every scene, the scenery was beautiful right down to Bilbos front door.  I wish they would have included Tom Bombadil in the movie somehow though.  You gotta read the book again before you see the movie. The transformation from book to screen was wonderfully done.",1041292800,,345,4.716666666666667
1317404,5,B00003CWT6,"Wow, this Extended Version DVD is definitely an exceptional buy! I was disappointed with the regular release version when there were no director's commentary or other good extras and then heard about this DVD set. I had to get it! And was not at all disappointed. I first thought the extra footage was mainly for fans of the book, but I think anyone that is into the movies will find the extra footage worth watching. There's a whole extra introduction at the beginning on hobbits that is charming, and of course the extended gift-giving in Lothlorien. But even more there is more interaction of the characters and story development that explains a lot more. While it does change the pacing of the movie somewhat, this should not be an issue if you are watching at home on your own time.
Then we have the commentaries. I haven't got through all of them, but they are well done and give you a lot of great information on the making of the movie, particularly how Jackson created the illusion of the hobbits being so small and even more, why they felt certain changes from the book were necessary. You have TWO whole more DVDs full of documentaries and extras, tons of images and of course, a look ahead to Two Towers. I was tickled to also get a free ticket to the Two Towers, but that expires 12/31/02 if you haven't bought it yet.
It's too bad the whole movie couldn't fit on one DVD but that's a minor nit. There's so much here and of course, the movie itself is a masterpiece, that it's only natural that it would be one of the largest DVD sets released for a single movie. And just think, by the time the last movie comes out, we'll have TWELVE DVDs to deal with the whole series.",1041292800,,1684,4.418006430868167

1317406,5,B00003CWT6,"Having read and loved all of Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" novels, I initially had pretty low expectations of Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"". I approached this film fearing that, through a combination of vital omissions and an excessive reliance on special affects, it would fail to compliment the experience of reading the book. Boy was I wrong! Yes, this film does omit some of the minor characters, but all of the principle players are included and portrayed superbly. Tolkien's beloved songs are completely excised, but with all due respect to the artist and his passion for inventing languages, those were the elements of the trilogy that I least enjoyed. Most importantly, I can't imagine a more perfect handling of special effects than Jackson's treatment of them in this film. Instead of relying heavily on special affects purely for the sake of realism (as in the Jurassic Park films, for example), Jackson sort of creates a middle ground in which the special affects and the characters are tailored to create the fabled atmosphere of Middle Earth. The special effects are real, but not too real. Both the costumes and the delivery of the actors are redolent of fantasy and fable, but never cease to be believable. After watching this film, I found that my recollections of it blended seamlessly with my recollections of the book, which was a sure indication that Jackson got it right.",1041206400,,1431,4.917355371900826
1317447,5,B00003CWT6,"I love the Lord of the Rings.  The story, the movie, and any and all related. I first discovered the story of the one ring by watching about an hour of its animated feature.  I love animation, and all the realism of the animated characters in the 'fellowship of the ring' cartoon really enamoured me at the time .  Also, I had never seen a cartoon deal with such a dark issue in so human a way before.  This was when I was 10, and seeing the movie again, after seeing greater works of animation, reveals many weaknesses.  The greatest of which I discovered after reading books - the cartoon molested the story.  But I still owe that film much gratitude for first introducing me to the exhaustive story of Sauron and the One Ring.
A friend [Sean Mullin - thank you man] really piqued my interest in the 'fellowship' as it neared it's premiere, when he began to summarise the backstory of the ring. I  was immediately very interested, and horrified [yet attracted] to the story of the Nazgul.  I remember persevering through Tolkien's [long] introduction to the book just so I could see how these small hobbits would survive such terrible creatures as these Ringwraiths.  The sheer palpable sense of evil was frightening and entrancing.  I wanted to know the ending to the story I had seen in cartoon form so long ago.  So I read the books.
The book trilogy of the 'Lord of the Rings' is easily one of the most involving, emotional journeys I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  I remember the sadness I felt at having to say goodbye to characters I had grown to love and hope for [Sam and Frodo especially - but especally Samwise the Brave].  By then, another creature had caught my interest - Gollum.  Out of all the creatures in the story, his corrupted nature shocked and gripped me the most.  The pictures some artists have created to capture his persona are the most disturbing and the most memorable.  All these aspects truly cemented my love for Tolkien's world.
I read these books WHILE Peter Jackson's movie was in theaters.  I would read several chapters, see the movie, finish the next book, see the movie again, and so on.  The fact that Peter's movie fit so perfectly in my perception of Tolkien's world, DESPITE the changes he made, really sold me out to the film.  So many visuals stick in your head long after you watch the film!  Especially the flying moth set against the horrific destruction of the trees around isengard, and gwaihir's triumphant soaring over the mountains of new zealand.  Special mention to Howard Shore's endearing score - have you ever read the trilogy while listening to this score?  It's like a blanket of imagination that keeps your visual imagery of middle-earth warm and sharply focused. His score does for the mind exactly what the film does.  That word leitmotif is a great word, and Howard Shore's leitmotif's in this film keep me in awe of it's majestic splendour.  My favorites are the boys choir themes of nature, rivendell's elven choir, and the chanting dwarfsmen of moria.
Repeated viewing after reading the books DID make me feel dissapointed that great parts of the story were missing from the film, but the Special Extended Edition of the 'fellowship of the ring' more than made up for that.  I can't even imagine Gandalf, Bilbo, or Samwise Gamgee as anyone other than Ian Mckellen, Ian Holm, and Rudy [I mean, Sean Astin] anymore!  Seeing the film over and over, and seeing how much love Peter Jackson and the entire production crew of the films put into making the films, has helped me decide to trust their instincts, and welcome the films as a great illustration of a magnificent story.
What the Peter Jackson crew want is to honor tolkien's world, and give us as much a joy of discovering and experiencing the story of that world, as modern technology, special effects, and excellent acting can give.  The greatest strength of the films is it's crew.  It's so obvious they love the story as much as we do.  It feels like they are making the film to please the fans of the story, and have us in mind with every single decision.  The writers of the script are as aware and in love with the story as any of us; their love affair with the stories of Tolkien probably has many more years growth than many of us.
It's been a pleasure to experience the lord of the rings through J.R.R. Tolkien's novels, and especially through the incredible film, wonderful extra features and many deeply interesting and intimate appendices of this magnificently presented DvD.",1041206400,,4524,4.654088050314465

Behind-the-scenes stuff fascinates me and my expectations have been exceeded beyond my wildest imagination.

1317450,5,B00003CWT6,"Most people hate reading books in school. I am one of those people. In the eighth grade, we were forced to read 'The Hobbit'. I hated it, but I managed to retain some of the names, places, and events of the book. Then, before seeing Rush Hour 2, I saw a preview for a movie called 'Lord of the Rings'. One of the names mentioned was 'Bilbo Baggins'. That name, not being one you hear every day, turned on a lightbulb in my head. I kept watching the preview, and I discovered how wonderful these books really are, just through the trailer. I saw the movie a couple days after it came out, and fell in love with it. I ended up seeing it 12 times in the theater, seeing something new every time. The day it came available for pre-order, I ordered mine, counting down the days. As you can see, this movie can captivate even the most indifferent person. I fell in love with the beautiful Rivendell, the elf city, and the Shire. I was captivated by the realness of Frodo. Gandalf. Legolas. Aragorn. Arwen. Gimli. Boromir. Elrond. Saruman. Everybody just seemed to be so real! Peter Jackson does a phenomenal job putting these books to life. You may be wondering how I know, because I only read the Hobbit. After seeing this movie, I felt the need to read all the books - and I did. They are just as good as the movies - which shows how parallel the movies are with the books. My advice to you is - buy this movie, watch it many times. You will not be disappointed.",1041206400,,1458,4.286231884057971

I can not wait for The Two Towers, and The Return Of The King to come out so I can buy them. I Highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you love stories of action/adventure or whatever. I bought this DVD the day it came out and I LOVE it so much! There are TONS of special features! Buy it to watch them! See this amazing movie at least once!",1041206400,,702,4.057553956834532
1317452,2,B00003CWT6,"I'm not sure what the actual running time of the extended edition is. It felt like about eight hours, and it took a conscious effort of will to sit through it for the duration. I never saw the theatrical release, but it couldn't have been much better, even if it were shortened by an hour or more: this is a very ponderous, overblown, over-hyped movie, full of gimmick but bereft of substance.
If there were an Academy Award for Most Ham-Handed, Self-Important Direction, Peter Jackson would have won, ham-hands down. Jackson's direction has all the subtle nuance of a jackboot to the groin; in every scene we sense him just off camera shouting ""Look at me! I'm directing a REALLY IMPORTANT EPIC MOVIE!"" But the final effect of his over-strained, over-reaching effort to make everything extra-big, extra-important and extra-colossal is merely to make a potentially good movie into a dead weight, lacking any importance or even anything of interest.
The script is sketchy at best, devoid of anything resembling character development or cohesiveness, and providing none of the depth of the original Tolkein books. The actors stumble through each scene as if walking to death row, delivering somnolent, wooden performances, and looking as if they'd rather be somewhere else. Not one character comes through as likable, or interesting, or even vaguely worth caring about. Two hours into this ""epic"" I started wishing they'd just give the ring back to Gollum and all go home, so I could move on to something interesting.
The background score, courtesy of Howard Shore, is as self-important and heavy-handed and tedious as the direction, and at times it puffs up and swells to the point of treading on the lines being spoken. (Fortunately, this doesn't make much difference insofar as exposition, and it won't affect your ability to follow the story; just go with the flow into the Next Big Scene with the assurance that you haven't missed anything important.)
What this movie does have plenty of is Special Effects, and that seems to be what audiences want these days. It's a sad fact of modern day movie-making, but it had to happen someday: the computer is more important here than the script, the actors, the story, or the director. It's made very clear throughout, in every scene, in every frame, that whiz-bang super-duper eye-popping effects were on everybody's mind, and no doubt lots of geek hours and tons of techno bucks went into the production to make it all look just so. The only problem is, it ends up looking just so-so: the effects and the swooping camera shots are used, overused and abused so much that there's really nothing all that impressive about it; there was nothing in this movie that wasn't done better fifteen years ago in Willow, where the effects were perhaps less sophisticated, but were more judiciously applied and better integrated into a much better movie.
In fact, if you're looking for a good fantasy adventure to add to your collection, just pick up a copy of Willow. The Fellowship Of The Ring may be almost obligatory to watch once, given all its hype and the marketing mega-blitz that accompanied it, but it isn't a movie to watch again and again, so save some money by just renting it. With the money you save, you can buy Willow and get excellent performances, deft direction, a good score, and plenty of passion, humor, and excitement. And it even has a village full of little people, lots of sorcery and magic, and a terrific battle between good and evil, all in a movie that's worth watching more than once.
Oh, and as for the dozen (or forty, or whatever it is) hours of ""extras"" and ""special features"" that accompany the movie: I didn't watch them. I'll concede that it's possible that many hours of self-congratulatory documentary about ""How We Made This Movie & Ain't It Impressive"" could, maybe, perhaps, be more interesting than the movie itself. But I'm not willing to invest the time to find out. All that extra stuff just looks like a self-conscious effort by New Line Cinema to cover up for the feature's lack of substance. Maybe if they'd put all that time and money and effort into the feature film, instead of the ""Look What We Did!"" extras, they'd have made a good movie. Maybe.",1041206400,2,4234,4.8173076923076925

Not only could the storyline have been told in 1/2 hour instead of 2 1/2, but adding to the torture was one action scene after another being chopped to death by one speech after another!  What gives?  The excruitiating pain of getting to the point in this movie was making my butt numb.  Why cram a series of wonderfully written and engrossing books into 3 movies?  The confusing hops from one country to another - one battle to another - one speech to another - one kill/death to another - was getting on my last nerve and causing people to actually walk out of the theater.

Most of the documentaries on DVDs are kind of [inferior productions] made for HBO deals but all the documentaries on these discs are full of insight and knowledge.
I heard somewhere that P.T. Anderson (director of Punch Drunk Love) never went to film school - instead he learned everything he knows about filmmaking from watching the commentary on laserdiscs.  Well I DID go to film school and this DVD is easily as educating (and much less expensive) than any class at USC.

The graphics cannot be put to words because they are so unbelievable. If you did not see this movie in theatres, you clearly are missing out on a masterpiece.

DVD: You want to know how all of these things, mentioned above, were acheived?  How deeply did the cast study Tolkien's books?  Why did Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) carry around his character's sword wherever he went?  How much time did Peter Jackson (the brilliant director of the Lord of the Rins series) put into this trilogy?  All of these questions, and more, are answered in this DVD.  First off, 30 minutes of additional material were added to this release, intergrated seemlessly to the theatrical release.  New music was composed for it and for the die hard fan or the casual fan, these are entertaining scenes.
The DVD comes with two discs packed with extras, hours and hours of them.  I have watched them all, from how the cast bonded during their 15 month shoot in New Zealand to how they got the Orcs to sound like cockaroaches. I plan to watch it all again.

1317554,5,B00003CWT6,"Director Peter Jackson, whom for years I felt was very underrated and underappreciated after crafting such films like Dead Alive, Bad Taste, and The Frighteners (all of which proved his power of imagination over budget) managed to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings saga to the big screen almost flawlessly.  Blending top notch CGI animation (most of which blows away anything offered by George Lucas), old camera tricks (to make the actors playing hobbits and dwarves appear smaller than humans and elves), and the beauty of New Zealand as a backdrop, Jackson has brought Tolkien's visionary Middle Earth to life, and old Tolkien fans could not be happier.  Elijah Wood (Frodo), Ian McKellen (Gandalf), and Viggo Mortenson (Aragorn) are all fantastic in their roles (Mortenson will become a much bigger star than he already is), and the rest of the all star cast includes Liv Tyler, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davis, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Sean Bean, Cate Blanchet, and Ian Holm; all of which give quite memorable performances.  The action scenes are nicely put together, but sometimes the fight scenes can become a bit blurry and incoherent, but that is only a minor complaint.  All in all, even if you've never read the original books by Tolkien, you will find something to love with this first installment of the Lord of the Rings.  This will be the Star Wars Trilogy for a new generation, and will be cherished for years to come.",1041033600,7,1463,4.930894308943089
1317555,5,B00003CWT6,"If you're reading this review in order to help you make a decision whether or not you should buy this DVD set. I said, ""Buy it!!"" Personally, I already love the original movie showed in theater but I think, I love this extended edition much more. The story flows better in this edition from the incorporation of many deleted scenes. The story was expanded and showed details and history of middle earth so you understand the story more. This makes this movie is not just another fantasy one but a very Brilliant Tolkien's masterpiece. Although, I'd like to say, die-hard Tolkien fans will not see 'Tom Bombadil' in the movie as we expected, the rest of movie will not disappoint you a bit. I read the book and I LOVE the book  and the movie is something that jumped right off the book. In this expanded DVD set, the first two discs are mainly movie. There're some commentary about the movie in each one. The last two discs is everything behind the making of The fellowship of the ring. It's two and a half hours on the first one and around three and a half on the other. This doculmentary is so much in details and you will never find it anywhere else. It starts out with how they came up with idea to make one of Tolkien's legendary books into movie. How they adapted the book into an exquisite screenplay, the storyboard and casting. It goes on to making middle earth, locations, shooting the movie, post production and finally the day the movie came out. It's an excellent documentary about the movie I've ever seen.... So If you're still deciding which one you should pick, the original movie DVD or this extended edition DVD... Believe me, pick this one and you will love it as much as I do..Happy watching!!",1041033600,,1713,4.508038585209003
1317556,5,B00003CWT6,"For anyone who was disappointed with the theatrical version of The Fellowship of the Ring because it did not follow the book exactly the way they thought it would, this special extended version of FOTR may be good to watch, although it does leave out Tom Bombadil and the Old Forest. It does contain several new and exciting sequences, such as an extended sequence of Hobbiton, with Bilbo Baggins writing a document entitled ""Concerning Hobbits"" which happens to be what the prologue of the book is. Other new scenes include, extended shots of Caras Galadhon and also a sequence in which Galadriel imparts gifts to each member of the Fellowship of the Ring. There is more character development, although it is mostly character development for Aragorn, showing his burden of lineage in a greater light. Other new scenes include Extended coverage of Frodo's journey with Samwise, Merry, Pippin and Aragorn before they reach Weathertop, where the four Hobbits are attacked by Ringwraiths, additional conversation scenes at the part where the Fellowship reaches the Gate of Moria, the Council of Elrond sequence is enhanced and lasts a bit longer.
This special extended version of the theatrical film is not to be missed by anybody who is a devout Lord of the Rings fan, as I am. This extended version conveys more of J.R.R. Tolkien's world lending even more credit to the book.
Also included at the end is a special feature, ""A Day in the Life of a Hobbit"", which takes you behind the scenes 6to the making of Fellowship and includes interviews with Elijah Wood (who plays Frodo Baggins) Dominic Monaghan (who plays Merry Brandybuck) Billy Boyd (who plays Pippin Took) Sean Astin (who plays Sam Gamgee) and Peter Jackson (the director).

1317590,5,B00003CWT6,"As the first movie in the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring is a grand, emotional and rousing film that brought the Fantasy genre to another level.  What the books did for bringing Fantasy genre to adults, this movie did for Fantasy genre in movies.  Theere is so much t enjoy, awe, and rave about this movie that we could start talking at noon and end at midnight.  New Zealand director Peter Jackson has given the movies a sense of unbelievable scope, but also gives us memorable characters that stick with us long after Frodo and Sam make their way into Mordor.
For those who don't know the story from the books, Frodo (Elijah Wood) is a hobbit, a small, peace-loving creature who really wants to do with little in the rest of the world, even though he often begs Gandalf (Ian Mckallen) for news of the outside world.  But he soons inherits from his uncle a powerful Ring, that was made three thousand years ago by a ruthless being named Sauron, whose one goal was to control all life in Middle-Earth.  Now, he has regained enough power to start gathering an army and once again launch an assault on the now dwindled forces of resistance of Middle-Earth.  Frodo, along with his faithful friends Sam (Sean Astin), Merry and Pippin, flee to the Elf haven of Rivendell where a Fellowship is made of the dominate races of Middle-Earth.  Their mission is to destroy the Ring and end forever the threat of Sauron.
Along with that intricate plot, the acting is superb.  English vets Ian McKallen and Christopher Lee (Saruman) lead the way with masterful performances and they show off their talents as well groomed and experienced actors.  But there are more than just the wisdom:  the young actors who portay the hobbits are just wonderful and delightful to watch.  Not to mention Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Ryes Davis (Gimli), Liv Tyler (Arwen), Hugo Weaving (Elrond) and Cate Blanchet (Galadreil) all give memorable performances.
Then they are the matter of the special effects.  They are spectacular.  From the opening battle sequence on the slopes of Mount Doom, the panorama shots of Hobbiton, the computerized orcs in the halls of Moria and especially the the world Frodo enters when he wears the Ring of Power are wonders of CGI and the massive pre-production that went on before the actual filming began.  The oscar for best visual effects went to the right place.
One other reason why the movie was such a success was because of the many moods, settings and styles that the film executes with grace and near perfection.  We have action in the mountain of Moria; romance in Rivendell; suspence in the chase between Arwen and Frodo and the ominous Ringwraiths; and effective comic relief from Merry and Pippin.  Almost anyone can find something to enjoy in this movie.
You can find this movie to be one of the best ever made.  It is executed so well, the story so well told and the scope so epic that you cannot help but be in awe.  Yeah its three hourslond, but it is one you will enjoy without noticing or feeling the time.  I seen other movies half as long but they felt slow and insipid.  This one movie is not one of them.",1040947200,,3186,4.645276292335116
1317591,4,B00003CWT6,"While the extended edition is great, don't expect a total of 30 minutes of new footage.  What the idiots don't tell you is that 20 minutes of that is nothing more than a listing of the fan club members in the credits.  Like who in the heck cares!  I was expecting a LOT more footage.  The extra footage was great, but nowhere near what I expected.  I hope these liars do better on the next extended edition!!",1040947200,,408,4.246753246753247
1317592,5,B00003CWT6,"Wow.  This is easily the best DVD ever made.
This movie does an amazing job of bringing Tolkien to life on the big screen.  Not everything is perfect, and true fans will probably find something to complain about, but overall you won't be disappointed.  This film is a very faithful adaption with fine acting, visuals straight from Tolkien's favorite artists, and dialoge right of the books.
This special extended version is definitely the best version.  This is the film for those of you who loved the books, who were annoyed at the changes and insane pacing of the theatrical release.  The 30 extra minutes of material aren't just a few deleted scenes here and there, but actually hundreds of extra shots and scenes, ranging from a few seconds to 4-5 minutes long.  The additions aren't perfect, but mostly good.  You'll find a longer, warmer intro to the Shire, the passing of Elves as Frodo flees the Riders, the gifts of Galadriel, and so on.  Better yet, many important scenes are given just a little extra time, so that you can enjoy and even understand them better.
Match this with some of the best DVD extras you'll ever find.  A total of 4 commentary tracks, plus 2 discs of extras covering every conceivable topic - how did they make hobbits so convincingly small?  Included is a wonderful documentary on Tolkien himself, and the history of this project as the director struggled to get it financed.  There is a map of Middle Earth and the journey of the Fellowship, plus another map of New Zealand and which locations were used.  Wonderful special effects montages take you through the multiple layors without having to click through a million still images (although those are still there).  Even the still images, which I usually hate and avoid, give us information and tell a story.
And the whole thing comes wrapped in a cover that reminds me of my old hardback edition of the book itself.  As an interesting touch, the movie chapter names match the chapter names in the books.  Perfect in every way, I strongly recommend anyone that owns a DVD player to buy this DVD.",1040860800,,2082,4.712707182320442
1317593,5,B00003CWT6,"I never read the Tolkien ring trilogy, nor did I ever have much patience with the cult that formed around it. When I heard that a film version was being produced, I cringed; another ""trekie"" situation I feared and expected. Even when the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was released and received surprisingly (to me) good reviews, I still dismissed it and never even considered seeing it. I just hoped it would go away.
Recently a close friend chastised me for being such a stubborn blockhead, and challenged me to watch it before offering any more of my ""opinions"" about it. Fair enough, I acknowledged, and so I got it and watched it.
My friend was right, I was being a blockhead.  This is a truly amazing film. I rank it among the top five best looking films I've ever seen, and among the top ten best films overall. True, it's somewhat difficult to follow at first, the plot is extraordinarily complex and dense for the film medium. But this rich tale is all in there, and with the DVD set one can watch it as many times as needed to figure out what's happening. I'm still watching it and not yet even close to being bored by the replays, I'm still finding plenty of new things in it.
I still won't join the cult, but I highly recommend at least this extended edition DVD version of this gorgeous, soon to be classic film.  I consider this currently the most advanced film yet made, and it's worth a lot more than the modest price to me, at least.",1040860800,,1444,4.404494382022472

1317595,5,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring was already a five-star film, but this extended version makes it even better. Usually when watching the ""deleted scenes"" on various DVDs I say to myself, ""well I can see why they deleted that scene."" Scenes are usually deleted for a good reason-either they cause the movie to drag on, or do nothing to develop the plot. This is not the case with the new scenes on the extended version of the LOTR. These scenes not only help add more clarity to the plot, but they go a long way in further developing the characters-the lack of which was a common criticism of the theatrical release of the LOTR. The only character that did not receive anymore character development is Legolas.
Add to this how well done these extra and lengthened scenes have been done. Each scene has been edited smoothly into the movie for a seamless experience. Sounds, special effects, and even additional scoring have been added to ensure the same quality throughout. These extra scenes are not essential, but surely add quite a bit to the film, enough so that on future viewings of the LOTR, I will always watch the extended version. The packaging is very well done and with two discs of bonus material, you definitely get your dollar's worth.
My only two criticisms are: 1.) I wish they could have fit the whole film on one disc, but perhaps this was not possible to do and still have all the audio commentaries, and 2.) Since they had four-discs-worth of room to fill, why not include the theatrical version and its bonus features as well, so as to make the four-disc set fully comprehensive?
Hidden bonus: On disc one go to Select a Scene, then go to last page of chapters, push down until you highlight the words ""* extra scene"" and push enter. It will play the MTV spoof on the Council of Elron.",1040860800,3,1799,4.555555555555555
1317596,5,B00003CWT6,"I don't usually review movies but I have to pay tribute to Peter Jackson's impressive film version of LOTR.  Jackson and his team have exercised unusual talent and intelligence in bringing LOTR to the screen.  Jackson and his co-writers made a number of changes in the plot, mainly deleting some subplots and minor characters.  These choices were made very well, not sacrificing any of the dramatic integrity of the story, and are really necessary for keeping a movie, even a 3 part film with long individual components, within reasonable commerical bounds.  Jackson's team is remarkably faithful to Tolkien's vision; their realization of many of the most important setpieces within the books is remarkable.  Most important of all, Jackson and his team have really been faithful to Tolkien's moral vision.  LOTR is a story about the virtues of courage and decency, and the need to and costs of resisting evil.  The LOTR films, with excellent performances from the entire cast, capture this very well.  Jackson has done a particularly good job of making the Ring of Power itself a protagonist in the film.  This insidious source of evil and corruption is the real villain of the piece.  Tolkien's opposition of the pull of the Ring against Frodo's quiet moral courage is tremendous moral drama which Jackson has brought to the fore of his movies.",1040860800,,1345,4.99103139013453
1317597,5,B00003CWT6,"I know I wrote about this before, but I have to again with the release of this special edition of it. I don't know what to say except to paraphrase my review's headlinge. This is a great film, there has not been a fantasy film in history as grand and ambitious as this one, and so brilliantly executed.
I only read the book The Lord Of The Rings once so far but I may do it again someday. Yes, there are things missing from the novel. That doesn't matter here though. The film manages to retain the grand epic spirit of Tolkien's work and conveys it greatly to the viewer.
Thanks to beautiful photography and top knotch special effects that are among the best ever seen in film, if not THE absolute best ever on film, New Zealand is literally and beautifully transformed into Middle Earth, and every inhabitant of it is convincingly presented by an excellent cast of actors and actresses.
And what a bunch we have. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin,  Dominic Monagahn and Billy Boyd play Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, Merrry and Pippin, four Hobbitts with a love for life thrust into an amazing and perilous adventure. Aiding them with power and wisdom are Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn/Strider) and Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellan) both excellent in their roles. Bringing a feminine and regal touch are Liv Tyler (Surprisingly good as Arwen) and Cate Blanchett (an absolutely regal and elegant Galadriel) On the other side we have the incomparable Christopher Lee (Saruman The White) as the perfectly dignified, powerful and utterly ruthless personification of evil. These and the other actors and actresses make you feel as though you are not just watching a film but watching part of the history of an ancient world. The RingWraiths are utterly chilling in particular. THe adventure and action, when it is present, is intense and thrilling to watch. The emotion is genuine and heart-tugging throghout the film.
The world of Middle Earth on film here is breathtaking, aided n tugging at the heart strings by an EXCELLENT musical score by Howard Shore. He has rightfully earned a place beside John Williams, James Horner and Jerry Goldsmith as one of the best movie composers of our time. The use of choirs in the score is utterly POWERFUL whether they do an ominous chilling chant or a heartbreaking lamentation.  The score moves effortlessly from intimate and happy to adventurous and heroic to heartbreakingly sad and beautiful and back again.
All in all I feel quite sure that this film and the entire trilogy based on The Lord Of The Rings, will do and HAS done for fantasy films what the Star Wars movies have done for science fiction and adventure movies. Like the book that it is based on, this film and this trilogy of films is and will be an instant classic. The extra footage in this new extended special DVD edition gives more background and character development, adding things back in that were cut out of the original film release and making scenes that were already great even better than they were before. If you get a chance to see this, go ahead and pick it up and take the wonderful trip back to Middle Earth. You may wish that you never had to leave. If The Two Towers an Return Of The King are as good as The Fellowship Of The Ring, (They should be) then this will go down in history as the greatest and most ambitious film trilogy ever made.",1040860800,7,3337,4.66383701188455

So what?  LOTR is JRR Tolkien's story, not Peter Jackon or whoever wrote the screenplay.  He doesn't have the moral right to change any of it.
""But if they kept everything in the book then the movie would be 8 hours long!"" So what?  If you can't make a completely direct adaption of a book to a movie, don't do it.
Why is it that film is the only art medium that can be hailed as great when all the artist did was butcher another work of art?  To me, adapting the Fellowship of the Ring is like repainting the Mona Lisa so it will appeal to a general audience.  Yeah, it make look neat but you still butchering an already made work of art.
It is people like Jackson who are ruining film to be an actual art medium.  The money used to make this movie could have funded 500 other ORIGINAL movies that could help reshape what we think of as film.  Where are my Donnie Darkos, the Momentos, and my Happinesses?

Final Essay: The Fellowship of the Ring
  ~~~There are several scenes in The Fellowship of the Ring that are left out in the production of the movie.  While many of us understand that the movie could not possibly include every scene of the book for it resulting in being very, very long, there are still people who would have liked a few more scenes included in the movie.  I am one of those people.  While I was reading The Fellowship of the Ring, whether it being because I was just getting started or because it was the longest section, I felt the whole journey between the Shire and the Prancing Pony was very long, in the movie the hobbits seem to breeze through it.  One of the reasons this happens is the obvious absence of Tom Bombadil and Goldberry.  The director may have assumed that since Tom never reappears in the series he is not an important character, yet I feel this was a big part of the start of the adventure.  Another scene missing is when Galadriel gives each member of the fellowship a gift.  These gifts become important later and I feel the scene should have been included.  Other scenes not included are the encounter with Farmer Maggot, the Barrow Wights and getting of the swords.
 ~~~A controversial topic regarding the transformation of the book into a movie include whether the director kept the feeling of the original book.  I have input on both sides of the topic but am not glued exactly to one spot or point.  On one side he did not because of the fast pace of the movie, it seems like you are never watching the same scene for more than twenty seconds, excluding Bilbo's party.  The book gives a very full and complete description of everything, which was a bit left out in the movie.  The special effects with music and lighting make the book a bit ""high tech"" while the books, having existed for more than 50 years, I'm sure were not written with huge effects in mind, but of a long rough adventure with determined characters.  On the other hand, the movie is being made now, in the 21st century, and thus giving the books the privlige of being made with good graphics, locations and lighting as opposed to it being produced thirty years ago.  Movies now are also more appealing to the audience of those demonstaring the effects as are used in The Fellowhip of the Ring..
 ~~~Prior to writing this essay I have read many artices written about the movie The Fellowship of the Ring and it appears that the audience has mixed feeling about the production of The Fellowship of the Ring, though most of the ones that I read proved to positively critique the film.  I chose two of the articles that pretty much agreed with me to use as references.  One quote at http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CWT6/ref=ase_ringzonenet/104-5923720-1372713 written by Miles D. Moore from Alexandria, VA USA quotes, ""Everything about this film feels exactly right, from the casting to the screenplay to the special effects. The last are amazing, putting to shame anything George Lucas has come up with, and yet they always serve to advance the story"" showing that the transformation from book to movie was successful, similarly agreeing to the view of BBC News's Jackie Finlay quote of ""Would it [the story] be tacky if ""made flesh, brought into the realms of the every day - or worse, of Hollywood?  But director Peter Jackson avoids almost all of the traps to deliver a powerful, intense and beautifully realized movie that interprets the novel - well, almost to perfection."" at [...] .  In conclusion, the transformation of the book into a movie is brilliantly done and deserves the congrats of all viewers, whether Lord of the Rings fan or not.
Well, Ms. B, I got this posted on the internet, now did I really deserve a 70% for incorrectly put citations?  I think content is what's important.",1040774400,2,3876,4.692762186115214
1317651,4,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, chapter one of J.R.R Tolkien's trilogy about the battle of good vs evil set in the land of Middle Earth, can be described in only two words: Flawless masterpiece. Filled with heart wrenching suspense and spectacular visual effects, The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the only movies that gets close to or over the three hour time limit and manages to keep the watcher entertained and gripped to your seat for all one-hundred eighty minutes. Surrounded by a good cast and great script, Fellowship dares to explore the evil-filled land of Middle Earth, where such terrible creatures as Orcs lurk in the shadows and work to destroy all good and rule the word with their terrible ways. For all kinds of movie fans, whether it's action, drama, suspense, romance, or fantasy that you like, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring will not disappoint. Your jaw will sink to the ground from the first scene and stay there for a whole three hours.
Fellowship does leave some things out of the movie that were included in the book though all the events in the movie are completely identical to the book. There are no surprising changes or twists though I suggest you read the book prior to the movie so you know the important facts.
The book and movie's plot are as follows: Elijah Wood (North)portrays Frodo, a Hobbit living in the quiet and peaceful land of the Shire. Now don't be surprised by Frodo's size. All Hobbits are small. Frodo is cousin to Bilbo Baggins, the brave Hobbit who first got the ring of power (in the other J.R.R Tolkien novel ""The Hobbit""), which has the ability to make you invisible. The ring first belonged to Sauron, a powerful creature who's want for the ring led to his demise. When, on his 111th birthday, Bilbo feels that he's gotten too old to hold the ring (especially now that Sauron's power is slowly rising) he hands it over to Frodo. After Sauron unites with the good-turned-evil wizard Saruman (played by Christopher Lee, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones) to get the ring, Frodo is left with no choice but to destroy the ring before Sauron kills him with his powerful Orcs and Black Riders.
Teaming up with his best friend Sam (played by Sean Astin, The Goonies), the friendly but no-nonsense wizard Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, X-Men), the brave warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen, A Perfect Murder), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), and Boromir (Sean Bean, Goldeneye and Don't Say a Word), Frodo sets out for Mount Doom, where he must destroy the ring. But can the fellowship overcome Sauron and Saruman? That is for you to find out.
Well-crafted and beautifully assembled, Fellowship of the Ring features star-making performances from Liv Tyler (Armageddon), Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth), and Hugo Weaving (The Matrix). The descriptions of the characters in the book are similar to those in the movie. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin portray the Hobbits well while Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and John Rhys-Davies steal the movie away with their dynamite performances and action scenes. It's good when you see a character and you immediately think: Oh, there is going to be a fight scene.
What disappoints me is that every creature is made by computers. Though several scenes and monsters look completely real, whenever you get a shot of a creature's face, you know immediately that it is computer-made. Gollum. The Orcs. Black Riders. Everything seems to be made from computers. Though people claim that Gollum's performance in the Two Towers were spectacular, I completely disagree.
Peter Jackson does a fantastic job as director and the script is taut and interesting. The fight scenes are simply amazing, considering that over 2000 weapons and over 400 extras were needed. Also, since it was filmed in New Zealand, we get a tour of several beautiful locations that are sure to capture the viewer's eye. Though running a bit long, Fellowship is practically screaming for you to get it. Very brilliant film!

All actors play their roles excellent,unlike in StarWars the effects are never the main focus,of course they are wonderful but they are very embedded into the story so that sometimes you don't even notice them as a special effects. Where in StarWars the effects are meant to steal the viewers focus from the horrible acting.
The Lord of the Rings has a certain magic about it that I thought was lost forever...the magic to pull you into a distant world and to make you feel like you really are in Middle Earth witnessing all these amazing events.

1317655,4,B00003CWT6,"Responses to LOTR generally break down into two camps. Those who, like myself, were raised on the books (one of my earliest childhood memories is reading 'The Hobbit') are spellbound. As fans, we are deeply pleased that the adaptation is faithful and pleasantly surprised that the departures from the text integrate seamlessly into the story and even add to the experience. The film is without question visually stunning and exciting.
Those who were not raised on LOTR tend not to ""get it."" I've given up trying to explain what the fuss is about and simply accepted that this may be one of those things requiring an introduction at a certain age, else it simply doesn't take. They complain that the film is unbearably long, and, if one isn't spellbound, it probably is.
So if you are young or read LOTR when you were young, this is a great movie. Of course, you knew that already, didn't you?",1040601600,,892,4.687898089171974
1317656,5,B00003CWT6,"I have to admit that when I first saw the movie I thought it was just good. After seeing the extended edition, I would have to say
this is one of the best movies I've seen.
The extended version brings some of the characters more to life. One of my favorite addition was the dwarf's words to the elf queen, very deep considering the animosity between the elves and dwarves. This is the ultimate story of good and evil and how good must always keep on guard for the weaknesses they have. There are so many things to learn from this movie. This is not just an action flick, but a life lesson.
I am currently reading the book and yes the movie takes certain liberties with the story but he never loses what's at the heart of book.
The movie runs about three and a half hours and this may be a bit long for some but since the movie spans two discs you you can watch it over two nights.",1040601600,2,880,4.122093023255814

1317706,3,B00003CWT6,"I'm sorry to say it, but this is one of those movies that it's trendy to say that it's a great movie, no matter if it is or not!
I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but whether it is actually good or not depends on whether or not the producers wanted this movie to show that it is an animated and computer made movie...
I don't work with 3D animation myself, but considering the business I'm in I've got friends and colleagues who does and I have a pretty good eye for these sort of things - for me I think it's disturbing to see first of all in the beginning when they show the previous war. You can see how all the animated soldiers on the field move; like they we're swept by the wind and they all move at the same time as if they were one man and not a thousand, or whatever and the sky moves with them in a strange way - it's the way the camera follows that twists the appearance...
Then it's the way the ground looks around the gap, and the way it looks inside where all is red and the bad guys hang out! - It looks unreal.
But whether or not that is a good or bad thing depends on if they want us to hang on to the fact that this is a fantasy, or if they want us to believe that this is real - if they want our eyes to believe what they are seeing - they've done a bad job!
OK these things are not central so maybe they didn't care too much about it..
The ring looks good, Frodo's extremely big and blue eyes look good and Aragorn/Viggo Mortensen undoubtedly looks very sexy with that painful look in his eyes and every young girl will fall for him... What else is new?!",1040601600,,1574,3.952830188679245
1317707,4,B00003CWT6,"THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS - Deluxe 4 DVD Collectors Set is a great addition to the film collector who like the information on the behind the scenes of making a movie. The Four DVD set has over 20 hours of screen information to watch - this includes - the three commentaries, which are excellent. The commentaries include the director and producer, the cast and the special effects people - all very enlightening and especially entertaining when listening to the cast version.
My review of the movie itself can be read on the regular DVD release. So for story and contact of the film itself - see that review. Here, I will focus on the extra's this one has.
The art and graphics; there are literally thousands of images on these DVD's. From the original drawings from the various novel artists to pre conception, pre production, design and development as well as all the art departments including costume, make-up, set and visual design departments.
The concept art and design; there are documentaries on the process of one word in Tolkeins books being take from interpreting, design, construction and filming. Very interesting and detailed information contained on these DVD's.
Behind the scenes documentaries; each of these details every aspect of the films production. From scouting locations, to finding props, doing forced perspectives, dueling, sword play, special effects, stunts, visual effects, computer generation and even the casting process. An extremely well done production on these DVD's.
The quality of the DVD and DVD Rom; The DVD itself is very well put together. The guiding menus are graphic and detailed and there are even introductions and explanations on how to use the DVD menus. This is a great collection to anyone who is a filmmaker or aspires to be one. Also - if you are just into the process of film making, this is definitely an educational tool.

I have to say I was stunned; I couldn't believe the epic scale of the film.  The special effects and action sequences are amazing.  However, many of the characters are very well-developed, particularly that of Frodo Baggins, played by Elijah Wood.  Frodo's inner turmoil and the burden the title of ring-bearer places on him becomes more and more apparent as the film progresses.  I personally became very attatched to the character of Frodo...I'm almost scared to see what becomes of him at the end of the final installment!

1317709,5,B00003CWT6,"A phenomenal story that will engage the imagination into belief. Hours later the story and images are still turning over and over in my mind -- the quest is so compelling and destined, it is impossible to let go. I may have to run out to a theater an watch the Twin Towers this evening.
Other reviewers have likened it to the Star Wars epics, and I agree along with the caveat that this has far more moral thread and emotional resonance. Add to this a wonderous sense of mystery, dread, true magic and transformation and there is the stuff of myth is these 3 short hours of movie.
This DVD edition is worth it. Just the other day I was debating the merits of the extras found on most DVD's with a friend. His argument, which is true sometimes, is that the extra scenes and bits end up on the cutting room floor for a reason. If the piece of art can't stand up on its own, then that's a problem in the first place.
The edition has scenes that enrich the story, fills in a few gaps, and adds to the richness of the thing. After watching, you're either going to watch the whole thing again or dive into the commentary. It's not like you really have a choice.",1040515200,,1155,4.230769230769231
1317710,5,B00003CWT6,"If you are even slightly interested in this set, then I assume that you have already seen this movie.
So, we have an extended version of the film with four commentaries, and a 6 hours long pile of documentaries. Wow.
First - the film. The extended version of the film. It's quite good. The new bits are nice - not essential, but nice. The gifting of the fellowship is perhaps the most significant scene here, quite nice. The commentaries are very good - this is a well-spoken group of people, and the producers of the commentary did a lot of judicious editing to keep the commentary from being just another rambling bunch of people telling each other things that only mildly interest the audience. I figure I'll finish watching the film with each commentary by the time the next deluxe set come out.
The documentaries - wow. These are very well done, very interesting, not repetative as might be expected. Once again, they are quite good, and really worth your time to watch. The documentary on scale was particularly good. Once again, there is not much fluff here, the interviews are well edited and thoughtfully put together.
The image quality is nice and charp throughout the whole set, and the sound quality is, of course, fantastic.
My only complaint, and I will always complain about this, is the still picture galleries. Unless you have a giant tv with fantastic resolution, you just can't see the details of these pictures. You can't zoom in or pan around the pictures, you just have to look at them and wonder what kind of detail would be available to see if you could just zoom in. It's not a big problem, but it's a pet peeve of mine in many dvds out there.

1317714,5,B00003CWT6,"""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a movie in a million: It has outstanding acting, directing, special effects, plotting, has romance and action and deep messages that still resonate today, decades after the books were published. It lives up to every ounce of the hype, and has deservedly made a huge mound of money. Now New Line has released it as it should be: Uncut, with plenty of extras for the raving geeks among us.
Frodo Baggins is an innocent young hobbit living in the idyllic Shire. But when his uncle Bilbo vanishes suddenly and leaves him all he owns to his nephew -- including a golden ring that makes the wearer invisible -- Frodo is told by the wizard Gandalf that his ring is the One Ring, the tiny indestructable token that contains the power of the demonic Dark Lord Sauron. The only way the Ring can be destroyed is to throw it into the volcano where it was forged, in the middle of the land of Mordor. Frodo volunteers for a perilous quest across Middle-Earth to destroy the Ring, even though he is small, weak, and not a warrior or a wizard. But he has no idea of the hideous powers that are chasing him, with the Ring threatening to turn the Fellowship of the Ring into a battleground.
""Lord of the Rings"" is one of those books that you think could never be made into a good movie. If this had been made only for the money, that would have been true. But Peter Jackson, the cast and crew obviously love the story and wanted to make it as good and as real as possible, and for that I am deeply, deeply grateful.
Elijah Wood is outstanding as the tiny, unlikely hero Frodo Baggins, who is a wide-eyed innocent whose strength is all on the inside. Wood does an outstanding job of showing Frodo's childlike trust, joy and innocence being chipped away, and his growing desperation as things start to fall apart around him. Sean Astin is loyal and loveable as the extremely difficult-to-play Sam Gamgee, Frodo's best friend. Dominic Monoghan and Billy Boyd play Frodo's somewhat ditzy but well-meaning cousins. Orlando Bloom has a macho-ethereal air as the elf archer Legolas, and John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as the everything-big-but-height dwarf Gimli. Ian McKellen is the quintessential gray wizard, crabby and kindly at the same time. (Like Dumbledore? You ain't seen nothin' yet!)
The movie is extended, including a lot of material from the books that never made it to theaters, such as the Sackville-Bagginses, greater insight into the Arwen/Aragorn relationship, the awful Midgewater Marshes, more about Gollum, Frodo and his cousins dancing and singing at the pub, Aragorn's past, Gimli and Legolas's budding friendship, greater insights into Frodo and Sam's friendship, more of Sam's shy interest in Rosie Cotton, Bilbo and Frodo's sweet father-son relationship, and a ""gift"" scene where we see Galadriel's softer side. The movie stretches over two of the four DVDs, which also include audio commentaries that you can turn on. (Plenty of entertaining anecdotes with the actor commentaries, such as the year-long prank that the other hobbits played on the unsuspecting Elijah Wood)
The third and fourth DVDs are also treats. The third DVD focuses on Tolkien and the background of ""Lord of the Rings."" And the fourth DVD is also great fun: It focuses on behind-the-scenes of the movie. There is ""Fellowship of the Cast,"" which outlines the main actors, serious and silly stuff (Dominic Monoghan can't stand pain, Elijah Wood can sleep anywhere, Sean Astin is a worrier, Liv Tyler made Orlando Bloom drive her around in New Zealand), as well as things about the supporting actors, and the scale doubles used for Gimli and the hobbits.
There is ""Day in the Life of a Hobbit,"" which shows the makeup-feet-ears that were done for the hobbit actors, how they filmed, and what they did in their time off. (It involves a lot of bleeped-out cursing) There is then a careful run-through of how they shot the different locations, followed by studies of the ""big-atures"" (enormous scale models), special effects, and computer-generated creatures. After a slightly monotonous section on editing the film to how it showed in the theaters, we get a glimpse of how the movie was received across the world.
Hypothetically this movie should be for Tolkien geeks -- the in-depth studies of Tolkien and a fair amount of the extra movie material center on things that won't make sense to those who haven't read the books. But if you don't mind not knowing, for example, who Morgoth is or where Valinor is, then it won't bother you at all. ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and its extras are funny, touching, cute, intense, smoother and richer than before. A must-buy, for geek and non-geek alike.",1040342400,2,4691,4.828571428571428

Boromir is a man who become seduced by the power of the ring, he lets the ring seduce him to his magic, but does become redeemed at the end of the film and dies making his death a personal sacrifice to save Pippin amd Merry.

1317757,3,B00003CWT6,"I am really not quite sure what to say or how to start it. I have never been interested in this legendary story, and this movie hasn't converted me. It is very easy to look at, but it's hard to to follow and hard to keep your attention to it. Director Peter Jackson has, without a doubt, delivered a magnificent looking film. He has created an unbelieveable world thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien, and brought to life some pretty good characters. Still, it wasn't enough for me. Everything about this film is marvelously done and made and acted, but I wasn't swept up by it. Here's the story - A magical ring falls into the hands of a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood), who sets out on a journey to Mordor, to destroy the ring. He is aided and guided by a magical wizard named Gandolf(Superbly done by Sir Ian McKellen). He is also supported by three other hobbit friends, led by Sam(Sean Astin). Along the way they meet up with Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen), an elf(Liv Tyler), and assorted other characters(Played by John Rhys Davies, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean from ""Goldeneye""). Also on hand is horror and film legend Christopher Lee, who gives a fantastic performance that will no doubt make his legion of fans smile proudly. The old master still has it. The storytelling is rich and deep, without question, but I could just never get involved with it. The landscape and cinematography is wonderful and, at times, extremely beautiful. The movie might of floundered if it were held together by a lesser cast. That's the best thing this film has going for it. The cast. Sir Ian is the very best of the bunch. You watch every single frame he's in. Listen to every word he utters. It's hard to say that about the others, but they are all still good. Clocking in at a near 3 hours, the film runs pretty long and certainly drags in a few places, but it usually picks up with some kind of heart pounding scene that grabs your attention. The loyalists and fans will no doubt be pleased and satisfied, but newbies to the story might not be as swept away by the film itself. The effects and all that, sure, but I doubt they will be as excited for the next chapter as the fans. As for the upcoming sequel, I'll wait for cable.

Every bit of the five and a half hours of the behind the scenes footage is amazing. I honestly thought I would get bored, but I found myself coming back for more. The extended cut is fabulous, especially the re-cut of the cave troll sequence. The Jackson/Boyens/Walsh commentary is also very good.

1317759,5,B00003CWT6,"These, the stories of John Ronald Ruel Tolkien, are what can truly be called a classic -- an epic work that has and shall stand the test of time.

This treatment of those works has finally met the challenge of bringing to the screen the vision of the original.

There ARE beauties here to make you weep -- the loss of childhood's perfections, the end of dreams, letting go, and the dark hours when all things good can only be seen from far away in the winter of sorrow.  There ARE wonders to burn the soul as well -- ideals ever out of reach, love beyond time and hope, devotion beyond death.

Giving us more (especially of Hobbiton) can only deepen the viewers' understanding of the most central theme of ""Lord of the Rings"" that of how precious that the little things of life are, and how important and empowering our ties to them can be.  This  central theme of Tolkien's writings echos his deeply religous background.  In Middle Earth, Tolkien sings to us of his vision of the beatitudes incarnate.  Herein, truly, the meek inherit the earth.

After seeing the first movie which I loved, I still had many questions why this part was left out or why they did not touch upon this subject. Well, they did. They just cut it.  The whole scene in Lothlorien is 10x better and makes much more sense with all the scenes.  Elven cloaks, lembas, why they are on the river, the gifts recieved all are scenes cut that are in this DVD and follows much more closely to the book.

I'm not a superfan, but did love Tolkien's works before seeing the movie. The extra footage dvd really represented the original work much more; I didn't think it was missing anything when I saw it in the theatre, but realized it was so much better when seen w/ the new footage. The extra footage isn't expanded fight scenes or unnecessary filler (like some dvds)-- this is really story-building stuff about the characters.

  In Lord of the Rings: Fellowship Peter Jackson has stripped the spirit of Tolkien almost entirely from the novel. What one finds in place of the mythic energy that drives the novel is technology. The landscapes of places like Rivendell are breathtaking and are clearly intended to give the film a feeling of grandeur. They do not achieve the effect their director intends because Jackson has forgotten that to tell a story you have to use language NOT just special effects and camera tricks. But this is exactly what I would expect from Hollywood where even in ""art films"" the difficult substance of literature and art is neglected for superficial trappings of style and craft.
  Entire exchanges between characters in Tolkien are reduced to one or two words in many scenes packed with clumsy dramatic pauses. Jackson entirely loses the sense of journey central to Tolkien. In Fellowship there is a sense that in Hobbiton everyone thinks all is well but a terrible storm looms far in the distance in someplace called Mordor far far away. This is achieved through the dark, intense conversation by firelight between Gandalf and Frodo in Tolkien. Jackson for the first hour of the movie makes no attempt to offer any such scene and instead squanders our attention by showing us fireworks displays in Hobbiton juxtaposed with impressive images of Mordor. Since there is no intimacy and feeling of protection surrounding Hobiton, no feeling that somehow when Frodo leave Hobbiton he is abandoning his stay before a nightmarish journey, because when we think of Hobbiton we think not of the secluded, warm atmosphere of Tolkien but just another pretty place full of spectacle.  The mystery that surrounds Sauron and Mordor is lost since we him in the first minute of the movie.
  Even on the level of a mindless adventure movie Lord of the Rings fails. It lacks the excitement and momentum of Indiana Jones and the humanity and grandeur of Star Wars (the old series NOT the new one).",1040083200,8,2189,4.790450928381963
1317785,5,B00003CWT6,"What can be said that hasn't been said already?  We are witnessing film history in the making, on the order of The Godfather series and the original Star Wars trilogy.  In many ways the Lord of the Rings combines what made both series successful; the depths and personalities of its characters and spectacular scenery that is only possible in the movies.  What is most impressive (to me anways) is that today's jaded audience is embracing what is essentially an old fashioned epic story about morality and power.  People are talking about the very ""human"" struggles of its heroes and not just the special effects or strange creatures; unlike its one-dimensional counterpart, the Harry Potter series.  Good triumphs over evil and it seems so easy and simplified in Harry Potter but in the LOTR ""things are not always as they seem"".  The film asks us to be emotionally and intellectually invested in its characters and not just the fireworks (altough there is plenty of that!!!).  The characters in LOTR choose the right path even when the odds are clearly stacked against them.  In Harry Potter and other contemporary films the good guys have plenty of firepower and their motives are simple.  Cardboard.
Not everyone understands what the fuss over LOTR is all about but many people still don't understand the fuss that is made over The Godfather or Star Wars either.  But for those of us in on the ride it is yet another example of why film is the supreme art form above anything else today.  Neither books, music, or even television draws in so many disparate demographics and backgrounds to a single work.
The FOTR is generally not going to go over well with those with short attention spans or are generally turned off by fantasy films.  There are a multitude of strange creatures, magical concepts, strange languages and lands.  All of which are touched upon in the film, but barely, compared to the depths J.R.R. Tolkien invested in them.  The book tells its tale in its own leisurely pace, noting every tree and hill or the histories of its various people.  But Peter Jackson's film brings a wonderful sense of energy, tension, and pacing that is appropriate for a film adaptation.  The attention to detail and the passion the people put behind the film is apparent onscreen but you'll never truly realize it until you see the extensive but enjoyable documentaries on discs 3 and 4.  I care not what other LOTR fans say about changes or omissions compared to the book.  There are simply so many other things PJ expanded, tightened, or even improved upon Tolkien's story.  Blasphemy?  Bah.  I enjoyed it immensely.
As for the Extended Edition this is Fellowship of the Ring as it should have been without the demands of NewLine, theatre vendors, or the general public in the way.  (But kudos to NewLine for taking the chance on this epic in the first place)  Peter Jackson states this is not the ""Director's Cut"" but I believe he's being ""diplomatic"" since the Two Towers and Return of the King will be shown in the ""acceptable"" 3 hr time frame.  The stories and characters in the Extended Edition are simply richer and has more clarity than the Theatrical Cut.  And for those who read the book the Extended Edition is more faithful to its spirit. This DVD set finally gives the story of FOTR the room it needed to breathe.
The FOTR is only 1/3 of a 9+ hour mega-movie and it should be viewed on those terms and not as a film in itself.  The story has just begun.......",1040083200,,3474,4.700826446280992

I give it three stars because of how the plot changes speed to frequntly, the ... acting, and Elijah woods poor job. Good effects though and sendoff of the characters. also good job with bringing the mosters to life (make-up/costumes). Overall very disappointing.",1039996800,,555,4.852631578947369
1317787,5,B00003CWT6,"I rented this movie, being a fan of fantasies and because of the praise it received. I stayed up past midnight watching it, glued to the screen. I really loved this movie, possibly even more than Harry Potter because of the intensity and good scenery/acting. I am 12 years old, and most (but not all) other 12-year-olds thought that this movie was ""boring."" Well, no one is making them watch it! If they can't tolerate the movie's length of 3 hours (which is actually a necessity) and cannot understand this movie, then they should watch silly 1-star comedies with no plot. Don't be fooled by the customer rating of 4 1/2 stars-I actually read the 1-star reviews, and most of them were because of irrelevant DVD disc errors, because of their immaturity and annoyance by the movie's success, or even because they mistakenly gave the movie a 1-star rating when they thought it was really 5 stars. Yes, parents, the PG-13 rating should not be disregarded. The movie contains no language or adult content (with the exception of one breif kiss) and is rated PG-13 because of scary images and battle scenes. Also, those who think that not a drop of blood was shed weren't paying attention at all. Basically, kids with tiny attention spans, fragile bladders, or those who tend to have nightmares after seeing scary images should not see this movie.
In contrast to the types of people that I would not recommend this movie to, those who would enjoy it would be those who like fantasies, chivalry, or medeival times (monarchs, knights, etc.). To end my review, I would like to note that the movie was nominated for 13 Academy Awards and only 122 out of 2400+ reviewers gave the movie 1 star.",1039996800,,1682,4.6858108108108105

LOTR is now my favorite series!! Gandalf is perfectly played by Ian McKellen. Infact almost every character is perfectly cast, especially Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn. There are some characters that don't belong in some of the action sequences (ARWEN!!!!!!!!!!) but other than that this movie is great. The story is of course excellent. And the direction, acting, scenery, detail, and special effects are great as well. But the action scenes (weathertop, Bridge of Khazadum, Amon Hen) are the best parts of this, my favorite movie.

1317826,5,B00003CWT6,"Sorry I am late for writing the review for this movie, I just easily forget stuff.  Anyway, the LOTR is an amazing movie.  The DVD could be sold without all the detailed extras, documentaries, and interviews and I would still give it a 5 star rating.  Most people who I have spoken to about the movie complained about the ending, saying that it should have gone into more detail before the last scene faded out.  I think that they might not have even understood that there are still 2 more movies to be released.  The two towers should be released this coming Wednesday.
This movie is a wonderful depiction of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece that he wrote in the mid 20th century.  This movie really makes you feel like you are in Rivendell yourself.  The language of the elves is also a nice touch.  Jackson did a superior job of keeping the characters focused on the current scene.  You could practically feel the evil from within the Naz Gul Riders.
The DVD set consists of 2 discs, one which plays the movie and the other contains nearly 2 hours of bonus features.  The extras show you what it was like behind-the-scenes of the most exciting DVDs to come along in a while.  The movie is full of surprises and very well done special effects.  It doesn't matter whether you choose the full screen or wide screen version either.  It still is disappointing that both wide screen and full screen were not included on the same disc.  Still, you should think about which version you wish to purchase, because some people find that the black on the edges of your screen in wide screen is very annoying.",1039824000,,1595,4.5508771929824565
1317827,5,B00003CWT6,"I really enjoyed the extended edition of LoTR:FoTR. The expanded scenes that come with the movie (even 30 seconds worth), completely change the feel of the film. As an example, the prelude of the film (the fall of Sauron and Isildur's death) are expanded to show Isildur slipping on the ring to escape the orcs and the ring pulling itself away to cause his death - in all, perhaps 30 seconds added that really brings a depth and sort of personality to the ring itself. The extended edition did what very few ""new cuts"" due - it actually created a different film. Sure it has all kinds of extra features (and the bookends are REAL nice...they're propping up my six-book Tolkein collection as I type; the National Geo special is interesting, and the commentary is awesome), but what really makes the edition WORTH it is the new movie.
In my opinion, the LoTR: FoTR movie (theatrical release) was a story about Frodo - his travels and his struggles. With the extended release, we see a very different story - a story about the One Ring: the trouble it causes and the struggle against it by the Fellowship and it's bearer...Frodo becomes a main player in the story, instead of the story itself. And in this regard, the extended edition did what I thought was impossible - it brought the story even closer to the spirit of the book...and gives the Ring a bit of the creepy backdrop that was missing in the theatrical release - it really makes you believe It wants to be found.",1039824000,,1471,4.554716981132075
1317828,5,B00003CWT6,"I was fortunate enough to see the extended edition on the big digital screen. Some important scenes were restored and others were extended. What we end up with is something much closer to the heart of the books than the original release (which I thought was excellent).
The extended edition is not the original release with new scenes accessible from another menu or with a little flashing icon that allows you to add them in--this is a newly-edited film with music written and recorded for the new scenes.
This DVD set is an example to all DVD producers as to what a special edition should be. From the outside in:
- The packaging is elegant
- The booklets are well-produced and give interesting information
- The DVDs have simple, elegant navigation
- The documentaries are exhaustive without being tedious. For Tolkein fans, it's great to get inside of every aspect of the production and to see not just HOW makeup, costumes, scenery, and FX were made, but WHY. I really got a sense that Peter Jackson did this as a labor of love and that no one else could have or should have taken on this project.
The caveat here is that we can't really expect for any other DVD set to contain content like this. Jackson thought ahead of time and made sure that every aspect of filmmaking was thoroughly documented. This takes time, money, and a hell of a lot of resources. He did this because these stories have meant so much to so many for a half century. Any other director who would document his film to this extent would just be conceited, so I guess we can look forward to James Cameron doing it in his next release.
In summary, if you only own one version of the Fellowship DVD, make it this one.",1039824000,,1692,4.496753246753247

Others have already commented on the extremely gratifying addition of seamlessly-grafted additional scenes, complete with new music; and on the amazing wealth of commentaries and special features. I hope the success of this special DVD set encourages the studios to create more like it. Anyone who liked the movie, even just a little, and who likes knowing about the inner workings of filmmaking, will find this great set an astonishingly good value.

This seemingly unsurmountable task has actually been overcome! The characters could not have been better chosen, especially those chosen for Gandalf, Boromir, Frodo, and...let's face it, there was not a bad choice there!
Of course, the film does translate better if you had actually read the books. However, my wife (who has never read the books) was completely enthralled and asked me questions about several aspects of the film. Yes, the film does not answer all, but her enthusiasm and interest had been completely captured by the wonderment of story, character, setting, and drama. This film lacks NOTHING in these departments.
Oh, and one special note. For the review stating something akin to ""Tolkein is rolling in his grave,"" I just wanted to note that I have actually met his daughter, Priscilla Tolkein. I, for one, can attest to J.R.R. Tolkein's love for his story and to the ones that he told it to. In all fairness, I never have met J.R.R. and cannot comment on his possible reaction to a rendering of his work, but I can say this in defense of his family: could we please have a little more tasteful respect for the dead? Enjoy this film for the adventure that it is and stop putting words in other people's mouths.
There are some frightening moments for kids, but I believe it will be a joy for those who have read the books.

I think you should.
True enough, there are about ten truck-loads of docs and extras on two extra discs.  But on the two discs of the movie itself, more importantly, you get 30 minutes of extra scenes.  This is a must-have deal.
If you read the LOTR books, for example, you know that Galadriel was more than a spooky elf chick.  She also gifted each member of the fellowship with weapons, tokens, and lembas bread  (""one small bite is enough to feed a full-grown man"", says Legolas--too bad Pippin ate four pieces).  Her radiant smile as she speaks with Gimli belies her eerie nature.  She is not the only character who we see more in full.  There are more hobbit scenes, elf scenes, Aragon and Boromir scenes, and generally a generous dose of character development.  Peter Jackson counted on the DVD format to allow him to show us more.
So by all means let him show you!  Pick this beauty up.",1039737600,,1022,4.451612903225806

The shrinking of the movie surface on the DVD from the original complete format = 0 stars.  What numbskull decided to take this sumptous beautiful masterpiece and shrink the area to widescreen? Makes me only want to watch the complete format version sans the extra 30 minutes.

1317891,5,B00003CWT6,"Easily the most visually stunning film of 2001, it's worth owning for the special effects alone. Yet even more remarkable is the success with which Jackson and his team managed the process of adaptation. This seems to have been achieved through two things. First, casting and performances which are utterly flawless, perfectly capturing the essence of the characters - the loving warmth of the hobbits, the isolated nobility of Aragorn, and the tragic weakness of Boromir. Secondly, an elegant and economical screenplay which excises, reworks or re-imagines whole chunks of the novel, without doing any real violence to the story. Indeed, if anything, it is improved by the changes - I certainly found it more exciting, more gripping, and more moving. This is what an adaptation should be: not a simple translation from page to screen, but a transposition from one register to another, making the film the occasion for a new imaginative experience without losing the qualities for which the novel is so loved. That's no mean feat - and if there were any justice in Hollywood, come Oscar-time this spectacularly successful effort would have been more amply rewarded.

1317940,5,B00003CWT6,"It is impossible to watch the complete 4-disc set of this extended edition of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" without a sense of awe - and a big, wide smile. And while this may not be the best movie of all time, one could argue from the two behind-the-scenes DVDs, that it is, indeed, the greatest piece of filmmaking ever.
Hundreds have spoken already of the merits of the movie simply as the realization of Tolkien's writings. But the true power of this extended edition is not so much the first two DVDs' added thirty minutes of scenes unseen in the theatrical release (that do flesh out the story even further), but the last two discs. Simply said, they are the finest ""making of"" pieces I have ever watched.
Everything a film buff would want to know can be found on the final two DVDs. The gift of this extended version provides us with insights into virtually every aspect of the movie. You get background on Tolkien himself,  the genesis of the film project, script insights, actor commentaries, hours of brilliant visual and sound effects background info, staggering props work... well, the list goes on and on. Always astonishing, these two DVDs are simply worth the cost of this set apart from the movie itself.
So complete is this background that one almost feels qualified to helm an epic like this. I thought I knew quite a bit about moviemaking, but this set put it all into perspective, and to be honest, my jaw was still on the floor when these two DVDs ran their course. How this movie didn't cost close to a billion dollars to make is beyond me, and I believe, will be beyond anyone who sees this set.
For those that have seen ""Fellowship"", this 4-disc set will do something that few other sets of this type will do: you will get that tingle down your back and that pull in your chest that will make a second viewing of the movie itself pure myrrh. Think of the movie as a sumptuous meal accentuated by the background discs - the perfectly matching wines. Everything is enhanced; the sum is better than the parts.
As for the movie on the first two DVDs, the transfer is beautiful. ""Attack of the Clones"" boasts of being a full digital to digital transfer, but ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is easily its equal, though simply film to digital. A splendid job.  Thankfully, with this many hours of film and background to wade through, the navigation design for the DVDs is excellent - clear, simple, and obvious. Navigation designers can take a tip from the work here - ""K.I.S.S.""
Lastly, this is the best sounding movie transfer I have ever heard. The DVDs are packed with sound options and even a casual listener can tell the difference. Mark this one as THE test DVD for your latest sound system.
In short, this is a mind-boggling package. If you wish to own the first film in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, it would be foolish to buy any lesser DVD transfer out there. And at this price for the extended edition, purchasing anything less would not only be foolish, but criminal, too.",1039305600,,2996,4.546296296296297

""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was absolutely incredible.  Very true to the book in most places, it simply blew me away when I saw it.  The story has always been a favorite of mine, and I had high hopes for this film.  It was thought that a live-action Lord of the Rings was impossible, but Director Peter Jackson has certainly suceeded in bringing it to life.  The astounding special effects highlight and enhance the world of Middle-Earth in ways that they could not have just a few years ago.  While a bit long and tedious, it is arguably one of the best films in recent years.  The DVD format only makes it all the more impressive.  The image and sound enhancements are great to experience.  The 30 minutes of extra footage not only add to the story, but they allow you to see some other characters more in-depth than you could in the Theatrical version.  I find that the original version flows a little better, but I also find myself drawn to the Extended edition because of those little additions that will become more important later on.
 -SPECIAL FEATURES-
All I can say is ""Wow.""  Two discs filled with documentaries.  To some people this material is completely worthless.  Well, watching these features helps you gain a much better understanding of Middle-Earth, the planning, the shooting, and the visual effects.  The two documentaries that I especially liked were ""The Fellowship of the Cast"" and ""A Day in the Life of a Hobbit.""  In these two features, the castmembers share their experiences on and off the set throughout the months of filming.  If you like these, then the Cast Audio Commentary is also fun to listen to.  It doesn't stop there.  These discs are filled with a truckload of stuff that takes hours to watch.  Even if you find the documentaires and ""Making Of"" features on DVDs boring, you just may want to watch some of these.
Overall, this is one of the greatest DVD collections ever put on the shelves.  Perhaps THE greatest.",1039305600,2,1963,4.667638483965015

However, Peter Jackson does such an extraordinary job of drawing people into this masterful adaptation of JRR Tolkien's classic trilogy, that it's hard to not fall in love with beloved characters like the extremely lovable and loyal Samwise Gamgee. The special effects in this film (i.e. Rivendell; the cave troll) put even the best to shame, and Jackson's devotion to the books is incredible and makes the film come to life even more. The fact that he actually took the time to construct the set for Hobbiton and let it germinate for a year boggles the mind. In the words of Christoper Lee:
""Middle-earth exists, and it is New Zealand.""
My prediction: Fellowship of the Ring will be hailed for years to come as one of the most beloved and well-made films to come out of Hollywood. Bravo Mr. Jackson.",1039305600,3,911,4.6645962732919255
1317944,5,B00003CWT6,"The lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring is a movie in which people had been waiting for for years. The book has been hailed as the ultimate fantasy ever, and now it comes to life in a way that nobody ever thaught possible. Nobody ever thaught that the technology would ever be good enough to bring the amazing effects that J. R. R. Tolkien described. He described events and places so amazingly, and descriptivly, that many thaught the world of middle earth could never be brought to life. But it has been done. The whole series of is three movies long, that don't give u a re-cap of the previos movies. Therefor if you haven't sen the movie in thetures, you have to buy or rent it. The story is so complicated, and so based on the finnest details that you cannot simply walk into the next one and completlt understand it. The next move, The two towers, is the middle of the series. Whereas in the first movie, you start to understand the quest of the ring, The two towers is where a lot of the action begins. There is a huge battle, one in which the evil sauromon plans to wipe out mankind. The battle is huge, and definatly a highlite of the movie. But if you didn't even make an effort to seeing the first one, there certinaly is no point in seeing the secound one. But there are two DVD sets. One, is the basic two disk set. Very basic, with some special features. Then there is the new special edition box set. In thi sone, there are acually four DVD's, and much more special features, which will explain the making of the movie, music, cast and more. And belive me, after seeing the movie, you are going to want to see the special features and the making of the film. There are acually more in the movie on the specila edition box set. There are scenes which didn't appear in the movie at first in the theture version and the normal DVD version. They are scenes in which are not to be missed, for thwy are very interesting. I don't even understand why they took it out of the movie, but if they didnt, the movie would be about four hours.

Watching it though, in all of its beautifully acted glory (at last) I feel quite jaded to its best parts (the ring, the power that corrupts, tiny people with hairy feet,  tall black trees, living magic, etc.), and keep droning and dozing off to the actual plot:  our heroes rally.  Spooky music plays. Bad guys are barely vanquished.  Repeat.  And repeat again.  And again.  And again again.
Maybe it's just me.
But I, me, can no longer believe that I used to love a book that was much like this movie.  And the best special effects I've ever seen don't help in any way.

If you enjoyed to film for the special effects, do not buy this VHS tape.  Maybe if you never saw it in the theater or on DVD you wouldn't notice, but overall it is not worth it.

""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is not only one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It's one of the greatest films ever made PERIOD! After having read the book so many times, after watching the movie so many times, this edition is just the thing I need to keep myself busy while waiting for the release of parts 2 and 3. The first two discs contain the whole movie, with an extra 35 minutes that includes, among other things, an extended introduction narrated by Bilbo Baggins. The picture and sound quality had never been so perfect, but even more amazing are the special features, contained in the other two discs. More than 3 hours of documentaries explaining each and every step of the making of the film, as well as the works of that genius J.R.R. Tolkien. Of the four diferent audio commentaries the one I enjoyed the most was the one with the cast members (although I admit that the one with Peter Jackson has much more information about the film). By the way, what about Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn)? Why wasn't he on that commentary track?
Anyway, I'm really excited about this edition and I think any fan of the movie (or the book for that matter) should be too. It's just perfect in every sense. Don't hesitate another moment.

I might as well add that Legolas was my favorite character along with Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Arwen (Liv Tayler). It's good to see a female elf that kicks ass!",1039132800,,565,4.390476190476191
1317964,5,B00003CWT6,"Undoubtedly, this film will become a classic in cinema history.  It has as much rich detail and well scripted characters as the original books.  The special effects are unique; they present additional scales of the settings and grandure to the action scenes.  The fight scenes utilizes a jumpy handheld camera that can be dizzying to look at (I mostly speak of Balin's tomb), but are still well orchestrated and gripping.
The cinematography is unique and plentiful.  Slow-motion shots, wild camera angles, and extreme close ups are very abundant, and add a visually hypnotic level to the film.  It's style also embellishes the story telling.  One just has to look at the screen to feel the emotions of the characters, tell what their relationships are, and tell what is going on.
The characters in particular shine in this film.  It is actually the very thing that I've enjoyed most about this.  The characters are easy to understand, and are very well developed.  Their depth and complexities are strongly evident, their relationships are close and heartwarming, and they actually make you care for them.
The film's steady pace, inventive style, and expert storytelling is entrancing for the whole three hours.  The extra thirty minutes on this disc set add to the characters' developments (especially to Aaragorn, whose heritance to Gondor is explained in greater detail), and foreshadow the events of the future Lord of the Rings episodes (namely the scene where the elves are seen traveling to the Gray Havens, later referred to in Return of the King).
Four discs for this movie is an esteemed blessing.  It is a treasure in my collection, and I can't wait until the next two films are released in this way.",1039132800,,1711,4.9475524475524475

Frodo Baggins, (Elijah Wood), comes across a mysterious ring, and as told by the wizard Gandalf, (Ian McKellen), he and his servant Sam, (Sean Lenin) have to carry it to the only place that it can be destroyed. Another good thing is that at the end, they split up, so you don't know how the plot is continued in The Two Towers. Also, the movie is 178 minutes, longer than either Harry Potter movie, so it has more time for all the excitement that takes place in the movie. But as for children, I recommend parental guidence, because there are things that could easily scare them to death, but probably not for children eleven or over.

1317967,4,B00003CWT6,"The additional 30 minutes of footage was very helpful in the overall plot progression.  While the extended footage was not absolutely necessary, it was a welcome luxury.
The bonus material was nice, but only a hard core LOTR fan would sing it's praises very loudly.  I think it was average in quality and impressiveness.
The additional National Geographic CD was not what I expected at all.  When I hear National Geographic, I think scenery and nature.  What I got was an interesting look at how Tolkein's real life experiences shaped the writing of the Lord of the Rings.  I had hoped for more scenes from the locations in New Zeland rather than what this was.
The whole reason I bought this particular set was for the National Geographic DVD.  The bookends helped compensate for my minor disappointment there.  I expected them to be worthless pieces of plastic junk.  They are fairly heavy, perfect for flanking your LOTR DVD's.  The quality of the sculpting was impressive.  These were not the plastic cereal box things I expected.
If you are really interested in the additional movie footage, I would recommend getting the cheaper extended edition DVD set only.  The National Geographic DVD is not something that most people would watch again and again.

The basic story taken from the book emcompasses many aspects of the human experience. Greed, temptation, love, loyalty and good versus evil. All the ingrediants for an epic adventure. The action is fast paced as the forces of evil try to ursurp the power of the ring which is entrusted to the modest hobbitt frodo very well played by elijah wood. Most of the movie involves wood and his compatriots running from and fighting evil orcs and the forces of evil. The screenplay is solid and some of the cinematography absolutely breath taking. My reason for not giving a 5 star rating  is primarily the acting. While woods and mcclaellan give exellent performances and liv tyler was solid some of the others were poor. The largely american cast seem to not know whether to use an english like accent or their own voice. Some of the computer devised effects are very mediocre reminisent of the mummy returns. Then there is the sound effects where horses make electronically enhanced squealing pig sounds.

Still overall this is a fine film that is suitable for most of the family. No foul language, nudity or sexual content and it is a story that teaches friendship and loyalty.

Instead of doing a film anaylisis, which I could, considering I'm a film student, I won't. Instead I'm just reviewing the DVD set it'self, because I'm assuming those who are reading this have already seen this movie. If you haven't seen this movie, then my recomendation is this; rent it. If you love this movie, buy THIS DVD set. If you found it medicore and a bit too long, then I'd recomend the original theatrical version.
This DVD set is amazig! It has literally DAY'S WORTH OF BONUSES!!
You will not be disapointed with this set, I guarantee it. I could go on and on about the bonuses, but what it all comes down to, is that it has every single DVD extra you would need. If there is a bonus that didn't make it onto this DVD set, then it wasn't worth it in the first place.
As for the extended movie, the extra 30 minutes, only make a great movie greater. Though it is only 30 minutes (""only 30 minutes!?"" you ask? Believe me, I wish this flick was 5 hours long) it does a lot for this film, because it does little things that add up, such character development and more depth to the world of Middle Earth.
Overall this is a flawless DVD set. In my opinion, it IS the best DVD to be produced to date. Lord of the Rings isn't my favorite movie, but after being engulfed by this DVD, I can't help but think otherwise.

This movie was amazing. Not 100% accurate to the book, but it still gave a wonderful vision of the world of Middle Earth. I'm not the biggest fan of Elijah Wood, but he made a wonderful performance. You can clearly see the transition and growth of his character by compairing him in the begining to how he was in the end. If you can't see it, there's something wrong with you.
Here's something you might not see in other reviews- this movie is NOT for the squeamish. My mother squirmed at the resurrection of Urukhai. It's a good thing she didn't see some of the battles towards the end! If you watch carefully, an arrow goes straight through the head of an Orc when they near the end of Moria. It seriously pierces through the front and comes out the back!

1318002,4,B00003CWT6,"Though Peter Jackson had always claimed that the 208 minute (roughly equal to ""Seven Samurai"" in length) DVD version of ""Lord of the Rings'"" first installment was not a director's cut, its vast superiority to the shortened theatrical release becomes clear immediately.
For those initally dissapointed with ""Fellowship's"" overly fast pace (skipping over characterizations and details for the sake of action) , the seamlessly integrated 30 minutes of footage works wonders.
Here are some Improvements:
1) Instead of a mere adventure movie (or a cgi cartoon, some may argue), Jackson's FOTR now feels closer to the spirit of Tolkien's world. Through more maps, longer stays at various crucial locations, more journey time, more geographic and historical references, one finaly begins to get a sense of original work's epic scope. In fact, there are a few scenes where the dialogue is copied almost verbatim, and that's always a welcomed addition.
2) Every character (even Gollum) gets at least some additonal exposure and all are considerably fleshed out. Aragorn benefits the most, now seeming more like a full-fledged human being (within epic conventions, though), rather than a straight-forward action hero. Galadriel, called a ""radioactive psycho"" by some, has other scenes here showing her true regal nature. Merry, Pippin, and especially Gimli, are more than buffoons to liven up the proceedings. Ian Holm's Bilbo, who was one of my favorite character portrayals in the film, also gets more screen time in the beginning, just like Tolkien wrote.
3) The overall themes of the book are now much more apparent - the ring's temptation, the weakness of humans, the appeal of a simple lifestyle over industrialization, and the dissappearance of civilizations (elves). The Passing of the Elves scene, is quite amazing - a shame to have been cut in the first place, as it is fairly short.
4) Some of the choppier and confusing parts of the theatrical version are elaborated upon and some questions are answered, such as ""How did the Ring betray Isildur ?"", or ""Why is Boromir so preoccupied with the Ring?"" Although Sam is not explicitly introduced as Frodo's servant, he is at least shown gardening at Bag End.
Many complaints that I, and other fans of the book, had with the theatrical version are now fully resolved, and by all standards, as a whole this is a much better film, already approaching that sought-after but seldom-attained classic status in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Approaching, but still stopping short of perfection, because many of the fundamental issues persist.
Here are my remaining Problems with FOTR in order of annoyance:
1) Gratuitous use (or abuse, rather) of slow motion - esp. in the ""Noooooooooo"" scene right after Gandalf's fall in Moria, and the ""drowning"" of Sam scene. Cheesy and detracting.
2) Overbearing, generic, omni-present score. Some scenes, like Boromir's attempt to take the ring, and his death, while well-acted, should have been fine without the bathetic, cringe-worthy accompaniment. Sometimes, silence can be just as effective in generating the proper emotions. Granted, the music is not all terrible, it's just excessive - but the cliched chanting has got to go.
3) While I can forgive Merry and Pippin's all-too-fast integration into the Fellowship, The Council of Elrond scene, even with the additions (which help) still doesn't quite work. Oh well, at least we get to hear the actual ""ash nazg durbatuluk"" speach by Gandalf. And, there's a funny hidden parody of the scene on one of the DVDs.
4) Saruman is still the cartoonish villain, with no extra depth.
The Extra materials on the DVD are top-notch, and as you may have heard, go into minute detail regarding all the aspects of production. They will take hours of viewing, if you care enough to investigate. Some of the audio commentaries are interesting as well - it looks like the presence of Philippa Boyens who was a harder Tolkienite than the action-oriented Jackson, helped steer certain scenes into the right direction. And without Richard Taylor, Alan Lee and John Howe, the visuals (best thing about the film in the first place) would not have been possible. We also get some discussion about New Zealand (interactive map provided) and the filming locations.
In summary : if you even remotely liked the film you saw a year ago, were hoping for an improvement, and did not make the mistake of purchasing the theatrical DVD in August - by all means get this one!",1039046400,,4471,5.067842605156038

1318004,5,B00003CWT6,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" has got to be the most visually impressive films ever made. With a running time of nearly three hours, director Peter Jackson shows us Tolkien's fantasy world of hobbits, elves, wizards, dwarves, goblins, and much more. The plot? Where to begin? Well, a boring village in the Shire, young hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who has inherited a mysterious ring from his uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm), must embark on a quest to destory the Ring--because if the evil lord Sauron gets his hands on the Ring, he can destory the entire world. Frodo is nearly shoved out the door by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and sets out with his friend Sam (Sean Astin). Soon they team up with two other hobbits, meet a mysterious warrior named Strider (Viggo Mortensen), and get stalked by this freaky Black Riders. They make it to Rivendell, an elf haven, where Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving) sends a Fellowship of nine to destroy the Ring: Frodo, Sam, the other hobbits Merry (Dominic Monagan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), Strider, whose real name is Aragorn, another human named Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), an ugly dwarf named Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Gandalf. They travels across mountains, go through these evil mines, fight Orcs and giant fire-demons, and in the closing scene, battle these Orc/man killers called the Uruk-Hai.
Which is not to say that the movie is flawless. I know that this is only the first part of a trilogy, but the ending was really abrupt. The action was going fast and furious....and all of sudden Frodo and Sam walk down a hill and the credits start to roll. All the actors were excellent in their roles, most notably Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean as flawed humans. Ian McKellen's provided so much great support that I nearly cried out when he was pulled into the Mines of Moria. Director Peter Jackson deserves much credit for his magnum opus, and I had the honor of seeing this in the theaters. All I can say is, I can't wait for the next installment, which will be released in two weeks.",1039046400,,2075,4.7190082644628095
1318005,5,B00003CWT6,"When I saw the Lord of the Rings in the theater, I was dutifully impressed with the production quality and the adaption of what must truly be deemed a masterpiece of the twentieth century. I went into the extended version hoping that it would extend the vision, and I was not disappointed.
From the beginning, the movie offers a much better explanation of hobbits, starting out with Bilbo writing about his adventures: ""There and Back Again: A Hobbits Tale."" The only shortcoming is the introduction, via knocks, of the Sackville Baggins does little beyond explaining why Bilbo was annoyed when Gandalf shows up. While this is not critical information to understand the stroy, it better sets up the ordinary life of Frodo, prior to taking on his perilous journey.
As the adventure moves on, we see a much more plausible enactment of events in Bree, an extended look at the wilderlands leading up to Weathertop and greater character development of Aragorn (Strider), who will become pivotal in future movies.
The scenes in Rivendell do greater justice to the setup of the Fellowship, which greatly adds to the epic. And, the Moria scenes are extended to give a much greater sense of the person of Gandalf and his sense of justice when it comes to Gollum.
Of all the pieces added, none was more necessary to the epic at large than the wonder of Gimli over Galadriel. The gifting of the Fellowship, while not important for this movie, should play a much greater role as the epic rolls on this December.
As for the extra material: For a true Tolkien fan, you really have to purchase both the extended version and the original release, as the material presented is different in each version. One of the nices pieces in this set is the notes on the locations that became different places in Middle Earth. While not technically superior, it is nice watching Jackson, and crew, scout out the locations that make New Zealand Middle Earth.
As you peruse the DVD set, make sure to check out the easter egg included in the set. If you deride the set for not presenting a trailer of the next volume in this epic, you would do well to explore a bit before passing final judgement.",1038960000,2,2166,4.687664041994751

1318007,5,B00003CWT6,"The eagerly awaited adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's colossal Lord Of The Rings trilogy, shot concurrently at a budget approaching three hundred million, should be a bloated, hubristic disaster-the sort of project that torpedoes a major studio. But in the Tolkien spirit, New Line has wisely entrusted the Rings to a hobbit, choosing an unlikely leader in director Peter Jackson, whose previous credits include two micro-budget slapstick horror films, and a masterful art film. In the latter, two adolescent girls create elaborate fantasy worlds in their own backyard; so too does Jackson, who shot the trilogy in the lush, rolling greens and towering peaks of his native New Zealand, merging the stunning natural landscape with CGI wonders designed by his own special-effects house. An enthusiastic visionary set loose on one of the biggest playgrounds ever constructed, Jackson brings more personality to the series' first installment, The Fellowship Of The Ring, than typically seeps into a franchise of this magnitude. His light touch remedies many of the problems inherent in adapting the Tolkien books, which are heavy on exposition and light on structure, barreling from one scary encounter to the next without a sense of the grand design.
In the mythical world of Middle Earth, where the forces of good and evil are as boldly demarcated as on the Fox News network, an intrepid hobbit, Frodo, has inherited a gold ring that his older cousin, Bilbo (in the movie he is Frodo's uncle, but in the books he is referred to as his cousin), found on his travels decades earlier. Forged long ago by a dark lord looking to consolidate his power, the One Ring somehow slipped from its creator's grasp and eventually made its way to Hobbiton in the Shire, the furthest spot west of the lord's kingdom in Mordor. Frodo's journey begins when a benevolent wizard, Gandalf, implores him to take the ring to the fires of Mount Doom and destroy it before it falls into the wrong hands. Facing an endless gauntlet of orcs, Ringwraiths, and genetically mutated Uruk-Hais, Wood is accompanied at various points by three fellow hobbits, two human warriors, an elven archer, and a roughneck dwarf.
In condensing Tolkien's book to feature length, Jackson and his screenwriters do the necessary pruning while still remaining faithful to the text. Pared down to its Cliffs Notes essence, the story moves forward at a relentless pace, occasionally sacrificing ambience for speed. But only the most expansive imagination could dream up a spectacle of such eye-popping proportions, with Jackson and his technicians constructing kingdoms and monsters with the innovation and joy of top-flight Ray Harryhausens. Setting vast digital armies against towering backdrops, the battle sequences have the visceral kick expected from this director, as Frodo and his motley militia hack through foes like zombies at the business end of a lawnmower. The Fellowship Of The Ring ends with a cliffhanger, but unlike its so called prime competitor (a film whose star is a young boy with magical powers), it should leave viewers anxious to know what happens next.",1038960000,4,3123,5.149606299212598
1318157,4,B00003CWT6,"There's a telling moment at the end of the new ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" DVD in which director Peter Jackson and his co-writers try to cram in their final thoughts.
Wait! Jackson seems to be saying as the credits roll and the commentary track fades -- There is so much more to tell. We've had only 3 1/2 hours!
Jackson's love of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Rings"" trilogy spills across New Line's ""special expanded"" four-DVD set of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."" The feature packs a whopping four audio commentaries, almost 15 hours' worth. An encyclopedic collection of other extras ensures no detail is left unexamined. (Obsessives can even return to last summer's two-DVD release of the title, which offered yet another set of featurettes.)

All this makes ""Fellowship"" one of the most-examined pieces of filmmaking since, say, ""The Zapruder Film"" or ""The Battleship Potemkin."" How much is too much when it comes to DVD content? This sprawling set surely tests those limits.
At the center of the new ""Fellowship"" DVD is Jackson's ""alternate"" version of the film, one that adds a half hour, mostly character development. (Jackson rejects the label ""director's cut,"" saying it implies unhappiness with the original.) Jackson even takes the opportunity to stir in material that synergizes with ""The Two Towers,"" indicating he's aware that many DVD viewers are now about to see part 2 of the trilogy in cinemas.
Jackson's extended ""Fellowship of the Ring"" renders the film more coherent, likable and elegantly paced. Combined with the pause-and-play advantages of the home theater environment, the DVD has the paradoxical effect of making the film seem shorter, even at a sofa-spring-testing 208 minutes.
""The wonderful thing about DVDs as a different medium to cinema is that the experiences are completely different,"" Jackson says in his commentary. ""The expectations of pace are different.""
""Fellowship"" has the same solid, CG-filled look as the theatrical release and the previous DVD. Flesh tones hold true; golds tempt with their fiery beauty; blacks lead straight to hell. Audio options are for DTS ES 6.1 and Dolby Digital EX 5.1, both capable of rocking viewers' alternate worlds.",1038873600,3,2203,5.1364902506963785
1318158,5,B00003CWT6,"Now that this edition is out, don't bother with the earlier version.  The Extended edition is 4-discs of Tolkien glory.  There are so many new and extended scenes seamlessly added that this Tolkien fan is happy indeed.  Even the commentary from the Peter Jackson, Boyens, et al, is informative and interesting, and I usually don't care for commentaries!  The movie itself is spread over 2 discs, but that's a minor irritation, because you're getting so much more on each disc.

I could go on and on, but I won't.  All I will say is that if you are one of the millions of us who found Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" to be one of the most amazing movie experiences ever (although I don't know for sure if it can beat out being 4 years old in the movie theatre and seeing Star Wars for the first time-It's a different experience, not better)this version is even better than the one that kept me glued to my seat in the theatre praying it would never end.
I don't know how many girls have reviewed this, but I have to say even if you aren't a girl who likes this type of fantasy/adventure, the MEN in this film are well worth paying the money for-every extra minute with Orly Bloom (the as*-kicking Legolas)is heaven!
I ahevn't even gotten through all of the extra stuff yet, but I doubt it will be anything less than pure quality magic-Peter Jackson is a genius.
Don't miss this-it makes the ""perfect film"" even better.",1038873600,,1029,4.423280423280423
1318160,5,B00003CWT6,"It's truly amazing, the new version of the film. In the booklet there is a list of chapters,and it's ful of new scenes and extended dialogue and action.
Whereas the theatrical version kept most material that dealt with Frodo, the extended version gives a cleare, better, funnier, more touching view of the rest of the cast.
For example, Celeborn maybe had one or two lines in the theatrical version, but had his own scene and a dozen more lines in thisnew version. Galadriel gives gifts to the rest of the fellowship, Aragorn sings a love ballad to Arwen, and Sauron's voice echoes in Rivendell at the Council of Elrond, to name a few.
I fell in love with this movie the second the prologue began in the theatre when i first saw it, but this new edition proves any (small and meager) objections false.
Truly, The Fellowship of the Fing: Special Extended edition is even better and even more undoubtedly the best movie in existence....That is, until the next two movies come out....",1038787200,,981,4.676300578034682

There's more battle, story development, and character build up.  You find that you have more connections with the charaters you already love.
THIS DVD IS THE MOST COST - SATISFATION DVD YOU CAN BUY!  OVER ^ HOURS OF BONUS STUFF THAT WILL GIVE YOU A GREATER APPREICIATION OF WHAT PETER JACKSON AND HIS CREW CREATED, AS WELL AS WHAT THE CAST WENT THROUGH TO BRING THESE BEAUTIFUL AND COLORFUL HEROS TO LIFE.",1038787200,,723,4.645669291338582

 My review remains largely unchanged. I still feel that this movie over all is the most beautiful film ever made, and I'm eager for the sequel. The additional footage adds a lot to the story, however, making this version the definitive version of the film. The additional features are a nice touch as well. I loved the ""a day in the life of a Hobbit"" featurette.
 The only complaint I have is that all our of these disks are single layer, they could have had a dual layer two disk set, eliminating the need to change disks half way into the movie, which in my mind is annoying, considering today's technology. Despite this minor complaint I still will take this extended edition over the theatrical release any day. I only hope that the Two Towers will contain all the footage they intend to use so I can buy that DVD right off the bat rather than having to wait for its extended edition.",1038787200,,1028,4.491978609625669

The extended version is just plain better than the original - in fact, the extended version (not the original) was the best movie of the year for 2001. I can only wonder at the suits at New Line that figured the American public could not sit through 3.5 hours. They had an oscar winner on their hands and they blew it.

So, yeah, here's Frodo, Sam, Pippin, merry, and of Course Bilbo in all of their extended edition glory. This is a hobbit lover's fiesta. See more of the little critters dancing, boozing, singing, running, eating, cowering from wraiths, and more. See Gandalf use some wicked Mordor language and watch Aragorn belt out a tune.

1318215,5,B00003CWT6,"Anyone who liked the movie when it came out in the theatre should buy this disc set -- while I understand that Peter Jackson did not want to make the movie any longer than it already was, the 30 or 40 minutes of extra footage added to this version of the movie, plus almost seven hours of documentary footage on the making of the movie is well worth the higher than usual price.
Almost every chapter on the DVD contains new footage, and there are about four or five completely new scenes not in the theatrical version.  One of these is the gift-giving scene in Lothlorien, which was one of the scenes people seemed to miss the most from the movie when it was first released.
If you have never seen the movie, well...I can only say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen -- and in its own way, I think it is at least as good or better than the book itself, something you cannot often say about a movie based on a book.  Almost everything about this movie is good -- the cast, the direction, the dialogue, the special effects, the story, the score...there are points in the movie where I am moved to tears.  Maybe that makes me sappy, but I challenge anyone to watch the movie and not be moved by the scenes in Moria or the scenes at Amon Hen.

4 disk director's cut of the film,while the first version was
more promotional with it's special features this 4 disk version
is a diffrent veiwing experience alltogether the film now about
3 hours 30 minutes put's a full 30 minutes on the film making
a great film into a masterpeice and that's exactly what Peter
Jackson's film is with lavish cinimatography ,costumes,special
effects,and musical score by Howard Shore.
  The extra scenes include more of an introduction of Hobbilton ,better charachter development with Aragorn as well
as Galadriel:The Lady Of The Woods and more scenes that add
to spice the film up. Incredible acting from Elijah Wood,Sean
Austin,Kate Blanchett,Vigo Mortensen,Orlando Bloom,Christopher
Lee,John Rayes Davies and Ian Mckellum who are the heart of
this film better charachter development wich is the gift that
Peter Jackson has that George Lucas has been lacking in his
recent Star Wars films.

far more insight on the making of this remarkable film everything
from countless documentarys , to making of stills to production
stills from interviews with the actors to an interactive map to
countless pictures of costume designs for the film much better

I did the same thing with this longer version -- and am not the least disappointed. Still no Tom Bombadill, but we were treated to a longer opening depiction of the Shire, to brief important conversations between various of the Elves and Aragorn, to a more complete cataloging of Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship, and to other insightful additions, ranging from added lines to added scenes.
The longer version takes the film one step closer to the books, and does much to round out the characters, motivation, and action of the film. Definitely a worthwhile purchase!",1038614400,,792,4.664285714285715

1318222,3,B00003CWT6,"Tolkien wrote the Lord Of The Rings epic as five separate books, and I've read that he was never happy that they were published as as trilogy.  If only Peter Jackson et al had preserved Tolkien's intent in this, and in every other, way.
Just think what the benefits could have been: 66% more revenue (5 movies instead of 3), 66% more screen time to preserve the ambience of the books, 100% of the cut characters and scenes could have been preserved, and on and on and on.
Also, I've read in other reviews here that viewers didn't like where the first movie ended.  I agree.  The first movie should have ended at the Flight To The Ford (the rescue of Frodo to Rivendell)... just like the first book ends.  This would, of course, leave the viewers gripping the arms of their seats begging for more... just like the first book ends.  Hmm... are we detecting a pattern?
So my point is this:  If you choose to adapt a book into a movie, and you choose to adapt a classic, and you choose to spend 18 months and a bazillion dollars to adapt it, and you choose to film the adaptation in a ""complete"" and ""realistic"" style.... THEN why, for heaven's sake, do you not DO the book as written?

So, along I went to the cinema, and what I was to see would keep me in awe for all time. It is vary rare that I passionately recommend any film, book or music album to anyone - but if there were ever an exception to that, this would have to be it. Whether or not you like the books, J.R.R. Tolkien's writings, fantasy movies, or movies at all, if you haven't seen this masterpiece, buy it - or at least rent it. This will be a movie that will be in the hearts and minds of many for a long time to come - like some of the older classics such as Gone With The Wind, The Sound Of Music and The Wizard Of Oz.

1318292,5,B00003CWT6,"FINALLY, someone has realized J.R.R. Tolkien's MASTERPIECE of literature on film.  It took 3 decades and as many tries.
Not only did they get the look and feel correct, but the writing is near-perfect.  All the right decisions were made:  what lines of dialogue to include, what to compress for visual-time's sake, etc ...  and they remained true to Tolkien (which is wise, since the more one strays from genius the worse-off the end result).  Especially noteworthy is that classic moment between Gandalf and Frodo in the mines of Moria, where Frodo confides in Gandalf his wish that ""none of this had happened.""  And Gandalf, in him wisdom, encourages Frodo that he was meant to find the Ring; that his present sufferings are not in vain and are not going unnoticed but are serving a Greater Plan.
Peter Jackson, the LOTR's producers and Ian McKellan (who plays Gandalf) had better win an Oscar by the time of the third installment of this series.  Not to exclude the other cast members of this most-worthy cast, either.  Elijah Wood and his three hobbit comrads (namely Sean Astin) were born to play their respective parts.  Indeed, it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing any of the characters (who else could convey Saruman the White's sinister darkness with such believable and motivated evil as does Christopher Lee?).

It has 30 extra minutes of deleted scenes which are NOT in the vesion relesed this summer. It also has comentary from the cast, production crew, and the directors.

Particularly of interest are the additional scenes about the meeting with Galadriel, and the additional footage inside Moria.",1038528000,,465,5.0519480519480515
1318296,4,B00003CWT6,"For a reader who has become enamored of a book, it is perhaps rather naive to expect that any film adaptation of the tale will not disappoint in at least some capacity.  The reader's imagination conjures up living and vibrant personages, in the mind's eye, by compare with whom any actor, regardless of skill, is likely to fall short; and, too, it can be jarring when the director's priorities-- of which scenes and lines and characters were most important-- are not in line with the reader's.
Nonetheless, there is certainly enough which is good and done well in Peter Jackson's version of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to keep me satisfied and to move the most casual viewer to awe.  From a cinematographic point of view the film is beautiful, and done on such a grand scale as to befit the epic scope of the book; and the New Zealand settings are exquisite.  Certainly, a good deal of the book has been pared away by necessity that the writers might condense it into a three-hour movie; for the most part I was pleased with Jackson's prioritisations, though I had a few reservations.
Some of the battle scenes, particularly the fight in Moria with the orcs and the cave-troll, run overly long, and have the end effect of assailing the viewer with so many jerky camera angles of clashing blades and desperate struggles that the scene loses both sense and interest, and I found myself simply waiting for the next scene without any great tension or excitement.  One is given to think that the animators are having a bit too much fun with their CGI toys, though they certainly do not indulge that vice to such atrocious degrees as in most modern screen 'epics.'
The movie is, I think, at its best when rendering scenes straight from the book; there are several moments which, while dramatic, were not present at all in the book to my recollection, such as the company leaping across the breaking staircase in Moria and Saruman's duel with Gandalf at Orthanc.  Most of these scenes have a certain hollow lack of drama-- we know, of course, that the heroes are bound to escape-- and seem better-suited to a standard fantasy adventure movie, than to keeping company with adaptations of Tolkien's often subtle and understated prose.
I also found myself wishing to hand the script editors a red pen at the various throwaway gag lines inserted into a few of the scenes, which are not as funny as the writers seem to think (though mercifully there are far fewer of them than in other movies of the fantasy genre), and at the rather minimal screentime afforded certain characters such as Galadriel (for whom I would gladly have foregone a few minutes of orc-bashing), with the end result that the movie affords a rather skewed image of their personalities.
But I do not think these flaws would have chafed me so if not for the fact that there is so much in the movie which -is- wonderful, and it is at those times when we are most awed at the presentation of a thing that any miscalculation glares out at us most unpleasantly.  Even with my caveats I recommend it to fans of the book; it is difficult to do justice to the book, but Peter Jackson does quite as well as one could hope for, I think, from any living director.",1038441600,,3212,4.596858638743456

1318298,4,B00003CWT6,"Unbelievably, Fellowship only scratches the surface of what the book held. Fellowship is quite lengthy, for it left few of the book's scenes out (Jackson changed only a handful, as well); but there is so much more to the tale than can be seen in the movie.
However, I do think the movie got across the main idea. Oh, and I think they did a great job of getting the ""Black Riders"" to look so EVIL! My sister was in the other room when I was once watching Fellowship and it was thus she heard the icy-cold voice. That was a spooky touch!
Also, scattered throughout Fellowship are close-ups of the hideous faces of the orcs. Yuck! I'm glad I was prepared for it by having first seen photos (in books and such). I hope this warns any sensitive hearts who have not yet seen the movie (if there are any!).
But the movie was not all horrible images; I loved the cozy Hobbiton. And the Hobbits all being so small compared to Gandalf! Jackson did a wonderful job there! Rivendale was not that bad either, but we don't get to stay there for long.
Carefree Merry and Pip, I think, were portrayed very well. Sam, I think, was not so close a hit. In the book, there was much more evidence of Sam's affection for Frodo then in the movie.
Frodo, I think (I think a lot!), was done reasonably well.
Aragorn -- perfect. Boromir -- also perfect.
Legolas and Gimli had rather little to do with the movie plot, so I can't say much about them. They did have more of a cut in the book, however.
Gandalf was also done very well.
All considered, Fellowship was a magnificent attempt at catching hold of the essence of Tolkien's book, The Fellowship of the Ring.",1038441600,,1637,4.352941176470588
1318367,5,B00003CWT6,"If you have not read the book and are solely relying on the films, then you should stop reading this; I give away the ending.
Any writer worth his or her salt would tell you, that adapting a book to a movie is very difficult. It's not hard to imagine the difficulty in transforming written words that in our minds become pictures and sounds: What each of us gather from books is our own unique experience as our minds are uniquely different from one another. The difficulty in adapting books to movies lies in the fact that we're almost always disappointed with the result. Whether the movie does not follow the book's sequence of events, whether certain scenes or chapters are omitted, or whether certain characters are omitted or combined with other minor characters, there's always something that disappoints someone. We must remember that adaptations are simply interpretations, and expecting them to be completely faithful to the written texts would be unreasonable.
In Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (FotR), and I believe for the upcoming The Two Towers (TTT) and The Return of the King (TRofk), it remains faithful to some of the central themes of Tolkien's books, that of pluralism and pity. That there is no one or even few heroes-if you will-who decide the outcome of the story is in my view refreshing, and quite the opposite of many hero films that promote individualism, that a single hero singularly saves the world. How often does this happen? Was there a person who single-handedly decided the outcome of WWII? Was the United States single-handedly built by one person? Despite its fantasy nature, LotR is much more realistic and speaks to the heart than other films.
The book makes clear (and hopefully the rest of the film) that no one, and no objects mentioned are wasted; they all serve a purpose in the War of the Ring. One aspect that was left out in the theatrical release, but thankfully kept in the extended DVD edition, is Bilbo's pity-as spoken by Gandalf-of Gollum that ultimately saved Gollum's life. Who are we, as Gandalf would ask, to quickly deal out death, when there are so many that die who deserve life, and so many that live who deserve death? As readers of the book know, it was actually Gollum that casts the ring (albeit accidentally) in Mount Doom, and not Frodo. Had Bilbo or Frodo not felt the pity for Gollum, the Quest would have ultimately failed. And I think the film does, and will continue to reinforce these themes.
There are a few things the theatrical release leaves out, but are restored (some of them anyway) in the extended DVD edition that are important for the two upcoming movies: The gifts given by Galadriel before the Company's departure from Lorien, with especially the scene of Gimli and Galadriel that has a powerful significance between the relationship between the Dwarves and the Elves. The weapons given to the hobbits by Aragorn atop Weathertop, while in the book they were actually found with help from Tom Bombadil, are also critical to the outcome and hopefully will be for the movies as well. If the movie was to be completely faithful to the book, then 17 years should have elapsed since Bilbo's 111th birthday and the beginning of the quest; the Company spends 2 months in Rivendell before finally setting out on their quest. For pacing reasons (and correctly so), the movie skips over them.
I highly recommend viewers read the books if not only to serve as a guide to the movies (the upcoming ones as well). You'll appreciate the depth and richness and the sheer complexity that make reading the 1,000 pages or sitting through over 9 hours of film (if you add up the three movies) so rewarding. I know I didn't describe this so pleasingly, and I have to admit the book is a little slow in the beginning, but you'll finish before you know it.
And you'll appreciate the efforts the filmmakers put into making this faithful masterpiece.",1038355200,,3925,4.748169838945827
1318368,5,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the rings was a fantastic movie and I would recomend it to anyone. The story is about a hobbit named Frodo who inherits a dark and powerful ring from his uncle Bilbo Baggins. Acompined by the wizard Gandalf , the hobbits Sam, Merry, and Pippin, the ranger Aragorn, the elf Legolas (My favorite character), And the dwarve Gimli son of Gloin (One of the 13 dwarves accopining Bilbo in the Hobbit. The cast was great too. This is one you'll want to see over and over again.",1038355200,,478,4.382022471910112
1318369,5,B00003CWT6,"The extended DVD version of the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings was well worth the wait.  JRR Tolkien fans and the general public will welcome the extended and new scenes added to movie.  Why?  Because they provide more depth into the story as well as it explains more of the plot... and will leave you looking forward for the next two movies.  Audiences will welcome Bilbo's explanation concerning Hobbits and life in the Shire; the purpose of the mines of Moria; the extended Council of Elrond and the Farewell to Lrien.
A great plot, superb direction, outstanding special effects and great cast will keep you nailed to your seat for the 3  hours of this extended edition.  The verdict: Excellent.  A true masterpiece that will last for decades to come.
Although this movie doesn't stick 100% to the book, you have to realize that movies from books are not meant to be literal adaptations.  Let me repeat that: movies are adaptations, which means they cannot  be literal; movies are slow way for conveying information, and things not so relevant to the main plot had to be left out (I'm talking about Tom Bombadil and other subplots found in the book). In this sense, director Peter Jackson came up with a fantastic masterpiece that will draw you into the world of Middle-Earth, its marvels and dangers.  Their 4 - 5 years of work are finally paying off.
The special and CG effects, besides outstanding, play a major role on the film.  This does not mean actors are dwarfed (no pun intended!) in any way by these.  The roles played by Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey, Elijah Wood as the charismatic Frodo Baggins and Sean Astin as the unconditional, will-follow-you-to-the-end-of-the-world friend Samwise Gamgee, reveal perhaps one of the books' main theme: the true value of friendship.  If you watch this movie, read between the lines and you'll find at the end that this is not a fantasy story.  It is about true friendship, about the perils of addiction, about putting the common good above your personal comfort -even if it implies risking your life or never returning home-, and the loss of moral values in the world.",1038355200,,2145,4.7466307277628035

BUT the extended material REALLY adds to the plot and understanding of the film.  If you're like me, and were already a Tolkien fan prior to the movie, you'll enjoy the additional material as the story is fleshed out.  If you're like my wife, who has never read the Trilogy, you'll ""get"" the plot much more easily.
All in all, this set is THE MUST-HAVE for any true fan of the book -- and the movie.

There wasn't a character cast that I felt didn't fit the role, and the wrighting that adapted the original Tolkien text was so well crafted it did nothing but pay homage to its author.  The cinematography is surpurb, and with the additional footage laced carefully thoughout, a true fan or a novice fan will have no problem appreciating it for what it really is.

After hearing them all speak about it, and see all of the friendships that they formed and the great experiences they had I was a little envious that I couldn't have been in the movie. The extra footage also reveals all of the enormous amount of work that went in to this fantasic film of epic proportions. The movie is just as amazing as it was in the theatre, and the extra scenes are fantastic. Some of the scenes I can't understand how they were able to take out because they set up parts of the following movies. I was a little disappointed that there was no Tom Bombadil, but after seeing all the work that was put into the making of this film I am just appreecaitive that they made it at all. It is absalutely brilliant and a deffinite must for any Lord of the Rings fan! If there was anything higher than 5 stars I would give it to this film, it is two thumbs way up high!!:0)",1038182400,2,1061,4.155339805825243
1318401,5,B00003CWT6,"Well, well.  When you thought you had seen it all, Peter Jackson restores 30 minutes of footage into the theatrical cut of the film which gives the already 3-hour long film a total running time of around 3.5 hours.  For those that complain that the theatrical release was too long, then you need not bother with this version because the fight scenes are longer as well as the expository scenes.  But just a thought to those who said that a 3-hour movie is too long.  You better stick to the Scorpion Kings out there, because it takes a serious film viewer to appreciate long epic movies.  Actually I wished the movie was longer, but then again, that's why Peter Jackson spread this epic tale out into THREE films.
But anyway, I was one of those people who went into the theater wondering what to expect.  I sat there and really tried to like the film.  But alas, I couldn't.  Not that because I was dissappointed byt the pace of the film (well sort of), but because I have never read the books.
But then comes the DVD, first the 2-disc version in Aug. 2002, and then the 4-disc Extended Version in Nov. 2002.  Well I'll have to say the the more and more I watch it, the more and more I absolutely LOVE the film.  Watching the extras helps alot too.  If you're not familiar with the story or Tolkien's world, then the extras will lay that out for you.  One of the most interesting featurettes was the 50 minute ""Cameras of Middle Earth"" special.  This was basically a behind-the-scenes ""making-of"" documentary.  Very cool to watch.  Another was the Cast of Middle Earth.  A series of interviews and candid response session of each cast member.  It was comedic as well.  The comments by the ""hobbits"" were extremely hysterical at times.
The added and extended scenes in this 4-disc version add a tremendous amount of insight to the story.  Some scenes are added dialogue that may explain something a little better, others are extended battle sequences.  One very apparent extended battle scene was the Orc and Cave Troll fight in the Mines of Moria.  One added scene which the production crew hated to cut in the first place was the gift-giving scene in Lothlorien.  This scene is important as it shows things that appear in the next two subsequent films.
One of the coolest features of this 4-disc set, is the case in which it comes in. The case looks like a worn leather book.  And so when and if (surely) that The Two Towers and The Return of the King will get the same treatment, you'll have a nice looking  3-book film on DVD.",1038182400,,2529,4.5198237885462555
1318402,5,B00003CWT6,"I noted another reviewer commented on Frodo's wimpiness.
Let me say #1.  Who cares - look at him, he is adorable.  And #2 c'mon, he's a hobbit.  What?  They're supposed to be brave?
This movie really transports the viewer there.  I found myself not wanting it to end.  And that is where the Platinum Series Extended Edition was perfect.  Not only was the movie that much more long and enjoyable, but important parts left out of the original motion picture could be seen.  This really helped me understand the story and get to know and love the quirkiness of each character.  The cast and crew commentaries were insightful and interesting.
If you like pure entertainment and can appreciate it for being just that - then run (with your fingers and keyboard), don't walk to Amazon.com and buy this gem for your DVD library.",1038182400,,820,4.678321678321678
1318403,2,B00003CWT6,"I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan and even waited to purchase this special edition (4-disc) version of the film.  Now I'm eager to buy the widescreen theatrical version.  The theatrical release was (in my eyes) flawless.  This new version is riddled with flaws and pieces that just don't sit well.  There are just too many great scenes that just didn't, and don't, fit in the film and deserved to be edited out.
The new intro would be great except the king puts on the ring, becomes invisible, stumbles into the river and drops the ring.  But if he was wearing the ring, how could it have slipped off?  There's a later scene that begs the question just how big is the shire?  And why are Merry and Pippin so far out into the shire in this version?  There are also a few night--> day--> night and day--> night--> day sequences that really take a beautiful piece of work and make it look like it was quickly and poorly pieced together.
Most of the extra footage was blended in seamlessly.  However, there are a few scenes, (not many, maybe five, which in total add up to five minutes) like the ones listed above, that really take away from the overall impact of the film.  I'm happy with it, but in some instances we're shown that less is more.
All in all, most of the reedited pieces are astonishing; however, some of scenes (even though on their own are powerful) should be featured seperately on either another disc or menu option.",1038182400,2,1432,4.431297709923665

1318405,5,B00003CWT6,"I am a lifelong fan of the ""The Lord of the Rings"" and as such, I'm sure I wasn't alone in fearing that a film adaptation would ruin the magic of the story.  I needn't have worried, as Peter Jackson's first installment ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" does a remarkable job of transferring Tolkien's work to the big screen.  Yes, Tom Bombadil is absent, and Arwen is given a greater role to offer something for female fans, but the essence (along with almost all of the substance) is there.
In the ""Extended Edition"" the viewer is treated to an additional half hour of footage.  There is more exposition on Hobbits at the beginning of the film, the battle against the goblins and cave troll in Moria was extended, and a few other vignettes were added.  However, what long time fans will be most pleased to see is Galadriel's gift giving scene.  The whole scene is beautifully conceived and executed, and Sam, and particularly Gimli reveal new aspects of their personalities through it.
Now for the specifics of this set:
Discs 1 & 2 comprise the film and commentaries.  For those of you who haven't seen the film yet, the director, Peter Jackson, chose his native land of New Zealand as the location of Middle Earth.  I can't imagine that he could have made a better choice.  While there is a great deal of CGI in this film, for the most part it is used to supplement, rather than replace, the landscape.  For instance, a ruin might be inserted to imbue with history an otherwise gorgeous, but perhaps disconnected, landscape.  As a result, the cinematography has a feeling of being grounded, of being ""real"", that one would never get from a George Lucas effects extravaganza.
The film begins with a history of the Ring of Power drawn from not only ""The Lord of The Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" but ""The Silmarillion"" and other of Tolkien's writings as well.  While not true to the form of the novel, it does a superb job of imbuing the rest of the film with a real sense of history.  In fact, throughout the film, it is Jackson's ability to ground the film in an alternate reality that makes it so successful.  The viewer doesn't feel so much like they are watching fantasy, as they are watching the history of some remote time.
I haven't listened to all of the commentary yet (at almost 16 hours, it will take a while) but the pieces I listened two were for the most part interesting and lively, which is surprising considering how dry such features can sometimes be.  One thing that struck me is how much passion everyone associated with the project has for it.  It really comes across that this was a labor of love, which goes a long way towards explaining why the film was so successful.
Discs 3 & 4 are without a doubt the best collection of behind the scenes special features I have ever encountered.  From the start, which is an absolutely brilliant history of Tolkien and his works, all the way through to the final post-production tweaks, the viewer is treated to an in depth, but never dull, look at the creation of Middle Earth.  I rarely watch of the behind the scenes footage on other discs because it has a tendency to be dry and geared towards the real film nut.  In this instance though, there is enough substance to satisfy even the most voracious film historian, while not being overwhelming to the layperson.  Furthermore, all of the features are always firmly rooted in the context of ""The Fellowship of the Ring""; the documentary never strays into theoretical jargon or technical challenges.  Rather it focuses on how the film was made, and the obstacles that were overcome.
In addition to the Tolkien biography that I already mentioned (and which is the best I have seen anywhere) I particularly enjoyed the features on the cast and the costumes.  The cast feature does a remarkable job of showing how the primary actors really gelled into a real life fellowship of their own.  And the costume feature is absolutely brilliant, as I shows the overwhelming volume of costumes, and particularly armor, that was required the make Middle Earth come alive.
Finally, there is a National Geographic documentary on Tolkien and ""The Lord of the Rings"" included, although it is separate from the boxed set.  It's actually a pretty good documentary in and of itself, but it is really overwhelmed by Discs 3 & 4.  There is no possible way that they could have covered the length and breadth of Middle Earth to the same degree.  That said, there are some interesting moments, particularly, Tolkien's fascination with the Finnish epic, ""The Kalevala"".
""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the superb first installment of what is destined to be a classic trilogy of films.  While not always exact in its correlation to the book, it nonetheless does an excellent job of capturing the key components of Tolkien's work: honor, duty, and above all, friendship.  At the same time, the DVD's really raise the bar for what constitutes ""special features"".  Aside from spectacular picture and sound, there are hours of fascinating features that should answer just about any question you could come up with about the film or its production.",1038182400,2,5123,4.706606942889138
1318406,5,B00003CWT6,"I thought the original DVD release was amazing.  This is even better!  The scenes that were added/re-inserted really add to the story.  Also, the extras are HUGE (Two full discs)!",1038096000,2,179,4.9
1318407,4,B00003CWT6,"I am giving this film 4 stars based more on its asthetic qualities than on the storyline. The story of the film was interesting and at times riveting, but it was not the full story of the Tolkien book.
Can you enjoy the film? Yes, regardless of whether or not you have read the books. You must however release the story of the book and go with the story of the film. Characters have been developed or cut back in order to improve the flow of the movie, but you may find that one of the less well developed characters is one of your favorites from the book.

It Is a constructive criticism, maybe the second one is going to be everything I was waiting for. Unfortunately, they don't make more things like old movies, where special effetcs were secondary and the story was what really mattered.

1318480,5,B00003CWT6,"This is the definitive version of the movie to have. The new footage fleshes out the characters, story and setting of Middle Earth. The commentary provides a deep source of ""how did they do that?"" for die-hard fans. The addition of the DTS will give every audiophile warm fuzzies in the pit of their stomachs. However, if you thought the original was already too long, this extended version probably won't do anything for you.
As a hard-core fan, I loved the extra footage, which was masterfully woven into the original rather than just being slapped in in big chunks. My wife, who is not a Tolkien follower, also really appreciated the extra scenes because they helped her understand more of the background. She felt they plugged gaps in the original.
The more memorable additions are an opening introduction to Hobbits, insights into Aragorn's conflict as the exiled heir to the kingdom of men, more on Boromir's ambition to use the ring for good, and -- thankfully! -- details of Lothlorien and Galadriel. There are other tidbits on Isildur and Gollum, and extended and gorier battle scenes.
I've only listened to some of the commentary, and didn't expect to be that interested. But once I started listening I found it fascinating. For example, on the commentary by the cast, they said they filmed two versions of Gandalf in the opening scenes, a smoking and a non-smoking one. The non-smoking one instead carried around a bag of toffees that he would suck on. And the elf haven of Rivendell was to be a no-smoking area! They were worried that the amount of pipe puffing that went on wouldn't go over well with anti-smokers.
This is also one of the best-sounding DVDs I have. The DTS coding is really worth it and practically justifies a surround sound system in and of itself. The dialogue comes through crisp and clear, while scenes like the Balrog simply wrap the room in delicious, full-bodied acoustics.
So unless you hate long movies, despise the fantasy genre in general, or wasn't that impressed with the movie in the theater, this really is the version to own...",1038009600,,2074,4.79608938547486
1318481,5,B00003CWT6,"I finally watched my new extended version DVD yesterday.  Having seen the theatrical version over, and over, and over, I couldn't wait to see the added and extended scenes.  For the most part, they were good and added to the film.  But there were a few that either didn't add to the story, interrupted the flow, or made no sense unless you read the book.  As for fitting in with the rest of the film, most of the scenes blended seamlessly the film.  They felt as if they could or should have been in the original theatrical release (wow!).  However, there were a couple that had that we-filmed-this-scene-after-the-movie-was-over-and-stuck-it-in-at-the-last-minute feel.  I would say about 85% of the new and extended scenes were good and about 15% were not.  But that's just quantity.  Quality-wise, the new scenes that were great more than make up for the few scenes that were not.
As many of you know, Howard Shore, who scored the film, came back and wrote new music for the added scenes in the film.  Like the added scenes, the new music was also hit-and-miss.  Some of it just didn't seem consistent with the original.  I would say of the new music 60% fit in with the original and 40% was out of place.
The only other thing that bugged me about the movie was that it is on two separate DVDs, so you have to switch out in the middle.  Good news for those who would like an intermission, but bad news for me.
To sum it all up, a great movie enhanced by great additions.  The gift giving scene alone is enough to make me buy the extended version.  Add in two complete disks of extras and you can't ask for much more.

1318484,5,B00003CWT6,"Ok, I've been an avid Tolkien fan since 1991, when I read The Hobbit and the three sequels, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Back in the late 70's, an attempt was made to adapt these books into films. Or rather, The Hobbit and Return of the King were. Though good in themselves, these films were a great disappointment to avid fans of Tolkien. There were those that saw the movies and were ever afterward convinced that Tolkien's work could never be adapted to film in a satisfactory manner. Then along came Peter Jackson. I don't remember exactly when he began work on this project, but it was his goal to turn each of the three Lord of the Rings novels into a movie, and not to make just one movie for them all. This, in my opinion, was a good idea. Not only that, with technology being considerably more advanced now than it was at the time of the first LOTR movie, much more could be done with it. To say that this is a very good movie would be something of an understatement. Even though I can't see (and therefore can't appreciate the visuals), I was much more impressed with this adaptation. Partly it's because...
  Jackson's choice of actors was right on. Though I never imagined Elijah Wood as a hobbit, he does an excellent job of capturing Frodo, while Ian McKellan is perfect in the shoes of Gandalf. Christopher Lee is also perfect for the role of Saruman.
  The plot is right out of Tolkien's book. I've heard people say they hated this movie because it didn't include every little thing from the book, but those are fanatics. You couldn't include everything from one of Tolkien's books in a movie without adding unnecessarily to the playing time.
  The music in this film is some of the best I've heard since the Star Wars films. Whoever was the composer must really have had Tolkien in mind. The only other recent movie whose soundtrack really caught my attention is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and that film's score was composed by the same guy who did the Star Wars music. The sound effects were also very excellent.
  Though not a perfect adaptation of the novel (as I said you couldn't do that without totally ruining the movie), this is definitely well worth the money. To name some of the film's high points, the duel between Gandalf and Saruman at the top of the tower of Orthank. It wasn't included in the book, but it fit right in. In fact, the movie goes into a bit more detail than even the novel did. Jackson must have also read the Silmarillion.
  I recommend that you rent this movie and watch it, then buy it if it meets with your standards. I admit I was a little dubious, but the excitement outweighed that by a considerable amount.",1038009600,,2715,4.477732793522267

  And all the documentaries are just icing on the cake. Very thorough, it just impresses you how much went into producing this movie.",1037923200,,390,5.078125
1318566,5,B00003CWT6,"The original theatrical release of ""Lords of the Rings"" was a fantasic adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic trilogy.  With the Extended Edition, it is apparent how much footage Peter Jackson had to let go.  And what great additions they make.  The first twenty minutes leads straight into Hobbiton from the prologue read by Cate Blanchett.  However, the introduction and attention to Bilbo and Frodo's relationship is played out in a series of crucial scenes, not to mention a lengthy voiceover from Ian Holm.  With the presence of the voiceover we are bridged from the events from ""The Hobbit"".  There is a great cut scene with the stone trolls Bilbo tells terrified young Hobbits about earlier at his birthday.  Amazingly, Aragorn and the quartet of Hobbits break out in songs...of Elvish love tales and drunken glee, respectively.
Gandalf also has some momentous scenes that appear here, namely one which explains why he can slow time with his booming voice...""the tongue of Mordor, which I will not utter here.""  At Rivendell, Boromir approaches the ring with much more confusion to which Gandalf speaks in Mordor, and the same effect is used.
To make a long story short, there is little self-indulgence on this DVD.  I can't imagine watching the original after seeing this rightful edition.  It would be like watching the digest.  And with this Collector's Edition, you get two nice statue bookends to hold your DVD in place.
Peter Jackson, a long underrated director, finally got his due with the ""Lord of the Rings"".  About ten years ago, Jackson had a eclectic filmography that included gorefest, ""Brain Dead"" aka ""Dead Alive"" and the wacky adult puppet show called ""Meet the Feebles"".  It was then that Jackson wrote and directed a masterpiece called ""Heavenly Creatures"" that introduced two terrific actresses, in Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet to the world.  The irony is that Jackson could not afford to work with Winslet after ""Titanic"", and now he is sitting on top of the world.  His unique visual style (lots of animation without pandering to the G-rated mainstream) combined with his courage to tackle difficult subject matter is what commands the kind of respect he deserves.

1318567,5,B00003CWT6,"For lovers of the book, the extra footage is essential. My problem with the movie was the rat a tat cutting pace. The extra footage breathes some air into the scenes and characters. And adds dimensions to many characters ... especially to Aragorn and Galadriel. Highly recommended.",1037923200,,281,5.0
1318568,5,B00003CWT6,"Actually, I do not contain the words to describe how amazing the Lord Of The Rings is! Most people have probably seen it and few can say that it is no good. If you haven't seen it, it's time you do! It creates life into the books of Tolkien. I never thought it to be THIS good! While standing in the que when it opened in December 2001 I was sure that the filmmakers would ruin the books with this film, on the contruary, they did an almost perfect job, just see for yourself.",1037923200,,476,4.074468085106383

It stops roughly halfway through disc 2 and nothing after that will play.

1318570,4,B00003CWT6,"This sprawling four disc set is a DVD package of ""reference"" quality by which all ""Special Editions"" should be judged. The picture quality and sound of the expanded film are superb. The extra 30 minutes of footage are seamlessly blended into the theatrical cut. The four feature length commentary tracks on discs 1 and 2 are both informative and entertaining. An innovative ""subtitling"" feature--which flashes each commentator's name on the screen as he or she is speaking--makes it easy to follow a half dozen or more different voices on a single track. Meanwhile, discs 3 and 4 are stuffed with several excellent documentaries, photo galleries and demonstration features examining every aspect of this epic production from the conceptual stages to the finished film. No detail is spared.

So, why do I give this ""extended"" version only 4 out of 5 stars?

To be honest, all of the special features in the world cannot hide the flaws of the additional scenes; the extra footage is a mixed bag. Too often, the added scenes trade narrative pacing for unnecessary exposition in a film already heavy with expository scenes. In many cases, the new footage both diminishes the impact of important events which occur later in the film and encumbers the narrative with unimportant details. This problem is most evident in the first 45 minutes of the expanded feature. (It's easy to see why the ""new"" scenes which take place in the Shire were excised from the theatrical cut of the film. They do not enhance our understanding of the story and they slow the pace of the film.) That said, not all of the expanded scenes are mere filler; The extra character building scenes featuring Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) deepen the narrative and enhance our understanding of one of the trilogy's most important characters. Likewise, the new footage of Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) adds details which are important in the next two films.

My reservations aside, I recommend this set over the earlier DVD release of the theatrical version. By themselves, the commentary tracks and the behind-the-scenes features make this set indispensable for fans of Peter Jackson's magnificent epic.",1037923200,,2158,5.073239436619718
1318571,5,B00003CWT6,"I give this release high regard for what it is...a true Director's cut of an excellent film. The scenes that were removed from the theatrical release were simply done so to reduce the running time of the film. This release, however, includes extended versions of existing scenes as well as scenes that were missing all together...all of which greatly contribute to the experience Peter Jackson meant to convey to the audience.
Now, reading the reviews here on Amazon, I keep seeing 1 and 2 star reviews due to the movie being split onto 2 discs. these people are citing special features included on the first 2 discs claiming that with only 30 minutes of added footage, it should be possible to get the whole movie onto 1 disc. This is very true, but the special features you guys are citing are audio commentaries by over 30 people, and were not talking about 30 people, stars, production people,writers, etc. all talking on 1 audio track. So you have to understand there are ALOT of audio tracks one can choose from when watching this movie. Some people think this is fluff, but I know there are many points in this movie where I would want to get the writers' input instead of a cast members thoughts on a film.
Second of all, there is something called a DTS track on this movie as well as a standard 5.1 Dolby Digital track too, ...and a stereo track for the less off viewers who think their mts stereo tv's have such great speakers. Did I mention DTS? Look it up if you're not educated in home theater and you might come to understand why a near 4 hour movie with 3 movie audio tracks and multiple audio commentaries might be required to be split over 2 discs. Next time do your research before badmouthing what may be the best DVD release this country has ever seen... and I don't just mean cause it was a good movie.
P.S. If your DVD doesn't play in your Dell DVD Rom, and you give it 1 star for this, you are an idiot! I hope I do not need to elaborate, just because you bought an OEM computer at the cheapest possible price from your local discount computer reseller does not mean you bought the right to complain to rest of the world when something does not work. Try a firmware update before you complain next time.",1037836800,2,2226,4.431707317073171
1318572,5,B00003CWT6,"The extra 1/2 hour really adds heaps for dedicated fans of the book. There's whole scenes that are added in, and many scenes (it seemed like most scenes) are extended and made significantly richer in detail and characterisation. Far more about the Shire and Hobbiton is seen (it's lovely!), the hobbits have more character development at the start, Midgewater is included (originally not shown at all), there's more time spent in the mines of Moria, and Galadriel's ""presents"" have more meaning. Amazingly, the added scenes don't seem pointless at all (at least to me).
It will take a long time to get through all the special features too - so far I've only listened to the actors' commentary (very interesting to hear the ""hobbits"" messing about with each other) and one of the documentaries, but they've been very entertaining.
People who haven't read the books would probably prefer the original version without all the extra details, but it is truly wonderful to see so many little moments from the story brought back in. (The character of the film is quite different from the original, however, so I may end up buying a cheap copy of that one day too.)",1037836800,,1157,4.819095477386934

I admit I am not a fanatic of the series ( have not read all the books, couldn't spot a hobbitt without his shoes off, etc), but I loved this movie.  it is well directed and just a stunning film.  Years from now, the debate about last year's Oscar selection might be why was A Beautiful Mind picked over this classic.  The print and the sound are great on this collection.  The movie is better now than the original version (which was pretty good already).  Even though this is a long film, it moves along very well.  I have always been a sucker for the underdog movie (Star Wars, Seven Samurai, Magnificent Seven, Dirty Dozen) and this may turn out to be the best of the bunch (well maybe second best behind Seven Samurai).  This is a perfect gift for those DVD lovers on your gift lists.  Even if they bought the 2 disc set that came out earlier in the year, get him or her this one.  They will thank you for it.  The extras are amazing.  Four commentaries, a ton of shorts, some history on the author- it may be the best packaged disc to come out yet. This is the rare movie that gets better after each viewing.

I'm happy to say, I was not disappointed. The added footage not only enhanced the story, but it added further character depth, and made some of the existing footage make more sense. I sat through the entire film without a break, and was not bored or distracted by the additions--they were more like ""pleasant surprises"" while watching it.
If I have anything negative to say about this edition, it is this: if you don't enjoy Tolkien or this genre of movie, this edition is not for you. It is quite lengthy, especially the added footage in the Shire, which may bore people. Because of this, I agree with Jackson's decision to cut these scenes in the original release. For those who do love Tolkien, however, this edition is a must-have!
I haven't had a chance to look through all the extras discs yet, but I am looking forward to it as I wait (impatiently) for the Two Towers!",1037836800,4,1119,4.5721393034825875

The scenes added to Fellowship make the story richer and easier to understand.

Everything about Lord of the Rings is AWESOME! The story, the sets and costumes, the action scense and of course the visuals (a lot of Special Effects eye candy in this one). Also, the dialogue and acting is very good. No one in this one is stiff as a board like some movies. All of the actors and actresses become their characters, it's very cool.
Now again, it might bother some people that this is almost 3 hours long. I can assure you that it won't be a wasted 3 hours. Plus there are a lot of extra features on the DVD set that are also pretty cool to watch. Check out Lord of the Rings!",1037836800,3,874,4.057803468208093

Unencumbered by time restrictions, Peter Jackson gives us the full epic vision of what this film should be.  There is more background on the hobbits, more character development, more of everything really.
This is not a director's cut that merely tacks on scenes that shouldn't have been included anyway.  This is a virtually perfect, and very refreshing vision of Tolkien's world.
As in all trilogies, this first installment is more about establishing background, setting, and characters.  There is every reason to think that each film will be better than the first, and that this series will surpass Star Wars as a great fantasy classic.

Everything from the screenwriting adaptation  to the storyboards to computer animation, location shoots and post production.

Trust me, if you REALLY want to be considered a true fan, GET THIS DVD!

Call me old fashioned, but all I really care about is a high-quality transfer (both video and audio) and maybe a directors commentary.  Do we really need to see every last bit of discarded footage?  Hey... that footage was discarded for a reason - it was unneccesary!

The theatrical version of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was beautiful, and easily the best adaptation of the book that I have ever seen, until now. The extended edition only adds about thirty minutes to the overall running time, but those thirty minutes make an amazing difference. Little details that were glossed over before are added. More depth is given to the characters. More time is devoted to events that will have significant impact in the second and third films. Basically put, this version is (hard as it may be to believe) truer to the book than the theatrical version, just because it has a little more time to invest on those all-important details. Oh, and the fact that those of us who are stuck on VHS finally get a Widescreen Edition is a nice touch too. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loved the Theatrical release, but felt that too much was left out. This movie goes a LONG way toward fixing that.

The cinematography is beautiful, and Howard Shore's soundtrack hits the mark dead center! In this excellent extended version, 30 minutes of additional footage contains the drama and dialogue I knew I would want to see: the Rivendell discussion is longer with more input from the men present (and Elrond is much more cautious about Frodo taking on this challenge). More is shown from the stay at Lothlorien, particularly the gift-giving scene where Gimli tells Galadriel that a lock of her hair would be more valuable than the gems of a dwarf mine. Several other snippets of drama enrich the story on screen, and being a fan of the books already, I'm more interested in seeing Tolkien's ideas than Jackson's adaptation. The hours of documentary and commentary from many actors and crew make this edition worth the wait. But more incredible than these things is that Jackson filmed scenes with the special edition DVD in mind. There is new music added to the original score and new footage not shown in the theater or on other DVDs. This plantinum extended edition or the collector's edition must not be passed by for any Tolkien lover, as the sales have already shown.",1037750400,5,1298,4.825112107623318
1318698,5,B00003CWT6,"W00t.  The extended version of Fellowship of the Ring is definitely the version that should have been in the theatres.
If I had seen all the additional Lothlorien scenes in the theatre, I wouldn't have been griping for the better part of a year about how badly they messed up Lothlorien and Galadriel. This version gives you a much warmer Cate Blanchett, not to mention more lines for Celeborn - he doesn't look like such an idiot in this version, either. (Though I admit I still would have liked to see Sam at the Mirror of Galadriel, and I still prefer the animated Bakshi version of Frodo's offering Galadriel the ring--where she laughs with that beautiful crystalline laugh and says, ""And I came to test your heart!"")
The other thing I was excited to see was the Midgewater Marsh scene, and Aragorn singing the Lay of Luthien. Wow.
And the Sackville-Bagginses! Definitely setup for the third movie, when Frodo will return home to find Lotho was living in his house.  There was a lot more humour, as well. You see more interaction between Gimli and Legolas, and Frodo gets a cute little line as the Fellowship leaves Rivendell. Not to mention the humour of Bilbo's reaction to the S-Bs.
All-in-all, the Extended Version is amazing. I highly recommend watching it straight through, rather than looking at your menu and watching only the extended or new scenes. This watches like a whole new movie. Peter Jackson rearranged bits of the theatre version and interlaced them with new scenes--it's really very seamlessly done, and an exciting viewing experience. I didn't get a chance to listen too closely to the additional score, but my first impression is not entirely favourable regarding that--but it could just be because I know the soundtrack by heart, and Howard Shore rearranged some of my favourite bits. So I can't render an opinion yet about whether the music is good or not. (I'm still waiting for a 2-disc Fellowship soundtrack!)
An unexpected plus with my extended version DVD is movie cash good for one free admittance to The Two Towers, beginning on opening night! Can't wait - at least the first of my anticipated six or eight viewings of TTT will be free!

The packaging is sumptuous, useful, and perfect for gift-giving.  Everything is tied down and packed tight (no breaking and rattling).  It is beautiful (you won't want to throw it out).
The first question you might have is: Are the bookends and other stuff worth the price?  The answer is a definite yes.  The bookends are well-crafted and very detailed.  I was expecting teen bedroom good, and received living room curio quality!  My nephews and neices were delighted to get the game cards.  The minature fan magazine is informative.  The NATGEOSOC video is very nice.  The only ""padding"" on this package is the stuff preventing breakage!
The DVD itself is overwhelming in scale and detail.  The new extended cut puts back most of the wonderful character development and background detail which made the book great.  This is a greater movie for the extra time. It catches the book's vision with near perfect veracity.
(Note to New Line Cinema:  Remember those 1950's movie roadshows?  Study them, learn.  Put the intermission in!)
The appendices are almost like the production team had read our minds.  Everything you'd want to know and more is included.  It is thoughtfully organized.  The beautiful ""decision trees"" are, I imagine, an innovation.  They should be imitated by Spielberg, Lucas, et al.

1318701,5,B00003CWT6,"Miraculously, the 30 minutes of additional footage and editing in the extended edition elevates The Fellowship of the Ring from a flawed good movie to a nearly-perfect great movie. I really wasn't expecting much except a longer version of the theatrical release, but fortunately I got much more. This is like a brand-new film, fuller and far less disjointed than the original. It's not your typical director's cut where a few things are shuffled around randomly; every change is appropriate and unquestionably benefits the film. I hesitate to use the word ""masterpiece"" here (hey it is just a fantasy film after all), but this is about as close as the genre will ever get to it. It's so good that I don't believe anyone will feel the need to try to remake it ever again.
What I like most about it is that it brings the hobbits back as the focal point, where I felt they got lost in the shuffle before. Here there is a much better sense of what hobbits are, a closer bond between Bilbo and Frodo, and we can finally tell that Merry and Pippen are actually along for the ride and even tell them apart if you pay attention. Nearly every other character also benefits from the changes, most notably Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli, Celeborn, Galadriel, and Saruman. To be fair, there are still a few awkward bits of dialogue and questionable editing choices, but that's nitpicking. The one thing that I really hoped would be fixed was the way-over-the-top ""Dark Galadriel"" scene (complete with demonic voice enhancement and an overapplied After Effects filter), which needed to be toned down but unfortunately was left as-is...oh well.
Technically, it's also nearly-perfect. I'd rather it didn't require being split up onto two discs but it was unavoidable in order to maintain a high bit rate for the video, which again looks more than excellent. There is NO trace of any blemishes to distract, contrast and color are excellent in general, and grain is almost non-existent. My one complaint here is that the color (particularly fleshtones) did not match in some of the added scenes. Those scenes still look good, but they could have taken some more time to nail it. I'm happy to report that certain scenes where the dialogue went weak in 2-channel stereo mode in the theatrical release have been fixed and the film also sounds fantastic. The extras will simply boggle your mind. This is the most complete DVD I've ever seen and I suspect it still will be for a long time. New Line has to be praised for really going way above and beyond the call of duty. How Jackson and the rest of the crew found the time to do all this while working on the other two films all at the same time, I'll never know. Do they sleep?
In short, this is the only version of the film that should ever be shown again. It completely obsoletes the one we saw in theaters, IMO. I think it would benefit people who have not read the books to see this version, as the it should make keeping the characters straight easier -- we finally get to see enough of them to know who they are. Those people should be aware, however, that the ending isn't meant to be final; there's no resolution here. It really only works in the context of the other two films yet to come. That shouldn't stop you from seeing it, just be aware of it. And what a great value this DVD is. I paid [price]for it, and it comes with a movie ticket coupon for The Two Towers, which is worth close to [price]in my neck of the woods. What more do you want? If you haven't bought this thing yet, do it now without hesitation. Lets hope the other two films and their DVDs live up to the bar they've set here.",1037750400,2,3630,4.518237082066869
1318702,5,B00003CWT6,"LOR was a labor of love, and millions have loved it. It is gratifying that the original movie captured the spirit of the marvellous, epic and the grand creativity of Tolkien. Watching the extended version is much more enjoyable than the original, allowing the film to more closely match the novel. The extra scenes are impeccably crafted and thrilling in all aspects, adding much more to the  original.
I thought the original was incredible, but the extended version is superlative.
Tolkien said that his book was too short (see the prologe to the LOR) and true afficionados would say the same of the movie, this special edition goes a long way to rectifying this problem!
The immense, and I mean immense labor that has gone into this epic production is completely and utterly astounding. Over five years in production, over 45 000 specifically made props, the costume details, the incredible and complex special effects, the love and attention paid to everything connected with this movie, from mugs in Bree, to dwarvish runes inscribed in Moria.  Rhys- Davies' 4 hour prosthetic application every day with its attendant skin problems is just one example of the dedication the crew has shown. It is a great testimony to the great achievment of Jackson and his crew, that many of the things they did are not seen on camera but were still put in to enhance the reality of experience.
The special edition DVD has fascinating insights into the complexities of scripting, editing, the amazing anectodes of the actors - who would have guessed that Sean Bean refused to fly by helicopter and climbed a mountain to get to the sets on foot!.
The background to the movie in no way detracts from the movie magic. The DVD provides a marvellous insight into the complexities of creating such an incredible movie and the special features are well worth watching.
The fact that Hollywood saw fit to give A beautiful mind the Oscar is just plain sad - don't get me wrong, Ron Howard is a good director, but Jackson has created true movie magic and stuck to the true spirit of Tolkien. No mean feat.
Thank you JRR Tolkien and thank you Peter Jackson, Barrie Osborn, Richard Taylor, Fran Walsh and all the others who have shown such creative dedication and who have succeeded so eloquently in bringing the beloved book to the screen.",1037664000,2,2316,4.7875
1318703,1,B00003CWT6,"First, let me begin by saying, this is a truly great book, a truly greater BBC radio dramatisation (available on CD) and a total disaster of a movie.
How on earth you could conclusively wreck such a world all time classic piece of literature on such a big budget is a mystery. It must be the Power of the Ring!
If you had to do it, here is what you would do:
Lengthen the timespan of the movie to ensure that you can include all your clever ideas. But in lots of SPFX that would make a Sony Playstation laugh in scorn. Include lots of funky atavars that don't quite move realistically. Tell all your actors to look permanently awe-struck. Remove the merest hint of sensuality from any female member of the cast, ideally remove almost all females from any scene in fact to leave more room for the atavars.
Remove any attempt at philosophical context when a character dies, because that is what the book is mostly about. Given the hash made of almost anything else, it may have been a wise decision not to go there, come to think of it.
Throw in some tedious melodramatc sound effects at every possible opportunity so that their artificial nature are bound to become fatiguing during this marathon.
Take the completely logical ending of the trilogy , but stop a few pages short of it.
And there you have it, don't worry that it is a rubbish product, trade on the superb reputation of the book. Call up your pals in the media and tell them to praise it. If people are still in doubt, they may watch a complete DVD of Hollywood luvvies telling us how clever they are to have made this act of celluloid carnage.
In short, buy the book, or buy the BBC boxed CD set. This is a terrible adaptation.",1037664000,5,1690,4.385350318471337
1318804,5,B00003CWT6,"Wow. I saw the original version several times in the theater, then many more times at home on DVD. However, I probably won't watch the first version again. The extended version is so much more balanced and developed, it's just so amazing what a bit of dialogue here, a short scene there will do for character development and plot.
There are enough extra features included to impress anyone in this set, what with four discs included, two just for bonus features. It seemed to me the sound has been tweaked up a bit(or two!) I was continually turning my volume down on my sound system for fear of offending the neighbors! The new chapter, ""Concerning Hobbits"", and the ""Gift-Giving"" sequence were my favorite new parts, and really, I can't see why they were cut in the first place. Thankfully, Peter Jackson put what little magic that was cut out back in, and made his masterpiece one for the ages.
I must say, if this version were shown theatrically, instead of the shorter version, it probably would have won the oscar for best picture. What most people had negative about the film was the lack of character development. This version has it. Although I'll likely never watch it again, I'll keep my shorter version on DVD, but I'll watch this extended one from now on!",1037664000,,1268,4.665178571428571

1318806,5,B00003CWT6,"This 4 disk set is simply incredible.  Given the amount of extra features the total run time of the set is something like 20 hours of information (counting multiple but separate commentaries.)  The National Geographic disk included is interesting, although ultimately lacking as it was made before the release of the movie and was thus limited to the clips it could work with.
The extended edition of the movie while longer obviously still flows well.  I really enjoyed the character moments that were missing in the theatrical release.  There is a nice index menu included to help navigate directly to your items on the two extra disks.  A note of caution, While hitting ""play all"" is the logical thing to do, it is 2 1/2 hours of featuretts on one disk, not counting over 2000 photos and 3 1/2 hours on the second disk, yes... with hundreds of photos as well.
The Argonath bookends are fun, much smaller than I would have thought, and not heavy enough for a serious readers bookshelf, but functional for what it's worth
The single lacking feature of the set was that there were no trailers included, it would have been nice to see how they planned the media marketing.
Overall, there is an abundance of enthusiasm, and everyone seems to exude a pure joy at being able to bring this fable to life through the movie.",1037664000,,1316,4.655172413793103
1318807,5,B00003CWT6,"I had never read the ""Ring"" books and didn't see the film in the theater, preferring to get it on DVD when it was released in August.  I thought it was an excellent film, and found myself watching it again because there's so much that you miss the first time.  The DVD of the theatrical release was fine and included a second disc with some good features.
But after reading reviews here of the difference the additional 30 minutes made in the film itself, I had to see for myself. I was not disappointed!  As others have already written, this extended edition truly does enhance the film.  Some of the added footage gives meaning to otherwise unclear parts of the theatrical release.  It definitely provides greater character development.  The video and audio of the basic version were fine, but they're even better on the new set.  The DTS soundtrack is amazing, particularly in the subtle power of the low-frequency effects.
I have really been enjoying the cast commentary.  The stage name and the character the actor plays are shown on-screen each time a cast member speaks, which is an excellent idea that should be standard for all multi-speaker commentary tracks.  You can also hear the commentary without the super-titles by selecting the appropriate soundtrack through your DVD's sound control while viewing the film.
I haven't had a chance to watch any of the material on the bonus discs yet.  As you can see from the information on Amazon.[com] as well as in many of the customeor reviews, there's a LOT of extra material!  I'm sure I will enjoy watching all of it, but I bought this set to see the extended version of the film, and for that alone, it was worth the money.  If you love this film as much as I do, then you must see the extended version.",1037664000,2,1762,4.630225080385852

1318810,5,B00003CWT6,"In case you're been living under a rock for the past year, this is the first of 3 movies adapting JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy for the big screen.  This is a review of the Platinum Edition DVD, which I purchased in the Gift set.
THIS is the definitive edition, although in his commentary, the director does threaten to fix it all up yet again... so start saving now.  For all you Tolkien fans, there is an extra half hour of movie added, which contains most of the character bits and fun stuff that you found missing in the theatrical release.  It includes the full Lothlorien gift sequence, which you should force your friends to see before they see the Two Towers.
The director and writers' commentary track is a delight.  They tell us why they decided to keep some bits and discard others; it's clear that all of them have a deep knowledge of the books and related works, and made their choices to be true to the themes of the book while changing the exact details for cinematic purposes.
I haven't yet listened to the other THREE commentary tracks, but I'm looking forward to it.
The gift set includes a National Geographic DVD and a pair of bookends.  The DVD is very interesting if you want to learn more about the life of JRR Tolkien and the influences on the story.  The bookends are fun to look at, but don't seem to be heavy enough to hold up books all that well.  You may want to save your money and get just the Platinum Edition DVD instead of this gift set; I don't regret it but I don't think it's a terrifically good value.
Definitely a keeper.  I wouldn't plan to find this DVD available used very often.",1037664000,,1631,4.377483443708609
1318811,5,B00003CWT6,"Don't bother to buy the DVD version of the theatrical release of ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring."" This extended version--enhanced by director Peter Jackson with 30 minutes of additional footage--is by far the superior realization of the first book of Tolkein's masterwork. And I'm saying this as someone who saw LOTR 14 times in theatres!
As one of the legions of LOTR fans who were appalled at first to learn that it was being adapted for the screen, I was prepared for the worst. How could Tolkein's world--a world fully realized, in heartbreakingly beautiful detail--ever be translated to film? But like millions of fans around the world, I ended up being deeply grateful to Jackson and his visionary guidance of this project. The theatrical release of LOTR is indeed shining accomplishment and a delightful surprise for skeptics like me. It was obviously created by artists with a deep affection and respect for the world and characters that Tolkein created.
And yet, however much I appreciated the efforts of Jackson and his gifted writing team, I longed for more character development. I longed for more of Tolkein's poetry and the singing that are woven into the narrative. I keenly felt the absence of some of my favorite passages of Tolkein's books.
In the Platinum Series Extended Edition, viewers get to see what we should have seen in theatres. (In fact, I'll start the begging now--Peter Jackson, please, PLEASE let us see this masterpiece on the big screen!)
This extended version is rich with additional detail that should make the work so much more accessible and enjoyable to those who have not read the books. We learn that, in the insular land of the Shire, life is simple, safe, and revolves mainly around eating, drinking, singing and making the land bloom. Thanks to a new narration by Frodo's uncle Bilbo, viewers get a much better understanding of why Frodo the Hobbit--or in fact, any Hobbit--is the most unlikely of heroes--and why his quest (and its ultimate outcome) is so improbable.
This version is full of gems that will delight fans of the theatrical release. In some cases, we get just a sentence or two of additional dialog. In others, we get entirely new scenes. Perhaps the most moving addition is Gimli's description of the Lady Galadriel's gift. We also get a deeper understanding of Aragorn's inner turmoil as the exiled, secret heir to Isildur's weakness. We feel more keenly the ultimate departure of the Elves from Middle-Earth--and Arwen's bittersweet decision to choose the love of the mortal Aragorn over eternal life with her kin in the West. We learn that Gollum had another name before the One Ring drove him mad'and we begin to understand why Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
Accompanying the newly-expanded masterpiece are some amazing documentaries about the making of The Lord of the Rings. I recommend saving these for dessert, after you've enjoyed Fellowship of the Ring a few times. They will increase your appreciation of the work in terms of filmmaking achievement--and you will be in awe of the sheer effort required to translate Tolkein's literary vision into cinematic vision.
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Platinum Series Extended Edition is a MUST for any fan of the books or the film. I also hope that it will move more viewers to read the books for themselves.",1037664000,,3365,4.905263157894737

1318813,5,B00003CWT6,"Rather than review the film, which has been done by many more eloquent than myself, I thought I'd offer my opinion on why the 4-disk extended edition is the only edition of this wonderful movie worth owning. The extra 30 minutes of footage added to the body of the movie proves that if it weren't for 21st-century attention spans being so short, this could have been an even greater movie in the theatres at its full length. The additions have been edited in seemlessly and add to the richness and depth of the world Jackson portrays on screen. I particularly like the greater time spent in Hobbiton, which is a truely magical location. As for the extras... WOW. I sometimes sit through some of the extras on a DVD and get the impression that they have just cobbled together some of the extra footage from filiming, along with some interviews with now-bored stars who have moved on to other projects. Compared to these DVDs and the original releases promotional material, this extended edition has the most engaging and fascinating extras I have ever seen. The passion of the cast for the project is clear to see, and the quality of the extras is remarkable. Everything from the selection of locations to the relationship of the main cast with hilarious actors who were their small-scale doubles. (The best moments for me are the stories of Sean Astin's little Indian double ordering Viggo Mortesnen around like an angry housewife). The insights into the making of the film and the care and attention to detail lavished on it by cast and crew only enrich the experience of the film itself. A must for anyone who liked the film, and worth it even if you have the first DVD release, I mean 6 1/2 hours of extra features is worth every penny!",1037664000,,1739,4.64935064935065

I was wrong.... VERY wrong!
""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" special extended version is worth EVERY penny!  The thirty additional minutes really enrich the film.  More character development is seen and the background story is more clear than ever before.  It's almost like seeing the film for the very first time.  You start to think to yourself, ""How in the world could they have left this out of the movie?""  This is how the movie should've been in the first place, but it would've probably been a pain to sit through a 3 and a half hour film in the theatres.  I am glad that Peter Jackson took great care in releasing an awesome and impressive DVD set that does the film justice.
The picture is outstanding, a lot more crystal clear than the original version, which was already really good.  I am also happy to report that the sound is MUCH better!  No more will you have to fumble around with the volume control.  You can actually hear the talking a lot better.  That was a previous complaint of mine with the original version.  It would be quiet during the talking scenes, and it would be very loud during the action ones.  You were constantly fooling around with the volume controls, which took away some of the enjoyment of watching the film.  I can assure you that this is much more impressive.  You can also watch it in DTS, which is something to experience if you can.
It doesn't stop there.  There are two additional disks with bonus materials, such as interviews, sketches, documentaries, and more.  Audio commentary is included as well.  I thought that the documentaries were highly entertaining and interesting.  They are really worth checking out.  Very, VERY impressive.
I could go on and on, but what's the point?  If you loved the original version, get this one as soon as you can.  You will not regret it for one second, I assure you.  The additional 30 minutes or more really do enrich the movie that much more.  You will never go back to the original again, that is for sure.  This can very well be the DVD collection you have been waiting for.  Don't miss this amazing opportunity.  This is ""Lord of the Rings"" as it should've been.

I loved the theatrical version and thought that it was the top of what movies can be, but I was wrong because this version is even better. I would have gladly sat through this version (about 3.5 hours) in the theatre.
I've only read the first 90% of the Hobbit, so I don't know how well it goes with the book, and I don't know when there's scenes in the movie that aren't in the book, etc, so I can't comment on any of that. I can say though that the movie is perfectly understandable even without having read the book.
I thought the theatrical version was awesome, but this version just takes the cake, so to speak. If you're a Lord of the Rings fan then this is a must-see. There's probably no more than 15-20% that's exactly as it was in the theatrical version. I won't mention exactly what's added because I don't want to spoil it. A lot of the added stuff is character related, which I like, and it slows the pace of the movie down a bit (but just a little), which I also like (they are on a long journey, which takes a long time, I think this version shows that better). You also get to see a lot more of the elves and Legolas, which I was very happy about, being a fan of the elves.
I watched all the extras (not including the National Geographic disc), and the amount of thought, work, and detail put into the movie is incredible. It's mind-boggling (is that a word?). It's also very interesting to see how they did it, although part of me wishes I didn't know so I could still watch it, awed, thinking ""how'd they do that?"". I guess something about knowing how they did it takes some mystery out of the film, so if you don't want some of the mystery taken away, don't watch the documentaries on the 2nd bonus disc.
The book ends are wonderful, even the box that it all comes in is wonderful, I'm trying to think of a use for it so I don't have to throw it away. :-)
It's worth the money to get the gift set, and it would for sure make a great gift to anyone who loves the Lord of the Rings. Very, very highly recommended!",1037577600,,2113,4.11864406779661

But those of us who have both versions will not necessarily be disappointed as there does not appear to be any repetition in the special features.  I watched one of the documentaries on the new set and was very impressed with how thorough it was.  This is a truly comprehensive set that will satisfy and appeal to everyone from newbies to Tolkien fans.  Needless to say the film, and I sense the two to follow, are destined to become classics that will be cherished for generations - more than can be said for last year's good yet not so memorable Oscar winner.

If I'd bought it in a store I'd exchange it--but I can't imagine myself looking at the whole movie again any time soon, to check whether a replacement DVD was good!

But that didn't prevent me from appreciating this movie. Quite simply, I was literally blown away. Quite possibly the greatest epic adventure since ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Lord of the Rings"" thrills, captivates, enthralls, and entertains you from start to finish. It's the great fantasy adventure that ""Harry Potter"" should have been (and can never be). I saw the extended 3.5 hour version late Friday night, and I watched every frame of the movie until 3:00 in the morning because I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. You can tell that director Peter Jackson invested a lot of love into this project through the scenery, the performances, the breathtaking action sequences, and the pacing. Elijah Wood is badly underrated as Frodo, who along with his cohorts, begins an adventure in which he protects a ring with magic powers against various forces of evil. Viggo Mortensen and Sir Ian McKellen also shine tremendously, especially McKellen, who was robbed of a Supporting Actor Oscar. Unfortunately, women don't have much of a presence in this movie, though Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler make the best of their underwritten roles. When ""Lord of the Rings"" first came out in DVD in August, I deliberately avoided the 2-disc version, for I knew that a deluxe edition was forthcoming. And while the pricetag is somewhat steep, it is worth every dime. I never saw the original theatrical release, but the 3.5 hour version passes along nicely and never drags.

1318975,1,B00003CWT6,"Wow, you mean I can be bored out of my mind for an extra half hour, but wait, you give me all the bonus stuff too, man, I could be comatose for an even longer period of time.
I really tried to like this movie, I gave it every benefit of the doubt, I ignored the running time, I ignored my better judgement, but I couldn't have foreseen how much I wouldn't like this movie.  I place it in my top 5 bad movies I have had the misfortune to see, number one is and probably always will be jeepers creepers.  I know it took three books to tell the story, but three movies?  I sat there watching, the end came and then I thought, what the???  That's the end, and even the ending didn't make sense, hey guys, let's say we failed and go whack some random evil and let some little guy go off and fight the darkness with his friend, I'm sure they will be ok, and it's ok that we failed.  Another thing, how is it a few random individuals with individual talents can somehow just take out a huge ammount of unstoppable evil?

1318976,5,B00003CWT6,"If you saw and loved the theater version, you won't want to miss this extended edition.  I won't go into detail about the theater version; instead I'll assume you've seen it and write about the new scenes.
I was very excited to learn that these new scenes weren't going to be a ""special section"" of the DVD.  Instead the extra scenes were added into the movie, edited and polished to blend perfectly.  There were some scenes which were altogether new; at other times a familiar scene would include added dimension.
Every added minute (I believe there were about 30 altogether) was thrilling and illuminating!  For example, I enjoyed learning more about Hobbits and life in The Shire!  This extended opening to the movie gave a broader foundation to those of us who knew nothing about Hobbits before seeing this movie.
Though there was some great battle footage added, a great deal of the added footage included conversations amongst the characters.  These conversations gave the characters--cherished and beloved as they already were--a greater depth and warmth.  It caused the obvious brotherly link of the Fellowship to make greater sense.  One example is an added conversation between Boromir and Aragorn while they are well into their journey to Mordor.  I'd already felt sorry for Boromir and his well-intentioned weakness for the ring, yet my husband couldn't understand why I felt endeared to him.  But after hearing the conversation between the two men, my husband was more able to understand my pity for Boromir.
Another example is the last fight scene in the movie.  In the theater version, Peregrine and Merry seemed to have run off and hid throughout the battle, until they saw Boromir shot.  But in the extended version, we see the courage and heart of these two Hobbits as they fight these huge, intimidating creatures with everything in them and using every resource available--even stone-throwing!  I was so proud of them that I clapped my hands as I watched!
As I write, I'm the process of watching the second of the two ""making of"" DVDs.  The first contains the process from book to movie concept.  It includes a short but interesting biography of the writer, J.R.R. Tolkein (though it doesn't mention his Christian roots).  The DVD also contains much of the process of making the book into a movie--the creation of the sets (using real locations, miniatures, and computer graphics, etc)., the creation of the creatures, and the costumes.  The first DVD itself is long and gets a little dry after a while, but it's well-divided so that you can watch it a piece at a time or skip the less interesting parts.
I haven't finished watching the second DVD, but it's already a lot of fun!  So far it's mainly made up of character interviews where the actors talk about what it was like to work with one another.  I've also enjoyed seeing the make-up process.
All that to say this:  I highly recommend this set!  If you're a fan of the first installment of this movie series, you won't be disappointed!",1037491200,83,3012,4.832358674463937

I've found several others who also have the same problem. Check Dell Computer Support Communities to find out if your DVD-ROM is one of the three. New Line Cinema should of thought of this before releasing the DVD. Unsatisfied customers are hard to please after problems. I really would like to watch the movie to rate it.

I am sure there are quite a few people who could have thought of a much better way to use those extra 19 minutes!

1318980,5,B00003CWT6,"... When Peter Jackson's movie came out I was instantly enthralled and so grateful that Tolkien had been filmed by directors, producers, and actors who loved him as much as I do. I didn't think it was possible to improve upon the theatrical release, but now I've seen the Extended Edition, and now I know that it is not only possible, it has been done!
First the basics: The Platinum Series Extended Edition Collector's Gift Set comes with five DVDs and a set of bookends representing the Argonath. The bookends are lovely, but obviously meant for paperbacks. One of the DVDs is the National Geographic special on New Zealand and on the sources of Tolkien's literary creations in England and elsewhere, a treasure in itself. Then you have two DVDs with the movie, and two Appendices make up the remaining two DVDs. Ordinarily I don't care much about the extra material that comes with DVD releases, but here the material enhances the story immeasurably. The first Appendix covers the story itself, with a nice short biography of Tolkien and much material about how the film was structured and planned. There are a lot of nice shots and video clips showing story boards and early plans for the movie. The second Appendix covers the filming itself, with a lot of fun material about what the actors and technicians went through for a period of more than a year. It was interesting to see that the actors had generally the same personae as their film character: the hobbits were fun loving and rollciking, while Viggo Mortensen was a more serious, solitary fellow. Of course, all of this introductory material is as nothing compared to the main event: the extended version of the film itself.
I think there are about 35 more minutes of film in this version. All of it is worthwhile and I don't want to spoil the magic for those of you who haven't seen the new stuff. Suffice it to say that the delight you felt when viewing the theatrical version will be intensified immeasurably. My particular favorite among the added scenes is a quick shot of some Elves traveling through the Shire on their way to the Grey Havens. Nothing so encapsulates the enormous depth behind the books, and now the film as well. You'll find the same enchantment through every scene, whether new, extended, or not.",1037491200,2,2285,4.7293233082706765
1318981,5,B00003CWT6,The extended edition is great! It makes you wonder why Peter Jackson did not bring this version to the screen in the first place. Plus there are loads and loads of extras! This is a great deal and every rabid Tolkien fan should snap this one up.,1037491200,,245,4.23404255319149

Everything is better explain. Aragorn has much more dialogue, and you can see the beggining of the friendship between Gimli and Legolas. But the most incredible part was the gifts from the Elves in lothlorien: ""you cant miss the gift that Galadriel gave to Gimli""
But thats not all, you are going to fell like part of the cast with the other 2 cd's, it explains how did they do the movie, and behind the scenes stories.............Well Thats all, please don't miss the oportunity to buy it",1037491200,,609,4.495495495495495

1319043,4,B00003CWT6,"The extended version of the movie brings new scenes that add to atmosphere and character development, while others were left out of the original release for the better of it. Two disks of extras contain overwhelming information about the production process without spoiling the watching of its result.
The extended movie brings new Shire scenes, one playing in the Green Dragon at Bywater known from the book and a must for all fans. Also it is nice that Bilbo does not merely promise Gandalf to tell Frodo of his departure plans as in the original, but we get to watch him making an attempt at keeping his promise. In the book, Frodo and Sam meet wood elves right in the beginning of their quest, and here they at least witness their journey to the Grey Havens, which has become so mystical and intense a scene that one wonders why it wasn't included in the original. On the other hand, Steven P Brumby in his review from Nov. 13, 2002 rightly points at some some scenes that would have better remained dropped, like Merry and Pippin throwing stones at the Uruk-hai, or Sam getting the rope from Galadriel, and I also could have done without a rather artificial looking view of Caras Galadhon in Lothlorien.
In his script, PJ deviated from two motivational strings in Tolkien's book: There it was Aragorn, not Gandalf, that did not want to go to Moria, which was obviously changed to create some sense of evil foreboding. In the book, Aragorn then was unresolved as where to turn to from Lothlorien, straight to Mordor or to Gondor first, and the main reason for the company to go by boat was to put off this decision until they reach Rauros. The movie has no such doubts on the side of Aragorn, and the extended version now explains that the reason for going by boat is to avoid attacks by orcs, Aragorn actually telling Boromir in a lengthy new scene during the trip he won't ever let the ring get near Minas Tirith. While accepting any right of PJ to change Tolkien's plot where appropriate, I did not find this invention too conclusive or necessary and the new scenes just make it less comprehensible.
The production material on CDs 3&4 alone is worth the buy, and to watch Christopher Lee's, and the whole team's, reverence of Tolkien's work is just very touching. Also, the details about the colour ""grading"" process explained my fiddling with the TV during the film, always having too much green in the shire and too much yellow at Elrond's council ;-)",1037491200,,2460,4.631578947368421
1319044,5,B00003CWT6,"The movie itself is a masterpiece, and is one of my favorites.  The DVD makes the movie much more of great experience.  The only problem that I've had with this DVD is that you can't view the movie in its original, theatrical form, but its not too much of a problem because the added scenes really add to the movie, and I now think of the theatrical edition as the lesser edition.  The movie itself had to be split up onto two DVDs because of all the commentaries that are now on the DVD.  With many movies that I've seen, the commentaries will start off strong and interesting, but will soon be reduced into long gaps and the director saying, ""I really love this shot here...""  and then trailing off again.  Not so with this DVD.  All I have watched so far is the director and writer's commentary, and it is very interesting, and there are very few long gaps of silence.  This DVD is huge, and it will take me a very long time to get through all the features on it.  As an added bonus, on this DVD you can find the Two Towers trailer that was attached to Fellowship of the Ring while it was still in theaters, and you can also see MTV's spoof of the Council of Elrond scene.  The second two discs have a treasure trove of stuff to go through, and I haven't seen much of it, but what I have seen is very interesting.  This DVD is a must have for any LOTR fan, and is a welcome addition to my DVD collection.  The sound quality seems to have been improved dramatically from the theatrical DVD release.  All in all, this is a great DVD worth buying.  The packaging is even interesting to look at.",1037491200,,1594,4.217821782178218
1319045,5,B00003CWT6,"The merits of Peter Jacksons' glorious adaption of the Lord of the Rings is addressed eloquently by many reviewers below.  This review is aimed at those contemplating the purchase of the Special Edition DVD.  You will rarely spend your money better.
The Fellowship of the Ring Special Edition is the new gold standard of DVD's.  It is, quite simply, the most outstanding DVD produced and I can only hope its lead will be followed by other studios.  It has everything you could ever want from a DVD collection.
First, the movie:  Yes, it is spread out over two disks.  However, the space has not been wasted.  The transfer is amazing.  The movie looks sharper, crisper and more beautiful than any other DVD I've seen.  The sound is excellent -- even on a simple stereo TV!  I looked at this side by side with the much-ballyhood Star Wars II digital transfer and there is simply no comparison.  Set against this disk, Star Wars looks blurry and murky.  LOTR is dazzling.
The new scenes are wonderful, adding depth to the story and characters.  The Lothlorien squence is completely revised and vastly improved.  My favorite new scene is after the Council of Elrond, when Aragorn visits his mother's grave.  And the music is recomposed, not simply looped.  This is THE definitive edition of FOTR.  You must have it.
What makes this the new standard are the two appendix disks.  The first has 2.5 hours of video and tons of stills on the development of the book to film.  The second has 3.5 hours and a few stills on the making of the movie.  All of this material is entertaining and informative.  By the end, you will feel like you've known the film-makers for years -- recognizing familiar faces when the pop up to explain some fascinating aspect of the movie.
Even better, however, is the organization.  Don't want to hunt around on the menus?  Hit ""Play All"" and it will cycle through the documentaries.  Wonder where some obscure still photograph is?  A printed map of the DVD is included.
I have never seen a studio or a film-maker be more giving and attentive to the needs of the audience.  New Line and Peter Jackson have truly earned the mountain of money they are going to make off this by providing quite simply the best DVD collection you will find.  I can only hope that the fantastic sales figures will open some eyes in Hollywood and teach them not only how to make great movies -- but how to make great home entertainment.",1037491200,,2433,4.610722610722611

PLEASE DO THIS MORE OFTEN.  DVD collectors are sick of getting the shaft by greedy execs without a shred of decency that have been bilking fans with the bait and switch over and over.

Go now!), and chances are you were pretty amazed by it. This extended edition adds more detail, explains more, and just has some nice little additional scenes that add to the experience. The movie alone is worth the extra money for this version, and that's not even including the extras, which give incredible insight into the creation of this wonderous film. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed the LOTR and loves DVD jam-packed with goodies. If there were a score higher than 5 stars, this DVD would get it.",1037404800,,645,4.716814159292035
1319048,5,B00003CWT6,"Even if you aren't a huge Tolkein fan, you may enjoy this movie yet.  It is very true to the book though, a rarity amongst blockbusters.  The cinematography and scenery is breathtaking.  It was well-shot, well-directed and well-casted.  It gets a bit overwhelming at times because there are a lot of characters and places to keep track of. It's a bit lenghty, but you really couldn't tell the story any other way.  Overall a very good film.",1037404800,,440,4.662337662337662
1319049,5,B00003CWT6,"First, a confession: I've only spent two or three hours with the documentary section of the dvd, and it appears I have not even scratched the surface of all the commentary tracks, documentary footage, and behind the scenes stuff. That will take me several weeks it looks like, so I'll confine my comments more to the film itself. As to the 30 minutes of replaced footage: (and I say this as a diehard denizen of Middle Earth) Hallelujah!
To look at this from a wide perspective, for those who are not fans of anything but the movie, it does not make for a better movie. In fact quite the opposite is true; from a purely cinematic standpoint this newer version is a bit clunkier and slower and some of the dialogue is a bit stiff. The added action sequences in particular, even if it's just the inclusion of a slightly wider shot in a battle, lack the crispness of the original. Mr. Jackson and company did their job well the first time. As to the technical aspects of the dvd format, suffice it to say that this should be the disc you take down to your local home-theater warehouse to demo equipment. It gets no better. The widescreen ratios and grains are seamless and the dialogue/soundtrack/fx balance is perfection. The surround is constant and skillful without being gimmicky.

For those who despaired of the lack of set up, especially of the interpersonal relationships that were evident in the book however, your prayers have been answered! Here is the bedrock of the Frodo/Sam bond that they play so heavily upon in the last ten minutes, now much better set up. Here is Aragorn and Boromir's dichotomy fleshed out. The gift scene with Galadriel is restored, and Gimli is finally more than a clown as his friendship with Legolas and his devotion to the White Lady of the Wood find a fuller flower. Interestingly, Merry and Pippin undergo a change from large to small screen, as they are much more violent and get a lot more licks in on the Uruk-hai orcs in the dvd, whereas in the cinematic release they were more often the victims. The largest footage difference is the first ten minutes of the movie, now narrated by Bilbo, and is an almost off-the-page recitation of ""concerning hobbits"" from the novel. (You can almost hear a New Line exec sitting in the screening room about five minutes into this going ""can we get to some dragon-stabbing-arrow-orc-blood-sword thing sometime soon?"")
In the final judgement, for those fans of the books like myself who still loved the movie, but missed developments of their favorite scene or character, this is a great payoff. For those who jumped on the wagon for the first time at the Cinerama, they'll wonder what all the fuss is about.",1037404800,,2686,4.678646934460888
1319050,5,B00003CWT6,"Having reviewed this film earlier on Amazon, I wondered if an extra thirty minutes could actually improve on what is already one of the most spectacular films ever made. To my surprise, it really does! First, understand that some scenes are added, and some are merely extended.
As far as the additional scenes go, the inclusion of Bilbo writing his story at the beginning of the epic lends a more 'comfortable' setting to the film, as do numerous, more intimate scenes of life in the Shire.
My favorite supplemental scene is the brief, but touching 'Passing of the Elves' where a long, slow parade of the immortal ones pass forever into the Grey Havens in the West. Accompanied by a revised and more haunting musical score, this moment becomes unforgettable. Less memorable might the Marshes of Midgewater sequence, which adds little to the storyline.
In general, the new footage seems to weave a more smooth transitional thread through the storyline, and makes us wonder why (other than time) such scenes were omitted in the first place. Such memorable moments as Gimili's request for a strand of Galadriel's hair, the equipping of the Fellowship by Galadriel, and Arwen's crestfallen countenance at the departure of Aragorn, develop characterizations more fully and wonderfully!! Finally, the fear the Elves displayed in allowing the Fellowship enter the City of Lorien is portrayed as it shouldve been in this extended version! Hooray for this edition!
My only complaint is that unlike the earlier DVD release, this version of the movie could not be fit onto one DVD, and if you have to change disks manually, it might become a small nuisance. Nevertheless, the extended version is top-notch, right down to the wonderful 'middle-earthy' boxed arrangement, and the additional disks containing background material, interviews, and much much more make this a must-have set!
In summary, the film is become much improved. This version should in no way be thought of as a mere gimmick. The supplementary material is appropriate, blended smoothly, and as stated, adds a depth to both character and plot development. In short, it really works!",1037404800,,2138,5.094017094017094

I never read the books, which I'd probably enjoy, but this movie was bad.  I saw it a long time ago, during it's cinemtic release, not on DVD, so I have forgotten, thankfully, what the lord of the ring is about.  I think if you where it you're invisible for three boring hours and than everybody sees you, gets angry that they looked for three hours when they had not a chance of finding you in the first place and than you escape your impending death by putting credits up so you get a a one year head start on a bunch of guys with swords and shields.",1037404800,2,661,4.264

1319113,5,B00003CWT6,"While I enjoyed and admired last year's theatrical release of The Fellowship of the Ring (partly out of the sheer joy of watching Middle-Earth come to life), I did not think that the film was truly worth all of the critical hosannas heaped upon it - despite its length and visual grandeur, the original release of the film felt wrong: although it was over 3 hours long and hit all the right points, in the rush just to tell the basic story onscreen, it seemed like too much had been left out.  I thought Jackson's handling of the action sequences was brilliant, but as far as the slower, quieter sections of the story were concerned, the original cut failed completely for me.  The film seemed too short and badly paced, despite its length.  However, something unprecedented in film history has happened with the release of the new extended edition of FELLOWSHIP: A good film has been raised to the level of a true masterwork with the addition of @30 mins. worth of new footage.  What you see now is practically a different film - a far more significant work of art and a deeper and richer emotional  experience.  The additions are not just a few scenes here and there - every sequence in the film seems to have been slightly reedited, and - miracle of miracles - the final result is destined to go down in history as one of the great epics ever made.  The new material is brilliantly chosen and incorporated: the sequences in the Shire and Lothlorien are double their original length, the very important scene of the Council in Rivendell has been recut so that it actually makes sense, the Moria scene now has the right level of slow build-up and a great deal of previously absent character development and necessary exposition has been added.  What was released in the theatres can now be seen as merely the superficial version of the tale: all of the performances have been given a depth and meaning that they did not have before (particularly Boromir, Strider, Gimli and Galadriel) - instead of being sketches, all the characters and their desires are fully fleshed-out.  Even more importantly, the new version is far better paced: the film now alternates between slow passages and action sequences, and the action scenes have a far greater impact than they did before because of this.  Furthermore, this version of the film makes the viewer feel totally immersed in a rich, complex society at a turning point in its history - the film just seems more real, less cartoonlike, than before.  The range of Jackson's vision and attention to detail is astonishing (I particularly love the new scene which features Strider arguing with Haldir in Sindarin Elvish) and gives the whole fantastic story a realism and emotional depth which captures the spirit of the novel. This is now the film that Tolkien's admirers wanted it to be.  It has everything - love, war, humour, sorrow, beauty, moral and philosophical depth - that an epic film and a great drama should have.  Now that this version has enabled us to see the true brilliance of the film, I have to say that - when completed - the entire tale of The Lord of the Rings as envisioned by Jackson and his cast and crew is going to go down in history as one of the great films of all time! Run, do not walk, to the nearest video store and immerse yourself in this film, because if this is any indication of what we can expect from the 2 remaining movies, you owe it to yourself to see this - a work of art like this film does not come along very often.  FELLOWSHIP is only going to get more popular with time - 50 years from now, I think people are going to describe THE LORD OF THE RINGS as the great cinematic epic of this age of the world.  Aren't we lucky to be the first generation to see it!",1037404800,,3747,4.53037037037037

1319116,5,B00003CWT6,"My initial reaction to the theatrical version of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was not wholly positive. It seemed dramatically thin and episodic, as if scenes were missing. * There was an ineffable ""vagueness"" that made me feel I was caught in a weird, disturbing dream. (Several friends had a similar reaction.)
The extended version corrects these problems, and again demonstrates why the director's initial cut is almost always ""right."" Restoring elements that do not directly relate to Frodo's quest ""opens up"" the film and allows it to ""breathe"" where breath is necessary. It's particularly nice to spend a bit more time with the hobbits at the beginning - the theatrical version moves much too ""abruptly"" into Frodo's flight.
Even if you own the first version, toss it and get the extended edition. (I was lucky - the store where I bought the first version allowed me to return it for a full refund, even though I'd opened the package - which is how I learned about the extended edition. Naughty New Line - naughty, naughty New Line!)
There are still some quibbles. The tone of the film is so dark that the few bits of humor seem glaringly out of place. Gimli's crack that ""This is one dwarf you don't toss!"" is so jarringly anachronistic that I nearly jumped out of my theater seat.
Peter Jackson's decision to underplay the material and treat it in a dramatic (rather than melodramatic) fashion leaves John Rhys-Davies and Christopher Lee with their heads above-ground, ready to be mown off, acting-wise. You expect dwarves to be feisty and loud-mouthed, and evil wizards to be melodramatically menacing, but these actors' performances are a little too broad to fit well with the other performances. On the other hand, Ian Holmes' turn as Bilbo is the best in the film, and should have earned him a supporting-actor Oscar nomination.
In attempting to give epic scope to Tolkien's vision, what was background on the page became foreground in the movie. The incredibly lavish sets and scenery (all digitally enhanced to visual perfection) tend to diminish the characters and their predicaments. The viewer is more aware of the setting than he ought to be. Peter Jackson should have had a long talk with Robert Zemeckis, who has repeatedly demonstrated how to make films loaded with special effects in which you're never aware of them.
Remember Orson Welle's remark that ""a movie studio is the best set of trains a boy ever had""? One of the reasons ""The Lord of the Rings"" was filmed was simply to show that such a huge, incredibly difficult and complex project could be successfully pulled off. What if ""The Wizard of Oz"" had been given the same treatment? ** Would it still be the classic it is? (If you want a possible answer, see ""Return to Oz."")
Any great story, poem, or piece of music builds to a payoff - emotional, intellectual, or spiritual. Brunhilde's immolation and the redemption of mankind are not isolated events, but what the preceding 17 hours of another famous ring story are leading up to. The story builds and develops toward that point.
The ultimate question about Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is not whether it's faithful to the book, but whether its parts will fit together to be greater than their sum - that after watching twelve hours of film, the viewer will have arrived at a moral or spiritual place different from where he started.
I haven't yet decided whether ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a great motion picture. But it is a magnificent piece of movie making. And for that alone it deserves five stars.
* This has nothing to do with being aware of scenes omitted from the novel. It is related to the overall pacing of the film, and to the way scenes relate and ""flow"" into each other. It's hard to describe, but easy to see.
** It was, for its day. But modern technology makes it possible to film the book almost exactly as written - including all the material MGM - and generations of fans - found unnecessary in the movie. There is a difference between ""richness"" and ""bloat.""",1037404800,,4024,4.741797432239657
1319117,5,B00003CWT6,"Let's get this out of the way really quickly. This movie is the best adaptation of a beloved book into a movie - even better than ""Gone with the Wind."" Believe me, that movie was highly anticipated at the time and they loved it. What makes ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" so incredible is that, just in the theatrical release, Peter Jackson told Tolkien's story with economy and the excellent cast brought the characters even more to life than they were in the book. You just can't write visual interaction in a book! The sly looks, the slow dawning of understanding, looks of horror or contempt are suited to a visual medium.
  The Extended Version's extra 30 minutes or so, some of which is NOT in the original, all work. My favorite is Frodo and Sam's lines coming out of the pub in Hobbiton! Even the audio commentary can be hilarious! Don't stop listening to it once the credits start rolling. The best line by one of the actors is right near the end. Believe me, just get it. It'll be months before you can even get to all of the bonus features. Enjoy!!

However, people should be warned against buying the gift set as opposed to the plain DVD.  After being duped into buying the theatrical release with practically no bonus material a few months ago, I was determined not to make that mistake again.  However, what I didn't realize that the only difference between the gift set and the regular DVD is the Argonath statuettes and the National Geographic DVD ""Beyond the Movie"", which may be a fabulous disc, but hardly worth more than twice the price.  Buy the special edition, it is a must-own, but don't waste your money on the ""gift set"", it is only a gift to the studio, just like the first DVD release.",1037318400,,821,4.595890410958904
1319181,5,B00003CWT6,"Simply put, this is the most complete and the most well done, thought out DVD set released to this date and will give nearly anything in the future a run for it's money. As decent as the previous 'theatrical' Fellowship of the Ring DVD release was, this is the real deal. All new extras that make the previous outing's extra disc look almost sad.
The film now is spread across 2 dics, but for reason. The more 'things' you cram onto  a disc the lower the quality is. So they're really doing it for us, not against us. The print is spetacular to say the least, as is the DD 5.1 Audio. 4 Commentary tracks are present and I've listened to both the writer/directors and cast tracks and they're the best commentaries by far I've ever ran across. The information we're given is valid and entertaining. Some commentaries run like people have been forced into doing them and aren't enjoying it, but the opposite is true here.
The additonal footage added blends in so well and makes the film that much more complete, especially for a fan of the books such as myself. It's the little things that count and Peter Jackson knows that and it shows. Some times you can't even tell anything was added because the scenes flow that much better. Even at 3.5 hours, this film still flies by fast.
To say the appendices were stuffed with extras would be a gross understatment. Every aspect of the creation of this film is so well presented it's beyond belief how amazing these documentaries are.
Every individual interviewed shows how many love, care, and work went into this project that it was bound to succeed. I've never seen such dedication for a project and it's great to know all this work was so worthwhile. From adaptation of story to the early concept drawings and pre-visualizations of the film, we see how it visually started to come together. From the sword to the scale model, we see how much work from the WETA workshop was put into this film to not only get the film done, but make it done right, accurately, and with a detail unmatched.
The relationship of the cast is as unique as the project they took part in. From their pre-filming training sessions to their year and a half spent together almost non-stop, these people genuinely were a family. There is a kinship unmatched between these people and their talk of each other never comes off uninspired or false. To see a varying group of people come together so is mesmerizing. The time put in from travelng to shoots to hours in the makeup trailer, we get to go along for the whole ride.
For anyone would was head over heels in love with the film to someone who may have not even cared for it, this set has so much that someone is bound to find something to become enthralled with. It's almost not so much a story of the film, but of the people. And it shows that when the right people come together, magic is bound to happen.",1037318400,,2877,4.48
1319182,5,B00003CWT6,"When I saw The Fellowship of the Ring in theatre, I must say I was quite impressed, most notably with the performance of Elijah Wood and Ian McKellan.  When it came on DVD, I rented it once but vowed not to buy it until this special edition came out.  Boy, was it worth it.  I had thought that the theatrical version lacked just that little bit of fleshing out, especially with the characters of Aragorn and Galadriel, and this edition certainly provided it.  I won't spoil the experience of watching it by describing what was left out, but those few extra minutes made the film twice as good.
I envy children born now, since they'll have the rich cinematography and wonderful acting and incredible special effects to watch in this film, and then they can read the books afterwards and see what was left out of the films, just to make more room for the action sequences in the story.
Anyway, this film deserved every Oscar it got, but also deserved two more, best supporting actor (Ian McKellan), and best picture.  And it deserved one more nomination as well--a best supporting actor nomination for Sean Bean, who played Boromir.  His performance was fantastic, and he's one of the most underrated British actors around today.
In other words, I can't say enough good things about this film.  Just rent it, or buy it, or see it somewhere!",1037318400,3,1338,4.6440677966101696

This special extended version rectifies most of those removal mistakes. Still there are still some things from the book not shown here, but I'm finding it harder to complain. Some things were added that weren't from the book, too. Funny (but true) seeing Frodo and Bilbo hide from the Sackville-Baggins (ahem, Lobelia I presume). Pippin actually has flatulance? I will say no more, but the extended version has some of Tolkien's good humor and more from his clever mind. Can't wait to see Two Towers even more so, now.",1037318400,,639,4.517241379310345

1319186,5,B00003CWT6,"I have been reading, re-reading and devouring TLOTR, and all things Tolkien for 33 years. I have waited for this movie to come out after the first time I read the novel. I stopped counting the number of times I read it after about 90 something.
The extended version of the movie is even better, if that could be believed, than the theatrical release. I found myself once again enjoying it as if it were the first time I have seen it, (which in fact was about the 7th). The added scenes were superbly inserted, artistically chosen and wonderfully fullfilling.
While I must admit that it took me a little time to get over some of the changes that Peter Jackson had to make in order to bring this story to the screen, (most of the changes were agreeably necessary, with perhaps two exceptions, the deletion of Glorfindel, and the surmise that Aragorn is shirking his lineage and destiny), the extra features that were included in the extended dvd which shows just how slavish they really were to being faithful as much as possible to the book made me a convert.
I agree with many others who express incredulity at A Beautiful Mind winning over TLOTR. What politically correct tripe was that?
I can only hope that the Two Towers will fare better. Ditto with Ian McKellan for best actor/supporting actor.
What is more, I think Peter Jackson did more that he thought with this DVD release. I think he has set the standard to which all other DVD's will need to be measured against. I have finally seen a movie which inserted the cut scenes into the movie instead of a directory of deleted scenes.
Bravo, and well done!!!!!",1037318400,,1615,4.572413793103448
1319187,5,B00003CWT6,"This is the film that should have been released to theaters. In many extended director's cuts the additional material is a waste of time. Every bit of added material included in this DVD either advances the plot or provides further insight into the hobbits/middle earth that Tolkienaphiles will love.

1319229,5,B00003CWT6,"My first impression of this set: Why?  I mean, please, just add the deleted scenes to the regular disk like everyone else.  And why should we buy into their clever little money making scheme with the two releases?
And the answer is:  They did EVERY LAST THING right!  The extended version is even more epic and incredible than the theatrical release, with some of those little scenes you missed thrown back in.  Adding them back into the movie is so superior to seeing some partially produced deleted scenes at the end.  The re-mastered sound is awesome, and using 16x9 format is the best possible way to approach that theater feeling at home.  The extras are interesting, well produced, and exhaustive.  I have never seen so much information on how a movie was made, from any source, ever.  I plopped down the extra for the ""collector's gift set"", and the Argonauth bookends are cool.

The extended edition just shows the audience the enormity of the project... so you can get a scope of the time, effort, and scale that it took on.  You cannot fully appreciate this wonderful movie without the platinum edition. 5 stars hands down.",1037318400,,346,4.40625
1319231,2,B00003CWT6,"Many people emphasize that this extended version is for true Tolkien fans because it includes more scenes from the book that were omitted in the theatrical release, thus elaborating more on Tolkien's original plot. This much is true. However, for every element that is added from Tolkien, there are several truly awful scenes that serve to further the vision of Peter Jackson, a vision that contradicts that of Tolkien. For instance, there are two new scenes with Aragorn where he makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with being King of Gondor. Tolkien was very clear that Aragorn was never in denial about his identity, but was instead awaiting the fullness of time to fulfill his destiny. I realize that in the theatrical release, the elrond character stated that Aragorn turned from the path of being king a long time ago. However, this is still somewhat acceptable. Because it never has Aragorn say what his motivations are. The impression that I got was that it only appeared that Aragorn had given up his claim to the throne, which would be consistent with the book.
Another example is a scene from the book which is added that destroys the flow of the movie. The problem is not the scene from the book, but that Jackson's rearrangement of the plot makes it almost impossible to reinsert this into the movie without destroying the impact of other scene. I am talking about scene where the elves are passing to the grey havens. In the original movie there is a voice over of Bilbo saying ""...and if you don't keep your feet, there's no telling where you may be swept off to"". As this is spoken the scene changes to a beautiful twighlight landscape, and then a black writer ominously appears in the right of the scene. The extended version however has the voiceover occur over a scene change to Sam cooking dinner for Frodo. Then we see the elves traveling. The aforementioned black rider over landscape scene does not occur until later. Jackson was forced to do this by his rearrangement of Tolkiens plot. The black rider landscape scene occurs in the movie to set up the scene where the Hobbits are hiding from the rider under a tree root. In the book the elf scene comes after this one but Jackson couldn't do this because his elf scene has two Hobbits witnessing it, while his black rider scene has four Hobbits, thus forcing him to reverse the order of the events in the book, and also destroy the impact of the movie. This goes to show that Jackson did not simply edit the movie to make it work better as a movie, because the original story would have worked better, and the impact of the scene order could have been preserved.
Thirdly there is a problem with the expanded Gimli scenes. One has Aragorn scolding Gimli for being rude to the elves. First, this does not happen in the book, as Gimli is very respectful, and second, this makes Jackson's Aragorn even less likeable, as the elves were rude to Gimli first.
Overall I would say that the extended edition is interesting, but for every element that is added from the original, there is an irritating addition from a pretentious director.
By the way, there is no way that a movie can remain true to the spirit of the novel when the motivations of the characters are completely changed, e.g. Aragorn. I am not someone who is of the opinion that no movie can be as good as the book. I think that Peter Jackson could have made the movie every bit as good as the book, but instead he chose to impose his own vision on someone else's work.",1037318400,,3506,4.566666666666666
1319232,4,B00003CWT6,"..I will save the empty star in Tolkien's honor.  Don't get me wrong, this film is a 5 out of 5.  I don't think anyone could create perfectly what we imagine when we read Lord of the Rings.
First off, this is a beautiful film.... Cinematography like LOTR:FOTR is a rare gem... The only other movie that I remember being so beautiful like this was the Thin Red Line.  This film captures exactly what I pictured in the books.
Second, the acting is NOTHING short of spectacular.  This movie is what Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, etc. will be remembered for.
On to my criticism (what I think should have been different)
**MAJOR SPOILER ALERT FOR THE TRILOGY (or anyone who hasn't read the trilogy)**
**TOLKIEN GEEKS ONLY**
Ok.  Now that's done.  I didn't really like how in the beginning of film how they showed Sauron in battle with the elves and humans.  I know it's the history of what happened, and pretty important for a film to tell back-story, but one of the reasons I love the books is that you never ""see"" Sauron... at all in the story.  Small quam, but relevant to me.
PS.  Why are Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings ever used in the same sentence?  Completely different films, no discredit to either, just different.  :)",1037318400,,1223,4.48868778280543

Also, the paint job is nowhere near what it should be.  The bookends in the photo seem to be nicely highlighted.  Mine are highlighted on the top only, and I am sorely tempted to redo the paint job myself, and re-base them so they can be used as the bookends they are advertised to be.",1037318400,,566,4.137614678899083

1319235,5,B00003CWT6,"I've never met him, but Peter Jackson must love his fans more than any director in the world.  He certainly loves his subject matter.  With this 4 DVD set Jackson and Co. have given us what could very well be the most comprehensive DVD release ever made.  Like the movie itself, it is a labor of love, and it comes through.
I bought the first DVD release, and at the time I was whining about the studio targeting weak willed fans (like myself) who would buy both versions like helpless crack-heads, or more accurately, like ring craving Gollums.  Watching them both side by side, you can tell that one is a studio release while the other is a director's release.  While Jackson may be avoiding the term ""director's cut"" like the plague, I can't think of a more accurate description.  Jackson put a ton of work into the extended version amassed a plethora of special features then wrapped it in a beautiful package and released it at a modest price.
The extended version of the movie is very nice.  It's hard to say it makes the movie better, because it was already one of the greatest movies ever made, but it does give you more of the same.  More greatness can't be a bad thing.  I know a lot of chowder heads that actually didn't like Fellowship because it was too long.  Doubtless these individuals would be better served watching Adam Sandler movies or taking a little nappy.  If they didn't like it before they will probably loathe it now.  The additional footage does slow the pace down some what, but anyone who ever read the books knows that the pace was never as frantic as portrayed in the film.  I think fans of the books will be best served by the extended cut.  There are details now included that many crybaby purists can now wipe their eyes and stop sniveling about.  I thought the movie was fantastic as it was.  I actually know someone that complained about Bill the Pony not being featured more. BILL THE PONY!!  I kid you not.  Frankly if Bill and Tom Bombadil have to be sacrificed to make room for what IS included it was not in vain.
I'll admit that I haven't completely explored all the features on this disk, but anyone claiming to have done so this soon after the release is either lying to you or fooling themselves.  It is an incredible amount of information.  I've watched quite a few of the documentaries and they are excellent.  Some of the more technical ones, like the one on digital grading are very interesting, but it's the ones with the cast and crew telling stories that I found most interesting and down right entertaining.  One of the things that everyone in the cast talks about is how there was as much Fellowship off the screen as on, and you can really tell.  Some of the stories and behind the scenes stuff is laugh out loud funny.  You can tell everyone had a good time making the movies and usually when people are having a good time; it comes through in their work.  I'm usually not interested in the off screen hijinks of movie stars, but the cool thing about this cast is that many of them aren't really stars and some are actually new to film making.  They lack a pretentiousness and snootiness that they hopefully will never pick up with their inevitable fame and fortune.
The history of the books and the author was also pretty interesting even if it's been better told elsewhere.  The huge gift set comes with the National geographic special on the Lord of the Rings and it's pretty comprehensive.  I've only seen snippets of it, but I have every intention of owning it.  The documentaries do go into the themes of the book and Tolkien's dislike of allegory.  The books are meant to be timeless belonging to no particular age or social situation.  Undoubtedly this is their greatest strength and one that Jackson has gone to great lengths to translate.
It's wonderful to think we have TWO MORE movies to go.  There is so much information and entertainment wrapped up in this first Expanded Edition set that I can't fathom having all three on my shelf.  While I'm not surprised that the first film was snubbed at the Oscars, nor will I be surprised when the other two are snubbed for best picture, I think time will show these movies to be the greatest single cinematic piece ever created.  We are watching history in the making.",1037318400,,4281,4.52405721716515
1319236,5,B00003CWT6,"I am a Tolkien zealot (as I like to put it), and though I loved ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" when it hit theaters last year, I had my share of problems with it, being the die-hard fanatic that I am. Some of these were liberties taken by the filmmakers that could not, and cannot, be reversed (Arwen instead of Glorfindel, Aragorn's leaving of Anduril in Rivendell, etc.). However, this extended ""director's cut"" has fixed quite a few of the earlier edit's annoyances. Though I loved the original film despite the occasional niggle, this expanded version FEELS more like Tolkien. The pace is less rushed (even though the first film was very long itself), and there are considerably more character moments. Gimli and Boromir are the most notable improvements. Boromir was always excellently developed (even more so now), but Gimli, as a character, was very weak. In fact, Gimli's portrayal as seen by the original cut was a severe disappointment, as Gimli is one of my favorite characters, and he had been reduced to a surly complainer who seemed to lack all but the most basic of emotions. Now, however, Gimli feels more like Gimli, thanks to his moments with Galadriel and Haldir in Lothlorien. One of the best new scenes, however, involves Sam and Frodo, as they spy a troupe of Elves departing Middle Earth. Almost every second of added footage is completely worthwhile. This stuff isn't just for fans of the novels, though - the added scenes make for a more coherent and heartfelt picture (and a slightly more violent one as well). My only real beef with the extended version is that it spans the course of TWO discs, which brings with it the annoyance of exchanging when one has ended. Add to this new and improved Fellowship a whole horde of previously unseen features and you have the ultimate Fellowship of the Ring presentation. Tolkien fans and fans of the films should not pass this one up under any circumstances.",1037232000,,1924,4.763473053892215
1319237,5,B00003CWT6,"I can't pretend to have seen all the extras on this deluxe DVD edition of The Fellowship of the Ring. What I can comment on is the extended version of the movie. The original release was a brilliant diamond with minor flaws. The new, improved version is looks like the same diamond but on closer inspection the flaws aren't there.
The extension of some scenes and addition of others makes Tolkien's rich fantasy allows for deeper character and plot developments. Additionally, some of the characters are given a richer back story that enables to understand their movitations better. The difference is like looking through a microscope adjusted for the first time to the proper focus; we were aware that something was there all along but now can distinguish what we're looking at. All of this adds to a richer understanding of this classic fantasy as a film.
The transfer appears nearly flawless and is one of the sharpest I've seen (the only transfers I can think of that are comparable in clarity, color and sharpness are Toy Story 1 & 2, A Bug's Life and Lucas' Star Wars: Attack of the Clones). Peter Jackson's commentary is illuminating and interesting in all the right places. More importantly, their interesting even in the most mundane scene. His explanation doesn't demystifying the film. They actually underline the difficulty of his task in taking Tolkien's epic vision squeezing it into a well tailored suit that compliments the material.
Enough has been said about the marvelous effects and acting (and it is a crime this film didn't win more Academy Awards but then that's nothing new). I can't really say anything any better than what has been stated before. I have stuck my big toe into the pool of extras and they are tremendous and interesting. Even if you don't watch the documentaries again (or for the first time), you'll be digging this version of the film out to enjoy again and again.
The packaging is quite nice although a bit flimsy. I would have like to have seen more added to the booklet but most of what's important is on the discs. It's not noted anywhere (that I can recall) but the first editions of this boxed set include a free ""ticket"" to The Two Towers.",1037232000,,2189,4.732984293193717
1319298,5,B00003CWT6,"First off, I am *not* one of those people who has read the entire set of Lost Tales published after Tolkien's passing. I also have only read ""The Silmarillion"" once. I am not, I hope, to be considered a fanboy. But I have seen the theatrical version of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" at least three times, and the extended version once. I am still working on the commentary tracks as I write this.
FOTR:SE is a must-see for anyone interested in good storytelling and this particular genre. The additional scenes had the effect of giving the story truly balanced pacing. This rhythm made the film feel surprisingly shorter than the original theatrical release. As if that was not enough of a pleasant surprise, the characterizations are richer and more understandable. I understand why Peter Jackson elected to shorten the theatrical release to 3 hours, but I strongly insist that it made for an inferior film to the masterpiece of the extended version.
This set has the character of being many things for many potential customers. The bargain hunter will realize its value immediately since once is getting up to 5 DVD discs for a street price of $... The audiophile will lose his/her mind when deciding to use Dolby 5.1 EX, DTS 6.1 or regular Dolby Surround Sound. The film student will have over 14 hours of commentary to listen to and explore. And the collector will get a set of nice bookends in the surprisingly well made recreation of the Argonath in miniature. And if these are not reasons enough, the initial set I received (with unexpected alacrity from Amazon.com, I might add) has a coupon good for one free admission to ""The Two Towers"" if you catch it within its first two weeks at the theater!
One can make all the noise in the world about features, but what about quality? That has, so far, been indisputably superb. The audio commentaries I have heard so far are very atypical of the Hollywood DVD commentary track. Usually, these tracks feel drawn out, boring, uninspired, tedious or at least superfluous. Not this time. What a relief it is that the production values of the film evidently were passed along to this astonishing DVD collection.
""The Fellowship of the Ring: SE"" set is not a mere labor of love. It is, rather, a labor of intelligence and passion both. Those of you who purchased the DVD back in August of 2002 when it first appeared should take heart that the overlap between that DVD and this one is surprisingly small. So yes, you can own them both and not feel that you have the same film twice. Instead, you can feel positive about having two editions of a fine piece of classic storytelling.",1037232000,,2622,4.677489177489178

I have to admit, being an avid fan of the series, I was terribly disapointed in the characeter development (or lack there of) in the theatrical release of this film.  Tolkiens world was much deeper then just action and a story.  It was about people and not only their struggle to accomplish their mission, but their inner struggles as well.  The bonus footage on this film completes this film.  For one, It gives a more in depth description of hobbit life which I think is essential in the movie since in reality, the movie is about them.  Boromirs and Aaragons characters are also deeper then they were before.  We also get to see the much missed gift giving scene.  Over all I thought the movie flowed better then the original release.  And, even though it is 30 min. longer it doesn't seem it.  This edition is not just for tolkein fans, it is for everyone.",1037232000,9,944,4.436046511627907

The previous version of the DVD was great for those people who just wanted to see the movie again.  THIS DVD set, however, is for the fan.  It gives insight into the filmmaking process from the perspective of many of the people who were involved in the making of the film.

  As a Tolkien fan, I did realize that the movie does differ from the book in many areas, but the quintessential elements of the story were portrayed to such exactness that the only way I could be happier then to watch this masterpiece come to life, was becoming a hobbit, and being in the movie as well.
  This first installment just gives you a taste for what is about to happen to our poor, broken fellowship. I love the extended because it conveys more background information that will be useful in the upcoming  installments.
  I believe that the first version of the movie was marvelous, but for those of you who have an unquenchable thirst for Tolkien, the extended version is the way to go.
  The special features lets you in on how much effort was put into this film as long with hints to some things that only the readers of the books will understand, but all in all it is suited for everyone.

1319304,5,B00003CWT6,"In what has to be the greatest DVD box set ever produced for a single film, The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring: Extended Edition takes a great film and lovingly improves it to a phenomenal level of perfection.
Upon first viewing the theatrical version on it's opening day of release, I was immediately in love with the first film of this trilogy. The expertise and care in adapting the wonderful Tolkien book into film was amazing, producing one of the best adaptations of all time. It made me fall in love with movies all over again, like Star Wars did for me at a young age. After a few months of digesting it and seeing it repeatedly, I decided that it had to take top spot as my favorite film. Each time after viewing it, I couldn't bare to watch anything else for days since it would pale in comparison to Fellowship.
Well, I now found a film that squashes that theatrical version: The Extended Edition. The addition of 30 extra minutes is seamlessly woven back into the fabric of this masterpiece with a new orchestrated score. And the results are amazing. There are no big action scenes added, nothing that changes the plot, just simple character development that makes the world of Middle Earth come even more alive. The film's so authentic and detailed it seems like this place must exist somewhere on Earth.
Smaller characters such as Merry, Pippin, Legolas and Gimli are further fleshed out, and the inclusion of Frodo and Sam witnessing of a group of wood elves on their way to leave Middle Earth forever gives the film a stronger sense of melancholy. It proves early in this story that Middle Earth will not be the same ever again. Such small inclusions really pack an additional wallop in the audience's emotional involvement. So much so I can't imagine ever watching the theatrical version again.
What makes this so special is that often when an excellent film is expanded for the home video market, the added material is usually better left out. Longer versions of movies such as Star Wars, Apocalypse Now Redux and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (excluding the recent director's cut) only hurt the film. But this Fellowship edition provides the shinning example of how an extended version can be far and away superior to the original.
I rarely include discussion on special features in my reviews, but here I cannot avoid it. This DVD's special features surpasses anything ever done in the short history of DVD. There are hours and hours of additional viewing, exploring every step of the movie's creation. Everything from the history of J.R.R. Tolkien  to post production is extensively covered here. The production of this trilogy is the most documented filmmaking experience in history, and the DVD takes full advantage of it. With almost 30 hours of extras, you'll feel like you were on set with director Peter Jackson for the four years that went into making The Fellowship of the Rings.
For anyone that enjoyed the theatrical version of Fellowship and those looking for an extensive study on what goes into making a major motion picture, this DVD is an absolute must-buy. You will not be disappointed. This gets my all-time highest recommendation.",1037232000,21,3184,4.789090909090909

I went through the books quickly and found myself at the theatre four times to watch this film.  I have never spent so much time in a movie theatre for one film in my life! Plus I've watched the DVD 3 times at home.
I love this film.  Each time I watch it I truly escape to another world.  Although Tolkiens books do have more wonderful detail, the movies do them excellent justice.  You get emotionally attached to the characters and follow it as if you were in the movie yourself.  Even my fiance loves this film and has sat through it at home a couple times herself.
The cinematography, the special effects and the amazing actions and battle scenes.  Unlike anything else ever seen.  The DVD is worth every penny and these books should be a standard for every 8-9 year old to get them hooked don reading.

1319395,5,B00003CWT6,"I didn't think they could improve the theatrical release - but they did.  The thirty minutes of extra fotage here add insight in to the characters and extra storyline, cunningly woven in seamlessly to the rest of the movie with full digital effects and new music.  Nitpicky fans who complained of things being left out will be happy - there is now more talk of Isildur's shattered blade, an argument with the elves at Lothlorien, Gandalf uttering the tongue of Mordor at the council, and a whole lot more.  The theatrical release was excellent, but this is better.
Did I forget to mention the TWO WHOLE DISCS of extras?  Everything but the sink in the set bathroom is here.  Highly, highly, highly informative.
Peter Jackson, you are the man.
Oh, I read one review complaining of FOTR's lack of a Best Picture Oscar.  Fear not, the Academy is waiting.  In two years, when Return of the King is up, Peter Jackson will have his Oscars.  They'll give it to the last installment, but it will really be for all three.  Trust me, it will win.  A franchise that is bringing in this much money can't loose.  Money does it (look at Titanic).
I digress.  Get this version.  Even if you have the other Theatrical release DVD, this one is worth owning as well - there are no repetive extras, and there are new commentaries.

1319396,5,B00003CWT6,"I was just slightly familiar with Tolkien and his writings. My only knowlege of Middle Earth came from the cartoon version of
""The Hobbit"", and I found that film un-watchable. However, I knew there was a huge fan base for Tolkien and his stories of the rings, so when the movie was released, last year, I wasn't surprised by the incredible box office results, but I had no interest in seeing it.
When it was released on DVD it was sans DTS, which is important to me. It usually indicates that another version, especially of such a blockbuster will be re-released, with dts, at a later date. However, my daughter purchased a copy and loaned it to me to watch. I was absolutely blown away. I probably watched it four times in one week. It immediatly went on my top ten of all time.
Now this. Re-released with never before seen footage AND DTS 6.1 ES. The sound is as good as any DVD that's ever been released. Heaven. The movie is longer but what an epic. The additional scenes add to the movie as opposed to just extra ""stuff.""
It's interesting to see all the influences this story has had on previous films, especially George Lucas and his Star Wars sagas, which, it appears to me, have become special effects displays.

1319398,5,B00003CWT6,"If you thought `The Fellowship of the Ring' theatrical version was wonderful, wait until you see this!!  I love J.R.R. Tolkien's books and the movie is one of my favorite films of all time, but this Special Extended Edition is even better!  More character development, more humor, more references to the book and more backstory.
The great thing about this version is that, instead of tacking in irrelevant deleted scenes to the DVD, the scenes were completely integrated into the original version of the movie with additional music composed by Howard Shore.  What you get is a much fuller and more fulfilling version of the film and changes the focus from being Frodo-centric to a layered story of Middle Earth and it's creatures.
There are sprinklings of added footage all over the film.  Sometimes if you blink you'll actually miss it.  Everyone in the Fellowship has added scenes but the characters who receive the biggest boost are Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett).  You see more of Aragorn's backstory as well as a warmer, more endearing side to his character.  While Galadriel appeared fearsome and grave in the original version, the elven queen is kindly and compassionate in this one.  My favorite new scenes are: the 4 hobbit heroes in the Green Dragon Inn - having fun and a good brew with their fellow hobbits (new characters such as Gaffer Gamgee and Ted Sandyman are also introduced); Elrond and Aragorn in Gilraen's (Aragorn's mothers) grave; and a warm and endearing scene in Lothlorien with Gimli and Galadriel as well as Aragorn and Galadriel.  Of all the locations, the Shire and Lothlorien get the biggest boost.  The gift-giving scene is back in and we see and hear more of Lord Celeborn (Marton Csokas) and Haldir.
All this and we haven't even began to look at the fantastic extra features and documentaries!!!  There are too many to mention (20+ hours of extras!).  In fact, I would suggest that you take in these behind-the-scenes documentaries a handful at a time as there is a LOT of information to absorb.  My favorites are the features ""The Fellowship of the Cast,"" ""A Day in the Life of a Hobbit"" and ""Cameras of Middle Earth"" in disk 4.  They show loads of cast and crew interviews (many of them candid and funny - esp. those with Dom Monaghan, Viggo, Sean Bean and Billy Boyd) as well as informative (and sometimes hilarious) behind-the-scenes footage.  And don't forget to locate the 2 easter eggs as well - the MTV movie awards spoof of the Council of Elrond and the fan trailer of ""The Two Towers.""
If you plan to own only one DVD this year and especially if you are a ""Lord of the Rings"" fan, you MUST get your hands on this DVD.  It is an absolute gem!  Even if you own the theatrical version of the Fellowship DVD, this one is a must have.  Both DVDs are completely different - in the movie version as as well as extra content.  This truly is a wonderful Christmas present from Peter Jackson and New Line to the fans and one that you will keep coming back to in years to come!",1037232000,2,3036,4.651685393258427

The special effects were amazing,especially the Bridge of Khazad Dum scene,with the mighty fire Balrog.
It depicts all the characters very,very well,and all the scenes were just like the way I imagined them in the books. It is a quite scary film in fact,because after the first time I saw it, I could`nt sleep for days because of the way Bilbo looked when he made a grab for Frodo`s ring. The orcs were done very well indeed, as were the Elves, and especially the Dwarves. Apart from the spectacular screenplay, it also has spectacular music and sound effects.
The battle scenes could`nt be better,and the acting is very well done,as were the scenes from Hobbiton. The council of Elrond and Lothlorien scenes were absolutely terrific. I would recommend this film to any fantasy lover or good film watcher.

Although it quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time, I still lamented some of the detail that was left out. I understood that it had to be edited and that no exhibitor would ever book a 3-1/2 hour movie at normal ticket prices.
When I heard the first information on this edition, I decided to forego the first DVD release and get this one instead.
The wait was worth it!
Although there are still a few details missing and a few things to quibble about, the result is simply stunning and can stand in its own right. Three and one-half hours of this movie is, quite simply, worth the investment in time. I'd recommend this to all fans of the original book - an audience that's proven its willingness to invest the time to get the most out of the experience.
I'm more anxious than ever to see ""The Two Towers"", and then to get its extended edition! In the history of movie ""franchises"", this is the crown jewel. A breathtaking accomplishment, if Peter Jackson never did another noteworthy thing in his life, this alone would elevate him to a legendary status comparable to his source material. His ability to bring this story vividly to life is almost as awesome as Tolkien's in writing it in the first place. (See also my review of the book where I state my opinion that's it's the greatest work of fiction in the English language - not excluding Shakespeare!)
I have no doubt that all three movies, when they've been released both thearically and in their extended editions, will prove among the most profitable and enduring ever filmed. I only hope that sometime along the way, the Academy sees fit to reward them with something more than technical Oscars.

In addition, there are four audio commentaries and six hours of documentaries and other never-before-seen bonus features.

LOTR is an extraordinary first segment in the potent moral trilogy that explores the dark, seductive lure of obtaining power through occult means and the destructive grip that lust-for-power-alone eventually has on the souls it possesses.

The first two discs are the movie and terrific commentaries.  The third disc is ""From Book To Vision.""  The fourth disc is ""From Vision to Reality.""

Why?
This ""special edition"" is NOT the wonderful theatrical release PLUS additional scenes that simply add to your enjoyment, but is instead a curious re-edit of the movie. In my opinion, the many changes from the original version sacrifice pace, focus, and narrative flow for the dubious benefits of showing modified and/or extended scenes that: (1) restore lines of Tolkein's dialogue/exposition,(2)restore stunt work that is silly (e.g. Aragorn and Boromir pulling the Cave Troll's chain; Merry and Pippin killing Uruk Hai by throwing stones [hobbits + uruk hai = ewoks + stormtroopers???]).  Lines are inexplicably taken from one character and given to another, diminishing several great performances in the process, but without adding much.  The new scenes frequently don't quite match the look of the original footage, which I found jarring.  Worse, the long awaited Lothlorien gift giving scene is merely OK, and includes material that departs from the books (e.g. Sam gets rope as his gift - even if the Battle of the Shire has been cut from the movie trilogy, why not still have Galadriel give Sam a gift for his garden in hope of better days?; Aragorn does not receive the golden scabbard for Narsil, as that sword is still broken back in Rivendell in this movie, but if he doesn't have a scabbard from Lorien the scene at the door to Theoden's Hall is badly damaged, and for no good reason!). Worst of all, the much advertised additional music jumps in all over the place, changing the rhythms of the scenes in a way that shows just how fantastic were the original editing and scoring.
Bottom line: I loved the theatrical release, and am sadly disappointed by this ""special edition"".  I will watch this edition for the commentaries, and will enjoy the documentaries and fine WETA bookends, but I will go back to the theatrical release DVD whenever I want to enjoy a masterpiece of cinema.",1037145600,5,2073,4.948275862068965

Everyone else who's written a review here says much the same thing though, so 'nuff said.
My review is on the special DVD extended edition GIFT SET in particular. The set includes the extended edition 4-disc DVD (the same as the one sold separately as the extended edition) along with a DVD of National Geographic's Beyond the Movie ""Lord of the Rings"". The set also has a pair of Argonath bookends, a supposedly Hobbit-sized version of the fan club's magazine, and a pack of three of Decipher's trading cards (looks like all the sets have the same three--Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli).
This special gift set is not cheap, retailng at about $80 (yikes!). I got it the day it came out .... The Extended Edition DVD by itself though was going...so I guess all I paid was [a cupple of dollars]for the extra stuff.
The NatGeo DVD is pretty interesting, incorporates a lot of info about Tolkien (all of it already known by any fans of JRR that have been around awhile). It's kind of one of those things you watch once and enjoy and then never watch it again. The Argonath bookends look really cool and detailed, but they're kind of, well, small. And not too heavy weighted either--they are probably only good for holding together your hardback copies of Tolkien's masterpiece. Personally, I like them better just being used as decorative pieces on the shelf. Also, this is odd and will probably go away over time, but the darn things SMELL (!). I guess it's the resin or whatever they make them out of. The other ""special"" stuff included isn't that special really--just a thin little magazine designed to look like the big LOTR fan club magazine (with all kinds of high praise for people who join said club of course) and a thin pack of three Decipher cards for their game. The special gift set does NOT come with a free movie ticket for the Two Towers--if you want the free ticket, you have to buy the separate Extended DVD, not the gift set.
Really, all in all, unless you can get this gift set at a fairly reasonable price like I did, I wouldn't put the additional money down for the gift set--just get the extended DVD on its own. The only really neat extra item you get is the so-called bookends. And while they're cool, I don't think they're [expensive] cool.",1037145600,3,2456,4.521348314606741

We have already had a peek at the Golum, whose ""precious"" is a critical element. I hope that before getting to deeply into this film--great as it is, that the really interested viewer will take the time to find out what Bilbo did, and how his adventure is a vital part of a real understanding what is happening.

1319465,5,B00003CWT6,"This may well get lost amid a flood of reviews, but I feel compelled to post it.  The DVD industry has become notorious for its constant moneygrab ""editions"", with rerelease upon rerelease, ""Collector's Edition"" this, and ""Platinum Version"" that, and for the most part that notoriety is well-deserved...it is shameful, transparent, and valueless in the majority of cases.  But not in this one.  Beyond expectations, this extended edition finally, finally provides a version of the movie that is worthy of the legendary kudos that have been heaped on it.  Allowing Jackson to provide it is the best thing New Line could have chosen to do; financially for them, creatively for Jackson and his team, and entertainment-wise for us.  It's a rare win-win-win.
I have to say, I was not one to agree with the raving over the original theatrical release.  I may be called a ""purist"", though I certainly would not have characterized myself as such, but I unapologetically take offense at the thought of taking creative liberties with a license and set of literature of the level of unmatched brilliance, scope, and endurance as Tolkien's.  As such, things like Arwen replacing Glorfindel, the editing mockery imposed on the Elrond council, the reduction of the Hobbits to comic relief, and so on, compounded each other and drastically reduced the movie's value for me.  I thought the film was ok, but for this passionate fan of the books, it was ultimately more disappointment than pleasant surprise.
However, beyond belief, I have to say that this extended edition redeems the film in ways I could never have imagined 30 extra minutes doing.  The better pacing during travel sequences, the darker menace of the battles, the enhanced majesty and relevance of the Lothlorien sequence, the extra character development (e.g. Boromir, Frodo, Gimli), a much more powerful, intelligent finale...it's hard to fathom that individual example improvements like these could make such an incredible difference.  But they can and do, to the point where this is practically a new film altogether.  The added scenes were masterfully selected, and the new scores for them are marvelous.  Not only has Peter Jackson used the lack of time constraints to excellent advantage, but he has actually gotten better at his editing choices as well, to the point where I feel this film really does reflect Tolkien's original vision better than the original theatrical release.
In short, this is the version of this movie that deserves all the raving.  It seems that the world's embrace of the first film has hopefully given Jackson and his team the liberty and confidence to more fully realize Tolkien's vision, and I now feel more encouraged than before by the potential of the next two films (and perhaps even moreso by their own extended editions, if they are planned).  There are still some things that will never be ""fixed"" per se (Arwen being one example), but otherwise, this is a true marvel of a re-release and is more than worth the money.  The extras (and they are excellent in their own right) just make it even more of a no-brainer.  An absolutely spectacular offering.",1037145600,5,3145,5.007677543186181
1319466,4,B00003CWT6,"I've read Lord of the Rings many times.  I've been a confirmed fan since the early 1970's.  The movie thrilled me! I bought the DVD version as soon as it was released.  It was great to bring the movie home, but I was more than a bit miffed when I watched the extra features to find that they were going to release a better version later that would cover FOUR DVDs and include over 30 minutes of scenes that were not included in the theatrical version.  If I'd known that, I would have waited.
I just purchased the enhanced version anyway, and it is wonderful!  Some of the re-integrated and extended scenes (such as the gifts of Galadrial) are very important for character development and for understanding a character's motivation later, especially for Gimli and Aragorn.  There are many other features, such as an interactive map, and hours of documentaries, artwork and storyboards etc. It even includes one ticket to see ""Two Towers"" at the theater in December.
I certainly understand why they had to edit the movie for showing in theaters.  It was nearly three hours long as it was, just about the outside limit for theaters.  But to rush the edited version out on DVD and THEN release it in the deluxe DVD form seemed a bit underhanded.
I gave my DVD of the theatrical version away.  I won't rush out and make this mistake for ""The Two Towers"".  I'll wait until they do it right, as they finally did for ""Fellowship of the Ring""",1037145600,,1434,4.544747081712062

Most of them merely add a few minutes of scenes that should have stayed on the cutting room floor and seem like they were added just to put a few more minutes onto the running time, but this is one director's cut that I would love to see in the theatre. The added scenes fill out the story line, add dimension to the characters and are beautifully produced just for the DVD. They blend in seamlessly to the original cut and are full of gems such as the opening scene where Bilbo gives the audience a short primer on Hobbits showing wonderful shots of Hobbiton not seen in the theatrical release. It also has many scenes of song and poems that are reminiscent of the books and add flavor to the film.

Just_Sarah's star review out of 5 (5 highest)
Plot: 4
The fellowship is formed and must get destroy the ring. There was a common goal but the way it was presented bored me. I am one who needs to be entertained.
Acting: 5
I'll admit all the actors were very good. Though the calming sence of the movie was not for me.
Quotable/Memorable: 3
There were a few freaky parts i.e. the white lady (sorry I don't remember her name) goes blue and her eyes well I cant describe it. But I wouldn't watch it over and over.
Action: 2
The movie is too slow. It drags on. What really is a couple hours seems like 5 hours. There are good stunts however preformed and some good fight scenes.
Romance: 0
This is not a romantic movie.
Funny Parts: 0
There were parts when people would laugh but I found nothing funny. Maybe because they read the books and understood what was happening?
Overall(not average): 3
I found that the movie moved too slowly and I didn't always understand who characters were and what they were doing. I think that if you have read the book you would love this movie. If you like sci fi movies you will most likely enjoy this movie also. However if you are like me you will not. If you enjoy romantic, explosion, horror or funny movie this one is definately not for you
DVD Features: ?
There is a whole bunch but since I didn't enjoy the movie I didn't waste my time watching them.",1037145600,,1619,4.159235668789809
1319470,5,B00003CWT6,"People have already said what needs to be said about the ""basic"" movie -- it is fantastic.  While there are some regretful deviations from the book, they are far outweighed by the details that are left in and gorgeously realized.  The extended edition, however, is in a completely different league.  My husband and I, both ardent fans of the books, watched the DVD as soon as it came, and we were not disappointed.  The added scenes were... incredible.  I was so thrilled to see my favorite moments from the book back in the film -- they are listed elsewhere so I won't go into great detail.  But the most amazing thing was how much of the book got put back in with the extended scenes, and what a huge difference that makes to the film as a whole!  I was simply beside myself with glee watching some of these scenes; there were parts of the original cut that had me asking, ""what about x?"" and there, in the extention, was x!  There are snippets from the Silmarillion, mentions of Valinor and such, that literally made me clap.  And because of a completely recut opening, it feels like an entirely new film for the first half an hour or so -- it's like watching the movie for the first time, all over again.  Even if you already have the original cut DVD, I can't recommend this version enough.  For the ""true"" fans of either the movie or the book, this is really a must-have.
The other features of the gift set are fun -- the National Geographic special gives some background on Tolkien's life, with some great footage of the places he lived in, and interviews with Tolkien scholars.  The Argonath bookends are very well-made, nice and heavy, and the box, while useless in and of itself, is quite pretty.  Is it worth an extra $35?  You'll have to judge that yourself.  We got ours with a gift certificate, so it was ""free,"" but if you like the WETA design of the Argonath or the Natl. Geographic special, I'd go for this set.",1037145600,,1928,4.4375
1319510,5,B00003CWT6,"--the movie is the draw of this DVD set.  This is the version of the film that so many of us wanted to see the first time around.  The film that was released was stellar, but this version is brilliant.
In the extended DVD, the space and quiet of the books is returned to the sometimes almost-frantic pace of the originally released movie.  Ian Holm's performance as Bilbo, as well as Kate Blanchet's Galadriel, are given their due at long last with extended scenes bringing the richness and complexity of their characters into full light.  Aragorn's arc is finally fleshed out, with the weight of Arwen's decision resting on him as well as the gradual acceptance that he is not Isildur, but his heir.
For fans of Sean Bean, John Rhys-Davies and Sean Astin, this version of the film will delight as all are allowed to explore the spectrum of their characters further than the original release's time constraints allowed.  The whole release is top rich new viewing experience that will ring true to lovers of the trilogy everywhere.
I'm looking forward to seeing the special features, but once again, the movie is worth the price of the DVD set alone.  The bookends, the tickets, the trading cards, the magazine and the National Geographic DVD are all very well packaged and nice quality.  Overall, all the special features and perks from buying the collectors set serve as lovely icing for its centerpiece:  the first two DVDS that contain the wonderful new version of cinematic treat Peter Jackson has given Tolkien fans everywhere.

Holy cow!  Too often the addition of deleted scenes does little to improve a DVD.  But it's quite incredible the difference 30 minutes makes to Fellowship of the Ring.  To me, the movie feels about the right length now.  Remember, this is an epic.  While Tom Bombadil is still missing, the additions make great improvements in character; Gimli and Galadriel, Merry and Pippin, all get their characters upsized so that they're closer to the scale they were written in the book.  While you still don't feel this version of Merry and Pippin are worth fighting orcs for, there's no doubt that this movie has been enhanced by the addition of the 30 minutes.
The transfer is incredible, especially the sound.
Even without Discs 3 and 4, the extended edition of the film is worth the price.  This, to me, is the definitive version of the film.
Discs 3-4:  The extras.
Exhaustive study of converting the book into vision and vision into film.  I've only started looking at all this stuff and it's a little overwhelming.  We're not quite at ""too much of a good thing"" yet, but it's in sight.  I can't comment on this stuff too much because I've only seen about a quarter of it.  But I'm glad to have it.
Can't wait for ""The Two Towers""!",1037145600,,1256,4.528888888888889
1319513,5,B00003CWT6,"In my opinion, this extended edition of _Fellowship of the Ring_ is the one that should have been released in the theatres. From the beginning, it is just so much better than the tbeatrical release -- and with a theatrical release that was as good as this one, that's saying a lot.
As good as _Fellowship_ was, I had a number of problems with it, many of which became more heightened rather than less over time, as the sheer astonishment of seeing Tolkein's world successfully brought to life and filmed wore off a bit.  Overall, I just found the production rushed, particularly in the first half of the movie.  There was a good deal less character development than I would have liked -- which made things not as clear for people who hadn't read the books -- and a great deal more pure action than I had envisioned.  By the time the Fellowship leaves Rivendell, this evens out, but I still consider it a flaw.
HOWEVER, the special edition remedies all that.  Those extra 30-odd minutes of footage really make the story shine.  Just a few extra lines and short scenes per character turn them from gestures of a few brushstrokes to fully fleshed people.  I was especially pleased to see the attention given to Boromir (Sean Bean), which really shines a new light on his relationship to Aragorn and his eventual fall, and to Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) which transforms him from an underused and almost laughable character into a soulful poet.  Aragorn (the fabulous Viggo Mortensen) also gets some extra time, showing more strongly his fears and doubts, and making his ultimate promise to Boromir all the more powerful.
All the extended scenes have the effect of slowing the pacing, which I found all to the good.  It gives the film more of a feel of being a real journey over time as well as space, which I think the original release lacked.  And it softened some of the things that I did not appreciate so much the first time around, such as the encounter and strife between Gandalf and Saruman.  I was not as struck by Christopher Lee's performance so much in the original, but here it really stood out and was as chilling as I wanted.
Of course, you get a lot of special bells and whistles, commentaries, closer looks, and all the things a DVD has to offer, and these are fun, too.  But the extended edition of the movie alone is worth the price.  If theatres showed more of this kind of thing instead of superficial 80-minute dreck, I'd go more often.
I watched this less than 12 hours ago and I'd watch it again right now.",1037145600,,2523,4.557522123893805
1319514,5,B00003CWT6,"I must recommend this new edition.  The missing scenes fill in a lot of gaps, make the movie richer, and are inserted expertly.  If you're a Tolkien reader, you should definitely get the new edition.  Unlike other extended editions, the additional footage didn't slow down the movie.  Not a one should have been left out, if not for time constraints.
New scenes were added at the beginning of the movie, to set up the tale of the ring and the setting of the Shire, and the gifting scene in Lothlorien is returned.  There are many other new moments, many very short, but all will be appreciated.
One must wonder if the theatrical release of The Two Towers will take into consideration this new material, or will it have to rely on only the material from the theatrical release?  For example, their cloaks, broaches, and Sam's rope were all left out of the theatrical release.  Interpersonal relationships between Gimli and Legolas can be fudged, but those items couldn't be and the rope ends up being so important later on.
This boxed collection is well worth it.  It includes 2 CDs of additional material, and a National Geographic special.  The set comes with a roadmap - very necessary.  There are also 5 different commentator versions.",1037145600,,1238,4.769953051643192

The vision of Tolkien remains basically unsullied by the showmanship of hollywood. As has been mentioned a few characters are missed, Tom Bombadil especially glaring ""Ho Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!"". The beauty of some of the scenery and the Climactic battle in Moria are stunning. One thing I missed is the recital of the poem lines that are inscribed on the One Ring in Rivendell by Gandalf in the language of Mordor; ""Ash nazg durbatuluk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrukatuluk, ash durzum-ishi krimpatul"" . The biggest shock that comes in the film is the change that comes over Bilbo as he nearly snaggs back the Ring in Rivendell, the transformation of Bilbo from a mild mannered elderly Hobbit to a snarling demon is so shocking that I backed away from my screen in surprise, Bravo, Well done.

1319516,5,B00003CWT6,"This review is of ASIN: B000067DNF (THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING - EXTENDED VERSION)
LOTR: FOTR has just been released as a 4-disc, extended version -- a 3 hour film on 2 discs, plus 2 extra behind-the-scenes discs. I am happy to report that this extravanganza has been executed very well, with as much care as the theatrical film received, and it is well worth the extra money.
I've been watching the film, the bonus materials, and listening to the audio comments for over a week now! There is a lot here. The discs are so comprehensive and incredible.  My favorite behind-the-scenes documentaries are ""Scale"", which deals with the movie magic employed to make hobbits hobbit-sized.  Fascinating!  I also enjoyed the documentary on ""Digital Grading"", which is the ""photoshop"" process that the entire film went through -- it is amazing how the images can be manipulated.  ""Book to Screen"", and the Alan Lee and John Howe docuementary are just as good.
The film itself has been extended by 1/2 hour. The new footage (which is marked on the chapter menus) is seamlessly integrated. There is a completely new beginning (following the Second Age prologue)! ""Concerning Hobbits"" immediately roots the film in Tolkien's writings. There's more surprised: we get to *see* the Sacksville-Baggins!! There is a charming scene with Frodo and Sam at the beginning of their journey - they talk about never getting used to sleeping on the ground, which is quite poignant when you think of the journey ahead of them. I could go on ... the extended film is really incredible!
My favorite thing about the set is that is it handsomely produced. From the packaging to the menus, this is a first class keepsake! The menus are charming and feature a book motif - the book ""opens up"" to the chapters, which reflect Tolkien's chapter names, etc.  Very cool!
I can't tell you how remarkable this is. One wishes all films released to DVD could be this thoroughly prepared.  Peter Jackson is omnipresent on the DVD.  One can feel the overwhelming love for this project -- from the big screen to the small screen, Jackson's care is palatable.",1037145600,,2135,4.816939890710382

There is more of a completeness to the film and the added scenes just flow even better with Tolkien's vision. For example it begins with Bilbo explaining Hobbits which was a very nice touch, right away you feel more for the main characters. And Hobbits sing in this version! More is revealed in Aragorn's dilemma and anguish and so on. You really get a sense that maybe Tolkien had a hand in guiding Peter Jackson in this newly edited version. And there is a whole lot of additional material that blows away all others bonus materials.

The extended version of Fellowship of the Ring is definitely the version that should have been in the theatres...  This version gives you a much warmer Cate Blanchett, not to mention more lines for Celeborn - he doesn't look like such a [weirdo] in this version, either...
The gift-giving scene was intercut with the departure of the Fellowship from Lothlorien, which I felt gave it more poignancy.  One mistake in the gifts was that Sam didn't get the box of soil and the mallorn seed, nor did Boromir get anything, but I still think they did a great job on this.
Speaking of Boromir, his character development gets more attention in the extended version.  Since Boromir is my favourite character, the flawed hero with the best of intentions, I was glad to see more of his heroic side drawn out, in addition to more interaction with Aragorn.

The other thing I was excited to see was the Midgewater Marsh scene, and Aragorn singing the Lay of Luthien.  In Elvish.  Wow.

And the Sackville-Bagginses!  Definitely setup for the third movie, when Frodo will return home to find Lotho in his house
Hobbiton gets a lot more attention, and I think the beginning of the movie is the part that was edited most extensively.  The attention here is really very loving, narrated by Bilbo ) with an indulgent humour.

There was other humour, as well.  You see more interaction between Gimli and Legolas, and Frodo gets a cute little line as the Fellowship leaves Rivendell.  Not to mention the humour of Bilbo's reaction to the S-Bs.

All-in-all, the Extended Version is AMAZING.  I highly recommend watching it straight through, rather than looking at your menu and watching only the extended or new scenes.  This watches like a whole new movie.  Peter Jackson rearranged bits of the theatre version and interlaced them with new scenes--it's really very seamlessly done, and an exciting viewing experience.  I didn't get a chance to listen too closely to the additional score, but my first impression is not entirely favourable regarding that--but it could just be because I know the soundtrack by heart, and Howard Shore tampered with some of my favourite bits.  So I can't render an opinion yet about whether the music is good or not.  (
An unexpected plus with my ext. ver. DVD is movie cash good for one free admittance to The Two Towers, beginning on opening night!  Can't wait - at least the first of my anticipated six or eight viewings of TTT will be free!",1037145600,,2460,4.741176470588235
1319608,5,B00003CWT6,"Now THIS is what movies are supposed to be like!
Although the theatrical version was well beyond my expectations for bringing such a complex (yet simple) story to the screen, the extended version of the film far outweighs the original release. The additional scenes and dialog are not scraps from the cutting room floor, but truly add to the characters and advance the story. As excited as I was to receive the theatrical version DVD, I fear it will now gather dust on the shelves as I can't imaging watching it without the added footage. The extended version now provides the feel of time passing and improved continuity from one scene to the next. The characters are richer and you are able to connect a bit more with them than in the theatrical presentation.
One feature that is not mentioned in the product detail is that the Charter Members of the Official Fan Club are listed at the end of the movie credits. This nod to the fans takes approximately 19 minutes with legible fonts and respectful scroll speed. This is just another touch that Mr. Jackson has added that indicates that this movie (series) was not just created for the mass market, but was created by fans and for the fans of this timeless and epic novel.
The Collector's Edition is nicely done. The storage case is constructed as a book-style weathered faux leather case which looks perfect on the shelf with the Argonath book ends on each side. Concept art with the look of pencil on parchment backs each DVD as you unfold the inner case. Every attention to detail has been paid, and paid well, in the design and presentation of this package.
The 6 hours of special features are pretty meaty stuff. No promotional fluff or self-serving actor/director interviews as with other so-called ""collector's editions"", but features we're actually interested in watching.

1319609,5,B00003CWT6,"The theatrical-release version of Peter Jackson's _Fellowship of the Ring_ was one of the best films of 2001.  But Jackson really outdoes himself with this special edition, which offers complete immersion in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy universe.

This new edition offers half an hour of extra scenes, most of which flesh out relationships between the characters.  Re-edited battle scenes give hobbits a more prominent role.  On the whole, the added footage improves the flow of the film.  And the 4-DVD set offers a bewildering plethora of extras -- most of them dispensible, unless you're a real LOTR geek.

Now, the important question: Which version is better?  As an avid reader poised precariously between Tolkien geekdom and the cultural mainstream, I'd argue that this special edition is the one Ring to own.

I absolutely recommend it for the price, (Money),  and you get a free movie ticket to see the new Lord of the Rings coming out on December the 18th!",1037059200,,531,3.9626168224299065
1319614,3,B00003CWT6,"This movie's okay.  I've never understood the appeal of Tolkein.  He wrote a great story (The Hobbit) and then thought it would be better if he magnified it's length and eliminated it's humor.
I prefer the film to the book (uncommon for me) I can't believe they're going to stretch this DVD out into another release and make it even longer!  I've got a suggestion, how about cutting it down to an hour and a half for those of us who didn't like it in the first place?
Is there a Mr. Magoo version of this?  That would be even better!  But would Magoo play Frodo or Gandalf?",1037059200,,573,4.268518518518518
1319615,5,B00003CWT6,"No doubt about it, 3 hours is a long movie. What keeps you from fidgeting in those uncomfortable movie theater seats is pacing, interest level and quality. You need all 3 of these to keep audiences enthralled in a 3-hour movie. The Fellowship of the Ring excelled in each of those, so much though that not only did I not want the movie to end, but my children (ages - 5,5,7,9) wanted it to continue as well. How many movies will keep 2 boys and 2 girls - all under 10 years old glued to the screen for 3 hours - not once, not twice, but 3 times! Plus a couple more times at home! We all love this movie. This, much like some Classic Disney Movies, The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, Star Wars and other classics is timeless. You can feel it while your watching this movie. People 50 years from now will be watching it in awe just like we are.

 Now we have this new, extended edition - topping the movie out at 3 1/2 hours. Too long? Quite the contrary. The movie almost feels shorter now. These added scenes actually improve the pacing, expand on the character personalities more and fill in the backstories and subplots to a degree that further entrances you into the film - allowing the passage of real time to slip away from your consciousness. I honestly feel the director, Peter Jackson would have loved to theatrically release this version over the 3 hour version, but most have acknowledged movie goers get extremely restless after 3 hours. He's right of course, but this version is SUPERIOR to the original release.

 There's more action, more humor, more reason to care for the characters, more sense of granduer and daunting for the characters as you now get a better view of how far they had to travel and many more dangers they faced along the way. This extended version of the movie also has many things included that readers of the Tolkien book(s) will aprreciate. Lembas, Galadriel's gifts, the Marshes, a short backstory about Luthien and several others.

 Even if you have the original version on VHS or DVD, this is still worth the purchase. It is truly a new and different movie, well worth its own space on your movie rack.",1037059200,,2147,4.478260869565218
1319704,5,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy The Lord of the Rings is a masterful piece of movie entertainment. Director Peter Jackson has done an amazing job of transferring one of the most beloved pieces of 20th century literature to the silver screen. Although certain sacrifices are made in the transition, the real heart and soul of the book is evident. Utilizing the natural beauty of New Zealand and state of the art special effects, Mr. Jackson brings Middle Earth to full life. The film has tremendous visuals and the feel of a classic Hollywood epic. The cast is first rate led by Sir Ian McKellan who is magnificent as Gandalf. Elijah Wood gives his best performance to date as the central character in the film, Frodo Baggins and Viggo Mortensen is cool and steely as Strider. Sean Bean as the doomed Boromir and Orlando Bloom as the heroic elf Legolas give strong support as does Sean Astin as Frodo's sidekick Samwise Gamgee. Christopher Lee adds yet another evil part to his resume and he is perfect as the corrupt wizard Saruman. Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and Ian Holm have small but effective roles. There is the appropriate amount of suspense and tension in the film as the Fellowship struggle to destroy the ring. The only drawback to the film is that knowing it is only the first part of a trilogy, it really doesn't end. You don't have the usual resolution of the plot, but the film's excellence will leave you heavily anticipating part two.  This version is Mr. Jackson's director's cut and it is a marvelous extension of the film.  The extended version helps flesh out the characters and gives more details on the lives of the hobbits, Strider and the forming of the Fellowship of the Ring.  The new version is extremely long, so it is obvious why it was trimmed down for its theatrical release, but if you already own that version of the DVD, this version is worth the money.  It is superior to the original and that's saying quite a bit as the original is tremendous.",1037059200,,2020,4.634078212290503

1319706,5,B00003CWT6,"J.R.R. Tolkien thought up of worlds, of languages, of everything. Peter Jackson had the job of following the legacy to make the movie the best ever, to follow the novel.
My only complaint is that they seemed to have Gandalf the Gray (Ian McKellen) alert Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) immediately, causing Frodo to take off immediately, without that seventeen-year gap which is supposed to signify the ring's power.
-Changes from the Novel
Boromir's (Sean Bean)death, occururs at the end of the first movie, not the beginning of the second.
Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) do not sing for Boromir at his death.
The scenes in Moria were made to have more battles,
In the woods, there isn't the scene where the elves blindfold Gimli and the argument between Legolas and Gimli
Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir did not volunteer to assist Frodo, they were chosen by Elrond.
Glorfindel was supposed to find Frodo, Arwen (Liv Tyler) did in the movie
Probably more...
The costumes were excellent
The Elvish was really cool
The fighting was well done

1319707,5,B00003CWT6,"As a long-time LotR fan, I waited for the theater release last Christmas, the DVD release in August and the extended edition release as well.  I love the extended edition, but there may be quite a few people who would prefer the original theater version.  Here are the most significant additions to the extended release: A lenghty sequence near the beginning showing the Shire and more about the Hobbits' lives.  Bilbo is shown beginning his book about his adventures.  Later at the Birthday party he and Frodo have a quiet moment to talk about their relationship.  Jumping ahead to the Moria sequence, there is a lot more footage of the company's journey through the mines.  Finally, the sequence most fans are looking forward to: Galadriel's gifts to the fellowship.  Significantly extended and highlighting the dwarf Gimli's admiration of the Elf Queen.
Having said all that, which one is right for you?  Fans seem to come in two catagories.  Those who like the movie very much will want to get the theatrical edition.  It moves along more and fans of this sort will not miss a line or two from the book. The obsessed, like me, treasure every moment of the experience.  Each line is treasured and having them returned to the story enriches it all the more.
The added material slows down the pace of the story.  For some this will seem tiresome - you need to get the original DVD.  Don't get the extended version just because it's longer.  For others, this will be like getting thirty more minutes in paradise.  You know what version you need.
Hope this is useful.  See you in line for The Two Towers!",1036972800,,1603,4.671428571428572
1319708,5,B00003CWT6,"There are DVDs. There are special edition DVDs. There are special edition DVDs loaded with extras. Now, there is THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING SPECIAL EXTENDED DVD EDITION.  I don't think there has been anything like this in home viewing ever. It has been suggested that this Special Edition set is the closest thing one can actually get to having been a part of the movie and I would have to agree.
It will take a person about two weeks of 4 hours of viewing each day to get through all the features in this set.
First of all is the film. The movie has been extended by over 30 minutes of extra footage not seen in the theatrical release. Though some of the scenes would have perhaps dragged the film down some in the theatres, they are a great addition here, tying up a few loose ends and making the novel come to life even more.
The movie itself takes up 2 discs. There are four different commentaries to go along with the film. I found the one with Peter Jackson to be my favorite.
The third disc is called ""From Book to Vision"". It includes six different documentaries ranging from one on Tolkien to one on Weta Workshop. There are also maps, galleries, and slides consisting of over 2,000 images. Besides that there are also a bunch of storyboards which give even greater insight into the development of the film.
The fourth disc has several more documentaries (around seven, if I'm not mistaken), several galleries, and behind-the-scenes photographs.
This special edition DVD set also includes a free ticket for THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS that is accepted at just about any chain movie theatre.
There is so much in this set, that I can't discuss it all. I mean, it took me two weeks to just view most of it. Wow. If you are a LORD OF THE RINGS fan, this is a must have, far better than the original DVD release and something to hold onto for life.",1036886400,67,1885,4.401146131805158
1319709,4,B00003CWT6,"I will probably get stoned for not finding this classic movie as great as everyone else in the world seems to.  Granted, Peter Jackson's vision and treatment of the film are exquisite.  Some of the visual effects, the scenery, art direction, costuming, makeup are mind-boggling and surreal as all get out.  The acting is impeccable...Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Ian Holm, Sean Bean, and Christopher Lee especially.  Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are merely decorative in given such small and not fully developed characters.  I also had some difficulty with some of the heavy British accents, and the film felt a little too long, and repetitive.  There are some brilliant moments though...Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen's final scene together is truly moving and heartfelt; Sean Astin and Elijah Wood's touching scene in the boat is also very moving and evocative.  It is a beautifully done movie.  However, since I am not a follower of Tolkien's and view the movie on its own merits, I didn't quite feel the same awe and wonder with some of its contrived mechanisms.  But, one can't deny its brilliance in film=making.

And of course, totally new scenes are their as well, mainly the new intro, more of the Council of Elrond, and the Gift-Giving in Lothlorien.

1319771,5,B00003CWT6,"That's a pretty outrageous statement to make, but that's how I felt after first watching Lord of the Rings on film. When I walked into the theatre all I expected was another long, boring ""by-the-numbers"" blockbuster film with tons of special effects and no emphasis on a strong plot or characters.
Oh boy, was I wrong.
What I got instead was the single most deeply-emotional joyful film experience that I have ever had in my entire life. In fact, I would go further than most critics and say that Peter Jackson's film is better than Tolkien's novel. For instance, in the novel it seemed like an eternity before Frodo and Sam finally left the Shire - in fact it's only 79 pages. In Peter Jackson's film, it seems to take much less time. I actually enjoyed seeing the Shire and its eccentric inhabitants, whereas in the novel I found them very much an annoyance.
Another aspect that Peter Jackson brings to life with incredible visceral impact are the fight scenes in this film, which are absolutely fantastic and hands down beat the action scenes in the current Star Wars films by a country mile. My favourite battle scenes are the battle with Sauron, Gandalf's battle with the Balrog, and the battle at Amon Hen.
The battle with Sauron, which we see at the beginning of the film, is actually based on The Silmarillion, not the original novels. For sheer size and scale, I love this scene a trillion times more than the Stadium fight in Attack of the Clones. You get a real sense of size and scale, not to mention the sense that the very existence of the entire world may be at stake.
And as for Sauron? Hands down, Sauron is now officially the most scary onscreen villain I have ever seen. When I saw Darth Vader in Star Wars, I thought he was a joke. Not so with Sauron - he is genuinely frightening. When we see him kill dozens of soldiers in one blow, we get a real sense of how truly terrifying Sauron is.
I remember reading about the Mines of Moria in the novel, and I was actually rather underwhelmed. Perhaps this is the reason why watching the same sequence on film was so incredibly exciting. Seeing the Balrog for the first time on film, I fully understood why Gandalf the Grey feared this demon so much. The team at WETA have done an excellent job at bringing Tolkien's creation to life...so much so, I totally forgot that it was a special effect and spent much of the time gripping my armrests in fear and anticipation.
During the battle at Amon Hen, I finally began to appreciate just how dangerous the members of the Fellowship really could be when they are backed into a corner. There are so many vivid images from Amon Hen that I will never forget...Aragorn saluting the orcs with his sword before he proceeds to slice and dice them, Legolas skill with the bow and dagger (how can any normal being shoot arrows that fast!?!!), and I will NEVER underestimate the fighting skill of a Dwarf ever again!
Amon Hen also has the biggest payoff - Boromir's death scene. I remember reading the same scene in the novel and thinking ""Well...Boromir's dead. Can we move on, now?"". But in the skillful hands of Peter Jackson, this scene was so emotionally devastating it was actually BETTER than the one in the books. It actually brought tears to my eyes, and that hasn't happened since I watched ET twenty years ago.
And what makes these (and other scenes in the film) so deeply affecting? The actors! Thank goodness, we finally have a director and a crew who understand that the best special effect in any film are the actors! The scenes with the Balrog or at Amon Hen would never have been even a tenth as good as they were, unless the actors were allowed to breathe and bring their characters to life.
Everyone points to Ian McKellen as Gandalf as being the star of this movie. I would 100% agree with this sentiment, but my favourite actor/character in this film always will be Aragorn. In the novels he was my favourite character, and this remains so in the film as well.
I suspect that the reason why Viggo Mortensen gets such short shrift from critics, is because his character is so quiet and subdued for this first instalment. For the first film, there's really very little chance there for Viggo Mortensen to chew the scenery, because that's not what the character of Aragorn does. It's a quiet, subtle and heroic performance that I really enjoyed watching. But boy oh boy, when they get to Return of the King...
I was surprised, angry and shocked that Fellowship of the Ring didn't win a Best Picture Oscar in 2001. I have watched a Beautiful Mind on DVD, and I cannot understand why anyone would want to ignore Fellowship, as it has a visceral emotional impact a thousand times more effective than A Beautiful Mind could ever have. I'm glad to see that Howard Shore won a richly deserved Academy Award for Best original Music for his brilliant filmscore, but I cannot understand why Ian McKellen didn't win Best Supporting Actor for his role in this film. Will wonders never cease.
In the end, Fellowship of the Rings isn't just the Best Film of 2001. I believe that it is the best film I have ever watched, and I am confident that time will prove me right. Ten years from now, I will still be able to watch this film and be deeply moved by it. This is a classic film, made in an age when classic filmmaking is all but over. Well done Peter Jackson, very well done indeed.",1036713600,,5388,4.521516393442623
1319772,5,B00003CWT6,"I was reluctant to see this film only because I couldn't get into the books. But at the urging of a number of people whose judgment I trust, I finally saw it. And what an extraordinary accomplishment this is! That it didn't win an Academy Award for Best Picture is beyond shocking--losing as it did to the very flawed A Beautiful Mind.
Here is a film that is rich in every aspect, from the superb casting and lovely performances, to fearsomely exhilarating special effects, to a narrative that is made entirely believable by fine directing, fine editing, beautiful costuming and exceptional cinematography. It's a rivetting movie that succeeds in every way and one needn't be a fan of fantasy to enjoy it--this is one of the rare efforts that transcends its genre and is, simply, a great movie.

Every character is potrayed brilliantly by an amazing group of actors. The potrayals of  Gandalf and Samwise were particularly amazing. The thing that amazed me most about this film, is how real it looks. The CGI is amazing and seamless, the props and costumes look as though they were pulled straight from medievel times, and the landscape made it truely seem like a time lost to history. Like other reviewers have said, the special effects are only used to enhance the film and nver to dominate it (unlike the Star Wars Prequels) they're never over used. Peter jackson relied more on the actors abilities and the stting to drive the film. I applaud him for thatAnother high point is the score. So often in films such as this, the score is loud and thuderous and drowns out and dominates actionsene, but the score for LOTR:FOTR is subtle and beautiful. It enhances and and movies the movie along fluidly without ever being the main focal point. If you haven't seen this film yet, please do. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed with it.

The added scenes really help flesh out the story. By and large, there are few really extended scenes, more like seconds or tops minutes are added to scenes already in the film. Granted there are enough of these to tally up to an extra half hour.
Things that helped flesh out the story are a better background on Hobbits, more depth for Borimir, and a better understanding of Aragorn and his relationships.
The only downside of seeing this on the big screen is that my wife and I noticed some of the ""new"" special effects stuck out pretty bad. Granted we saw it on a 54 foot tall by 96 food wide screen, which is a tad bigger than even the biggest home theater display. (If you have larger, drop me a line, because we're coming over to watch movies at your place.)

1319779,5,B00003CWT6,"Wow. On November 5, 2002 I went to an advance theatrical screening of the extended edition of Fellowship of the Rings. This was the same edition that appears on this DVD, with the extra 30 minutes of footage.

Wow.

It was AWESOME. I was amazed at how the extra footage improved on perfection. The extra 30 minutes footage was divided into a minute here, thirty seconds there, to a significant extension of the Shire and Lothlorien. For vaguge details, see below:

[VAGUE SPOILER WARNING]

The extra footage developed the relationships between Gimli & Legolas, Aragorn & Boromir, Frodo & Sam, and Arwen & Aragorn. That last bit really changed the way I felt about Arwen/Liv Tyler. She rocks. The character is so much better now, and I'm glad Jackson chose her instead of Glorfindel as the bearer of the wounded Frodo.

Also, significantly, the additional footage showed some signifant plot points that were just plain missing from the first cut (I won't go into details, but if you read the book and remember Lothlorien you'll know what I mean).

But best of all was the extra characterization; the characters of the Fellowship were developed and they became people; Legolas and Gimli instead of just Iconic Blustery Dwarf and Iconic Graceful Elf, Haldir instead of Suspicious Lothlorien Guard, Boromir instead of Doomed Patriotic Man, Aragorn instead of Gloomy Ranger. The 30 minutes developed not only characters, but also places and history: Lothlorien and Gondor are much more developed.

The special edition is SO MUCH BETTER. But, remarkably, the special edition also showed just how good the first cut is. Meaning, even without the 30 minutes, the first cut ably conveyed the majesty and vital plot points of Tolkien's book, and even included a LOT of character development for Gandalf, Frodo, and Sam and background info on the Shire, Imladris, Isengard, Mordor, Moria and Middle Earth.

Wow. I still get chills, just thinking about the movie.

1319811,4,B00003CWT6,"A fine film by any measure, though we really have to wait for the sequels for the interesting scenes. I saw this flick twice in the cinema and twice more on video (I own a copy). But I'd have to be honest: not much goes on in the first part of the Tolkien trilogy, and neither Jackson nor anybody else could have done anything about it.
The computer graphics are a little crude by American standards, but what more can I expect from New Zealand?  If Jackson had got them from Industrial Light & Magic, he would have gone way over the $270 million budget.
Anyway, they are not too bad, as they are.  I applaud Jackson for his efforts, and I look forward very much to his sequels. Having seen a long clip of The Two Towers in the Official LoTR Exhibition in Toronto - the only one in the whole world - I can tell you that this one looks pretty good - it really is better than the first installment.  People who have seen this clip are not likely to be over-impressed by The Fellowship of the Ring.

And with the help of eight other companions (including Gandalf the wizard, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, two Men called Boromir and Strider, and three of Frodo's Hobbit friends), Frodo begins the quest of a lifetime to reach Mount Doom before it is too late.
After finally just finishing ""The Fellowship"" book, I've realized that they left out a lot of it in the film. But that doesn't really hurt the film, because at least when people see the film who have already read the book, it will be more surprising to them. Peter Jackson did an incredible directing job...I don't think any other director could have pulled this off so well. The acting by the entire cast is truly outstanding, especially by the lead. Elijah Wood is finally getting the credit and recognization he deserves! The special effects just simply leave you in total awe...there's no other word to describe them.
Now onto the DVD. I must say that this first edition DVD is lacking somewhat, so I'm very glad New Line Cinemas is already planning the release of a Platinum Series edition, which will surely be much better than this. This DVD includes an exclusive preview and behind-the-scenes look at ""The Two Towers"", featurettes, revealing of secrets behind the film, theatrical trailers, Enya's ""May It Be"" music video, and more. This DVD is available in both wide screen formats and full frame formats.
I highly recommend ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" DVD.

1319816,5,B00003CWT6,"Nearly everyone I knew new that this movie was going to be terrific. One of the great things about the movie is that it can be followed even if you haven't read the books. Everything is made clear and the incidents rarely stray from what happened in the book. My mother thinks that there's too much action and that it's rather corny because things keep happening. The reasoning behind this though is quite clear. It took Tolkien 14 years to write the novel, not novels. The entire tale of the Lord of the Rings was actually covered in one massive book. The publishers decided that it would appeal more to readers if the book was split into threee parts, hence the birth of the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers, and the Return of the King. It's ironic that Peter Jackson, director of the movies, decided to shoot the entire tale, 1st,2nd, and 3rd book, nonstop  over the course of 2 years. The reason that the movies are are coming out every December is because all the  special effects are still being put into the films. The point is that there is a lot of nonstop action in the Fellowship of the Ring, but do keep in mind that there are still 2 films to come and that the Fellowship of the Ring is not at all a solitary movie. In fact the movie ends where things are just picking up again.
The movie centers around Frodo Baggins, nephew of Bilbo Baggins who returned from a long adventure bearing many riches including a curious ring. Bilbo's adventure is actually covered in the book The Hobbit which preceded the trilogy. Bilbo has left his home in The Shire to seek a calmer life in Rivendell with the Elves. He leaves his home to Frodo who also inherits the  ring. Gandalf the wizard a long time friend of the 2 Bagginses and most hobbits, explains to Frodo the horrible truth about the ring. This one ring is actually holding the spirit of Sauron the Dark Lord. Thought to be dead for ages, Sauron still clings to life and he is searcing fro the ring, which wil restore him to full strength. He has employed many beasts to help him accomplish this task. Frodo soon learns that he has destroy the ring. The only way to do this is to toss it back into the chasm of Mount Doom, where it was made. Mount Doom, however, sits in the land of Mordor, which is Sauron's territory. Frodo sets out on his epic quest with the ring. At Rivendell, a Fellowship including Gandalf is formed to assist Frodo is reaching Mordor to destroy the ring. And so the adventure begins...
The second disc is packed with special features including a behind the scenes look at the Two Towers. There are featurettes, televison programs related to the movie, and a lot of information about creating the sets and costumes for the Lord of the Rings. I highly recommend adding this DVD to your collection.",1036022400,,2784,4.454901960784314
1319817,5,B00003CWT6,"I remember hearing about the Lord of the Rings trilogy coming to the silver screen and shaking my head at the thought of another futile attempt at transferring a great piece of literature to a movie.  Well this takes the cake in coming close to what could be deemed a successful attempt.
Who the heck is Peter Jackson? I asked when I first heard about the movie(s) project.  Do me a favor and rent Dead Alive, a raunchy, campy, neo-horror flick that will induce you to stroke level in realizing the same man directs the LOTR trilogy.  He has come a long way since Dead Alive and strikes me as a true visionary in the league of Lucas and Spielberg.
My review would only echo the previous reviews.  I will say that Viggo Mortensen nails the part as Stryder/Aragorn.  He has the aura and intensity that I invisioned in the books.  And it just doesn't get any better than Christopher Lee and Ian McKellan as Sauruman and Gandalf.
This is a must-have DVD, but I would recommend waiting for the Special Edition with the deleted scenes and other extras.",1036022400,,1046,4.507936507936508
1319887,4,B00003CWT6,"I really did enjoy this film, but, like other reviewers before me, there were some aspects that didn't work for me. My overall assessment is that it is an excellent film. I thought I would point out what I liked the most and the least in this adaptation.
I particularly liked:
1)  Most of the cast performed excellently, and those who played Gandalf, Frodo, Bilbo, and Strider, deserve particular mention and praise. They accurately captured the characters from the novels and were charasmatic presences on the screen.
2)  The scenic cinematography was just gorgeous and wonderfully diverse, capturing a variety of climates and moods. The Shire was appropriately picturesque, while Moria was amazingly large and daunting.
3)  Unlike some previous reviewers I beleieve that Jackson did need to edit incidents, and although all the scenes that were cut would certainly have added to the story (Tom Bombadil, the Barrow Downs etc.) it would have been impossible to include them all. Many of the excisions were well chosen, although missed.
4) A think a fine balance was struck between the great and mighty and the personal. By this I mean both great battles, mighty duels, and the awesome landscape were effectively counterbalanced by Frodo's incredibly expressive face, Gandalf's obvious concern for the hobbits, and other smaller, more personal instances in the film. Gandlf's research in the Library of the White City was a lovely personal moment in the film.
I wanted to like the following but I couldn't:
1)  While most of the special effects were, well ... extremely effective, there were a few that just didn't work for me. Galadriel's ""all will love me and despair"" speech looked awful to me, with its photographic negative appearance. I wanted to hear her conflict in her voice, and see it in her bearing, not see a special effect so lacking in subtlety.
2)  While the cuts that Jackson made were fine, I didn't feel the same way about the additions. I too feel that Arwen's recue of Frodo and her sole claim to keeping the Nazgul at bay was unecessary, and gave a false idea of the relative strength of the elves and Mordor. I also found the scene where Boromir examines the sword in Strider's presence a strange addition, when the same information could be given to the audience using scenes from the book.
3)  Sam. I really wanted to like this performance but I found it so hard. Yes, he captured Sam's innocence, love of Frodo, and inferior intelligence adequetly, but there was an essential ""Samness"" missing I felt. Sam, in the novel, is headstrong, forthright, and stubborn, and endearing because of these qualities. I felt that the screen Sam was a lot weaker than Tolkein's. (I also found his accent a bit unconvicing.) Hopefully as his role develops in the next two films his character will reveal more of the textual Sam.
All things condidered, there is so much to like about this film that the flaws don't strongly effect the pleasure of watching it. It is a strong and beautifully filmed adaptation.",1035936000,,3018,4.861867704280155
1319888,3,B00003CWT6,"i am one of the few who was disapointed with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  It was not a bad movie, in fact, I almost hate to criticize; the special effects were great, the characters were well cast (I think Wood has done a great job with the character ""Frodo""), and the movie was faithful to the book. The movie however did not fullfill my expectations. Maybe it's just that my own imagination was richer, but I expected more of the movie.  It lacked the awe which I felt while reading the book.  The ""dark"" aspect of Mordor did not create fear, Gandolph's imprisonment did not evoke feelings of futility, and the elf's archery did not fill one with awe. Maybe if I hadn't read the book first, the movie might have been more impressive.  I'd rent before I'd buy, just so that I knew whether I really wanted it or not. I myself do not have the desire to see the movie again.",1035936000,,874,4.310975609756097
1319889,4,B00003CWT6,"I really enjoyed this DVD. I won't go into any details about the movie, since there appears to be at least one new review every day, and many of them have done a better job than I will.
The sound is good, the picture sharp, the documentaries are very nice, a collection of all the tv shows and web documentaries that were made.
HOWEVER - there is a commercial for the 4 Disc DVD coming out in November. This is aggravating beyond belief. ""Congratulations, you have bought this two-dvd set, now prepare to shell out big bucks for the four-disc set! Chump!!""
I don't like surprises like this. I don't like wanting to buy the same thing twice.
Oh well - the rest of the sheep and I will probably buy it anyways. Enjoy!",1035936000,,715,4.343283582089552
1319890,3,B00003CWT6,"Well, I thought this was very disappointing.
My wife and I found it so slow going that we ended up watching it in two sittings and even then she fell asleep in the second half.
Amazingly, she found she had missed nothing when she awoke 20 minutes later!
The effects and scenery were very nice, but a film needs so much more than that for me.
To sum this film up I would say it was just very very slow.",1035936000,,401,4.025
1319891,5,B00003CWT6,"The first part of LOTR is wonderfully made into a live action film!  The movie starts with a long prolouge explaining how the One Ring was made, what happened to it, and where it is now.  By strange chances, the One Ring is now owned by Bilbo Baggins of The Shire.  Bilbo leaves the ring to Frodo and off to Rivendell.  Frodo soon is off on an adventure to destroy the one ring along with a followship; Nine walkers against the Nine riders of Mordor.  The locations are amazing and truly look like they're from Middle-Earth.  My favorite line is ""Nobody tosses a Dwarf!""",1035763200,,570,4.4326923076923075
1319892,4,B00003CWT6,"I've never read the book before, but fantasy/adventures always appeal to me (unless it's, shudder, Dungeons and Dragons) so I was rather looking forward to enjoying this film. The story, as it goes, isn't too different from what we usually see in most films of the genre. You see, thousands of years ago on Middle-Earth, an evil wizard named Sauron wanted to control the land with the power of a ring forged from the fires of Mount Doom. Sauron was destroyed, but Isuldur, the king of men, was enticed by the power of ring, and rather than casting it back into the fires, he kept it for himself. The ring passes on after Isuldur's death until it ends in the hands of Bilbo Baggins. The plot gets a bit heavy from there, as there's now a quest and fellowship formed to destroy the ring before Saruman and the evil armies of Mordor can regain their full strength.
It will probably anger a lot of Tolkein fans for me to say this, but while I do think The Fellowship of the Ring is great entertainment, it's not without its flaws. As an introductory tale, set-ups can get confusing, and character development, for me at least, was a bit awkward. Sudden flashbacks don't help matters much. Take, for instance, the scene where we see Gandalf held captive by Saruman, then the next time we see him he's talking to Frodo (then they have to do a flashback to how he escaped, kind of jarring, I thought).
It wasn't until the halfway mark of this three-hour adventure the film finally hit its mark and never looked back. The first half of this movie is fairly enjoyable, though a bit slow and confusing. The second half, however, is grand adventure, delivering awesome battle scenes and even powerful drama. It's in this hour-and-a-half we see what epic filmmaking can accomplish at its pinnacle. Accompanied by Howard Shore's magnificent score, the fellowship's quest is among the most thrilling and engaging odysseys I've seen on film to date.
Perhaps the film's highlight setpiece is through The Mines of Moria, a tense sequence packed with exciting battle scenes and fast-paced chases as the foundation of the Mines begins to crumble around our heroes (is that not just a standard for all adventure films?). Admittedly, the Mines of Moria battle scene does use CGI stuntwork, which has always bugged me (Blade II, anyone?) and it's done no better here, though, thankfully, it's limited to a few very short moments.
The performances are confident and assured, with Elijah Wood doing a fine job as Frodo Baggins. Even his British accent sounds genuine. The rest of the cast is all very good, though the standout for me was Orlando Bloom as Legolas, the elf archer who really kicks a lot of Orc ass. Even making a good impression is Liv Tyler, who's usually flat and inexpressive. Okay, so she doesn't show a lot of emotion here, but she's convincing and even quite pretty to look at.
Director Peter Jackson was a good choice to helm the picture. His work here is stylish, beautiful, and even quite evocative. Anybody else find it amazing this is the same man who gave us Dead Alive, the goriest film ever made? LOTR's cliffhanger ending probably won't go well with everybody (though the thrilling battle scene before it will certainly leave viewers with an adrenaline rush before the movie's over), but it makes a nice segue for the soon to be The Two Towers, which I now have even higher expectations of. Hopefully, it won't disappoint.

1319893,5,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring was definatly the best fantasy movie ever made. Sure, there were great fantasy movies - Willow, The Neverending Story, Legend - but none compare to the Fellowship, or the rest of the LOTR trilogy for that matter.
Finally, however, we will get to see the movie how is should have been. The extended versian contains THIRTY MINUTES extra footage. All those people who were made that the movie took out scenes from the book..well..this should make them happy. Also, the 30 minutes extra footage is mostly non-action. A lot of people complained Fellowship of The Ring had too much action and not enough drama/happy scenes. Well, these 30 extra-minutes are going to fix that.
The only reason we didn't get the directors cut in theatres is cause I assume they were afraid that a 3.5 hour long movie would be too much for casual movie-goers.
LOTR fans, this is your movie - don't be fooled by the non-extended versians available. It was just a cheap ploy to make money. New Line Cinema was hoping to get people to buy the LOTR:Fellowship DVD, and then get them to buy the Extended Versian 1 year after the movie's release so they can make twice as much money - Sadly, it worked. At least the curropt movie industry didn't ruin this movie, however, as it is the greatest fantasy movie ever made.",1035590400,,1314,4.619658119658119
1319894,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay, this review is for anyone who hasn't seen LOTR yet (wow, where have you been?) or anyone who has only seen it once. Disregard any opinions about this film, even mine. Who knows if you'll love/hate it? But remember one thing: TAKE YOUR IMAGINATION WITH YOU! You have one, don't you? Treat your imagination as if it was your passport, a passport to an entirely different and magical land where dreams come true and reality is lost.
That being said, this film was an unexpected surprise for me. Sure, it ended abruptly, but you have to remember it's the same way the novels ended. How's that for faithful? You have to at least learn the names of the nine people in the Fellowship in order to understand the characters. Disregard the special effects (although they are pretty darn special!) and take in the scenery. Can you believe there are really untouched places like that? Also, don't look at the Ring as an object, look at it as the main character with a mind of it's own and a will to corrupt the unlucky souls it finds.",1035504000,,1028,4.502673796791444
1319934,5,B00003CWT6,"I wait with great anticipation for the release of ""The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, extended version"".  I am a big fan of the books, and to see the movie is like you are reading parts of the book.  Notice I said PARTS of the book.  In my opinion Peter Jackson has done a remarkable job staying true to the book, however you just can't fit a 398 page book into 3 hours.  That is why I am so excited about this version, Peter Jackson has restored into the movie about 30 more min. Such scenes as the gift giving in lothlorien, the pasion and deep respect of Gimli to Galadriel, Gollum following the fellowship down the Anduin River, and Bilbo writing in his book; chapter one ""Concerning Hobbits"".  I still admit even 3&1/2 hours will not be nearly enough to cover the first part of J.R.R. Tolkein's incredible epic novel.  But this is a must have for fans of the theatrical version and of the books.",1035504000,,916,4.3274853801169595
1319935,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson's first part of the collossal LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is nothing short of a brilliant masterpiece, with incredible SFX, great characters, and staying true to J.R.R Tolkien's story while altering some of the book's elements to make it more suitable for film.
Deeply rooted in the fantasy genre, Fellowship of the Rings sees a young Hobbit Frodo Baggins inherit a powerful mystical ring from his cousin Bilbo Baggins. The ring, worn by the Dark Lord Sauron, has been passed down through many people until it reaches Bilbo. The mighty wizard Gandalf and a troop of dwarfes, elves and hobbits set out on a journey to destroy the dangerous ring by casting it back into the lava of Mt. Doom. But of course, there are bad guys, in the form of Saruman the White, played with relish by the brilliant Christopher Lee and his army of Orcs and Ringwaiths.
Director Peter Jackson (The Frighteners) has taken Tolkein's story and molded it into the perfect fantasy adventure. Some characters that were ciphers in the novel have been elevated to main characters, and while some purists may be upset over the loss of some characters, Jackson does do service to the story's originality. And the result? In a Hollywood summer of dissapointments, Fellowship was the standout, one of those rare films that come along like The Matrix that remind us of why we like movies in the first place.
In a film as ambitious as this, all the key elements are in place, the masterful storytelling, Jackson's brilliant visionary direction, superb acting (especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo), incredible visual effects and the wealth of imagination from Tolkien's extraordinary tome. The supporting cast is great too, with John Rhys- Davies as Gimli the dwarf, Sean Bean as Boromir and Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf. The best facet about the whole thing is that it's so real that you really think that all this happened long ago. And that, more than anything else is a bonifide sign that this is not only one of the greatest cinema acheivements ever, but it's now entered into the cultural zeitgeist.
The film takes us where we've never been before, Tolkein's world of Wizards, elves, ringwaiths, orcs and all the other imaginative creatures on display are a thrill to watch. For such a huge scale, the use of CG is of course neccesary, and the visuals are incredible, utilising state-of-the-art technology to create entire landscapes, creatures and battles. The most outstanding scene, where our intrepid fellowship travels into the mines of Mordor is a fantastic tour-de-force of incredible movie magic. The seamless blend of FX and amazing cinematography is absolutly breath-taking. Howard Shore's brooding score adds another layer of excellence to the myraid of adventurous escapism. There are problems; the film may not sit well with purists and the ending feels somewhat of an anti- climax after the climactic Mordor, but we all know that the real battles are yet to come. This is a film that takes you far beyond your imagination. What lies ahead for THE TWO TOWERS will no doubt be even more amazing and draw the millions of eager fans out once again to witness the second part to one of the most amazing films ever made.
For people who managed to hold off the temptation to but the first DVD release, this platinum series ""extended"" edition is worth the wait. Discs 1 and 2 have a unique version of LOTR with over 30 minutes of cut footage incorporated into the film and new music scored by Howard Shore. Also included are four feature-length audio commentaries by director and writers, the design team, the production team, and the cast featuring more than 30 participants.
Discs 3 and 4 contain some of the most comprehensive extra material ever on DVD. Disc 3 has the doco ""From Book to Vision"": Adapting the book into a screenplay & planning the film, Designing and building Middle-earth, storyboards to pre-visualization, Weta Workshop visit including creatures and miniatures from the film, an awesome interactive map of Middle-earth tracing the journey of the Fellowship, an interactive map of New Zealand (yay!) highlighting the location scouting process, galleries of art and slideshows with commentaries by the artists, guided tour of the wardrobe department footage from early meetings, moving storyboards and pre-visualization reels.

1319938,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a fine movie. Too bad it didn't win best picture. It could have kicked off an Oscars run similar to The Godfather trilogy.
Alas...
Academy voters have always been blind. For instance:
Can somebody please tell me why Jackson was not the best director? His vision of was the one thing that rose above the bland mire that was last year's Oscar crop. The only other decent movie released during Oscar season was The Shipping News (which Oscar completely neglected).
Can someone please show me an Actor who gave more to his movie than Ian McKellan? His Gandalf is pure genius. Who else could have made such a character believable, much less likable?
Where oh where has Viggo Mortensen's supporting actor Oscar gone?
These questions left aside, there are flaws in the book's translation to the screen. I still can't see what is gained by having Liv Tyler rescue Frodo. Poor Glorfindel.
The beginning of the movie, while being a wonderful piece of cinematic exposition, horribly compresses some things. Again--poor Tom Bombadil.
Finally, I understand this is to be in the ""director's cut"" of the 4 disc DVD, but why on earth did they not put Gimli's falling in love with Galadriel in the publicly released version? --Kind of important for characterization.
However, none of these flaws should really stop someone from watching this great movie. There are too many things that are dealt with with excellence:
-The Shire. Jackson has captured the beauty and wonder of the Shire and its fascinating Hobbits.
-Weathertop. Though this too gets condensed (and we lose Aragorn's all important tale), Jackson has captured the fight on Weathertop just as I had imagined it.
-Moria and the fight on the bridge. Moria is wonderfully imagined. Gandalf's talk with Frodo is another great piece of exposition. The flight across the bridge and Gandalf's stand against the Balrog are scary as can be.
-Kate Blanchett is perfect as Galadriel.
-The two scenes at the end, between Boromir and Aragorn, and Sam and Frodo, are as moving as anything that's been on the screen in the past twenty years. They leave the viewer waiting expectantly for the next film.

The ring was a convenient plot device when it first appeared in the short but enjoyable adventure, ""The Hobbit"", a trinket that allowed its founder, a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, to become invisible while battling goblins in his quest to return Thorin Oakenshield, the Dwarf King under the mountain, to his throne.  In ""Fellowship"" we learn that the ring was crafted 25 centuries earlier as one of a group of rings - the others handed out lords of Elves, Dwarves and even men.  Those rings offered power, but turned their bearers into wraiths, lifeless slaves of their crafter - the thoroughly evil Sauron.  The ring found by Bilboa Baggins, however, was ""the One"", the ring worn by Sauron himself, the one that bound the others and held Sauron's power firmly in this world.  Narrowly defeated 2500 years earlier, the evil sorcerer only appeared vanquished, waiting for his servants to reclaim the ring for him, so he could arise and again drown the world in his shadow.  The One Ring, however, had a mind of its own, seducing those who found it and who have known better than to think they could bend it to their will.  All of this is artfully explained in a voice over in the first few minutes of ""Fellowship"" for those of us who never read most or any of Tolkien's books.  We then cut to ""The Shire"", the home of those notoriously unadventurous creatures called Hobbits, especially Bilboa Baggins (Ian Holm) who found the ring, Gandalf the Grey (Ian Mckellen, never looking quite so tall) the sage wizard and his old friend, and Frodo (Elijah Wood, who looked taller when he played younger roles years ago) who will have to carry the ring to the fires of Mount Doom in which it was forged.
If you've got little experience with Tolkien's books, you'll still enjoy this film which briskly brings the saga to life without feeling the slightest bit abridged.  Fast camerawork and a great script brings each scene to epic life, touching on major themes - the weakness of men, the nobility of the elves, the pervasive evil of the orcs and their dark lord, the love of Arwen and Aragorn (powerful enough to overcome her elvish immortality) and the collusion of the once noble Saruman with the cause of evil.  This was the epic that the newer Star Wars movies couldn't be - a monster story never losing sight that it was about people rather than great effects and battles.  Despite demons of fire and shadow, huge armies of orcs and one evil sorceror who sees all from an eye wreathed by fire, the story never lets you forget that this essentially the story of a band of heroes joined by some singularly undefined loyalty, the sort of folly that causes great evil, but here is used for good - which is why the characters seemingly walk on the edge of a blade (as Gladriel says; will Boromir succumb to the call of the ring? Will the noble Aragorn fall to the self doubt stemming from the critical weakness of his ancestors?  And how can a hobbit hope to contend in the Land Of Mordor with an evil that had once swept men aside like gnats?)  The script also excels in the way it surgically inserts the comprehensive lore of Middle Earth into its lines without slowing the pace or otherwise appearing to skimp on Tolkien's extensive continuity. At slightly over three hours, this is a flick that doesn't wear out its welcome, though just how many sweeping vistas and cool settings can you see?  Also, Elijah Wood spends much of the film looking terrified - embodying neither the Hobbit traits of indolence nor his uncommon Baggins love of adventure, while Viggo Mortensen allows Aragorn's self doubts to keep him from becoming much of a person at all.  Yet, by the end of the film, these faults are overcome.  Though one of a series, Jackson matures his characters - Frodo continues into Mordor alone (with Samwise, but without the unerring elven bow of Legolas, the relentless dwarvish axe of Gimli, the sword of Boromir or the direction of Aragorn; even Sam's companionship was unexpected).  The Fellowship is in other words destroyed, but something even stronger takes its place. I caught this flick on video, but don't intend to make the same mistake when ""Two Towers"" roles into theaters.",1035072000,,4262,4.668891855807743
1320031,5,B00003CWT6,"It was the most promising film of the year. It promises to pleasure you and it promises to impress you. Just like Gone with the wind and Ben-Hur, the movie is just as good as the book. The film couldn't have been made any better. It's for fans of all kind of interests. Even if you aren't a fantasy film fan, this movie will thrill you. It's for everyone who likes adventure, comedy, thrill, horror, love, hope, and of coarse fantasy.
  The film has used what would be the best example of cinematography I have ever seen. It couldn't have been made any better. Whoever set up the cast did a great job. And of coarse the musical score and sound effects couldn't have been any better. They were just right to put an audience at the edge of their seats. Liv Tyler did a great job as well as the rest of the cast. Also the movie is for audiences of all ages, though it may frighten youngsters. Cate Blanchett also did a great job, just like she did in Elizabeth.
  The movie is positively one that has more than one theme to its plot. An adventure like this hasn't been seen since probably Jurassic Park and Independence Day. It's also for everyone who enjoyed watching the Star Wars trilogy. It is definitely the year's most thrilling fantasy adventure. I did think Harry Potter was the film of the year but now, Lord of the rings takes the title. The movie is also for all Narnia fans. I haven't seen a film this good in months. For once a movie has been made in which every penny spent on it is worth it. This Jackson flick is one that helps to recreate one's imagination.

1320032,5,B00003CWT6,"I can add very little to the reviews already posted, except to comment that it is obvious that Director Peter Jackson comes from ""our"" generation; the generation who went through secondary school in the late sixties and early seventies, and whose cultural millieu, for all our lifestyle ""differences"", is remarkably the same. I recognized characters walking onto the screen before their first lines, and Dwarf- architecture looked, well DWARF. And Elvish sets looked ELVISH -and we forget that although Tolkien used a lot of words, there were not a lot of specific descriptions.
I would like to submit that the famed trilogy could possibly be credited for the success of the Civil Rights movement in the United States (well there is a way to go yet, but the laws are there now). Think of the Fellowship -we have representatives of multiple ehtnic/racial groups, very few of whom seem to get along with each other in Middle Earth, suddenly combining for a common task (not that they don't bristle at each other occasionally, but, hey...), and our suspension of disbelief in the mid-60's allowed us to accept the idea that those ""other"" people were still people.

So after 30+ readings I was totally prepared to dislike the movie. Imagine my surprise when I discovered the best movie I've seen in years. Granted, some changes were inevitable. For instance there are few female characters in the novel so Galadriel and Arwen in particular had to be fleshed out for the movie. No big deal, it still follows the story line remarkably well. The acting is superb, the special effects incredible and the sets and scenary simply beautiful.

If you want to see an extradinary movie, look no farther than this first installment in The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.
I saw this movie back in the theater in January by accident because the film I was there to see was sold-out.
At the time I had never turned a page of Tolkien's fantasy epic but associated it closely with The Chronicles Of Narnia,
another series I had never taken the time to read.
I didn't know what to expect just that I wasn't expecting much.
I was dead wrong! The movie unfolded on the screen like a vibrant,
colorful work of art, one that I could hardly behold in one viewing. I went back and saw it again, then again.
The movie never dimmed or faded, but my enjoyment and fascination grew with each viewing. The acting is perfect for the film.
The story is steller. In fact, I can't think of a single thing I would change with anything in this absolutely extraordinary movie!
I read a couple of reviews on Amazon before posting my own.
Somebody called it boring, or whatever. They must have seen a different film. This is a flawless work of art! Destined to be remembered along with such classics as Ben-Hur and Casablanca, or what have you. I already bought the theatrical version and am eagerly anticipating this FOUR-DISC SET. A film-lover's dream!
An extra half hour has been added into the film and there is over six hours of making-of content on two discs!
I am now in the process of reading The Two Towers to try and quell my impatience for movies two and three, ... I can't wait!

1320037,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is triumphant proof that despite frequent evidence to the contrary, it is possible to adapt excellent books into equally excellent films. Of course, at the heart of any good film is a good story, and this is provided par excellence by J. R. R. Tolkien.
In a time before recorded history, the peaceful inhabitants of Middle-earth are threatened by the reappearance of a long-lost ring, in which resides the life force of the evil Dark Lord Sauron. Seemingly by chance the ring comes to young hobbit Frodo Baggins who must destroy it by throwing it back into the fires from whence it was forged. In his quest he is joined by a wizard, two men, a dwarf, an elf and three hobbits - representatives of the free people of Middle-earth - whom together form the titular fellowship.
This film is monumental in scale, but it is director Peter Jackson's attention to detail and the all-important (and sadly oft-forgotten) humanity involved that really makes it a masterpiece. Although the black faceless ringwraiths, the orc and goblin hordes, and the claustrophobic darkness of the mines of Moria are certainly frightening, the moment when the viewer truly realises the insidious evil of the ring is when kindly bumbling Uncle Bilbo Baggins becomes (for a split second only) a raving demon in its presence.
The outstanding cast has made it easy to become involved with the characters and the computer graphics wizardry of Isengard and Rivendell, et. al., is astonishing and almost seamless. Ultimately, any film which, after almost three hours, can leave a viewer exclaiming ""No! It can't end there! I want to see what happens next!"" is well worth watching.

1320108,5,B00003CWT6,"I never read the Tolkien before seeing this movie.
There, I said it.
I have since then. And it raises the question with movies like this and Harry Potter about reliability to the text. Is it a virtue or a nusiance to try and recreate a book word for word on the big screen? I personally think it's maddening. It cannot be done properly so it's hardly even worth attempting. My advice is, do as much as you can. Start with the words, always start with the words, and let your own vision and ideas take flight. Peter Jackson (who I'd never heard of prior to this) did a superb job of taking a classic tale and giving it new life on the screen. The Frodo we see on the screen is not the Frodo we read about in the books, but he's the right Frodo for the movie. The visual style was stunning, the performances were largely Oscar calibre, I can even live with the sappy End Credits theme to say that the music was flawless.
I'm obviously not going to go into a whole in depth review, because chances are you've read too many of them already. So, let's shorthand it: In fifty years this movie will be remembered, known and studied as one of the Greatest Movies of All Time.

Peter sacrificed 16 months+ of his life to film 3 movies in a row. Now thats impressive. Think about the massive crew in filming. They also sacrificed 16 months in filming. Most of them away from their families also.
  The movie was great. It was adventurous with a hint of romance. I didn't really like the fact that Tom Bombadil was nowhere to be seen, or that famor maggot had a very brief apperance, but since they have no true reason in the novel, it would confuse the viewers. The composer was very talented. I loved the music, but when I watch it at home, I always have to have the captions on because the music is kinda loud compared to the actors. The movie is great! But be sure to read the books then watch the movie. And if your not keen to fantasy, watch the movie for the beautiful scenery.

1320111,5,B00003CWT6,"I consider myself a Tolkien fan.  According to my calculations (which aren't always correct), I've read the Trilogy at least 15 or 20 times and the Hobbit equal amounts.  I've even read the Silmarillion.  When I heard the movie was coming out last year and I saw the trailer via the Net, I was as excited as anybody.  I immediately found all the information I could and even purchased the soundtrack before I'd seen the movie (great, powerful music).  I never got around to seeing it till March, as things don't get to the theaters in Ukraine as quickly as they do elsewhere.
I was astounded, amazed, the movie completely blew me away and crushed all my doubts.  True, Tom Bombadil was erased, but his part wasn't crucial to the plot and the movie was long enough as it was.  True, Arwen replaced Glorfindel and her role was extended, but oh well, Liv Tyler did a good job acting her.  But my favorite actors were Ian McKellen doing a superb Gandalf and just as I imagined him, Ian Holm doing great as Bilbo Baggins, Elijah Wood doing an acceptable Frodo and Christopher Lee doing the best as Saruman.  His role here beats down his role as Dooku in Attack of the Clones.  Other actors include Viggo Mortensen (as a fairly good Aragorn) Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd.
The backgrounds were truly awe-inspiring and weren't all CG, like Star Wars 1 and 2, a lot of them were painting.  The sets were amazing, the best being Isengard (those canyons!), The Shire, Rivendell, and Moria.  The special effects were the best and weren't overly used at all.  It was Computer-generated images at their very best:  the frightening cave troll, the hordes of shrieking goblins, the terrifying Black Riders, the octopus-like Watcher, and last but not least, the nightmarish fiery Balrog, his fight with Gandalf being my favorite scene.  They did a perfect job of mixing ""shadow and flame"" to create a literally living ember.
Three minor complaints:
1.  The whole scene in Lothlorien I did not like.  It was much too dark and creepy, the book describes is as a place full of light, a forest made mostly of aspens, and yet with a sad sort of feeling to it.  Jackson made it almost like Mirkwood.  Also, they turned Galadriel into some sort of sorceress, which she wasn't.
2.  The fight with the cave troll, which wasn't there at all in the books.  Though the battle was well done and action-packed, it was almost too much extended.  I felt like shouting aloud in the theater, ""Just die, you stupid troll!""
3.  The transformation of Gimli into a stuttering dolt.  I look forward to seeing the Extended Edition, which should enhance his character.  Galadriel's gift-giving scene should help a lot.
Other than those, I have no other complaint to make.  I've already pre-ordered the Special Extended Edition and have seen the trailer for the Two Towers, which I very much look forward to seeing.  A must-see for all fantasy and Tolkien lovers!",1034640000,3,3009,4.72552783109405

Anyone who reads the book also appreciates the importance of maintaining dialogue from the books.  Jackson's attention to detail and ability to capture the appropriate mood of each scene cannot be understated.

Gandalf is just the way I pictured him, sometimes jovial and friendly, sometimes severe and stern.  Suroman is as devious as expected and his slick and oily tongue fit the character perfectly.

1320115,5,B00003CWT6,"First off I'd like to put down reviewers who dismiss this movie. And if you are not the patient viewer you tend to write off this movie as too lengthy, to draggy and the characters seemingly carry on and on about something and nothing.
Although some would commonly agree that the romance between Aragorn and Arwen the Elf Princess was magnified to support the movie somewhat, I say this this is the most affectionate adaptation of the classic trilogy novel. If you are into those Harrison Ford type thriller-adventures or those Blow-em-up action type movies, then this movie or movies of this genre is not for you. So I say it's not fair comment to pan it.
Although I saw more acting from Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean. I say that overall it is the ensemble of characters that shares equal screen presence that is nicely executed in this movie that impressed me. Although some important chapters was omitted or 'fused' into one scene. I say it is still one of the more faithful adaptations that does not stray from the overall feel and plot of the book. But for those who have never read the book, I find the narrative part of the book not too hard to absorb.

Tolkien, who was a professor of Literature at Oxford University, incorporated features from such epic poems as Beowulf into The Hobbit and his Ring Trilogy, creating a link to other literary works which has always fascinated me and led me to explore other literature.
 I must admit that when I first heard that Peter Jackson would be bringing the Ring to the big screen I immediately felt indignant, almost angry that someone would tamper with Tolkien's Masterpiece. After all, how often has the film industry completely rewritten pieces of literature or altered history to make a movie more palatable?
 I am pleased to say that my misgivings were completely inaccurate. Mr. Jackson gave himself to reproducing Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth with an awesome exactness. The locales are fantastic, cinematography stunning, and casting wonderful, not to mention a delightful musical score. Tolkien's classic good versus evil storyline was adhered to almost to the letter.

I read de book long before knowing there was going to be a movie and I gotta say I love this film. I know that when a book has to be put as a movie, you can't expect to see everything just the same as in the manuscrit because a film's gotta have visual impact.
Its an insult to Tolkien to say the book is better than the movie or otherwise because you cna't compare them. Some people complain about the movie being too different from the book. Well, it would be kind of boring if it was, don't you think? And lets not say it would be like five hours long or so.

As for the changes...well, my favorite scenes from the movie are the fight between Gandalf and Saruman inside Orthanc. That scene is practicaly original and was not in the book. I love the shots of Barad-dr, which were not even suggested in the entire Lord of The Rings Trilogy. As I read the book, I didn't really liked Tom Bombadil, so I didn't mind they did not include him in the film.
Ah, THAT scene, the one everbody talks about. I like strong women who are still beautiful and feminine. Yes, I like that Arwen saved Frodo herself, rather than Glorfindel giving him that horse. What was his name? It's more exiting, it'll sure be great for people who haven't read de book and puts at least two women taling in the entire film.
The Lord of the Rings is a great adaptation. As a novel, is terrific, as a movie, just the same.

Tight story, excellent special effects, and great casting make this film one of the best films ever made.
One thing should be mentioned to all would-be buyers: Since this is part of a trilogy of films that were shot back to back this film sort of just ""ends"". Being part of a trilogy, there is no major resolution at the end...it leaves off at a certain part of the adventure.

They were able to bring parts of the book to life (i.e. the balrog) that they could not have done 10 years ago, in a satisfying fashion.  The special effects get an A+.  However, as a devoted Lord of the Ring/Tolkien fan I must admit that I was disappointed when something was left out, changed (i.e. Arwen being the horse rider), or made ""darker"" than it was intended.  I especially was disappointed at not seeing the tender get together when they surprised Frodo with their intention to join him no matter what!  I thought this was a critical part, as it expressed the deep friendship they had.  Then, I missed not seeing the wonderful characters of Tom Bombadil and Goldberry with their adventure through the old forest.  I thought they made Elrond's character a bit rough and stern.  My harshest criticism would be how they portrayed Galadriel and Lothlorien.  It was all so ""dark"".  Noone contradicted Gimli when he said Galadriel was a witch.  They made Galdriel out to be almost demonic.  I was very uncomfortable with the scene when she had the ring. Also, my husband who has not read the book could not tell that the elves were singing a lament. He thought it was just part of the soundtrack.  I sorely missed the emphasis on music, poetry, and singing that is such a crucial part of the book.  Other than these two actors I thought everyone else was a great portrayal and looked like I thought they would.  I understand that they can't put everything in, BUT they did spend precious movie minutes on stuff that wasn't even in the book, such as the fight between the two wizards.  There was one scene, however that was a great addition: the scene of Aragorn and Arwen when they were pledging there love for each other.  That was pure magic!  Overall, despite the latter comments, I would recommend this movie even to Tolkien fans.  I know I enjoyed seeing much of the book come to life.

Now comes a bold new attempt to bring Tolkien's legacy to the big screen.  This time, thanks to technology and a director who wanted to be as true to novel as possible.  The Fellowship of the Ring is a long but lush and vivid trip into Middle Earth.  Peter Jackson succeeded where the others have miserably failed.  This movie actually makes you believe that Middle Earth is a REAL place, filled with real hobbits, elves, and men.
To be sure, the Fellowship of the Ring doesn't cover every aspect of the novel, but the changes are hard to spot, except by the most die-hard Tolkien fan.  You can see that New Line Cinema didn't ""ride"" Peter and force him to dumb down the movie so that people with an 8th Grade reading level could grasp it.  Things happen in this movie that aren't always ""explained"" by some character or narrator, which is truly refreshing.  I look forward to this trend continuing through the rest of the trilogy.
The Fellowship of the Ring is a movie much like Lawrence of Arabia, Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone, Frank Herbert's Dune, and Titanic in that it is a long but ultimately very satisfying film.  A masterwork that is already on its way to becoming classic in the truest sense of the word.",1034294400,,1499,4.5559701492537314
1320144,5,B00003CWT6,"What can I say? The hype was out last December that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is being released. The first part this month. I saw it get fairly good reviews from the critics, and being a massive fan of the books I hesistantly went to the theatre, not wanting to destroy my image of the book. Boy was I glad I went!
The movie starts off quite quick, giving you a solid history base and a fairly onimous warning about what will happen next, as well as some geography. Then, it REALLY slows down introducing Bilbo, Gandalf, and Frodo, as well as brief appearances from Sam, Pippin, and Merry. The home of the hobbits (all the characters mentioned with the exception of Gandalf)is in a free land called The Shire, reminiscent of England. The party at Bilbo's place is where it started to speed up. Bilbo (at his 111st birthday) uses the 'Ring', an ancient power devised by the evil Sauron (kin of Gandalf; a quick fact for those who have watched it)-and had found it on his travels- and became invisible and sneaked off to his house. Bilbo met Gandalf, the wizard and agreed to head off to the elf settlement of Rivendell near the mountains. Frodo, Bilbo's cousin, is entrusted the Ring and vows to keep it a secret until Gandalf comes back, for he does not know it is This Ring, the most powerful of them all, made by Sauron. He searches through ancient documents and discovers that his suspicions were true, and bustles Frodo and Sam, his friend who was snooping, off to Rivendell. Gandalf goes to his ally, the wizard Saruman, for aid.
On their way to Rivendell, they meet the two troublesome hobbits Pippin and Merry. They help them on their quest. They reached a town called Bree, without some danger because of the servants of Sauron -the Ringwraiths or Nazgul-, but they get there and meet Strider, a Dunedain, (the remnants of the ancient men who settled in the Shire formerly)and he befriended them and helped them on their way to Rivendell. After Frodo was posioned from one of the Ringwraith's blades, they finally take care of the Nazgul (for now, they are immortal) courtesy of the magic of the elves and the Master of Rivendell, Elrond, heals Frodo of his ailment. There is a council, with Gandalf there and tells of the treachery of Saruman, who has turned evil. Gandalf just barely escapes. They all decide to take the Ring to Mordor, the stronghold of Sauron, for only there can it be unmade. The four hobbits are accompanied by Gandalf the wizard; Gimli the dwarf; Legolas the elf; Boromir the human from Gondor, the country of men in the South; and Aragorn a.k.a. Strider, a man that has lived in the wild all his life and is seemingly more than a woodsman. This is only half of the movie, the rest you have to see for yourself.
The Fellowship of the Ring, as the movie is called, is a masterpiece in its characters, its unique storyline, its well developed geography, and its through special effects, amazing cinematography, make-up, and excellent battle scenes. The pace starts at mundane then picks up to a convincing climax, but remember, there is still two books to go! This is a must see and I highly recommend you get the movie!",1034208000,,3154,4.574204946996466

1320146,5,B00003CWT6,"Considering the difficulty of these books, it would be a monumental task in bringing them to the screen.  In my opinion Peter Jackson has done it and done it well, at least in the first installment.
The acting - for the most part - is good and he did well in choosing Ian Mckellern as Gandalf.  The film takes you to a breath-taking middle earth - Well New Zealand actually - and the dialogue is only slightly contaminated with modern phrases.  The action is good, and time is taken to build up plot and characters.  Jackson evidently has great love for the
books and it shows.  This is a labour of love and dedication.
You could do a lot worse than buy this film - see in at the cinema if you can , it blows your head off - I look forward to parts 2 & 3 with anticipation.
Viewers who are not familiar with the books should be warned that this is the 1st installment of a trilogy, a trilogy that was originally meant to be one book by the author but was broken up by the publisher.  So be warned, the film does not have a 'traditional' ending;  but it does not suffer for this, in fact I found it refreshing from the normal hollywood three act ""fast food films"".  This however is not to everyones taste.
It was no mean task to convince the studios to part with 270 million dollars to create a nine hour film AND stay true to the spirit of the book. In my opinion he deserves an oscar just for that.  So instead of 4 stars I gave 5.",1034208000,,1432,4.122302158273381
1320147,5,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy The Lord of the Rings is a masterful piece of movie entertainment.  Director Peter Jackson has done an amazing job of transferring one of the most beloved pieces of 20th century literature to the silver screen.  Although certain sacrifices are made in the transition, the real heart and soul of the book is evident.  Utilizing the natural beauty of New Zealand and state of the art special effects, Mr. Jackson brings Middle Earth to full life.  The film has tremendous visuals and the feel of a classic Hollywood epic.  The cast is first rate led by Sir Ian McKellan who is magnificent as Gandalf.  Elijah Wood gives his best performance to date as the central character in the film, Frodo Baggins and Viggo Mortensen is cool and steely as Strider.  Sean Bean as the doomed Boromir and Orlando Bloom as the heroic elf Legolas give strong support as does Sean Astin as Frodo's sidekick Samwise Gamgee. Christopher Lee adds yet another evil part to his resume and he is perfect as the corrupt wizard Saruman.  Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and Ian Holm have small but effective roles.  There is the appropriate amount of suspense and tension in the film as the Fellowship struggle to destroy the ring.  The only drawback to the film is that knowing it is only the first part of a trilogy, it really doesn't end.  You don't have the usual resolution of the plot, but the film's excellence will leave you heavily anticipating part two.",1034208000,,1501,4.690839694656488

Frodo's father, Bilbo, stole a magic ring from Gollum (a frog-like creature). Bilbo then goes on a trip and leaves the ring to Frodo. Gandalf the wizard comes to warn Frodo, that the ring's maker, the evil Sauron wants it back and Frodo is in great danger. From here the real action of the movie starts as we see Frodo and his friends trying to get to Mount Doom to destroy the ring. An exciting and intriguing movie to watch.

1320217,2,B00003CWT6,"As a long-time reader of The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, and all of the supplemental works, I can honestly say that I was extremely disappointed by Peter Jackson's version of the Lord of the Rings.
To start with, many unnecessary scenes were added to this film that were not in the original text written by JRR Tolkein.  The fight scene between Sauron and Isildur, where the ring was lost for a time, was not in the book at all, except as a short narration by Gandalf.  Another fight scene which was only a brief narration in the book was the fight between Gandalf and Saruman.  Throughout the movie Peter Jackson has seen fit to add in material which can not be found in Tolkien's original writing.
Jackson also goes too far by removing some of the best scenes in the book.  The pride of the elves, Lorien and Galadriel, have virtually no screen time at all.  The Dwarven dark failure, Moria, is a muddled run through some caves with little comment on their history.  The views of daily life in the Shire are cut to nothing at all.  In fact the entire journey to Bree takes moments of screen time, removing entirely the wonder of what a grand journey these hobbits are taking for the first time.  The hobbits instead creep from shadow to shadow and rely entirely on the humans to cart them around like baggage.
In the end the movie follows the Holywood formula of promoting style over substance.  It shoves aside the central point of the novels, which is the meek (the hobbits) growing into their own, for that of violence and flashy special effects.  I know that this film was enjoyed by many, but I feel that the true fans of the original novels will be truly disappointed with the mess Peter Jackson has made of these classic works.",1034035200,3,1735,4.496815286624204

The movie comes to some resolution when the first part of the journey is complete and this would have made a good stopping point.  However the journey continues and somewhere in it the movie ends abruptly.

It is said that this is how the book ends.  If that is so I would rather wait until the series is complete so I don't have to be kept hanging.",1034035200,,558,4.368932038834951
1320219,5,B00003CWT6,"Yeah it's long - it's VERY long - but the beginning of the great Lord of the Rings trilogy couldn't be told in a better style.  I would, however, like to respond to the rumors that the movie is faithful to the book.  I don't think so...after all, there are many differences between the two.  For example, did you know that in the book, after Gandalf left Frodo alone at the Shire to study the lore behind the One Ring, that he was gone for 17 years before returning for good?  There are other differences as well, such as the Willow in the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil, and the Barrow Downs being left out of the movie.  Also, Arwen did NOT take Frodo to Rivendell like the movie, he was escorted there by Glorfindel, who makes no appearance in the movie at all.  But aside from a few nitpicky things like that, this is a fascinating adaptation of the JRRT classic.

I was disappointed in this film. I think it would have made a far better animated film in the tradition that Japan's Miyazaki Hayao works in. New Zealand all dolled up and blurred to look like the Shire didn't convince me, though things did get better with the landscape as they go under the mountain where all the dwarves perished. The depiction of the hybrid orcs--like the ones that shoot Boromir full of arrows--is particularly effective. It was a bit of a shock to see the guy who played the evil agent Smith in the Matrix show up as the Elf King, but he actually was quite good. As was Sean Bean as the mighty warrior, Boromir. The music of this film really got on my nerves after a while--it was like an uneven cross between Enya and Wagner. I felt like I was waking up at my own funeral only to find out I was in hell.
I did watch this only on DVD, so I can't really say how it compares with the video. But it's obvious that you lose a lot with a film like this once you go from the big screen. So if you have got great home theatre equipment, I'd bet the DVD is the superior way to go.
Perhaps this series will grow on me and the next installment will get higher ratings from me. Perhaps I really do need to see them at a local theatre first.",1034035200,2,1255,4.105691056910569
1320222,5,B00003CWT6,"A pervious attempt to capture the magic of this classic trilogy was an embarrassment to Tolkien himself.  Thankfully, this new attempt to create an onscreen masterpiece has hit the mark. The scenery was amazing and the characters were all very well cast.  The formula for an increadible movie was created when Tolkien wrote his books all those years ago and Wingnut Films has created the start of what looks to be a promising and wonderful trilogy.
The story itself follows closely to the book, however there are a few deviations and ommisions in the film, but that helps cut down on overdetailing and dragging out scenes.  The movie does not ruin the book and the book does not ruin the movie, they actually compliment each other and should be enjoyed together.
Whether you are or are not familiar with the story, I highly recommend that you view this movie.  It combines an amazing storyline with delightful sights and thrilling action.  This is an instant classic that will be enjoyed for many years to come.",1033948800,,1011,4.787356321839081

Peter Jackson respect Tolkiens world and describe things just as I imagine. I highly recommand it. If you are a die hard Tolkiens fan, you might be disappoint by this movie because the film modify many plotline and sequences(The battle between Arogorn/Friz, Arwen replace Glorfindel, the battle between cave troll, Tom Bombadill disappears, and more), but if Peter Jackson squeeze everything into the story, I would expect it over 10 hours long.
After you see the film, if you are inspired to read the books for the first time, I should warn you that movie and books are a totally different medea, so don't blame me if you don't understand the books.

1320224,5,B00003CWT6,"I do not even know where to begin.  Expectations were high when we first heard that Tolkien was coming to the big screen, but hesitation as well.  Does anyone have the right to try and mess with what has been rightly named book of the century?  Peter Jackson has proven that he does have that right, with his devotion to making every little detail faithful to the book.  A visual feast is the result of his years of work, with great casting decisions, great screenplay, and special effects that should make even Lucasfilm stand up and take notice.
 The DVD is no exception to the experience.  Jackson has no qualms about letting the viewer behind the scenes to show how each and every moment of magic was pulled off.  The sound and colour are as clean and crisp as any movie on DVD has ever had(and if you disagree on this point, get a better, bigger TV now!!).  I viewed every last minute of featurette and documentary footage, which not only satisfies the movie-viewer's soul, but builds the appetite for both the upcoming extended edition DVD(which I have already pre-ordered through our friends at Amazon of course!), but also the next chapter, The Two Towers.  December is oh so far away, and yet oh so close!
In closing, if you own this film masterpiece, good show!  Spread the word!  And if you don't yet own it, if you're unsure whether it's worth seeing let alone owning, trust me...that's right, trust a guy you don't even know!  Buy it!  Own it!  Love it!",1033862400,,1466,4.5458015267175576

1320302,5,B00003CWT6,"I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, like I would hope all do before seeing Fellowship, and I believe it an excellent adaptation.  Not only does Peter Jackson allow for his cast to give an actual performance, unlike George Lucas, he also does an excellent job of filling in gaps.  There wasn't the best of explanations, in the book, of how Gandalf escaped Orthanc, yet Jackson did his best to fill that in.
Those who complain and moan about how people compare this to Star Wars, and putting shame to it, it does.  Compared to Lord of the Rings, Star Wars is a joke, a mockery of cinema.  Special effects in Lord of the Rings aren't done to play around, they're done only to further the storyline.  When 12 year-olds review this movie and complain, it's easily equated to being TWELVE.  Quit reviewing movies that are aimed at a much higher audience, and as far as people referring to ""Viggo Mortsenson's Knight,"" how about you watch the movie first.  He's mentioned by three names total in the movie, at least uee ONE of them to refer to him - Aragorn, Strider or Elissar.
Complaints revolving around 'this movie is too long', and 'the movie was too dark', maybe you should also read the books.  Every book was well-over 300 pages, which still isn't that long, and to do them justice, obviously, you need a lot of time.  Tolkien ultra-purists are going to complain as it is, without Tom Bombadil, which would've likely added 30 or more minutes.  As far as being 'too dark', that's the point of this series!  Too dark?!  That's right, there's a great shadow over the land that is trying to envelope all of Middle-Earth, and it's the job of the Fellowship to try and end it.
Comparing this movie to Harry Potter is laughable, because Harry Potter is aimed at children, not an adult.  Children shouldn't review adult-oriented themes, because they'll, first, not understand them, even some adults who haven't read the books won't understand the first time around, and second, not comprehend the overall meaning of the actions being taken.

Unlike some receant fantasy blockbusters( mostly Harry Potter) the CGI's in this movie are very realistic.  Their movement really flows, and is no way blurry.  If you are going to or have read any of the one star reviews for this, don't believe them.  Most of the ones I read are from people without any imagination,  people who thought they did not stick to the book enough( to which I say, when have you seen a movie that does?

There are changes from the book, which I just reread, but there is very little to complain about, it seems to me.  Yes, there is some bowing to the pressure of the modern audience (more romance, more prominence to the female characters), but it is no more than you can expect given the realities of justifying hundreds of millions of dollars to produce these films.
It's getting near the time when the four DVD set will be out, and if you're going to buy that, then just bite the bullet and wait.

Although due to necessity the book is compressed, the film gives ample credit to the book. The storyline concerns a Hobbit named Frodo Baggins. His 111 year-old uncle Bilbo Baggins retreats his homeland which is the Shire to stay with the Elves, and the inheritance to Bag End suddenly becomes Frodo's. After claiming inheritance, Frodo realizes he posseses a mysterious gold ring. Gandalf, a wizard who is on friendly terms with the hobbits of the Shire, and especially with Frodo suddenly discovers the nature of the ring, finding it to be the One Ring forged by the dark lord Sauron in the dark realm of Mordor. It had come to be in the possession of Bilbo 60 years before, when he found it while lost in the mountains on one of his quests. The servants of the dark lord soon learn from a creature who was an eyewitness to the finding of the ring, that the Ring was in the possession of Baggins. The dark, fearsome Ringwraiths now set out find the Ring that would enable Sauron to destroy all good in Middle-earth. Frodo embarks on a perilous quest through Middle-earth, his destination being Mount Doom, in the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom of Mordor, the one and only place where the deadly Ring could be destroyed. He is accompanied by Gandalf, along with several others, humans, a dwarf, an elf, and three other hobbits. Together they form the Fellowship of the Ring.
Director Peter Jackson has made an astonishing masterpiece of a movie that transports you to a world beyond imagination. The film is well worth the purchase price .

Frankly, I think that this wonderful film, ""The Lord of the Rings-The Fellowship of the Ring"" being produced in New Zealand by a wonderful director, Peter Jackson, from the UK (I believe to be the case) did not help it with Oscar voters. Perhaps the votes were close, but I still was amazed that this magnificent film walked away with only a handful of Oscars and not the major awards. I am hopeful that ""The Two Towers"" will bring a long over-due Academy Award nomination to Christopher Lee as Best Supporting Actor for his role as the wizard, Saruman, which is larger in ""The Two Towers"". After more than fifty years in film Christopher Lee is now 80 and it would be richly deserved. I am not forgetting Ian McKellum either, hopefully he will win for ""The Return of the King""!
 The producers and screenwriters had the difficult task of translating this massive book published almost 50 years ago, and most of it written even earlier, to the screen and the results do not dissapoint. I agree with other viewers that even small deviations from the story can be annoying. I was not put off so much by the fact that Arwens character stood in for Glorfindel, but it changed the story since it was at that moment for example that Frodo stood up to and defied the Lord of the Nazgul who breaks Frodos sword with his piercing cry. Incidentally, that is one of the reasons Bilbo gives Frodo Sting, along with his mail coat. The only other major change worth noting was when the Fellowship enters Moria. In the movie version they find the remains of the slain dwarves just inside the gate and then try to double out before they are forced to go on. This frankly foreshadows and spoils somewhat the dramatic impact later of the Fellowship finding Balin's tomb and realizing than the the dwarf colony had indeed perished. These are not major changes, but worth noting. Most of what we know of the character of Arwen Evenstar comes from the appendice, not the book proper, so an attempt was made to weave her more into the story. It will not please all purists, but frankly it wasn't bad either.
  As far as the DVD release itself, I am not overjoyed with the prospect of buying this film twice on DVD, but at least through the LOTR website and the media, the studio and director were very upfront about the DVD releases and exactly what they would contain in advance of either one being offered. That is a far better way to do business than most studios who wait until you have bought one DVD edition before releasing even details of a second! So enjoy the DVDs and I will see you at the movies in December for the premiere of ""The Two Towers""!  In the meanwhile, I hope those of you who enjoyed the film, but still have not read the books, will get busy and start reading.  You will learn a great deal and appreciate the movies all the more.

It has great acting (except for frodo), wonderful story, and sweet action. This movie is most certainly my favorite movie. I have read the book, it also is a classic, and the movie stays true to the book. The thing is though, at the end of the movie it jumps from the end of the Fellowship of the Ring to the begining of the Two Towers book, but it is still easy to follow along. The One Ring falls in the hands of Frodo and Gandalf the Grey (he's a wizzard) tells him to bring it to the Prancing Pony and he will meet them (the hobbits, Pippin, Merry, Sam) there. Things don't turn out so well for Gandalf and they meet Strider (Aragorn) and he starts leading them to Rivendell. But on the way they meet som trouble. They run into the Nazugul, or Ringwriaths, beings of darkness, clothed all in black. They have no visible face. There in Rivendell the hobbits meet Gandalf and the Fellowship is created. Gimli the Dwarf, Legoles the Elf, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn, Boromir, Pippin, Merry, Sam, and Frodo. From there they try to go over some mountains, but Saruman, who betrayes the good side, tries to bring down the mountain. That doesn't work so the Fellowship goes through the mines of Moria. In Balin's Tomb, inside Moria, they meet some Orcs. There is a ferousios battle between many orcs, and the Fellowship. It has to be the best battle scene in the movie. Then they get overwhelmed by too many Orcs, and they flee. Then a couple thousand Orcs surrond them but get scared by a demon from the shadow, a Balrog. Gandalf and the Balrog have a showdown, and Gandalf wins. Well, sort of. The Balrog pulls him down into the shadows with him. Gandalf falls, and the Fellowship flees. Then they meet up with the kind Elves in Lorien, then head towards Mordor (which is where they need to go to destroy the ring) by going down the Great River. They hit the banks, and are attacked by Orcs. The Fellowship is broken here, and Sam and Frodo go on thier own towards Mordor to destroy the Ring. Boromir falls, trying to protect the other two hobbits, and the hobbits get captured. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas go after the Orcs to get back Merry and Pippin, the hobbits. That is where the movie ends. It is a great five star masterpiece and a must see. No movie collection is complete without it. I'm sure we all thank Peter Jackson for this wonderful movie.",1033430400,8,2758,4.367704280155642

1320408,4,B00003CWT6,"(My review refers to the 'theatrical' version DVD.)
If you have not read the book, then this movie rocks!

And I have not when I watched the movie in theaters, so I found this movie, like most others, to be the ""ne plus ultra"". Forget Star Wars, I said. Forget Hogwarts and Harry Potter. Watched it twice. The casting choices for, above all, Gandalf and Bilbo as well as Frodo, Legolas (the surprise package of the movie), Aragorn (although he was only 2nd choice), Boromir, Samwise and Galadriel could hardly be topped. The location couldn't be better. Visual effects are 'magical', even though they have less CGI than most Lucas movies.
Like many, I got curiouser, to borrow a Lewis Carroll word, and bought the books, including ""The Hobbit"". I had to fight through the tightly spaced lines and admittedly strange ""English"" language (Winston Churchill would have found it just right) but I finished all four. Reading brings realization that the movie will inevitably fall short.
I'm not a literary snob. I hardly read books of this sort, although I do read reference books (science, history etc.). I don't gripe much about the compression of time frame. We all know Tom Bombadil and the episode on the Barrowdowns were removed. Regrettable (I would love to see Peter Jackson's take on Tom) but forgiveable. It's the alteration of the characters that disappointed me. I found it strange for Elrond to say in the movie that Aragorn has strayed from the path and has chosen exile, when in the book story, it was Elrond himself who set Aragorn on the path (of reclaiming his kingship), and knows all his labors, being his foster father. I also found it strange that Aragorn doubted whether he could be King. Sure, Aragorn had doubts, but not on this one, he never doubted his proper place. He willingly peered into the palantir and challenged Sauron because he knew his place. He summoned the Dead because he knew his place. He may look ragged, and his kingdom may be in tatters but he is King.
They also made Isildur look like a miserable power-hungry fool, like all he did was push all Middle Earth over the cliff of damnation. For the record, Isildur was a great man, a mighty warrior and righteous ruler, second only to his father Elendil. And while he took the ring, he never really did anything else wrong; he returned to Gondor, turned over Gondor, which he co-rules and over which he has a legal claim, to his nephew(if he was a bad man, he could have taken Gondor for himself), he planted the White Tree, then went north to Arnor, but was ambushed in Gladden Fields and was killed. Anyone would have failed the test of the Ring, even the Wise (Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel) refused the Ring in succession when it was offered freely, because they knew they would fail.
I also think the filmmakers took too much liberty enhancing the role of Arwen. As Tolkien expert Michael Martinez says, it is not inconceivable for Arwen to wield a sword and take an active part in aiding the Quest. I agree, but now that she has taken over the part of Glorfindel in Part 1, I don't think it is too far-fetched to assume that she will also take the role of Eowyn in Part 3 (The Return of the King). Perhaps Arwen, and not Eowyn, will face the Captain of the Nazgul in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. What's to stop the filmmakers from going that far?
And why did Peter Jackson miss the special affection Gimli had for Galadriel when they finally met? Except perhaps for Sam, Gimli was Galadriel's greatest champion, he was even prepared to fight Eomer to the death over Galadriel's honor. That Galadriel was a witch was a myth (believed by Boromir and Gimli and most people who don't know her), but the movie seems to believe it. And how could they cut the part where Galadriel gives each member of the Company a gift? (OK, they included the part where Frodo gets the phial.) It could have been a wonderful part, especially for Sam and Gimli, who gets the seemingly impossible.
Movies like Star Wars (1977), and now the Lord of the Rings, are made by the details that almost seem trivial, but which make the stories lifelike, and connect to us. LOTR:FOTR has the details, too much in some, wonderful in many, and lacking in many others. It does connect to us, and is still a great effort (I wanted to give it 3.5 stars), especially for those who have not read the book, but a little more faithfulness to the book and its characters would have been welcome. After all, there are a lot of Tolkien readers out there, wouldn't you want them to be pleased, too?
I'm almost tempted to counsel fans not to read the books.",1032739200,,4609,4.573155985489722
1320409,5,B00003CWT6,"I am a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, and I have been for a while now.  It was when I heard the first breath of a movie about this magnificent piece of literature that I read the books.  Then re-read them.  Then  found more about them and read that too.  Now, having seen the movie somewhere around 15 times, theatre and DVD, I can tell you with confidence it is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It's every second of visual stimulation fills the viewer with majestic awe.  It is brilliantly crafted by the talented Peter Jackson into everything I imagined it would be.  Very few movies can rival this magical piece of film history, even the classics.  It's DVD is even better, with loads of features and things to play with that make the whole experience that much more enjoyable.  It is impossible not to respect the whole movie: cast, crew, and everything they endured to make this film, and those that will follow with even more grandeur.  The only suitible piece of advice regarding this movie: buy it.  Watch it.  Study it even.  You'll learn to respect all that goes into a movie of this magnitude.  And any that say different don't deserve this brilliant hallmark of movie history.",1032652800,2,1194,4.566037735849057
1320410,4,B00003CWT6,"The movie was amazing, perhaps one of the three best book adaptations of all time.  Lucas and the people doing the Harry Potter books should take a lot lessons from this movie.
The DVD is somewhat dissapointing, in part because it's a tease for the 4-disc volume coming out later.  That version will be extended with deleted scenes and, I believe, have commentary tracks.  Which means the current version is lacking in both of these elements that really add to DVDs.  This set has 2-discs, one with the movie and the other with extras, which are mostly behind-the-scenes featurettes.  These are interesting, but I really want the commentary and deleted scenes.
If you absolutely have to have TLoR now and can't wait for the 4-disc set, buy this.  If you have enough money to buy both versions, buy this.  If you just want the movie, buy this.  If you can wait a few more months, only want one set of TLoR DVDs and want all the extras, pass on this and wait for the 4-disc set.",1032480000,,976,4.505681818181818
1320411,5,B00003CWT6,"I can highly recommend Lord of the Rings after purchasing it on DVD and watching it at the cinema, twice.  I was first introduced to Tolkien when I bought Lord of the Rings, The Simarillion, and The Hobbit as a triple book collection, and my heart was captured in the realms of Middle-Earth so exquisite was JRR Tolkien's words.  Peter Jackson's adaptation take's nothing away from the brilliance of the book, a feat many thought impossible when translating to the big screen, or even in this case for the little one.
To watch Tolkien's work come to life is a whole new adventure in imagination, and rather than quashing the mind's eye view of Middle-Earth it actually creates new depths to create a rich interwoven tapestry of cinema and imagination.  Watch the DVD but keep the book handy as you'll want to travel through the lands of Middle-Earth with your own imagination.

I have followed the making of the Trilogy since it started ...  My anticipation growing with each new picture, with each new piece of spoiler information, and with each new trailer.
I walked into the cinema on the day of it's release and watched what is now my #1 movie of all time.  It delivered on all my expectations and more.  There they were, all the characters from my imagination on the big screen.  The sets, the art, the cast, the scenery, the story, the performances, the epic scale!!!
Not once did I ever feel that I was watching something that missed the essence of Tolkien.  I think the great man would have approved.
Peter Jackson and Co. should be applauded for the amount of time and hard work they have put into this project.  Every award and accolade that this movie has recieved is well deserved.  I look forward to The Two Towers and Return of the King.

1320454,5,B00003CWT6,"When I first heard that a movie was going to be made out of my favorite book of all time, my first reaction was absolute horror! I considered Lord of the Rings to be singularly untranslatable to screen and started reliving my nightmares of the 1980s cartoon versions. I was slightly less apprehensive when I learned that it was not going to be a cartoon and that the director was Peter Jackson. With my fears still not relieved, I walked into the theatre expecting to be horrified and to leave in tears with what they had done to a masterpiece of literature.
  I was pleasantly surprised when the movie started playing across the screen. Elijah Wood played an excellent Frodo and Sir Ian McKellen was a breathtakingly realistic Gandalf.
  The special effects, while not the focus point of the movie, were certainly amazing. The costumes accurately reflected LOTR and were brilliant in and of themselves.
  Although having already read the books was helpful to understanding the movie, it is absolutely not essential to the enjoying of this magnificent retelling of Tolkien's classic tale.
  While some characters were missing, it hardly detracts from the storyline. Readers will miss Tom Bombadil, the Sackville-Bagginses, and Sam's Gaffer but their absence does not make this movie any less enjoyable.
  The most common complaint I have heard refers to the larger role Arwen, daughter of Elrond, plays in the movie. Without her introduction early, the marriage to Aragorn in the Return of the King would have been highly confusing, as she does not come into the story later, save for a small paragraph in the Two Towers where her name is not even mentioned. Also, while I am not a feminist, the lack of strong female characters, except for Galadriel, was somewhat alleviated by her appearance and made the movie more appealing to female watchers. Tolkien purists, I am sure, will probably disagree with me.
  Overall, I would have to give this movie 5 stars, both as a movie alone, and as a retelling of J.R.R. Tolkien's book. Thus far I have watched the movie 8 times and read the book 15 times.",1032220800,9,2097,4.826815642458101
1320455,5,B00003CWT6,"This fantastical film was nominated for a best picture Oscar, so it seems even the uptight Academy members couldn't avoid giving it some nod of praise, besides just the usual good cinematography and best score banalities. But they weren't brave enough to actually award it The prize, though it certainly would have deserved it.
 Tolkien's literary work is, without a doubt, a sprawling masterpiece. But anyone who has read the work and seen Peter Jackson's epic film knows the two are quite capable of standing independent of one another (you don't need to read the book to know the movie is good, and vice versa). And that is how one should consider the film, a piece onto itself. Yes, Jackson has managed to keep the spirit and integrity of the story (which stays amazingly true to the book), but it is not a direct translation. The book sets a lazy pace and spends much time celebrating Middle Earth's inhabitants with songs and legend; the quest is the backdrop placed for us to enjoy the characters. The film, however, is all about evil vs. good and the bloody fight to preserve it. Jackson has managed to inscribe a new passion and adventure for our senses in a way that only a great visual storyteller could, and in a way only a movie could.
Lord of the Rings far surpasses any movie released in 2001 and it is unfortunate that many equate commercial success with substandard movies.  Or believe a movie needs to be drama-based to be worthy of serious consideration. The fact is, the translation from literature to a credible, intelligent film without losing any of the original substance is, in itself, remarkable. Add onto that the years of pre-production, impeccable casting, filming, post-productions---this movie deserved to win Best Picture for it's unyielding dedication to detail and devotion to making it a Reality. The fact that it is a genre-specific film is probably the only reason it has been denied its right to stand by the greats.
To make a movie that grand in scale without disintergrating the project into hollywood mush, To create an entire world translated from imagination to an interesting visual reality, To allow the characters to shine DESPITE the intimidating scale of the backdrop and story is a testament to Jackson's skill and direction. This is a movie that connects with its audience and creates escape; this is true storytelling that goes beyond clever camera tricks and overdramatic actors. This is one of the best films ever made; this is the type of storytelling magic that films were made for (in the grand tradition of the original Star Wars triology and ET and the Matrix).

The actors; Ian McKellen as the great Gandalf the Gray, Elijah Wood as the young hobbit Frodo, Viggo Mortensen as the swashbuckling Aragorn, Sean Astin as Frodo's companion Sam, and Ian Holm as the aging but wise Bilbo, give riveting performances throughout the film.  The special effects are top notch, especially the battle with the Balrog of Moria and the numerous encounters with the mysterious Orcs. Anyone who has read the beloved Tolkien trilogy knows the story of the Ring, and it is accurately told in the film.

1320459,3,B00003CWT6,"THE LORD OF THE RINGS : The Fellowship Of The Rings is another one of those movies that when I saw it in the theatre I thought it was too long and unimpressive. Yes it looked great and had great wide angled shot, but it was so visual that it didn't work for me in the theatre. Now, on the DVD, it was like Harry Potter - it works much better for the small screen. No I did not believe it was a `best picture' material, and yes, I did read the original novels and enjoyed them tremendously.
The story is relatively simple about a Hobbit who is given a ring to go on a quest to bring it where it belongs. The ring is evil and everyone is after it. Meeting, dwarfs, elves, humans and ogre alike they travel the grounds of Middle Earth in search for the goal.
Directed by Peter Jackson (The Frighteners, Braindead ) , the film definitely has a mystical quality about it, but he takes very long and very drawn out shots and has very little dialogue in any one place most of the time. ...
The DVD extras have some short snippets of the interviews with the cast as well as a lot of the production and production design of the movie.

The disappointing DVD released in August is a let down.  It only includes theatrical trailers and some made for television specials as extras.  The most aggravating of which was a promo for a better DVD version coming out in November.  The extras seemed to be one big commercial for future products, not giving any real insight to the planning, producing, or character development.

I received the DVD for free and checked it out. Since, I have read the trilogy and very much enjoyed it. I wouldn't place it on the top of my list of books, but it was a joy to read. Some look at the movie and complain about the removal of certain characters, the over-emphasis on others, and whatever else they want to point out as differing from the book. I look at it this way. What's the point of having a replica of the book? It's a different medium, and thus has different demands. I think that Peter Jackson and all involved did a fabulous job of making this movie true to the book and to the general movie audience. I never would have thought the director of movie like Dead Alive would be able to deliver on a film such as this, but he has gone beyond my expectations. Whether you've read the books or haven't, give it a chance as a film all on its own. Sure, feel free to compare, but is it necessary to attack the film because it doesn't live up to the picture in your head from the book. That's the wonderful thing about books. Everyone can have their own picture. Having a film that simply replicates every page destroys that opportunity for all those who will read the book in the future.

In the passage through the mines, the scenery is equally well done, though the drama building up to a boiling point dominates those scenes. This movie shows a need for amazon to provide more options for searching out a review, such as directly by date or by title or title keywords. One can find a review that one really likes for this movie, only to not be able to find it again among the overwhelming array of reviews>",1031961600,3,712,4.5703125
1320499,5,B00003CWT6,"Not being a big fan of the mid-evil/Dungeons and Dragons genre, I did not go to see Lord of the Rings in theaters (and certainly never read the books). But when I saw that it was coming on video, I decided to rent it at my local video store, not really expecting too much. But after about the first ten minutes, I knew I was wrong, This Movie is Amazing! Everything about this movie is great; the story, the acting, the cinematography, everything.
The first thing that struck me about the movie was the wonderful character of Gandalf - or maybe it was the wonderful performance by (Sir) Ian McKellen - or maybe it was both. Either way the character of Gandalf the White was my favorite of the movie.
The second thing that caught my eye was the excellent cinematography; from the shots of the opening battle in the 'prologue', to the beautiful colors of the Shire, the greens of the trees and grass, the browns of the dirt and mud.
And also how the Hobbits looked normal size when shot by them selves, only when they appear in a shot with a human or an elf do we see they're actual size.
After Frodo set off on his Quest, and met new allies and adversaries, I was amazed to find that I liked every character in the movie, from the kind and truthful hobbits, to the short but mighty dwarfs. Every character seemed to perfectly into the action, every actor seemed to fit perfectly into his or her roll, especially the character of Sam, who for the most part stayed out of the lime light of the movie, but when he was in the spot light, showed that he was a brave, but knew when to speak up or shut up.
I would also like to mention Christopher Lee's performance as Saruman. While I liked it immensely, I thought Lee's portrayal as Count Dooku in the latest Star Wars installment, Attack of the Clones, was a little better.
One of the best qualities of the film was how it never seemed - to me at least - to slow and/or become boring. Even when there wasn't any action, the great dialogue keeps you watching, and the end of the movie leaves you thinking: That was three hours!
The only minuscule complaint that I had, is the 'to be continued' ending, which if its 2004 and you have the other two movies available to watch, is not that big of a problem, but when its still 2002, and you have to wait another year or two for the final installments, it's a bit aggravating. But what are you going to do; it's based on a book.
And authors don't usually take into consideration that they're story might be a movie someday.
I suppose I should also mention the director; Peter Jackson.
To be perfectly honest, I had never heard of him before.
But if he makes other movies as well as he made this one, he is one of the best directors in Hollywood.
After the movie was over, I sat there wishing I could watch the final two installments of the trilogy.
And I knew it was one of the best movies I had ever seen.

All of the performances stand out, especially Ian Mckellan as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn; both of these actors throw themselves into their roles.  The movie also adds parts that would have been helpful to read in the book, for instance, the fight between Gandalf and Saruman.  The Lord of the Rings delivers excellent battle sequences, such as Aragorn vs. the black riders and when the fellowship takes on 50 orcs in the mines of Moria.  This movie also features cinematography of New Zealand mountains, rivers, waterfalls, and forests that blow all other movies away.  See this movie!",1031875200,,730,4.808

1320502,4,B00003CWT6,"I have read the trilogy several times. It is amazing in its scope. As a quest to destroy the ultimate evil has to be huge. Director Peter Jackson has done a very good job in maintaining that scope in just under three hours. He has treated this classic tale of fantasy with great respect. Hobbitown looks just as described. I vividly remember reading about when the Nazgul Ring Wraiths first appear. I remember trying to visualize how four hobbits could hide under a root without being seen when the black Wraith is standing directly over them, and yet not be seen. I remember reading about the trip through the Mines of Moria, the Wizard Gandalf's battle with the balrock and how the Fellowship broke apart. The movie depicts each with the size and scope of the book.
The only other set of movies I know of with this scope is the Star Wars Trilogy. But there, the actors always seem to be having a good time, almost like they were acting in a Saturday Serial. The Good Guys can't die. In contrast, the actors here take their roles much more seriously. They play their roles as if they can die. Without that seriousness, the movie would not work.
The cinematography, sound track and special effects are very good. There are no effects done simply for the ""WOW that's cool!"" value. (See e.g., the candy frog comming to life and jumping out of the train window in Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone.) If the effects had been eye candy, they would have detracted from the movie. Instead, the special effects and computer generated characters, backgrounds and images take a back seat to the story.
My main gripe with the movie is that it could have been shortened by half an hour if every fifth shot was not of the Ring in Frodo's hand. It becomes very distracting and annoying. This is the ony reason I did not give this movie a 5 star rating. Highly recommended.",1031875200,,1860,4.538690476190476
1320503,5,B00003CWT6,"A short time ago the best serious or high fantasy movie was considered by many to be ""Ladyhawke"", with a very limited number of other movies even close. Move over ""Ladyhawke"", ""Lord of the Rings"" has vaulted to the number one spot in one fell swoop.
""Lord of the Rings"" seamlessly blends indoor and outdoor sets with special effects to create the most incredibly believable fantasy world ever, setting a new standard of excellence for fantasy movies. The cinematography gets five stars plus.
The standard of excellence does not stop there. The actors chosen for the main parts fit their parts perfectly. I was originally concerned about the choice of Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. Throw my concern away. Elijah Wood is a perfect Frodo Baggins. Ian McKellen IS Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen brings a wonderful dimensionality to Aragorn, a character I had trouble visualizing in the books. I could easily spend thousands of words regarding the choices made for each of the characters, and how well each played their part. Suffice it to say that the acting was among the best of any movie in 2001, if not the best. The short-sighted people at the Academy missed the opportunity to award an epic fantasy rewards for acting excellence. Let's hope they take advantage of the opportunity with the next installment in the series!
Special effects: The new state-of-the-art. The flow between special effects and set effects is invisible. Probably the most evident special effect to me was the Balrog, which, while very good, still had somewhat of an animated feel to it. The effect was still good enough that you felt the fear of the characters and for the characters. ""Run!"" you wanted to yell...okay, I did yell run. The special effects are so good that I want to move to Middle Earth!
How well was Tolkien translated? Very, very well. The principal characters are there, and their depth is well-established, with even more potential to increase depth in the next two installments. Admittedly, there are some characters missing. Some of the detail had to be trimmed. However, the movie adds visual detail that enhances the story. The movie remains true to the essence of the story, and I think that the modifications the director and producer made fit well with the translation, in several cases summarizing what took Tolkien dozens of pages to describe in a brief moment, capturing what Tolkien intended the reader to understand.
This series of movies will be able to do what all other movies have not, tell a single story of incredible scope in 3 separate 3-hour movies, each released a year part. Only made-for-tv miniseries have previously had the luxury of such extended length.
When I reached the end of this movie, my only disappointment was that I had to wait for two years to see it to the end.
This movie is a must-have for any serious fan of fantasy, and for fans of Tolkien. Fantasy has for many years taken a backseat to the development of ever-better science fiction movies. With the release of this movie, the opportunity to create movies to match the vision of other great fantasy books can at last be realized.",1031788800,9,3114,4.833333333333333

The climactic battle-royal with the Uber-Orcs is a gut-wrenching melee of blades and arrows. Sean Bean portrays a righteous juggernaut, fighting on even with three monster shafts in his chest.
And wait until you see what Viggo Mortensen does to the final opponent...
About halfway through the film, you see what Viggo is willing unleash upon Sean in order to protect the ring during their journey. That moment sums up the warrior-code ethic of this fine action movie.",1031788800,,596,4.740384615384615

For those not familiar with the epic tale, be warned that this is only 1/3 of the story! But take heart, the producers and directors shot all the film for the final two parts over a two year period and the second installment is due out this winter. If you enjoy fantasy (elves, wizards, etc.) I recomend you purchase the books (boxed set). Remember, this is mythology with all the good and bad that that implies.",1031788800,,667,4.61344537815126
1320603,1,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings was pretty much everything I expected it to be. I don't really expect very much of Hollywood--where very little real art is created and most of what gets produced are overpriced, overproduced, sensationalized, muscle-flexing action extravaganzas for persons of advancing age and limited attention span. If you think that the film will even remotely match the aesthetic of the book, banish that thought the instant you turn on the movie.
  Clearly, a certain amount of the spirit of the novel is bound to be lost when it hits the screen. But Peter Jackson might have attempted to create the cinematic version of Tolkien's razor-sharp imagery, through shots of the creatures, that, like Spielberg's Jaws, don't reveal their full bodies and keep you in suspense.
  Ian McKellan is a fine British actor, and Elijah one is a decent one, so one would expect there to be some chemistry between Frodo and Gandalf in the film. WRONG. Whenever Gandalf and Frodo seem to develop the beginnings of a tender relationship, one in which they care for each other visibly and we can actually feel the sacred bond uniting them that was so affecting in the novel, Jackson immediately stamps out whatever chemistry there is, through a vulgar horror movie special effect or another tiresome this-is-the-most-important-moment-in-history line.
  There are some pretty cinematic views of the Shire, and some comforting exchanges between characters, that attempt to evoke the spirit of the original--of a blind but cozy group of creatures, but a dreadful storm looming in the distance. But he undercuts himself here, too, through many vulgar and gratuitous special effects displays, such as the pointless and unartful firing off of fireworks by Pippin and Merry.
  Whatever merit the film has is lost as soon as the Fellowship reaches Brandybuck. From here Fellowship tumbles rapidly downhill. There's probably about five pages of dialogue in the remaining hour and forty five minutes of the film. The plot almost completely vanishes, after nearly two hours of Peter Jackson smothering us with chases that have scant tension or suspense and other idiotic displays of spectacle, mercifully, Fellowship ends.",1031788800,5,2199,5.192090395480226
1320604,5,B00003CWT6,"I am not the type of person that enjoys watching films with a ""dungeon and dragons"" feel to them, but after an awful lot of hype and seeing the advertisement on TV enough times to know each scene in order, I decided to watch The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring earlier today. I rented it with some mates and sat down for almost three hours and by the end had just witnessed the greatest film my 15-year-old eyes have ever seen. Nominated for 13 Academy Awards and walking away with only 4 earlier in the year, I was left dazzled, gripped and entranced by this epic film. At $300 million, The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring overtook Titanic as the most expensive film to produce of all time. They made their money's worth though, as the film has grossed almost $1 billion in less than a year! It rocketed straight to No. 1 on the UK VHS/DVD chart on Sunday 11th August 2002, shifting more than 1.3 million copies in its first week to become the fastest selling film of all-time in the UK - outselling the previous record set by Titanic for 1.25 million in September 1998. Director Peter Jackson surpasses himself with the sheer size of Middle-Earth. J.R.R. Tolkein's classic novel of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy always represented me with the challenge of imagining just how big Middle-Earth is, but Jackson seems to have got the size just right; it's just how I, and I'm sure the majority of other fans, imagined it would be.

An ancient Ring, thought lost for centuries has been found, and through a strange twist in fate has been given to a small Hobbit named Frodo. When Gandalf discovers the Ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, Frodo must make an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it. However he does not go alone. He is joined by Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir and his three Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin and Samwise. Through mountains, snow, darkness, forests, rivers and plains, facing evil and danger at every corner the Fellowship of the Ring must go. Their quest to destroy the One Ring is the only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign. Elijah Wood plays a convincing Frodo Baggins, but spends most of his screen time frowning, looking confused, yet determined to return the ring and destroy it. Ian McKellen makes the most of his role as Gandalf as does Cate Blanchett. She doesn't have much screen time but is pure and fresh in her role as Galadriel. Liv Tyler as Arwen Undomiel, Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins, and Christopher Lee as Saruman the White are all exceptional in their roles. There really isn't an actor on this film that isn't superb and spot-on. The whole film is so action packed, gripping, suspenseful and tense. There are shocks and twists a plenty that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the final scene. The sheer size and volume of Middle-Earth is breathtaking and spectacular - and the fight scenes are fantastically choreographed with superb, amazingly life-like special effects.
OVERALL GRADE: 10/10
All in all, The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is the greatest film of all-time. I am not the biggest fan of fantasy films (Star Wars are, in my opinion, junk), but The Fellowship Of The Ring has gone straight to No. 1 in my list of all-time favourite films, knocking back films with the horror, comedy and drama theme along the way. I can't wait until The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers in December 2002 and the third enstallment, The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King, but I think it will be an extremely difficult task to follow up on the first one. If you haven't seen The Fellowship Of The Ring, you HAVE to. Buy it, rent it, borrow it...heck, [...] it for crying out loud! Whatever method takes your fancy, this is the must-see film of the 21st Century so far! Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone is inferior and mediocre in comparison to LOTR and everyone I know who has seen it liked this one better that [...] Potter! The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is truly a classic and epic film is cinema history that will stand out as the greatest film ever made - buy it from Amazon now!",1031788800,2,4170,4.465268676277851

The BBC had one (of several) radio programs that was fantastic (Ian Holm, Michael Hordern, et al). Sure, they had to cut some to make it fit into 3 hours (no Tom Bombadil), but the result is living up to dreams about as well as they could be. The transfer to DVD is excellent. The layer switch is noticeable but you are aware that you did not miss anything (this is good -- many layer switches occur between scenes and you are never sure if you missed something).

I could go into the story, but I think that's been pretty well covered in these reviews already. I love everything about this movie. The characters, the plot, the acting, the scenery (gorgeous), the music, the special effects. The only thing that could improve it is if it were longer so that more of the book (FOTR) could be seen, but then it would be hours longer and who has that kind of attention span? *S*
Peter Jackson did a wonderful job directing. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellan, Orlando Bloom (Legolas is my favorite character), Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, etc. They all were great in LOTR.
I will soon own this edition ..., but I'm really looking forward to the extended edition coming out in November.

LOTR and it's follow-ups look to be a staple in Film Art classes nationwide and despite some very minor flaws a wonderful adaptation of the classic novel.
A lot of the costumes and environments felt very similar to many modern PC roleplaying video games that I've enjoyed, I couldn't help but to keep thinking of that the first time I saw it!  LOTR is the ultimate in fantasy lore and keeps your interest from beginning to end.
I actually had to watch it twice to absorb all it had to offer, and my biggest complaint would be that the dialogue was hard to hear at times as intentionally soft spoken lines were not drawn out enough to hear or obscured by the soundtrack, (which is also excellent).
And I can certainly forgive the film's creators for not including ""everything"" the book included, no one wants to watch a ten hour movie in one sitting no matter how good it is, simply impossible.  The great job they did of adapting it to film made up for those lack of inclusions.
A classic tale of good versus evil, and even if you aren't a fan of the book, and you have an open, creative mind that loves magic and fantasy, you can get past the fact the entire epic story is based on a simple gold ring.
I simply cannot wait for the second film to arrive in theaters as the rather abrupt ending point really leaves you yearning for the rest of the story to be shown on-screen.  Luckily for me it's been such a long time since I read the book that I can barely remember who lives, who dies, and what happens.  And I have no intention of reading it in the interim as it will certainly make the second film that much more enjoyable.

1320611,3,B00003CWT6,"The only two saving graces about this movie were the special effects and Liv Tyler.  And not necessarally in that order...  This movie was almost as long and as tedious as the books.  Like Frank Herbert and Dune, J.R.R. Tolkien has managed to create a lush and imaginative world that no one else has invisioned.  Unlike Herbert, however, he didn't know how to write a tight, compelling tale.  Instead, he gets bogged down in pages and pages of description and imagery and sadly, this has carried over to every interpritation in film of the books I have seen.  While this effort certainly does outshine all of them, it still falls victom to endless minutes wasted on showing off the ""wonder"" and ""majesty"" of Middle Earth, and very little on plot and charactor development (remember those?).  By the end, I was getting very tired of seeing Frodo standing some place snivelling yet once more over his plight.  Puh-lease...  While I will probably add this series to my collection as it is the best I have seen to date, I fear that these films, like the three books, should have been cut down to about one and a half, thus making a much more watchable (and readable) story.

It will wet the appetite of the fanboys who are waiting for the deluxe/extended DVD edition in November and THE TWO TOWERS in December (theatrical release).
The film looks great here.  I think DVD looks superior to VHS any day, but I must confess that some of the transfer looks like the compression shows.  The title and some of the blacks look pixilated to my eyes.  This is a small complaint.  I'm not all that technical either, but I did notice the digital quality in some places.
The bonus disk features a preview of the extended DVD - I've watched it several times.  There is also a TWO TOWERS preview/behind the scenes featurette.  Incredible!
FELLOWSHIP, as a film, is excellent.  Peter Jackson opens the film with a flashback to the First Age - the visuals here are awe-inspiring.  Seeing it in the theatre, I had heart palpitations: thousands of elves meeting legions of orcs on the slopes of Mount Doom is the most incredible sight I've seen on film!  And then Jackson puts the fans over the moon with a glimpse of Gollum and a quick view of Bilbo finding the ring in the Misty Mountains.  And this is still the FELLOWSHIP prologue!!
The rest of the movie is very faithful to Tolkien's book, although in my opinion it's an overly-caffeinated Tolkien.  I understand that film paces differently than literature, and I accept the differences here.
Jackson succeeds in casting, art direction, special effects, and (most importantly) story-telling/script!  Notice how George Lucas has lost his story-telling ability in the new STAR WARS trilogy (Lawrence Kasdan's script contributions in the first trilogy were invaluable). Peter Jackson knows that Tolkien the story-teller knew what he was doing and Jackson follows suite.

of Middle-Earth fell

It is actually quite remarkable how the mythic world of middle Earth has been made so lifelike, and how intriguing it is on the big screen.
The script is brilliantly written and the cast is excellent. We get to see all the wonders of Middle Earth before our eyes- The Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lotholorien...
What makes the Lord of the Rings so inspiring is the hope of good always triumphing over evil, at a time when, at the beginning of the 21st century,
by the breakdown of a morality of right and wrong acts in favor of a therapeutic ethic which ""feels the pain"" of the perpetrators of violence. Taken in combination, these are powerful forces, to which the countervailing influences of reason, responsibility and restraint are as unequal now as they have been at any other time of populist ferment and generalized fear.
With the end of the Cold War, we have seen, instead of a triumph, of Judeo-Christian values and Western democracy, an anti-western revolutionary amoral and cruel philosophy taking over the world.  This leads us to fear that
Judeo-Christian civilization will fall, ""and all will come to darkness"", but we
Must take inspiration from the words of Aragorn: ""I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you, I will not let the White City fall. Nor our people fail!""
Thus we can take comfort that darkness will not triumph and as Gandalf so inspiringly puts it: ""So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you were also meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought...""
As long As we always stand by values of right and justice and freedom and never give up the idea that they will triumph.",1031443200,,2413,4.36

The setup is nice; the opening scenes in idyllic Hobbiton (or whatever it's called) are truly magical. And the conflict between Good and Evil is nicely delineated, both visually and in terms of the characters;  Ian McKellen and Christoper Lee are perfect in their roles. But the endless trek through peril after peril that takes place in the second half of the movie eventually becomes tiresome.  I mean, we KNOW that Our Heroes are going to make it through to Mordor (at least, most of them) and by the middle of the third hour, my butt was aching and my eyes were tired!  Don't get me wrong; this is a good movie, in some ways maybe even a great movie ... but it's not quite as good as most of the nearly 2000 other reviews here would have you believe!",1031356800,2,924,4.203389830508475

So at first glance, it might not be surprising that it seems so unusually, wonderfully literary.  But this is not your average book-based film.
This movie handles the transition from book to film flawlessly. It has the quick-paced and intelligently complex plot, the large cast of characters (all with incredible depth and completely believable) that would be expected in a fantasy novel. Every character is well developed, and the viewer is never left confused by the omission of details that often occampanies book-based films. Rather, it is as though you are suddenly able to watch the book instead of reading it. With this visual ability comes wonderful acting, incredible New Zealand scenery, engaging cinematography and a sense of complete believability.

I was especially impressed with the characterizations of Merry and Pippin, and Sam and Frodo.  What marvelous hobbits they are.  The technical wizardry is thrilling, the landscapes are breathtaking, and the acting is top-notch.  Not s single character was left ""hollow"" or ""flat""; even Gollum in his abbreviated appearance was given three dimensions.  It's a wonderful film...  Seeing it so many times,too, you pick up on little things: like Legolas walking ON TOP of the snow, while everyone else is chest-deep in it.  That image alone spoke volumes about the handsome elve's cat-like abilities without saying a word...  It's marvelous.  You MUST see it!",1031270400,,840,5.162962962962963
1320724,5,B00003CWT6,"If you love fantasy, or Tolkien, or just superb filmmaking, do yourself a favor and ignore the inane, critical reviews below. 'LOTR' is brilliant, a wonderful departure of epic proportions from the typical Hollywood garbage that floods screens 99% of the time. Peter Jackson should be commended for having the brass to bring this trilogy to the big screen, and pulling off the first episode so well. The whole film completely draws you into the Fellowship's quest and adventures!
Fans of the fantasy genre have been waiting, uh, FOREVER for an oscar-worthy fantasy film, and have finally been given our masterpiece. From beginning to end, the film rocks! Casting is outstanding, highlighted by Ian McKellan's portrayal of Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen's vigorous turn as Aragorn. Sean Bean, John Rhys Davies, Christopher Lee, and Elijah Wood also turn in excellent performances. While not complete unknowns, it was nice to see a director who refused to cast morons like Keanu Reeves, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Freddie Prinze in roles they have no business being near. I could only imagine what 'LOTR' would've looked like if some Hollywood lame-o like Joel Shumacher or Speilberg got their grubby paws on it.
The action is well-paced, not overblown yet not slow either. The plot is set up well, and the storyline is COMPLETELY understandable and sensical. Enough of the book is put into the script to flesh out Tolkien's world, without being overly talky. Special effects shine as well. The Balrog is incredible, the Watcher is fearsome, the scenes with the wraiths while Frodo is wearing the ring are macabre and surreal, the battle in the Mines of Moria with the orcs & cave troll is awesome, as is the army of orcs Saurumon raises. The scenery is lavish and fantasic, most notably Rivendell and Moria.
The sound on the DVD is great. My widescreen, 5.1 Dolby Digital disc actually sounds like DTS through my home theater system! Extras are nice, if some are a bit repetitive. If you must have the collector's set, by all means go ahead, but the widescreen DVD is all most of you will need.
Peter Jackson is an extremely underrated director, and deserves more acclaim. While churning out gems like 'The Frighteners' and 'Dead Alive' in apparent anonymity, he needs to be heralded for pulling off the seemingly impossible: making 'LOTR' into a brilliant film experience. Forget 'A Beautiful Mind'. If the clowns in Hollywood weren't so averse to straying from the predictable, 'LOTR' should've garnered 'best picture' & 'best director' along with its other 4 awards.
'LOTR' is a masterpiece, a brilliant fantasy epic. This is, no doubt, the best film I have ever seen in my life, and certainly the best film in the near-barren wasteland of the fantasy genre. It blows 'Gladiator' away, hands-down. A must-own film!",1031270400,,2813,4.974522292993631
1320725,4,B00003CWT6,"The answer is ""no"", of course, but this film gives it a great try and perhaps it comes as close as one can get to the spirit of the book. This is the tale of a long journey, immersed in much history and folklore, and, of necessity, sometimes it feels a bit rushed. Plus, some of my favorite parts of the book are left out of the movie, like the visit to the house of Tom Bombadil and the story of Sam's horse. These things would ""humanize"" (and that term is used loosely when discussings Hobbits, Elves, Dwarfs, and Wizards) the characters more, but much ""humanization"" is cast aside to leave more time for swordplay and action, which is what brings people to the theaters in this day and age. What amazed me is that the look of the movie is much the way I visualized things while reading the story. And a great story it is. Despite not quite living up to the book, as impossible as that is, I'm looking forward to the next installment.",1031270400,,936,4.293785310734464

1320727,5,B00003CWT6,"Holding people spellbound was what J.R.R. Tolkien did best by writing a story that had thousands of years of back story and multitudinous cultural short stories that surround it.
Peter Jackson's translation of it to film is very good.  When I originally read the books, I never caught the relational nuances between the characters, but this film painted for me a portion of the story that I had an inability to visualize.  The weight of the burden carried by the main character of the film is masterfully exposed in the film as opposed to the book, where, if I recall correctly, Frodo simply states that it is wearing on him.
In translation, Jackson expanded on the sketchy vision of the ethereal world that Tolkein laid out for his characters who wear the One Ring.  In the film when Frodo places it on his finger, he is instantly immersed in a parallel world in which spirits have substance and the world he left behind is but a faint shadow.  A violent wind constantly blows across a stark black and white terrain, and the nearly blind and shrouded black riders are revealed as ancient shining kings.  I do not remember Tolkein fleshing this out as well as Jackson does.
The book and the movie place a great deal of emphasis on the Ring.  But what the movie does that is subtle, but laudable, is to de-emphasize the portrayal of power bound in all the other unusual objects in Tolkein's fantasy.  Instead, Jackson integrates their mystical powers with the characters who carry them, never bothering to point out the inherent qualities of the character versus that of the item they carry.  (I do not have room in this review to please the purists who would argue about the sword of Isildur and the light of Galadriel).
In short, it expands Middle-Earth (the world setting of the books and the films) into one of flesh, blood, and tears while letting the mysticism seem less otherworldly.
However, if you just don't get it (morality plays in a fantasy setting), you won't like it.",1031184000,,1981,4.672413793103448

1320729,2,B00003CWT6,"I regret that I seem to disagree with most of the professional reviews and ordinary mortals on this film. I agree that this movie is faithful to Tolkein's book, that Elijah Wood and Ian McKellan are well cast as Frodo and Gandalf respectively as are most of the other players and, yes, the effects & cinematic vistas are epic with the bad guys being really frightening.
Unfortunately despite all these good ingredients we still ended up as a movie that I found rather flat. Perhaps it was the need to faithfully cram the whole book into 2+ hours or the sheer effort of working with the 9 player ensemble constituting the ""Fellowship of the Ring"". Regardless, my experience was that while the scenery and effects are gorgeous, I ended up lying on my couch waiting for everybody to hit their mark and say their line. Somehow I found the drama inherent in the book lacking. Also, other than Frodo and Gandalf, none of the character relationships really seemed to develop. Especially disappointing is the apparent loss of all but the most superficial treatment of the development and evolution of the relationship between Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf.
For me the best part of the film was a comic throwaway line by Gimli during the escape from the mines of Moria that I certainly don't remember as part of the Tokien text. It was a welcome relief to the otherwise unyielding seriousness of the film. And, more to this note, the worst parts of the film for me were when Pipin and Merry were on screen. There characters struck me as rather more sophomoric and stupid rather than the boisterous and charmingly naive young hobbits I expected. The needed comic relief I expected of these two never materialized. Worse, it seemed that badly needed light moments were replaced by clumsy displays of oafishness and stupidity.
I'm hoping that ""The Two Towers"" will be a better effort as we can now leave character development behind us with the gaggle of characters that was the ""fellowship of the ring"". I own the DVD of LOTR and I console myself in the fact that I received 7 free movie rentals from the store from which I purchased it. Otherwise I would have regretted my purchase even more.",1031184000,,2188,4.685714285714286

Although, I must agree with some others that the movie was lacking something.  Not being a fanatic and wanting basically the whole story to be conveyed in the movie (In which case The Fellowship movie alone would probably have a play time of 10 hours), I do feel that some certain scenes should not have been excised from the movie.  All in all, adding these scenes would have only made the move 5 minutes longer, AND A LOT BETTER.
Still, I feel that it is a very well done adaption of the book, and the plot of the movie cannot truely be judged until the other two parts of the trilogy come out.
PS. I rather liked the ending to the Fellowship of the Ring.  Despite what others may say, it gives a sense that not everything turns out like what we hoped for.  Not all books, or movies have to end,""...and they lived happily ever after.""",1031184000,,985,4.326086956521739

Plus it has some Fox and Learning channel shows that featured the making, but stuff I've already seen.

1320770,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson in his masterful Fellowship of the Ring has succeeded in raising J.R.R. Tolkien's lifework almost to a Homeric status.  Homer: the Literary Colossus whose powerful refrains were echoed and reverberated and expanded down the generations by future literary giants, such as Aeschylus, Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare and Goethe.  The film version of the Fellowship of the Ring is the first great echo of Tolkien's work. If Tolkien is the ""Homer"", Jackson may be the aspiring ""Aeschylus.""
Purists and fanatics may complain and carp about this or that -- about the absence of Bombadil, or the altered dialogue and sequences.  But lets face it -- this thing is now beyond Tolkien, the publishers and us all.  We are witnessing the the nascent birth and expansion of Mythos.
Everything about this film rings true to the text.  The setting for the Shire and the Middle Earth lands through which the characters travel is exactly as I had envisioned it in thirty-five years of reading.  The character performances are astonishing -- especially that of Sir Ian McKellen, whose nuances of mood beutifully illuminate the role.  Above all, the undergirding moral vision of the work is also true to the original.
Some other random thoughts:
1.  Jackson has boldly expanded the possibilities of filmmaking.  Perhaps we now know how the first audiences of Sophocles felt, as he added a third actor to the Greek drama-thereby tremendously increasing the dramatic possibilities of the medium.  The bold move to shoot all three films at once, the stunning visual effects, Jackson's loving attention to detail, all extend our vision and increase the capacity of the film medium itself.

2.  What makes Tolkien's work so powerful is that it is a Text with Context.  Most other works of fantasy are as thin as air, but Tolkien's lifetime of loving labor bestowed on the Silmarillion has given the Lord of the Rings a depth and substance unparalleled in literature.  Jackson's film adaptation both draws upon and expands this rich bedrock of context.  The unbelievable efforts at realism in every detail are all in harmony with Tolkien's approach to his work.",1031184000,2,2144,5.051136363636363
1320771,4,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings is one of the best known fantasy stories of all time, and here is finally in a production that can do it justice. Most of the scenes are done brilliantly, using the beautiful and well-chosen landscape of New Zealand, which captures Middle Earth excellently. The cast was also well chosen, with especially good performance by Ian McKellen as Gandalf.
There is only one quibble that I have with this movie: the old axiom ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Events were drastically changed during the chase on the way to Rivendell. The original version (which did not introduce the elf lady until after the chase) was much more gripping. Also, an element of mystery at the beginning of the story was lost... the original made certain that we had no clue what was going on until the Council, where we finally get the whole story.
Ah well. It's still so utterly great that I would strongly reccommend buying it, as a DVD or a video.",1031184000,,948,4.549707602339181
1320772,3,B00003CWT6,"Tolkien's name is not on it because the Tolkein family took it off when they realized just how many changes Peter Jackson was doing to it.  Many Tolkien purists are alarmed at the additions and changes and cuts.
Sure you have to cut something. I agree. But why do you have to add things?  Why do you have to change things?  This is a masterpiece your talking about here.  You don't hand the Mona Lisa to Hollywood, they will put a gun in her hand and have her blow stuff up.
Some key things were changed:  Frodo does not let people play with his ring!  He doesnt drop it or toss it around.  He rarely takes it off his neck.  The ring is possesive.  Gandalf never touches it, he doesn't even want the temptation. That's just one thing that bothered me.  Frodo often clutches it in the book, but under his shirt. Glimli does not attack it with his axe?! Galadriel has a ring of her own but you wouldn't know it watching this movie.  By the way she has one of the Elven rings which is shown breifly at the beginning of the movie. Arwen does not save Frodo at the river crossing. I could go on.
In these days of MTV and short attention spans and snappy commercials, I would have liked to see the movie paced out more.  Its a long and difficult journey, not a car chase scene.
  Its supposed to be a very long adventure with action at certain parts. Its about bravery and strong friendships and betrayals and fierce enemies. You get to know the land and the people and you feel as though you are there, inside Middle Earth. The movie was lacking in these areas.
Having said that, I must admit the casting was excellent, the effects mostly good(some computer effects were odd), the sets and scenery very good. Acting was decent.
So I loved it and hated it at the same time.  It put me into middle earth, but it was certainly not quite the middle earth I have previously visited.
See the movie, but PLEASE read the book!  The Lord of the Rings is perhaps the best adventure tale ever written.  Even when you mess it up when making a movie, some of Tolkien does come through.  So 3 stars from me.",1031097600,3,2088,4.283163265306122

1320774,1,B00003CWT6,"It's sad how people rave about how 'good' this movie is.  I've seen it twice - once in the theatre and once at home.  The time at the theatre, I think that my mother had more fun watching my facial expressions (Shock, dismay) than from the movie; and the only reason I watched it the second time was to prove to my father that it barely even followed the storyline.  Mind you, both me and my father have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (My father has read the book anywhere between 25-30 times in the past years, possibly more; and will read it many more times in the future, same as I will).
Throughout the whole movie, my father was steadily swearing at our television and saying,""THAT'S NOT IN THE BOOK!""  There is barely any relation to the book, as I have already said.  Some examples are:
-It said nothing about Frodo moving to his other house before he left on the quest.
-It skipped Tom Bombadil entirely, which I found highly annoying.
-At the inn, Frodo did NOT mention that he knew Gandalf.  He also didn't disappear for no reason either.
-Arwen did NOT save Frodo, it was her brother.
-Etcetera, etcetera, I can go on forever.  And that's only, let's say, the first half of the movie?
And there are people who hate the movie and have NOT read the books, refusing to do so now because they think that the book is as bad, or worse, than the movie.  And it scares me even worse to see the people that have read the book say that the movie follows the book to a 'T'.
Poor Tolkien is rolling in his grave by now, poor man.  It's sad that such a classic should have been butchered so badly.  I will most definately NOT see the following two, nor let my father see them for fear that he would most likely destroy the television.

1320775,5,B00003CWT6,"Alright, I agree: there dozens or even hundreds of alterations from the first book here. IN the scope of TOlkien's imagination, it would be almost impossible, even with one three hour film made for each book, to put everything exactly the same say.
So, Jackson and his pals were forced to make some choices. First of all, being this a fantasy film and knowing a lot of people who did not read the book would see the movie, they chose to increase pace and action (so, of course, the songs and the Tom BOmbadil chapter were the first to go...). Other than this, let's not forget that we'll have a four-DVD edition coming in November, with an extra 30 minutes of new scenes edited into the original movie.
THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is so touching for one simple reason. It's clear that everybody involved did their best, with respect for Tolkien's work. It's not like when you're going to shoot a super-gero adptation, for example, and the studio hires a hot-shot director who, sometimes, never even read a comic book from that hero. No. Here, the case is totally different: JAckson, the director, wanted to shoot the movie desperately: it was a deram, and HE went after the studios for backing him up.

Even though they could never get everything in the movie that was in the book, I felt they did a superb job in covering all the main events.  I did not go to the theater until I heard the reviews, not wanting to ruin my love of Tolkein and of course after seeing it in the theater, I pre-ordered my copy and have watched it several times and am currently re-reading the book again.

1320777,3,B00003CWT6,"I had great hopes for this movie, although I only vaguely remembered the books (I read them back in the 60s I think). However, I was quite disappointed. It dragged on and on, with an endless parade of monsters which, though showing off the film makers' incredible technical special effects skill, did not move the plot along. It all became tedious and unrelenting, taking itself far too seriously (with almost no hint of humor to break up the 'suspense'). I was tempted to fast forward through some sections merely to ""get on with it.""
Also, since there was not even the barest attempt at character development, I found myself wondering why anyone would care who got the ... ring!
Granted, it was an immense challenge to please both the ""Ring"" fans who know the story inside out, and those of us who have only a slight recollection of the story line and characters.
Obviously, I'm in the minority here!<G> But I'd have to give this one a thumbs down.",1031011200,,950,4.627218934911243

1320837,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is very well done.  I think it's better than the book personally.  The story is about a young hobbit who is swept to a world of horror and danger.  How he is swept to that world is, his uncle Bilbo, had found a powerful ring.  Bilbo was leaving on a ""holiday""  just after his birthday party.  He left the ring there for Bilbo.  The wizard Gandalf told Frodo the horrible past about the ring, and told him to go o a quest to destroy the ring in the only place he can, Mt. Doom.  His two clumsy Hobbit friends come with them, Gandalf told them he would them later, thus begins this great movie.
  The special effects are amazing.  That's a really good way to make the story clearer and alot more interesting.  This movie has some humor, but it's not to funny.  The writing is excellent.  This is definetly a must see.",1031011200,,826,4.245161290322581
1320838,3,B00003CWT6,"If I were to describe this movie in a word, it would be ""fluff.""  ""Lord of the Rings - the Fellowship of the Ring"" is full of eye candy with dazzling cinematography, costumes and makeup.  It also has some fairly good action scenes.
Unfortunately, this is all there is to this movie.  The plot is so convoluted as to be impossible to follow.  One has the feeling that the film makers were trying to adapt too much story for the amount of movie time, and they broke a lot of simple rules in so doing.  Potentially interesting characters come into play for only a scene or two, then are never seen again with no explanation as to what happened to them or why they were written out of the plot.  It is impossible to follow the names of the characters as they are not spoken often or clearly enough in the dialogue.
Which leads to another problem with the film:  The sound. Watching the movie on DVD, I felt like the guy in the hearing aid commercial sitting with his wife in the movie theater,constantly asking, ""What did he say?""  Not only do the actors constantly mumble their lines, but the background music is so loud at times as to overpower the dialogue making it impossible to understand!  I found myself several times stopping my DVD and backing up to try to catch what had been said.
This also has to have among the top five *worst* endings of any movie ever made. I undertand that the producers want us to watch the next film in the series, but puh-lease! It would be hard to divulge the ending in this review, because ... there wasn't one. It was as if they ran out of film halfway through making the movie!
Generally a fun and pretty fantasy, but spoiled by the very confusing storyline divergences, choppy dialogue and complete lack of character development. Not since ""Dune"" have I seen a movie that I had such a difficult time following.",1030924800,,1848,4.443786982248521

The acting, directing, and cinematography was outrageous, i really don't understand why it didn't sweep the oscars, it was ten times better than ""a beautiful mind"". The ensemble cast was terrific, i especially liked Viggo Mortensen as Aragon, and Ian Mckellan as Gandalf. Even the smaller roles, like Legolas, played by Orlando Bloom, and Galadrial, portrayed by Cate Blanchette, were so well acted. This is a movie choc full of wizards, fire-breathing monsters, and elves, yet somehow the world of Middle-Earth was totally believable.  I usually hate fantasy movies, i mean, ""Harry Potter"", what the hell was that?? But honestly, this movie was sublime, everything about it was perfect. i think 50 years from now, it will continue to blow people away, just like it has to me..",1030924800,,1015,4.734463276836158

1) Legolas doesnt have two knives.
2) Legolas has long boots.

1320843,5,B00003CWT6,"I know there's a serious debate on about this film across the internet and beyond.  My thought is that the movie stayed as close to the original book as it could, and remained true to it.  Yes, there were alterations (some large), but if after you see the movie and think a moment, these are alterations which I don't think could have been gotten around.  Bilbo didn't leave with dwarves, nor did they meet the elves until Elrond's house.  Tom and the Barrow-Wight were removed, as well.  The movie already ran over 2 hours, and if they're stayed 100% true to every detail, one book could have been a trilogy in itself.  More elves, dwarves, side storylines etc. would have been truer to the book, but that would have meant more people, more make-up, sets, props etc. and in the movie were they really needed?  Bilbo leaving the Shire alone with a song on his lips may have not been the original book, but it was just as effective on film.  Radagast the Brown's part was removed, as was Tom's.  All of this, however, basically streamlined down the plot, while actually remaining as true to the story or more so than most movies I've seen.  Stephen King's books and movies are oven very dissimilar.  Bram Stoker's Dracula became a love story instead of keeping Dracula as the devil incarnate which he was in the book, and even blended in parts of Vlad's real life.  The list goes on and on.  I disagree it could have been from another book, and I reread the novel after seeing the film.  I saw it more as simply taking out parts which weren't utterly critical, adding screen drama where appropriate, and making it slightly more exciting as a movie.  The book, too, is full of poetry and song, which had Bilbo or the others paused to go into all of that, I fear the audience would have been bored.  In the book, it fits and works fine.  The film is a masterpiece, and I rank it the best made this year.  The cinematography is outstanding, with ariel effects which swept you through scenes like a roller coaster.  Middle Earth becomes a living, breathing, utterly believable place you feel you've stepped into. Other tiny details, such as Elrond's dark hair, are attended to in the film.  This is as much of a white knuckle-grab the edge of your seat action film as the original Jurassic Park, and if you've never read the book, it will keep you guessing like the Matrix.  Much of the dialog is taken directly from the book, as well, in many cases word per word.  The characters are all excellently acted, the special effects are superb, and the make up was, to my eye, flawless.  In short, I highly recommend this film, to be seen as a movie, not something which is going to be word-per-word from the brilliance of Tolkien's novel.  In addition to the movie, I'd have to recommend the novel, if you just can't get enough of Middle Earth and want to read the ""blanks"" which were cut out.  That was, after all, where it all began.",1030838400,,2926,4.485822306238186
1320844,1,B00003CWT6,"This film is devastatingly disappointing. If you have ever read the book, you know how wonderful it is. The movie is a mishmash of Hollywood ...and terrible writing and acting.
The screenplay has very little to do with the actual story; much is invented (very badly) and of course nearly all that Tolkien wrote (character development, story, motivation)is left out.
The characters, so lovingly and complexly rendered by Tolkien are reduced to one dimensional B-movie stereotypes.
Gandalf is ridiculous. No power, no wisdom, no subtle grandeur. He is Shemp in a ""Soggy-Bottoms-Boy"" false beard.
Frodo is a perpetually wide eyed wimp devoid of courage or wit. Just awful.
The other members of the ""fellowship"" are rendered as idiots.
The rest of the cast parts are poorly written and even more poorly acted.
Lots of pointless action, none of it scary or exciting. Just expensive.
When given such wonderful material with which to work and what is obviously an enormous budget, the makers of this film should be ashamed of themselves.
This film is an utter failure and must be regarded as one of the worst adaptations ever.
I'm giving my copy away. To someone I don't like.",1030838400,6,1169,4.939086294416244

This was an awesome spectacle  and a beautiful film. The characters were well drawn and the action nearly non-stop. Was it faithful to the book? I don't know and sure don't care. It was a fine picture, the best fantasy epic I've ever seen.
Harry Potter needs to go home. This is real fantasy, not the flavor of the month.
Even if you don't like fantasy films, see this picture.",1030838400,3,538,4.2745098039215685
1320846,5,B00003CWT6,"Generally I'm not a fan of fantasy novels and I must admit to never having had the urge to even try to read JRR Tolkien's epic books, written decades ago. Nor have I read the likes of Terry Pratchett or JK Rowling's Harry Potter books, although I must admit to a childhood appreciation of CS Lewis.  A few years ago when I read that they were making The Lord of the Rings into a trilogy of movies and my favourite movie magazines writers were wetting themselves with excitement, I thought `so what?'. Director Peter Jackson (Heavenly Creatures) didn't have that much of a track record, sword and sorcery was definitely not my thing and besides I'm an adult and I thought that kind of stuff was for kids. That was until December 2001 when I first saw Lord of the Rings; Fellowship of the Ring and was blown away by this cinematic masterpiece...
So what can you say about Lord of The Rings that hasn't already been said? In my view in 2001 there were two great and I mean GREAT movies made, Lord of the Rings and Moulin Rouge. BUT did Oscar recognise either movie? Of course not because Oscar prefers mediocrity, Oscar prefers cynically made I've got a disability and I'm going to overcome it movies. The problem with Lord of the Rings is that nobody had a disability. None of the major characters was blind, autistic, schizophrenic or could paint with their left foot, and everybody knows to win any of the major Oscars you need a major disability, you need to follow a formula and you need to be popular and previously unfairly overlooked by the Academy for the best work of your life. Then eventually it will become your turn if it happens to be politically correct that year and if the movie studio spends millions of dollars on a publicity campaign. The fact that Lord of the Rings was perhaps the best movie of that year and outstanding Directorial achievement was apparently inconsequential to the Academy but then why should that surprise anybody?
The Lord of the Rings starts by explaining the history of the rings, how they were forged, how the forces of evil were defeated and how through the greed of man the one ring that could control all survived and eventually ended up in the possession Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), one of the diminutive peace-loving hobbits who live in the Shire. On the occasion of his 110th birthday Bilbo, overcome with wanderlust, sets off on a journey across middle earth and at the behest of the good wizard Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), he entrusts the ring to his young nephew, Frodo (Elijah Wood). However, it is not long before the forces of evil are in hot pursuit of the ring, led by another wizard, Saruman (Christopher Lee), under the influence of the abominable Sauron, the evil force that originally created and controlled the ring and that previously had plunged middle earth into darkness. This leads to Frodo having to flee the shire to the elf city of Rivendell, with three of his fellow (and rather mischievous) hobbits for company, hotly pursued by Sauron's evil cloaked nightriders. On eventually, and not so safely, arriving at Rivendell and after much debate it is decided that the ring must be destroyed, in the only place possible, in the fires of Mount Doom (where it was originally forged) and the quest to destroy the ring sets out in earnest, with a multi-nationed (although apparently not multi-racial) fellowship of wizards, Hobbits, elves, humans and dwarves. Once again however, danger is not far behind in the shape of the hideous and unbelievably ferocious Orcs and in the hearts of the fellowship themselves.
Parents beware!!! The Lord of the Rings is punctuated by action scenes that lift the tempo of the movie and get the audiences adrenalin flowing but they do feature some a lot of violence - torture, mutilation, decapitation, death and I have to say that I was very surprised at the rating given to it in the UK, which allowed very young children to see it. For this is not a children's movie and despite it's mythic, swords and sorcery basis, it is certainly not Harry Potter.
At the heart of Tolkien's story is that evil and hatred lurks in the heart of every person and that the ring draws these feelings to the surface and apparently, much of Tolkien's inspiration behind the moral tone of Lord of The Rings was the rise of the Nazi's prior to and during the Second World War. Hence, unlike most great mythological quests where the object is to attain some great treasure or object that will provide its bearer with some great power or wealth, at the centre of the Lord of the Rings is the quest to destroy an object of great power in the fires of Doom in order to vanquish evil and bring peace for all eternity).
Although a posterior-numbing (nearly) three hours long, at the end of The Fellowship of The Ring I was left frustrated and desperate for more. I wanted to stay seated and for the movie theatre to immediately start showing the second part of the trilogy, The Two Towers.  I didn't want to have to wait a year for the sequel or eight months for the DVD, such was my enjoyment of this movie. For Peter Jackson has achieved what supposedly could not be achieved in providing us with a fast-moving and totally enthralling tale, set against the beautiful backdrop of the New Zealand landscape; snow-capped mountains, beautiful lakes, rivers and valleys, idyllic farmland, great expanses of woodland and beautiful and exotic flora. The New Zealand tourist board will forever be in his debt. The sets and special effects are all excellent, as is the cast magnificently led by Sir Ian McKellen as the great wizard Gandalf, who does a magnificent job steering well clear of the ham. He is brilliantly supported by the likes of Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Sean Bean, Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin and in particular (in what might well be a breakthrough performance) Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn (aka Strider). Whilst Frances Walsh's screenplay must also be given much credit.
Like many millions of other people across the planet I eagerly await the second part of the trilogy, The Two Towers. As for The Fellowship of The Ring it fully deserves five stars, if not six (five stars are all too often too easily dispensed by Amazon reviewers). Movie entertainment doesn't get any better than this and if you disagree, then you are entitled to your opinion. It is just that on this occasion your opinion happens to be wrong!!!

1320917,5,B00003CWT6,"This was undoubtedly the greatest movie that I have ever seen! Every thing about it was absolutely amazing. Some of the actors have, for the most part, have never been heard of, yet they delivered extremely good performances. Peter Jackson did a great job on the movie and only used special effects on what would enhance the movie, not detract from it. He also did not just enjoy playing around with the special effects, unlike a certain George Lucas. Another thing is the cinematography was excellent, and the scenery could not be paralleled. Yes, though Jackson could have includued more from the book, I am partially grateful he didn't, due to time reasons. If you have not yet seen the movie find a friend that has it or buy the movie! It is not a waste of money or time, despite what others say. This movie is simply amazing!",1030752000,2,830,4.577181208053691
1320918,5,B00003CWT6,"INTRO:  First of all, I would like to point out that this DVD is spectacular (the Widescreen that is), and a movie of this calibur deserves it.  Second, I would like to point out the length of the movie...yes, everyone knows its about 3 hours long (and if you don't, then now you do) and most will be a little bored if you're not familiar with this movie or J.R.R. Tolkien's works.  The book was long, so the movie is too.  If you are a total action nut, then maybe this isn't the movie for you.  You have to understand the beauty as well, and at least have matured your movie expectations beyond Fast and the Furious and Matrix.
--------------------------------
PLOT:  The plot of the movie...is well...unique.  If you are familiar with the prequel to this movie/book ""The Hobbit"" then you are at least somewhat aware who Gandalf and Bilbo are and why they have such a long-lasting friendship.  Also, you'll be familiar with the magic ""ring"" Bilbo discovered when he was younger if you watch The Hobbit.  But anyways, the plot of this movie switches the view from Bilbo to Frodo, his grandson.  This movie (Fellowship of the Ring) is the first in the trilogy of the ""Lord of the Rings"" and don't expect everything to be wrapped up in just this volume...although a lot will be explained.  Without ruining too much, this movie is about discovering the true purpose of the magic ring that Bilbo discovered o' so long ago.  I would rate the plot top-notch for fantasy, and extrememly well-put for any other plot line.
The scenery in this movie is to be noted.  It was filmed mainly in New Zealand, by Peter Jackson...so there is a lot of beautiful mountain ranges and such to be seen...you'll hardly believe its just on one area of the planet.  A lot of computer generation and ""blue screening"" is used as well to make Hobbits and Dwarves look smaller than their environment and peers, but this is high-rate computer generation (a rare thing today) so you won't notice and it'll keep you guessing on how they did it.
--------------------------------
DVD:  Ok, now that I got through most of the plot (even though it would take me a few pages to go through everything I wanted to) now I should mention the DVD itself.  I, myself, bought the WIDESCREEN EDITION which is superior to the FULL SCREEN EDITION in almost every aspect.  You get to see more of the screen, and its not shrunk down to an annoying level to make viewing difficult.  The menus on the DVD are magnificent and I couldn't have thought of a better one myself, but there is one minor minor beef with it though.  On the first disc (the Feature Disc), there is an ""extras"" option in the menu, but when you select it you are given a message saying ""Please Insert Disc 2"", which kind of makes you wonder why they even put it on the first disc to begin with.  I don't care really so its no biggy.
--------------------------------
EXTRAS:  The extras aren't really ""super-abundant"" but the ones that are there are pretty cool and are worth mentioning.  There are a few TV Specials that are pretty interesting and a lot of little clips that tell how they made the movie.  Also some actor interviews and some trailers.  People complain that there isn't a ""Two Towers"" trailer, but you can see just about everything the trailer has to offer in the ""Behind the Scenes of Two Towers"" preview... (Two Towers is the next movie in the trilogy if you didn't know).
--------------------------------
OVERALL:  Overall, I would only recommend this DVD if you are just a fan of the basic edition of the movie.  Why do I say this?  Well, even though the movie is 3 hours long, they still removed a lot of essential stuff from it.  If you are a hardcore fan of the movie that needs all of the cut scenes and 2 discs full of extras (including the Two Towers trailers), then I would wait for the ""Extended Edition"" that is coming soon.  The Extended Edition will be 4+ hours and will bear 4 total discs to get its point across that this movie definitely gets what it deserves on home video.  The Widescreen Edition is only for people that want the short version (as long as it is) of LOTR.  All in all...GET THE EXTENDED EDITION in November!!",1030752000,,4181,4.542056074766355
1320919,5,B00003CWT6,"This is easily the best movie I've seen in years. The scenery is a visual delight and the characters are well-acted too. Ian McKellen is best-suppoering-actor nominated as Gandalf. While he is certainly good, I think it's the dimunitive Hobbits that steal the show. I read the book years ago. In all the details I can remember, this movie is an accurate retelling. It should make Tolkien fans out of some who haven't been before, though I wouldn't call it a substitute for the books themselves. But it is a must see for those who are fans already, and it can be considered a wonderful supplement to the original. Often I find movies based on books I've read to be visually disappointing, but this made Middle Earth even more visually stunning than I had previously imagined. I'm sure many of us will be eagerly awaiting the sequels.",1030752000,2,832,4.666666666666667

There is no way the worthy director, Peter Jackson, could possibly have crammed all the material and events down to the last detail into one movie. The only changes in the storyline were made to shorten the movie, and even then it is quite long enough at about 3 hours. Why, the only important change was that they left Tom Bombadil and Goldberry out of the script. Other than that, what a marvelous job! One of the best movies I've ever seen. Nothing could possibly surpass that book, but nothing could surpass this movie either. A true work of art, made with tons of effort and research. Buy it.",1030752000,3,738,4.514925373134329
1320921,5,B00003CWT6,"The lord of the rings are arguably the best fantasy stories of all time. The movies are equally remarkable. BUY THIS MOVIE! The DVD has tons of special features, not that I needed any other reasons to buy this masterpeice.",1030752000,,222,4.575

1320923,5,B00003CWT6,"Prior to this film, Director Peter Jackson was obscure even among the anonymous wannabes of the film industry.  His resume consisted of a half a dozen indy films in the horror and comedy genres.  If you took the budgets of all his prior films together, they wouldn't equal his salary for this franchise.  He now owns the second highest grossing film in history.  Talk about a Cinderella story!
This film was somewhat of a personal obsession for Jackson.  It took eight years from inception to completion.  He originally pitched the idea to Miramax who agreed to take it on and then balked at the cost of a two movie deal and backed out.  Desperate to save the project, he presented it to New Line Cinema and convinced them that if he filmed in New Zealand, used his own effects company and filmed all three movies back to back, he could make three films for less than the cost of two.  They bought the project and gave him a record $270 Million budget for the three.  He completed the filming for all three films in 16 months of continual shooting, a record.
Jackson's task was daunting.  He wanted to create a film with mass appeal that was true to the classic books.  Considering the devoted following of Tolkien's trilogy, their preoccupation with the smallest trivia and the sheer volume of the works, this was an almost impossible task.  Jackson decided to lean toward the action/adventure elements, while paying homage to aficionados with scenes that compressed the intricacies of the various cultures and contained allusions to various pieces of trivia that only devotees of the books would understand.  The result is a terrific film that doesn't leave the books out of the screenplay.
The transformation of the real world into the fantasy world is nothing short of fantastic.  The combination of makeup, set decoration, costumes, New Zealand locations and special effects sets a new standard for this or any genre.  The attention to detail is astounding from the elf ears to the hobbit toes.
The ensemble cast does a fine job without any need for a superstar.  Elijah Wood is lovable and believable as the dauntless Frodo.  Wood has the perfect combination of childlike exuberance and steely resolve to play the ring bearer.  Ian McClellan, who is a big ring fan himself, is perfectly cast as Gandalf.  With almost 40 years in TV and films, McKellen is one of the veterans of the cast.  He is a powerful dramatic actor and he renders Gandalf with great range.  He is formidable and commanding in some scenes, and tender and paternal in the scenes with Frodo.  Along with Christopher Lee (55 years in film) the battle of the elders is given enormous dramatic power.
Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Aragon.  Mortensen demanded to do all his own stunts and trained exhaustively at swordsmanship and other combat skills to make his fight scenes as realistic as possible.  In one scene he had a tooth knocked out and after a quick trip to the dentist he was back on the set later that day.  Ian Holm is wonderful as Bilbo Baggins.  Holm captures the ageless hobbit with a youthful enthusiasm that belies his advanced age.
This film is really more the first episode of a miniseries than a film that stands alone.  By the end it is clear that we haven't yet reached the middle, even if you never read the books.  Still, at three hours, it never drags.
It is a tremendous filmmaking achievement that redefines the fantasy genre and sets production standards that will be difficult to equal.  It is fabulously entertaining for audiences of all ages.  One cannot see this film and not be eager for the next episode to be released.  I rated it a 10/10.  It is motion picture history in the making.",1030579200,9,3692,4.702492211838006

This movie does not disappoint.  The music, story flow, camera angles, music, locations, special effects (did I mention the music?) all combine with superb acting to enchant anyone who loves movies.

1320965,5,B00003CWT6,"With all the praise this movie has been recieving, I am not sure what more I can add, but I do feel that I have to voice my opinion. The movie deserve every bit the praise. It IS a masterpiece, and it is already a classic.
I admit that I was sceptic going in to watch the movie, after all I have read the book countles times, I was thinking: This has to be a letdown. How wrong I was.
Let me start with the surroundings. They are perfect. They actualy hit exactly how I imagined The Shire, and later on Bree and Moria, I had not thought this possible. Everything is worked on to perfection. The clothing, the weapons, the makeup. The casting too is formidable. Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo, and Ian McKellen simply IS Gandalf, no doubt about it in my mind.
I actualy feel that there has been no wrong steps in this part of the movie at all. Everything works in a greater harmony.
Another thing is that the movie follows the book very closesly(with a few exeptions), the storyline has only been altered slightly, and the scenes that has been cut out, has been chosen carefully. The cut out scenses from the book, are not of monumental importance to the main-plot.
The only real alteration is the motives of Saruman, this is understandable though(I shall say no more in case some of you have not seen the movie).
Most importantly I feel that Peter Jackson catches the mood of Tolkiens books very well, this is where it CAN go wrong, even with a 100 million dollars to back you up. But Jackson make Tolkiens universe come to life in a very unique way.
The movie might have a bit more emphasis on action than the books, but it is not a flaw.
All I can do is congratulate everyone working on the movie for doing a splendid job. If the sequels are as good as this, then we got a trilogy-classic on our hands.",1030579200,,1805,4.296187683284457

I was not dissappointed at all.the stunning New zealand landscapes mingle with the amazing but not completeley over the top CGI effects (Attack of the clones take note) to create a very real fantasy world of middle earth. The attention to detail,and faithfulness to books as far as I can remember as well is outstanding. The characters allthough I admit did we really  need that many? all play the parts well,not to over top or hamming it up at all,even old hands christopher lee and sir Ian Mckellen manage to play it fairly straight. The excellent score rounds off the stunning adventure,niceley prsented in crsystal clear anamorphic widescreen.the only reason not to enter the world of orcs,goblins,hobbits,beautiful elves(especially liv tyler and cate blanchett!)and many other creatures is if you cannot stand fantasy adventures at all.

Peter Jackson has accomplished what everyone thought was impossible - bringing Tolkien to the screen in a way that does Tolkien justice.
I am quite impressed with the DVD version. I purchased it knowing full well that most of the good stuff was probably being saved for the Extended Version. I felt that the picture quality was far superior to the quality of the version I saw in the theatre. There were many places in the movie where I felt it was a bit blurry, and grainy. The picture quality of the DVD was decidedly clearer. And the sound! I can honestly say that my couch was vibrating and the neighbors banging on my door!

1321007,5,B00003CWT6,"For once, I'm very pleased at what filmmakers have done in translating a book to movie, especially one that is beloved by so many people.  We have a situation here where several things come together in a positive synergy:  the state of special effects, the desire to finally bring it to the screen in the epic proportions it deserves, and the money to bring it all together.  It was also a brilliant move to shoot all three episodes at once so we don't have to endure as long a wait as the Star Wars endeavors.
Practically everyone who is a huge fan of the books will probably be miffed that some of their favorite parts are missing.  While understandable, these folks should appreciate that just the first installment is just about three hours, with two more equal installments coming.  By the time this thing is done, there will be about nine hours of first-class filmmaking to enjoy.  For myself, who read it twenty-five years ago in college, I choose to look at this as a special treat that one should be appreciative of.
I'm very impressed that they could tell the basic story as well as they did.  Sure, there are a lot of subleties that would make a truly complete filming run over twenty hours, but basically it's about a shrimpy guy that has to drag a ring accross a magical land and throw it in a pit.  To create all the different types of creatures, good and bad, who are involved was a monumental effort.
Most of my past movies reviews here ride high on cynicism in the way they tend to pull cheap shots just to get your dollars.  This time there is no such cynicism.  Sure it's gonna make a lot of money, but here is the rare example where the makers of the movie truly seem to love making the story they are telling, and wanted to deliver the best possible product possible.  I congratulate them for doing just that.",1030406400,4,1830,4.432835820895522
1321008,5,B00003CWT6,"Jackson and new line Cinema give Tolkien's work the justice it deserves. The first volume in the trilogy really gets the juices flowing and I eagerly await the next.
I do not consider mysel a real tolkein fanatic. In fact I found the books a bit heavy, particularly Tolkien's penchant for describing the geneology of his fictional characters. But there is no doubt that Tolkien created such a believable world, that I almost treat this work as an piece of historical fiction.
Jackson's movie has a faster pace than the book while still remaining true not just to the spirt, but  to the letter of the books too. True Tolkien grognards will find flaws, but I enjoyed the attention to detail that Jackson lavishes. This is where the DVD excells as you can go back and look for fresh stuff in each viewing.
My only compaint is the blatant merchandising. They are releasing two versions of the DVD, one with 30 minutes of cut scenes. I found this a bit much. One DVD with all the extra material would have been much more logical.",1030406400,2,1024,4.565217391304348

The movie just went on and on. The song at the end of it should have been Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On and on ... and on some more. I'm not saying I was bored by the movie. I actually thought it was excellent. I haven't read the books so it was completely new to me. The characters, story, setting was all beautiful. Perhaps I enjoyed this movie so much because it's the first and only fantasy movie that was done well. I'm a fan of the ""Final Fantasy"" games and this movie is how I would expect one of those games to be made into a movie. Not like the horrible ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" movie. Anyway, I think this first movie gives out a little too much information. Being new to the story I had to get used to the odd names of towns and characters and then I had to pay close attention to the story and what was going on. The ending is really disappointing because you're left hanging without knowing what will happen next. I understand this will be in the second movie but still it's a bit of a downer.

There simply is no way to do the books in movie format without cutting some things.  That being said, what is here is almost all fantastic.  The movie never got its fair shake from the over weight and overpaid critics, however, to those who grew up on the books, this is like coming home and being on a holiday.  My only real complaint would have to be that it was too short.  But then we have the extended version coming out in November, and with a little luck, Jackson will catch Lucas' mania and give us the ten hour version in a couple of years.  ;-)",1030320000,4,729,4.2086330935251794

Well I say, just ignore the detractors and judge this movie on it's own merits.  You will find it hard not to list it as one of your favorite movies of all time.

Elijah Wood was charming as Frodo, and Ian McKellen as Gandalf the wizard is remarkable as only he can be.  Viggo Mortenson bravely plays Aragorn helping Frodo on his quest and is superb and a delight.  Other performances that must be mentioned, as brief as they are on screen, are Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett both hauntingly beautiful and unforgettable. With characters all so endearing and likeable and visual effects and scenery that will blow you away, I now can't wait for the second of three installments to come to the screen.  Not at all what I expected!  I watched with intense curiousity and thrills and chills and even some tugs at my heart strings......though long, the time went by, and when it was finished and the credits rolled I found myself wanting more.

1321073,5,B00003CWT6,"Yes to all of the above.  I was one of the people who just couldn't wait the extra three months for the extended version of the DVD.  This movie is one of the finest motion pictures ever made.  Frodo Baggins - a Hobbit (a race of halfling creatures with big furry feet who eat no less than 6 meals a day) -  his friends and Gandalf the Wizard begin the quest to destroy the One Ring of Power.  The ring is in the possession of Frodo, who must cast it into the fires from which it came before it proves to be the undoing of Middle Earth.  What makes The Fellowship of the Ring a masterpiece is that it has the feel of history - a deep, long history.  Peter Jackson's direction and the actors' portrayals give these mythical characters something missing from most action and fantasy genre films - emotions.  Sadness, joy, romance, and bravery to the point of sacrifice.  Emotions that move you to tears and emotions that move you to cheers.  The DVD package provides plenty of extras, and unless you are a fan of extended versions and ""Making Of"" documentaries, this may be all that you need.

1321076,5,B00003CWT6,"Despite being an avid AD&D role player, and able to write it, I am not a fan of fantasy literature. I have owned one of the many collected printings of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but have never been able to get more than a hundred pages into it before Tolkien's dry writing style got to me and I would put it down in order to read some Heinlein, Smith or Niven instead. Thus when I found out that Peter Jackson, the same man who brought us such epic splatter-fests as Bad Taste, Brain Damage, and Meet the Feebles, had begun production on the entire trilogy, I was curious. The only person to have ever attempted this before, Ralph Bakshi, had made a mockery of Tolkien's books with his half baked attempts to render them to the big screen. Jackson on the other hand, even when he was making his gross out movies, had always been a brilliant technical director and I began to wonder how he would handle a project of this magnitude.
While I was eager to see the end results, I didn't have the sort of emotional investment that so many Tolkien readers have. I have friend who have read the trilogy over and over so I was curious as to what his responses would be. There are also those fans who, no matter how good the film(s) would be, no matter how exacting they were, would hate them, either just because or just because it didn't fit their vision of what it should like. Or even because they feel that they should never be made into movies. What Jackson has done here is something special and I don't just mean in the technical sense. It became clear to me that he had taken great care to surround himself with craftsmen and artists who understood the books, he even went so far as to hire the two artists who had conceived so much of the later book art to craft much of the three film's final look. Having now seen the movie several times and reading through the first of the many art books, I can honestly say I doubt anyone else could have done a better job at bringing it to the big screen.
The Fellowship story is rather simple, but it's epic on a grand scale. Three thousand years ago, during the first age, the Dark Lord Sauron, servant of the Morgoth, had forged 19 rings of power and leadership, 3 for the elves, 7 seven for the dwarfs, and 9 to the race of men- all of the rings were controlled by a 20th ring, forged from metal from all of the others. With this ring Sauron could rule all of Middle Earth. A last alliance of men and elves raised an army and at the foot of Mount Doom, near Sauron's fortress of Barador, defeated the Dark Lord and his army. And it was here that Isildur took up his father's sword and sliced the ring from Sauron's hand, defeating the Enemy. While I felt the opening battle sequence could have been longer, it firmly ingrains the might and power wielded by Sauron. What it doesn't show is Sauron is just a pawn of Morgoth? Who is Morgoth? Read the Silmarillion and find out.
As history fades to legend then legend into myth, the ring of power passes from Isildur's after he is slain, lost for centuries until it is found by the creature Golem, the magic of the ring extending his life for five-hundred years until he loses the ring and it is found by the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Enter Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), a wizard who learns from Bilbo that he has The One Ring. However, after his 111th birthday party, Bilbo uses the ring to render himself invisible after a speech, then retreats to his home to gather his things. He has kept it a secret for sixty years until he decides that he tired of everything, simply wanting to finish a book he is writing in peace and quiet. He leaves everything, including the ring, to his nephew Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), then departs to live out his days with the elves. It then falls to Frodo to bring it to Sauron's realm of Mordor and cast it into the fires of Mount Doom, for that is the only way it can be destroyed. There is more, but I won't attempt to lay it all out for you here- buy it, rent it, but SEE IT.
My favorite character is probably Legolas (Orlando Bloom), even though he didn't have a whole lot to say, I liked the portrayal of the elven archer as being a total nightmare to anyone on the receiving end of his bow shots. Legolas does no less than 8 god-like trick shots as well as using arrows as melee weapons. He is also the only Tolkien elf that I can stomach. I much prefer the idea that elves are happy-go-lucky types living for the moment, not the doom and gloom sourpuss elves who are leaving the land- a concept that several fantasy authors since have emulated and why I think so many people dislike elves. Sean Bean's Boromir is likeable as the tragic self-sacrificing knight and Viggo Mortenson as the hell-on-wheels Ranger, Aragorn. More importantly, I loved the easy affection shared by the hobbits, and Gandalf's love for these peaceful folk.
Still, I have to laugh at those so-called `Tolkien Devotees' who scream and wale about what an `atrocity' or `abomination' has been wrought by Jackson. One reviewer was aghast at the concept of a playful elf. Yeah, let them all be miserable and depressing. And because people may have actually liked this film, they have to become personally insulting. So what if he didn't follow the Fellowship chapter and verse as it was written, there is such a thing as artistic license in this world or does it only apply to whatever medium you happen to be touting. Who cares if Arwen had a sword and washed away the Ring Wraiths with a spell? Maybe you can devote 5 years of your life and two-hundred million dollars of your own money and make the trilogy only you can enjoy. I'm sure having Ian McKellan on screen for twenty hours as he reads the book to the audience would be infinitely more exciting.",1030147200,4,5762,4.385981308411215

I have my own 2 disk set copy on Region 2(PAL)(available from amazon.co.uk) - but I'm here to give a different but very, very important perspective - my ""patriotic spin"" if you'd like, and as a service to all Tolkien devotees and ""LOTR"" fans.
Something that has been sadly amd sorely overlooked (even by his own countrymen!) is the fact that Mr. Tolkien was very much South African! Yes folks, a South African! We truly are a surprising bunch, aren't we? He may have lived much of his later life in our Commonwealth ""mother country"" England, but he was born in the city of Bloemfontein in South Africa. In fact he started writing the first drafts of the ""LOTR"" saga here in Eastern Cape region of South Africa. It was while spending time in a region known as the Eastern Cape in a hamlet known as ""Hog's Back"", that Tolkien became inspired. It is well known (here) that the mountains, lush wild forests and rivers around ""Hog's Back"" very much provided the template for Tolkien's ""Middle Earth"" environs and back drops. I suggest all true Tolkien and ""LOTR"" devotees to make the trip to the forest village of ""Hog's Back"" in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa and come and see for themselves, the only and true inspiration for ""Middle Earth"".
Also of note, is that ""The Tolkien Society"" are based in his old birth town of Bloemfontein, S Africa, and they do, I beleive, run tours of his birth place and other places of his youth etc. I'm happy to assist where I can, as I fellow ""LOTR"" and more importantly, as a fellow countryman of Mr. Tolkien, if anybody would like to contact me.

See my review of Harry Potter, I talk about how I am not a fan of the genre, but I really enjoyed the movie. Well, things didn't work the same in this situation.  The movie has an amazing performance by Ian McKellen, who is a consumate professional actor. He takes the craft seriously, and he is a truly amazing talent and I love to watch him.
I actually did like this movie to some extent, but it just kept going on and on and on and on and on.... It just didn't do anything for me, the first hour was good, It had me interested in wanting to know more of the story, but it just dragged way too much. I was stunned by the visuals, they are just breath taking.  It is a beautifully filmed zonker. Sorry, but this is my honest opinion, and we are all entitled.
I have never read any of the books, and I never plan to as I just can't get into this genre of book or movie.
This is way too long! It's over three hours. Drink some coffee and don't watch this too late.

1321080,4,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring is finally out on DVD - but for those who want to get the 'real' version of the movie, one must wait till November when the Special Extended Edition comes out.
However, this DVD is adequate for those who just cannot wait. The trailors are interesting to watch after seeing the movie (you notice just how much footage of deleted scenes were used in them) and Enya's music video captures some of the more poignant momemts in the movie, played in slow motion to her beautiful voice. The 'behind the scenes' clips are also interesting - you can see just how much work went into the movie - for example Orlando Bloom practicing his archery, the hobbit-boys going through dialect coaching and the metres of fabric that went into creating each Ringwraith costume. Big time fans of the book and movie probably caught the documentaries - 'Quest for the Ring', 'Welcome to Middle Earth' and 'Passage to Middle Earth' when they were on television, but they're also included just for completions sake. The preview for Electronic Art's video game is a bit tacky however - it comes across as a bit too much of an advertisement, and the mere idea that Tolkien's epic actually *is* a video game is something that makes me wince.
But now on to the juicy stuff - what most people were waiting for was the Two Towers preview. Although some people speculated (or hoped) it was another trailor, it is in fact a behind-the-scenes preview in which Peter Jackson explains some of the storyline, the origins of the title, introduces us to some of the new characters, and the creation of the special effects (in particular the incredible battle at Helm's Deep, and Gollum, which Peter describes as the most actor-driven CGI creation ever). However, don't despair - there is some footage that has never been seen before, and though some are marred by the presence of cameras and crew members in the scenes, a precious few are actual movie shots.
What many people weren't expecting however on this DVD was a preview for a second version of the 'Fellowship', which has approximatly thirty minutes of deleted scenes actually incorporated into the movie, along with their own original musical score. These glimpses are perhaps more enticing than the Two Towers preview, which include Sam and Frodo witnessing elves departing Middle Earth for the Grey Havens, Aragorn at his mother's grave, Gollum floating downstream on a log, Pippen and Merry partying at the Green Dragon Inn, the Fellowship departing Rivendell, the famous Galadriel gift-giving scenes, a few quiet scenes of Frodo talking to both Gandalf and Sam, and a lot more fighting footage in both Moria and Amon Hen. No doubt most of these scenes, which seem to mainly include serene, restful moments, were unfortunatly sacrificed to speed up the action.
Do what I did: RENT this version, and save your money for the four-disc Special Edition, which not only has these scenes, but over four hours of extra footage. You have been warned.
As for the movie itself, what can I say that hasn't already been said? There are some prunes out there who disliked it (I had a skim through the one-star reviews) but in most people's eyes, whether they be Tolkien fans or newcomers, Peter Jackson and his people did a masterful job of creating a movie that contained both  traditional Tolkien and fresh new ideas.
Of course, it is inevitably diminished in its transition from movie to television screen. Scenes such as the Balrog simply *cannot* have the same effect as when they were towering over you at the movies. However, scenes of imtimacy are still as effective, especially since the viewer has the power of rewind in their hand to explore all those extra details you didn't notice at the movie theatre - which can be as subtle as a glance from one character to the other (ie. when the Fellowship first meets Galadriel). I also strongly suggest watching the movie at least once with the subtitles on - you'd be surprised at how much dialouge you may have missed when you were preoccupied with other characters - such as Gandalf arguing with Boromir at the disrupted Council, Merry and Sam fighting over the mushrooms, and the Ring itself - which has a surprising amount of dialouge for an inanimate band of gold!",1030060800,,4261,4.781546811397558

1321082,5,B00003CWT6,"'The Lord of the Rings' remains one of the most cherished pieces of literature of all time.  It is a classic, and is also, fifty years later, one of the best selling novels of all time.  Upon first seeing previews for 'The Fellowship of the Ring', I admit to being skeptical.  It seems that drama, wit and human emotion, for the most part in cinema today have been replaced by explosions and eye candy.  Admittedly, there are a few contemporary exceptions, Braveheart and Hart's War among them, but, for the most part, there never has seemed to be a middle ground, a ground where battles and violence can link arms with character development and still come off as being an excellent story.
The first part in this epic trilogy did it superbly.  Peter Jackson's masterpiece brought back memories of the novels, making me immediately reread them and relive the wonders that almost every child has experienced with these books.  What impressed me the most about this first installment was the fact was that Jackson's vision was not MTV friendly, and by saying that I mean jazzed up to appeal to a contemporary audience.  There was far less Dungeons and Dragons expose' than I expected there to be, and much more richness.  The story was not touched, which was wonderful to see, the score by Enya and Howard Shore was magnificent (and the soundtrack is worth the buy), the sets and special effects are some of the finest since Terminator 2, and the acting was fantastic, most notably by Viggo Mortenson and Sir Ian MacKellen.
Certainly, there are epic scenes of action and violence, sometimes on a seemingly R-rated scale, but somehow, Tolkien's themes of friendship and honor seem to shine through every second of this film and make you eager for the second chapter of this grand trilogy, and especially the third.  Brilliantly adapted, finely directed, flawlessly acted and divinely scored, this film will be remembered for generations to come, and not just because it retells one of the finest stories of our time, but because it opens new doors for cinema.
It is the 'Jaws' and the 'Star Wars' for the new millennium, as no one has seen, or ever will see again, anything as brilliant in terms of what makes a fantasy epic so great.",1030060800,,2230,4.741602067183463
1321126,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay. Where do I start? Here. I have only read The Lord Of The Rings one time. Was it good? Yes. Do I care that things have been trimmed from the book? No. Why, you ask? Because this film retains the spirit and feeling of Tolkien's work and is vastly entertaining on it's own. Even with a lot of things cut, as they had to be for a three hour film, this thing is a grand achivement on a truly epic scale.
The acting- This really got to me. Everybody here did a great job. Ian McKellan (Gandalf) and Christopher Lee (Saruman) just OOZED with a great chemistry and screen prescence, with Gandalf wise and sometimes funny, while Saruman is dark and cunning and utterly ruthless. He had an air of power and command that Christopher Lee pulled off VERY well. Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) was appropriately regal though her part was not as big as the others. Everybody else fit just right. The emotion was genuine and did not feel forced. The dialogue worked extremely well and was delivered convinvincingly. I also loved the fact that the characters SPOKE Elvish with subtitles, rather than speaking English with made-up and funny sounding accents. It made the words feel more real to me. It gave it the air of a real language.
The Special Effects- These were incredible. Especially considering  that all three movies were shot with a $ million budget. That's $ million per movie folks. Yet they make worlds and characters and locations and things that are 100% believable. I will NOT compare this to Star Wars Episode II or say that it was better effects-wise. The biggest comparison I will make is to put them on par with and equal to each other. They are each THAT good, and each is an example of absolute mastery of the craft of special effects wizardry.  They are two different movies, two different stories, and depict different things, therefore they need different elements. The important thing is that each film convincingly takes you to another world and draws you into a very engaging and emotional story. From script to screen The Lord Of The Rings is an excellent achievement.
The Music- Kudos to Howard Shore for making this score. From first note to last it is beautiful. It expertly dances between tense and dramatic, to lovely and ethereal, to rousing and adventurous and back again. The use of the choir work here is brilliant. It really adds to the emotion of the scenes on the screen. Also, though I personally prefer the music of Enya's cousins (Clannad) to that of Enya herself, I cannot deny that Enya made a beautiful contribution to the score of this movie. It is an absolute masterpiece. I think that while he is not John Williams, Howard Shore has earned the right to be favorably compared to him and put in his illustrious company by the merit of this breathtaking musical score. I look forward to more from him in the future.
  In short, if you love or even just like fantasy films, you cannot go wrong with this one. It is a visit to a breathtaking world, filled with aventure, humor, tenderness and suspense. It has something for everyone. I LOVED this picture and you just might love it too. Peace and God bless you. Enjoy it. Happy viewing. :)",1029974400,,3169,4.613475177304965
1321127,4,B00003CWT6,"The film speaks for itself, so I won't comment on it. I will comment on the DVD features and extras that come with the film on this, the extended version (""director's cut"").
First, the extra scenes really add much to the story line. The best of them (the following is a spoiler, so if you don't like spoilers, stop reading now!) in my opinion, is the extended scenes from Lothlorien, which follow the book more closely. The gift scene I thought inestimable and am surprised it was thrown out of the theatrical version (also, where's Sam's box of dirt?). We see a more ethereal Galadriel, but there's also times where she appears more ""down to earth"" than before (ie, when she laughs).
I also thought the scene between Boromir and Aragorn on the side of the river at night VERY important to the story simply because it makes Boromir's death-bed confessions to Aragorn more pertinent and meaningful (""our people... my king""). I'm also surprised that scene was tossed.
For those that do not know every scene by heart of the theatrical version, you may not notice but the extended version is slightly more violent (the head uruk-hai actually licks his own blood from the knife that Aragorn stuck into his thigh before he throws it back at Aragorn). There are extra shots of Legolas dumping off arrows (at great speed - was that CGI?) at the uruk-hai, and the final battle of Boromir and Merry/Pippin is somewhat longer and more violent.
The extra disks are great; they far outshadow the extra CD on the theatrical version (which I feel was just a teaser for the extended cut). All of the methods of making the hobbits appear smaller are explained (CGI, forced perspective, miniture doubles, etc.). I especially thought the interviews with the sound crew especially insightful (the cave troll's inhales were taken from a tiger, the chuffing exhales recorded from a lynx, and the moaning from a walrus; The Watcher's vocal was also recorded from a walrus; the Balrog's vocal was recorded by dragging cinder blocks across the pavement and then slowing the sound down). VERY GOOD EXTRAS ON THE BONUS DVDs.
The only complaint I have is that the film is on two disks. This problem arose because of the extensive audio tracks and commentaries. Frankly, I think the audio commentaries are overkill because one can learn from the bonus DVDs everything that is said in the running commentaries. They probably could have just kept the film on one DVD with only one or two commentary tracks and allowed the viewer to learn from the extra DVDs. (This is especially perturbing if you watch this film in a DVD player that only holds 1 disk).
All in all, I recommend picking this set up and throwing your old theatrical version up for auction.",1029974400,,2723,4.746835443037975
1321128,5,B00003CWT6,"The movie was excellent. I had read the book (3) times and whatever the movie could not fit in length of time I remembered and filled the details in myself. The characters were captivating and you were drawn to them. Each had their own individual strengths that pulled you through the movie and left you with the need for more.
Within the ""Relm of Man"" .. we are allowed to escape for a little while through movies and the magic of the Lord of the Rings allows this happen.",1029974400,,473,4.325842696629214

I cannot wait till the second film will come out and also the Special Extended Edition of the movie. The score by Howard Shore is one of the best I've ever heard.

1321130,4,B00003CWT6,"Firstly the Dvds extra disc really seems a non-event, for the ammount of useful material it could and should have been fite onto one disk, there was a lot missing, and it seems to serve the purpose of flogging the next 4 disc set and the next film, the documentary was ok, but frankly extras lite.
On first watching at the cinema i was distinctly underwhelmed and the film really didn't make much of an impression. On watching the Dvd ive got used to this translation so could relax into it a little more.
The biggest annoyance by far is merry and pippin, they have become bumbling prat fallguys, and even the music whenever they start providing sideshow relief is cringing, this is not such a good traslation to say the least.
Unlike some i found Legolas one of the better played parts, along with Sean Bean, who i was hoping when i read the original casting was going to be Aragorn, he would have been so much better, mind you Hugo Weaving as Legolas would have been a big improvement, but i welcome his prescence as Elrond, even if hes underused.
The computer effects work overall but some time a litlle unsubtle. The sets and costumes are mind blowing, and the New Zealand locations are perfect, Hobbiton hit the nail on the head for me, if only the hobbits were played with a little less twee comedy, we really don't need light relief Mr Jackson.",1029974400,,1351,4.495934959349594
1321131,4,B00003CWT6,"First off, I want to say that I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would and found it better than I'd expected, with wonderful special effects and a clear attempt to be faithful to Tolkien's structure and plot. This was not just another Hollywood vehicle but a serious effort - from the casting to the script. So credit is due for that much.
But I still found some significant shortcomings in the movie. I felt that the book's emotional and spititual essence did not reverberate through this movie. Perhaps this was simply because this was an ""introductory"" movie, one of only several to follow and the director felt that the plot needed to be emphasized. But I didn't find myself thinking about this movie for days nor did I find that it had an emotional resonance, the kind of resonance that makes you want to see the movie again and again (just as I wanted to re-read the books). There were a few words of wisdom that stood out but, for the most part, it seemed as though emphasis was given to action and adventures at the loss of characterization.
I know there are plenty out there who will disagree with me and I can certainly agree that Hollywood could have done worse. Elijah Wood is a warm and winning Frodo and others in the cast are equally appealing - to a point. But I urge viewers to think carefully about what makes a movie a classic, especially movies which have elements of fantasy. I'd argue that there has to be something enduring, a movie that goes beyond state of the art special effects and spectacle and gives equal weight to Tolkien's words, language and enduring soul. I didn't quite find that depth in this movie.",1029888000,2,1644,4.52013422818792

1321133,5,B00003CWT6,"I've long been a fan of Tolkien's Middle Earth and an avid reader (scholar?) of his works, including those published in memorium by his son, Christopher.  Let me say the following about this latest celluloid incarnation:
This is, by far, a masterpiece.  Other die-hards will no doubt lament the omission of tom Bombadil and select other minute details, but the seamless integration of computer animation, stellar acting, breath-taking scenery and pure genius of directing breathes life into Tolkien's world and doees justice to his long-standing classic.  While best viewed on larger television/movie screens (the bigger the better, I assure you!)  this movie will not fail to disappoint you.
Case in point: my wife never enjoyed the book, finding it boring and disagreeable with her tastes in literature.  After seeing this film in the theatres she is now hooked and reading my prized hard-cover edition voraciously.

1321156,5,B00003CWT6,"While Jackson is neither a true artist nor a madman (except for the fact he did undergo the tedious process of creating three epics in two years), he managed to successfully juggle all that is the recreation of a classic fantasy novel. While lacking that certain 'closure' of a stand-alone feature, and at times being a tad too tedious and slow, it successfully crams a great deal of Tolkien's work of the first part of the Lord of the Rings novel, the Fellowship of the Ring. For some reason, this movie just feels right. The cast, the props, the effects, etc.. they all feel appropriate and very well done. On this dvd set you get to see a number of featurettes which include interviews and numerous shots at the amount of armor and weaponry created for this film. The detail and work put into all of it is absolutely mind-boggling. Jackson definitely managed to go through a very long and hefty 'to do' list. The sets are also all great. Every room, every cave, every hillside, every pillar, every stream.. it's all great.
As Jackson mentioned in one of his interviews, he was afraid someone without the expertise in special effects would take a project like this. Sure, having started his film career with his home-brewn 'Bad Taste', having worked on all of it's effects and all of it's directing for four years on occassional weekends and days off... he sure has the patience and experience to tackle a project of this caliber and deliver marvelous effects without ever over-doing anything (except for Galadriel's power-hungry dark side scene, which was awful). Kudos to Jackson for a great movie, and kudos for the excellent dvd package which is all but lacking in features.",1029801600,3,1680,4.756849315068493
1321157,5,B00003CWT6,"Yes, the movie was a dream of cinematography.  Yes, they made mistakes, left out parts, made Frodo a bit wimpy.  But they did a great job on packaging this onto DVD.  Without watching the movie you can still spend hours being entertained by the cast members, documentaries, music and a great teaser for the next installment.
Taking a book like Lord of the Rings and making it into a movie is a major gamble.  There is no way to please everyone.  Putting in half the stuff they left out in the first movie alone would make it 6 hours long.  I am glad they're coming out with an extended version.  They have a teaser for it on this DVD also so I know I'll be buying it too.  Putting back some of the things left aside.  The things they chose to leave out or change sometimes leaves me wondering.  Having Arwen defy the Ringwraiths at the ford instead of Frodo takes away the watchers first real insight into the heart of a hobbit.  But I'm not a filmmaker.  I couldn't have made the decision to leave out Tom Bombadill or the barrow wights.  I'm glad I didn't have to.  I'm glad Peter Jackson got a chance to share his love of this story with the rest of us who love it too.
I highly recommend purchasing this DVD for your collection.  Even if you don't like fantasy, this film is beautifully composed, the countryside is epic, the action heroic and the characters... classic.  Even with the departures from the novel you can tell there was a love of the story in the director's heart.

1321158,5,B00003CWT6,"With the many, many reviews written concerning this movie, there is little for me to add. I saw the movie in the theatre, but being deaf, had to wait until this came out for me to really enjoy it. I read the trilogy four times when I was younger. They could not have done a much better job bringing this to screen, and I can hardly wait until the next part of the trilogy. Thank heavens Peter Jackson had the intelligence to wait until the technology was such that he could make Lord of the Rings as it is written. McKellen as Gandalf is superb, Elijah Wood has an unbelieveably poignant face and mannerism (I never thought much of him as a child actor, but then maybe it was the choice of scripts he got and the directors?). His sadness at having to do such a hard task alone is enough to break your heart!
Again, those of us with hearing loss enjoy films best when they are in letterbox format. The captioning that we need is then not interfering with the beauty and plot on the screen.
I plan to wait until all three movies are out, and then I will get the boxed version with all the outtakes. One thing I must bring attention to...is for once, all the outtakes, the specials, etc. are captioned so I can enjoy them with my hearing family members. I really wish members of the directors and film communities would figure out that captioning of all parts of the DVDs make it worth while for us deafies to buy the blasted things. I was horribly disappointed with The Grinch since only the film itself was captioned!!!!
I still maintain, if A Beautiful Mind had not been in the running, Lord of the Rings would have won much more at the Oscars. A truly beautiful movie.

You don't need to have read the book.  The story explains itself admirably as it goes along.  If there's something you don't understand, just be patient-- it will get explained eventually.  Yet it isn't overexplained either-- very little pure exposition.
I have only two complaints: (1) The movie is too short.  (2) In remastering the soundtrack to issue the DVD they made the music too soft in comparison to the dialogue.  One of the joys of the movie is the music, and there are times on the DVD where you can barely hear it.
Some people have complained that the movie isn't faithful to the book.  OK, yes, there are changes in detail, and some events have been left out.  Yet the net effect is to tighten up the plot and better justify some later events that otherwise seem to spring out of nowhere in the books.

1321163,2,B00003CWT6,"Quite simply it lacked the grandiose Tolkien-esque feel that even Christopher Tolkien's writing often has. The action seemed infinitely slower than the books, even slower than Robert Jordan's works. Difference is, that Jordan and Tolkien actually seem to have a point, this seemed pointless and like everyone stopped caring about 2/3 of the way through the movie. This wouldn't be so bad normally, but the fact that only the actors portraying the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn and Boromir appeared to care in the first place really turns the 'masterpiece' into drivel. Now admittedly, 7/9 of the fellowship doesn't seem to be that bad, but that doesn't include people they meet, most of which are portrayed either INCREDIBLY inaccurately (read Arwen with a sword) or with such a lack of emotion or even talent in acting that it's like they picked a guy up off the street, such as Saruman. The movie was made to a politically correct, semi-accurate, fantasy, popular thing. But that doesn't fly very well for two reasons. 1, it's LoTR, a CLASSIC and 2, because of people like me who love the fantasy genre more than we love almost anything else, who won't allow little things like Arwen having a sword, when she shouldn't because she isn't pure enough to grow the silver plant that the elves make into swords. But other than that there is the fact that it's a long film and FEELS like a long film. This actually would be an excellent film if it weren't supposed to be LoTR, but suffice to say that it is and shouldn't be. The last good fantasy film about a good fantasy book is and probably will be for a while yet Willow, because while Harry Potter was a good movie, it was an unreadable stupid childrens book, whereas this is an unwatchable politically correct stupid movie",1029715200,3,1770,4.731391585760518

If the clips shown for this are a true indication of what has been put back in, the extended version will include many of the elements that should have been there in the theatrical version to satisfy those of us that love the more ethereal, intangible qualities in the book.

As a result, I was hugely disappointed that I had purchased a DVD that I will want to throw away in 3 months - actually, I felt conned.

1321217,5,B00003CWT6,"Long ago, Sauron the Deceiver forged several rings to give to those who saught the power to rule, bringing them into a sort of alliance with each other.  Three were given to elves, seven to dwarves, and nine to mortal men.  However, Sauron did not tell the recipients that another ring was forged - one with tremendous power that he himself would yield.  One ring to rule them all!  But an alliance was forged once the treachery was discovered.  Elves and Men defeated Sauron.  The ring should have been destroyed, but the King of Gondor, Isolder, decided to bear it instead - to his doom.  After he was killed, the ring was thought lost forever, but (through a tumultuous series of events) the ring ended up in the hands of Frodo Baggins.  Realizing that the ring is indeed the One Ring and that it must be destroyed, a group of nine set out to bring the ring to Mordor.  There it will be cast into the flames from whence it was forged.  But the journey is perilous and many shall fall along the way.  And the ring itself, seeking its original master, will betray the Fellowship of the Ring.

I read these books, starting with the Hobbit, when I was about 8 years old. They were recommended to me by my dad. A true fan was born! So, I wasn't sure how true to the books this movie would be. But, then I saw a special about the making of the movie, and decided I had to see this movie. It seemed like Peter Jackson was dedicated to getting this movie right.
This movie is amazing! Peter Jackson makes a valiant attempt to bring the worlds of Hobbiton, Mordor, etc. as real to us as New York City, London, or any other real city. The actors do a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. You can truly believe that Elijah Wood is Frodo Baggins. We can witness first-hand the struggle of Aragorn as he is portrayed by Viggio Mortenson. And Ian McKellen is remarkable as Gandalf the Grey - just as I pictured him!
Of course, due to length constraints, the movie can't have every scene from the book. Frodo's journey prior to meeting Strider is cut rather short. However, it does nothing to hurt the continuity of the story. Also, Jackson has seen fit to give Arwen a much larger role. I say more power to you, Jackson. I always thought there was too little in the trilogy about the great Lady Arwen. The special effects are perfect and help to bring the magical story to life. I went to see this film with several other Lord of the Rings fans and we were all in agreement - This movie rocks!! I can't wait for the next part of the trilogy!",1029628800,,2689,4.3687374749499
1321218,5,B00003CWT6,"Many people will be turned of by the absolutely glowing reviews that this film has recieved, but don't be. It is all that they say, and more. Every actor is well chosen, the sets beautifully constructed, the music hauntingly sweet, the plot not tied to the novel, but not so loose that it loses it's way. None of the dialog is overdone, which is one of the problems sci-fi/fantasy has too often. It is quite simply the best film of the past 5-10 years.",1029628800,4,452,4.392857142857143
1321219,1,B00003CWT6,"If you have never read the book, or read it once and forgot it, or just don't care much about it, you may enjoy this film. It is beautifully made and has many fine qualities.
If you are a devotee of the books, have read them with love and understanding, if Tolkien is important to you....be prepared either to forget temporarily the plot which Tolkien developed or to suffer repeated great shocks and disappointments.
I have not the heart to go into a lot of detail, but I'll give just a few examples (for I do not want you to think that I object to the omission of the Old Forest and Bombadil--no, they had to go--or to some trivial change or deletion.)
Saruman is one of the few ambivalent characters in the book--a too-clever man who plays his own game. In this film he is just a tool of Sauron from the start. The subtlety of his character is destroyed.
Merry and Pippin start out as minor juvenile delinquents.  They join Frodo and Sam more or less accidentally.
Gimli is a buffoon.  Legolas hardly exists except as a machine-like archer.
Aragorn, in the film, does not want to be King--he has ""given that up long ago."" Really. I thought he had been spending his whole life preparing to claim his rightful throne. (I guess that's why, in the film, he finds the shards of Narsil in Rivendell rather than carrying the Sword That Was Broken with him.)
In this politically correct age, we cannot slight the ladies, can we?--and it's a long wait to get to Eowyn. So we'll just have Arwen show up at Weathertop to save the whole Fellowship with her sword and fast horse. Charming. This idiotic scene should please Xena fans, though it is a little disconcerting to see Aragorn reduced to being Gabrielle.
Elrond Half-elven. Ah. My favorite character in the film. ""Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale as a tried warrior..."" is how the Master describes him (I, 274). His appearance instead inspired in me an acute nostalgia, for he reminded me of some of the sorts of people I remember from my college days, who existed on the fringes of academe, usually by selling beads, incense, and other, less-legal things from basement shops in college communities. Ah, yes, good old Elrond Half-hippie. (I expected him to try to calm down the film's farcical Council by offering them marijuana.)
The final battle scene is a wonderful example of the director not knowing where to stop. The ""Boromir-as-pincushion"" scene(a.k.a. ""You can't keep a good man down"") goes from being appropriately tragic to inappropriately hilarious (will he get up yet again??), while Aragorn's dismemberment of the Uruk-hai leader makes one wonder if this Mortensen fellow should have starred in Gladiator.
Did anyone else notice the final music (when Aragorn talks to Gimli and Legolas)? I swear it's like something out of Braveheart--which is, I think, the film the director really wanted to make. I expected bagpipers to come marching up and Aragorn to cry ""Freedom!""
Not content with many extra-close close-ups of the Ruling Ring, the director decided it should say a few words occasionally, and recite some poetry (""Ash nazg durbatuluk,"" etc.)  I think the Ring has more lines than Legolas.

The Lidless Eye might be more effective if it were horizontal, not vertical.
Much more could be said, but not by me. Words fail. This ill-judged mangling of the works of a great author is very unfortunate.  There was no reason to change so much.",1029628800,18,3440,4.736227045075125
1321220,5,B00003CWT6,"The only way to summarize this movie is to look at it from a human point of view. The characters catch you, the script holds you and binds you to the story. I am not really sure if this movie will ever let the viewer go, or if the viewer wants to disconnect from it.
Legolas' bowmanship is awesome. I enjoyed the swordmanship, but there has not been a movie that ever showed the speed and graceful agility as Legolas with the bow.",1029628800,,430,4.192771084337349

I've already reviewed this product, and at the time I was all for Harry Potter, so I gave this a 1 and called it worthless and overrated and all of that. Well, it's definetly NOT worthless, but it may be a little overrated. But, beside that, this is a really great movie, though I wouldn't go as far as to call it an ""astounishing masterpiece"", but I would go as far as to say it's one of the best movies I've seen in quite some time, and is better than Harry Potter. The special effects are dazzling, the actors are amazing, and I would say that if JRR Tolkien were still alive, he would be very, very proud. The only mistake I've made is not seeing it in theaters.",1029628800,2,773,4.125827814569536

Having not read the books yet, I really can't sit back and compare the two.  The movie by itself is just so wonderful though.  All the actors do just a wonderful job of bringing to life all the characters of the genre.  I'm sure, like everybody else, I can't wait until the second and third films hit the theater's and the DVD racks.",1029628800,,445,4.325301204819277
1321223,5,B00003CWT6,"I heard that the Lord of the Rings was coming to theaters, and I saw that a lot of my friends were reading the book to know more about the movie. I only read the first three chapters of the book, but when I saw the movie, that was all I needed to know. I'm planning to read the rest of the trilogy soon...
The first thing I liked was the amazing special effects. The movie won an award for that, and I wasn't surprised. Everything--from the water horse stampede to the huge shadow/flame monster to the giant cave troll--looked astoundingly real. In movies like ""Jurassic Park"" and so forth, the monsters look like animatronics, even to stupid little kids. Um--right.
The second thing I enjoyed was the characters. They seemed well captured, as seen from the book. I really liked the strider-- Aragon-- and the others of the Fellowship as well. You really get to connect with them.
Also, since I didn't read the book yet, I never knew what was going to happen next. I liked this; it provides excitment. I was crossing my fingers in the battle with the orges... And I whispered ""yes!"" under my breath each time they defeated a monster or escaped a danger.
In other words, one really cool movie. It deserves five stars.",1029628800,2,1216,4.506787330316742
1321263,4,B00003CWT6,"This movie is wonderful. The attention to detail is incredible. I mean this is middle earth made real! The shire and Hobbiton are just as I imagined them.
Now one thing I really enjoy about the story of the Lord of the Rings: Magic is relatively rare. The story involves magic and the supernatural, but it's not used excesively. Most of the story is about the journey and the interrelationships between the characters.
The movie and the world created by Tolkien have this very real feeling to them. It's like the world actually exists. Different kingdoms and places have a rich history, language, and cultures of their own. Tolkien was a scholar and a lover of languages and history and it shows in the quality of his beautiful storytelling.
All to often these days adventure movies rely too much on special effects or violence and leave little to the plot or the characters. The Lord of the Rings is great storytelling and one of the best stories to come out of the 20th century. It's a classic that has stood the test of time and heavily influenced later fantasy writers and artists. Now this movie does have terrific special affects and some very violent moments but thankfully it offers much more than that.
Thank you very much J.R.R. Tolkien for this wonderful story.
Now why did I only give this movie a 4 star when I thoroughly enjoyed it to the point of feeling it deserves 5 stars?
Well it diverges from the novel on some points I felt it didn't have to. Yes I know you can't fit the whole story into 3 movies but still there are changes made to the storyline that didn't have to be done. Some changes wouldn't have made the story longer but seemed to be altered just because the movie script writers felt it would be better if done a different way.
I mean Ralph Bakshi's animated version of the Lord of the Rings covered the first book and a half of the Lord of the Rings, wasn't as long as this Fellowship of the Ring movie, yet was truer to the dialogue and the major plots elements than this movie!
The animated version made a few changes also but in this movie there were more of them!
At least I thought the movie version of Samwise Gamgee was better and I really liked Gandalf the wizard also! Now I thought the animated version of Strider/Aragorn was a better representation of the book character. Somehow I felt he should have been older than he was in the movie version. After all he was supposed to be weathered and older looking from his journeys and fighting in the wild lands he roamed through.
Now I hope at the end of the 3rd movie they just don't have Aragorn and Arwen live happily ever after because if you read the appendix at the end of the book of the Lord of the Rings, after Aragorn dies of old age he leaves Arwen to a very sad fate to die alone in Lorien after all the other elves had passed away from middle earth forever. I was very sad and cried when I read that. There she dies with only her memories and all that she loved had passed away forever. A bitter fate indeed. However since it's not in the story proper but only in the appendix it may not be in the 3rd movie.",1029628800,,3109,4.362068965517241
1321264,5,B00003CWT6,"I first read the Ring triology over 30 years ago and have revisited it many times since.  I was almost reluctant to see this film because of all the hype - I was afraid it would mar the mental images and visualizations of Tolkein's word I've cherished all this time. It was, therefore, truly amazing and delightful to me to see how beautifully and faithly made this movie is.  It's as if Peter Jackson read my mind (and the minds of everyone else I know who has both read the books and seen the film).  Everything is exactly as I'd pictured it.  Not only that, but my husband (who has never read any Tolkein) became equally entranced by the movie and looks forward to the releaese of ""The Two Towers"" almost as eagerly as I do!  Excellent, excellent movie.",1029542400,,756,4.410071942446043
1321265,5,B00003CWT6,"They said it couldn't be done--no one would ever be able to adequately capture Tolkien's majestic fantasy world on film. There was no way that a filmmaker could please both the fans of the books and the casual moviegoer. But somehow, someway, Peter Jackson has done it. This will remain one of the definitive fantasy films for generations to come, enduring as well as the books have. Every aspect of this film, from casting and acting to direction and technical details, is exquisitely and expertly realized. Jackson's literate script alters or omits parts of the book in ways that may upset some fans; the most noticable absences are the encounter with the Barrow-Wight and the meeting with Tom Bombadil. There's some foreshortening of events and time in order to keep the movie at a reasonable length, but the film's pace never suffers from it. The script also makes good use of Tolkien's dialogue from the novel, and I was very impressed with the seamless incorporation of some dialogue from the chapter ""The Shadow of the Past"" into Frodo and Gandalf's conversation in Moria.
""The Fellowship of the Ring"" manages to embrace the scale and scope of the greatest epics without losing touch with characterization or emotion. As a die-hard Tolkien fan, I had grown to love these characters over the years, and I was honestly worried that they would get lost in this massive production (usually the case with big-budget films these days). But Jackson and his incredible ensemble cast bring the familiar characters of Middle Earth to living, breathing life; for me, it was like rediscovering them all over again. The casting was perfect: Ian McKellan is wonderful as Gandalf, balancing wisdom and discipline with a welcome sense of humor; Elijah Wood shows the right mix of courage and vulnerability as Frodo; Ian Holm is delightful as Bilbo; Viggo Mortensen is a tower of strength as Aragorn; Sean Bean is dynamic as the all-too-human Boromir; Sean Astin, mixed accent and all, is perfect as the steadfastly loyal Sam. Jackson's script also does not compromise Tolkien's moral vision for fear that it would sound preachy or dated. Truth be told, we could use more of that these days.
Jackson's direction is an exercise in the art of filmmaking. Not a shot is wasted, nor does there seem to be a false moment in this film. The special effects are outstanding, even more so when one considers that they came from the relatively unknown Weta company; if you haven't seen the Balrog yet--prepare to be blown away! Only the cave troll looked a little fake, but I doubt that ILM could have done better with such a challenging effect. The film's best effect, however, is the visual trickery involved in making Wood and company look like they really are a few feet tall--this is done with some clever use of foreshortening, camera tricks, and forced perspective, plus the use of little people and overlarge foreground objects. It's utterly convincing, and an impressive job. The production design and costumes are also wondrous; Middle Earth looks and feels like I've always imagined it.
Like the great epics of old, this movie will endure as one of the most masterful examples of storytelling on film. For those who do not want the expanded DVD, this will serve more than adequately. Don't forget Disc 2--the quality of the extras in this DVD set rank second only to those in ""Citizen Kane.""",1029542400,,3382,4.873263888888889

1321270,5,B00003CWT6,"I love three-hour movies. I often hear about how Fellowship of the Rings (or the Green Mile, for that matter) was a long film. To that I say: no. Why? Because they used every second of those three hours. A movie can be twice as long at half the length if it is the sort that drags on. The Fellowship of the Ring does anything but that.
In Fellowship, director Peter Jackson has given birth to what I do not doubt is his life's work. Each scene, each shot is done with expert precision, and filled with touches, which were hardly necessary on their own, but add up to one of the most enchanting epics ever to grace the silver screen. As an example: at one point, Strider picks up a sword, and casts it to the ground. Had this been all, then there would be no complaints. Instead, the blade turns to dust in his hand. A little touch? Yes. But they add up.
This is not to say Fellowship is all about subtleties-that would hardly fit the grand epic. From the opening three millennia in the past, to the conclusion, the movie brims with adventure, fear, corruption, mirth, sorrow. It is almost as hard to offer too much praise, as it is to imagine a better adaptation of a beloved English language classic. It's been said before, but it cannot be said to much: New Zealand is Middle Earth if such a place ever existed
The Fellowship of the Ring also has some great acting. Gandalf (Ian Mckellan) is given the most acclaim (and an Oscar nod), but he is hardly alone. Ian Holm brings a machless performance as the aging Bilbo, almost corrupted by the ring and still tempted by its evil. Sean Bean's Boromir is the flipside; we see him slowly drawn to the ring. And Elijah Wood does an admirable job as Frodo, who knows his grim fate and does not fear to face it. If there was an ensamble cast Oscar (and there should be), this would take the prize.
However, there is one sad note: although I wish everyone involved in this film luck, I believe that The Lord of the Rings may be the occupational highpoint for all involved. Why?
Simple: what are the odds of anyone being in both Lord of the Rings and something even better?",1029456000,,2115,4.343434343434343
1321271,3,B00003CWT6,"My biggest criticism of the movie is that it tries too hard to be an epic, and as a result has its moments of grandeur, and unfortunately, its moments of stultifying boredom. I'm sympathetic to the problem the director ran into: keeping true to Tolkien's vast vision while making a movie that didn't sprawl for six hours. As someone once remarked, ""more about less"" -- I'm sure Tolkien fans would've have complained, but I'd rather irritate a few people than make a bad movie. Don't get me wrong -- I've read the Hobbit countless times, the Lord of the Rings trilogy several times, and finally I've actually read Simarillion twice (for this I believe I deserve significant financial compensation) -- so I don't mean to disparage Tolkien's vision. But to think that one can reproduce the magic of the trilogy by being literally faithful to the text is simply naive. In short, this is probably a good movie if you are a Tolkien fan, but a disappointment if you are looking for combination of action, drama, and special effects (well, they did this pretty well, except for the obscene ""eye of sauron"" -- what the [heck] were they thinking?).",1029456000,,1138,4.723618090452261

Probably one of the most debated issues from Lord of the Ring's junkies I know of.

Many times it was like Tolkein's words were leaping out of the book onto the screen.  I have waited for this movie for ages and it was all that I hoped it would be (I have the original VHS tapes of the Hobbitt and the semi animated version).  However the beauty and excitement of the movie could not completely wipe out the discomfort of the theater seats--the noise of the people munching and drinking (and talking).  Now I have the DVD and have seen it twice in the comfort of my home--and seen things that I missed before--the coffee got cold and the munchies uneaten--the 3 hours went so fast I could not believe it was over.  The special features on the second disk I could have done without since I had already seen them on the Web and the TV--except for the preview of the 'Two Towers'.

The only thing I was unsure of going into it was the expanded role of Arwen, and the fact that it was Liv Tyler playing her. Her performance, however left me enchanted, as did all the other actors. Peter Jackson chose his cast well; every actor suited the part perfectly.
There are some deviations from the book's storyline, but those I can forgive. A lot of them were because of time restrictions, and everything flowed evenly. There are times when I wish that there were fewer scenes with Saruman and the Uruk-Hai, but it lends more explanation for the events that come after.

I have read ""The Hobbit"" and thought it was a good read, so I hope to read the others.  ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is one of my new favorites, and I enjoyed every minute.
I'm not going to go into great detail of the story.  Chances are, you already know it, or at least some of it.  What was so great about seeing this movie for the first time and not knowing too much about the story, I was able to watch the story unwrap right before my eyes.  I was so suprised and in awe.  Let it be known, this movie is almost three hours long.  So expect that.  But, believe me, if you enjoy the movie, the time flies by so quickly, and you're left wanting more.
Well, since the story is well known by most, this review is mainly going to deal with the DVD itself.  It's amazing, despite that it's one I'm going to have to rebuy, since I want the extended version.  But someone made a good point, if you love the movie, why not have both.  Both DVDs are going to have special features.  Ones that appear on this one most likely won't appear on the other.  Plus, now you'll have two versions of the movie.  So, if you don't want to spend the dough but would very much like to see this movie without having to wait for the extended version to come out, the best soulution is to rent it, or borrow it from someone.  (If they let you!)
The picture was outstanding and breathtaking.  Just like being at the theatres.  It's crystal clear and enhances every little detail that comes about.  It is anamorphic widescreen, which made it look that much better.
Sound was pretty good.  Very loud.  Possibly the loudest DVD I own, and it's not even DTS!  My only problem is it is hard to hear the talking at some parts.  And just when you turn the volume up to hear it, a very loud action sequence pops out almost deafening your ears.  So, I had to fumble with the volume control quite a bit.  But, it really did sound great.  I just hope that you can hear the talking a little better on the extended version.
There are tons of special features.  There's a couple of ""making of"" programs, (I liked the one that was shown on Fox).  There is also a ten minute behind-the-scenes feature on ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.'  All I can say is that it's going to be amazing, and I can't wait for it to come out.
I regret watching the behind-the-scenes feature on the extended version of this movie.  Why?  Because before I watched it, I had it in my mind that I wasn't going to have to resort to re-buying this movie, because it was already a masterpiece in my mind.  Well....I watched the feature, and it looks like they left out some REALLY good stuff.  Figures!  Be warned, if you watch it, you will want to buy the extended version.
I'm sure there are more features I have forgot to mention, but those are the ones I have been able to watch or go through.
""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an awesome epic adventure that really did surprise me.  Is it a masterpiece?  Maybe not yet.  I thought so at first, but now I'm going to have to see the extended version.  Maybe the thirty minutes cut out of the movie makes it a lot better.  Hard to imagine how this movie can get any better, but it's something I'm anxious to experience and see.  This beginning to one hell of an epic is filled with danger, darkness, evil, and adventure.  A great movie, destined to be a classic, if not already.

It didn't seem three hours long to me at all.  The sheer imagery and the music had such effect on me that time didn't seem to be elapsing and I was rather surprised when I realized this movie was drawing to a close.
The best I can do is say that I personally feel this is the greatest fantasy or science fiction movie I've seen.  I know that there are those who will disagree with me.  There are changes from the novel and this is necessary, unfortunately, to reach the movie audience.  If you will notice, those few movies that cling to the source material generally fail completely to be good movies.
This time around, I won't go into great detail.  I will say though that this is a movie that everyone should see, if only to satisfy your own curiosity.  There's no other way you're going to find out if you like it or not than to go and see it.",1029369600,,1123,4.244131455399061
1321333,5,B00003CWT6,"Transferring a book to the screen is always a dangerous proposition.  Simply put, too much can go wrong, the two mediums are simply too different for most adaptations to hold up with any integrity.  Transferring what many consider the best book of the twentieth century to screen, well logically that should simply be an act of folly.  Tolkien wrote a deeply drawn story with passion and vision and these are things that transfer poorly to the silver screen.  As Roger Ebert noted ""The trilogy is mostly about leaving places, going places, being places, and going on to other places, all amid fearful portents and speculations"".  The books are also about the use and abuse of power, the ability of one soul to make a difference and the growth a person will and must undergo once they leave their home.  All in all, too much for a film of any commercial value or length to reasonably tackle, so obviously something had to go.
Largely what was changed was mood and tone.  While the books felt airy and gently paced as it moved its hobbit heroes through the bumps and hollows of Middle earth, introducing them to a wide breadth of that world's inhabitants, the film takes the central motivation, the threat of the one-ring and ties its fate to that frame alone.  As a result the core of the tale does shift from Frodo, to the fellowship as a whole, and the tone does move drastically and becomes much darker.  Contrary to much spilled ink however, this is not inconsistent with the book.  Middle earth has never been portrayed as a world in its prime.  The Elves are leaving/dying out, the Dwarves are merely a shadow of their former selves, Mankind is without leadership and the isolationist Hobbits have cut themselves off, possibly fatally, from the happenings of the world around them.  Into this stagnancy returns the corrupting power and strength of the one-ring, this is dark stuff, Tom Bombadil and musical trappings cannot hide this.
What remains is a darker, leaner narrative, but one that retains many of the key elements that make this story so worth telling in any form.  Never has the corrupting nature of power and the temptation it poses to all who possess it been so passionately and elegantly told.  Frodo's internal struggles, Gandalf's fight for knowledge and understanding, the conflict of the elves to leave and save the civilization that they have grown beyond but also formed, the tragedy and sorrow of the loss of a dwarf's entire culture, and need to use the enemy's strongest weapon against him and knowing that such a thing must not be done; these are all wonderfully rich stories and themes that any single movie would take pride in dealing singly with.  Fellowship tackles all of these vital threads and to varying degrees of success weaves them into a magical quilt that most intelligent observers said was impossible and could never be done. There IS magic in this movie, and it comes from its smallest moments; a gleam in Gandalf's eyes, a held-back tear in Frodo's eyes, the moment of understanding in Boromir's stance, the addiction of Bilbo, and the envy of Galadriel as she confronts Frodo.
This is all the stuff of legend and of magic, and as magic-makers nobody on this production has ever been better than they are here, Peter Jackson, Howard Shore, Andrew Lesnie, Ian McKellen all are hitting on all cylinders.  This is as close as film can get to fulfilling its potential as a medium while celebrating the achievements of another wholly different one.",1029369600,,3490,4.782029950083195
1321334,5,B00003CWT6,"Some have said that Fellowship of the Ring is the movie George Lucas was trying to make with Star Wars before he lost sight of his vision. While Star Wars is still a masterpiece as a whole in its own right, Fellowship of the Ring is the perfect epic fantasy adventure, with very few flaws. The only complaint I have is that some of my favorite moments from the book did not make it into the movie. Quite frankly I hardly noticed that the movie is as long as it is and would have happily sat through 6, or even 12 hours of a masterpiece like this.
 We all know the story, so I will not write a synopsis, but I will say that I feel that each character was casted perfectly, and even Liv Tyler performed brilliantly. The scenery and attention to detail was amazing, and how they went through great lengths to ensure that every culture of the different races of Middle Earth was also amazing. I watch this movie, and every time I see it I am in awe of the grandeur of it all. This movie is grand, sweeping and epic, and aside from a few minor technical glitches (Frodo wearing shoes in one scene, Gandolf in hiking boots in another) this movie is the fantasy film I have longed to see since I was a child.

1321336,2,B00003CWT6,"I say this because i love the genre/formula that tolkein was in large part responsible for creating. At the time this was written it was probably epic in it's imagination but the formula has been vastly improved since then.
  epic trilogies like ""THE DRAGONLANCE CHRONICLES"" or ""THE RIFTWAR SAGA"" far outshine this stale and tired story.
  By today's standards this story lacks imagination, the quest is far to linear and the charachters are one dimensional.
  It's like playing pong on your playstation 2.
  as far as the screen adaptation is concerned......I tried to like it and towards about the last half hour i'll admit i started to get into it.......but the movie was more than a half hour wasn't it!?
the movie is done well the producer/directors did a great job of breathing life into tolkeins characters...
the story is just not that interesting. it is worth a viewing and it is one of a very few ""FANTASY"" novel to movie adaptations.
  i believe the only good that will come from this film is that the myriad of people that scoffed at the fantasy genre or made fun of people who played dungeons and dragons might become open minded (but then again i am a realist).i know a few of you(and you know who you are) saw this....there are not enough of us nerds out there to support the kind of money this film has generated.
  watch the movie, if you are new to this genre you will probably love this film.if you are not new then you will probably think this movie is long but worth the rental.",1029369600,,1499,4.5315985130111525
1321337,5,B00003CWT6,"The beauty of this film is simply staggering.  As literature, The Lord of the Rings holds a unique spot in history as one of the first works to be considered Fantasy.  Though it is truly in the style of previous ""romance"" works, LOTR is one of the only books that truly delves into the sacred and mythical and comes out of the underworld with dignity and a lesson learned.  Peter Jackson and the entire crew of the film version have not hesitated to let themselves be taken away by this truly amazing story and have surrendered to the world that Tolkien created.
While the film is honestly quite bombastic and over the top at times, it is quite forgivable.  The story itself is not lost in the minor changes in adaptation, and the film makes up for it in it's ability to vividly re-create Middle-Earth into a colorful and alive place that I am not even capable of imaginging when I read the book.  The film also shortens the rambling tendencies of Tolkien and focuses instead on the story and the characters, bringing to light some parts of the book that may not be so clear.
This first Lord of the Rings film does what a film adaptation should do: it takes direct inspiration from the book and makes a masterpiece that is true to the original, yet stands on it's own as a brilliant and transcendently beautiful work of art.

1321340,5,B00003CWT6,"This film speaks for itself.  It is the definitive adaptation of Tolkien's work that will last for the next century or so.  The casting, the acting, the sets and scenery all work together to make this a perfect film.  Rarely does a book adapt so well to the silver screen, but Jackson has managed to work a miracle.
I recommend this film as the perfect segue into the books, where you get the full and complete explosion of Tolkien's genius, since you get the broad strokes of the plot and subplots, but are not bogged down in detail and language.  Seeing is believing!
The DVD has all the bonuses that we have come to love and expect, except that there are no deleted scenes.  On the super-deluxe version of ""Lord of the Rings,"" to be released in November 2002, a full half-hour of deleted material will be reintegrated into the movie.

They did leave out some items that I would have added but then the movie would be longer. ie: I felt that the gifts from the woman of the wood was not compleat enough. Readers of the book know that Sam was given a gift (important) that was not mentioned. also the counsel of elders in riverdale was not compleat as bilbo was not there? I stil feel this representation of the book was very well done. I have watched it 4 times in 4 days!!! Can't wait till Dec.,1029283200,,598,3.950413223140496
1321467,5,B00003CWT6,"I've loved these books from the time I was a preteen and have read them many times since.  I despaired of ever seeing them on the big screen because their scope is so immense and their layered meaning so profound.  But Peter Jackon has done it!  His love for the story must even be more than mine because he actually made the movie(s)and if The Fellowship of the Ring represents the next two, he made them with all the care and love and respect and understanding due this fantastic and wonderful tale.  He has created the time and the places of Middle Earth just as if he had captured them from some magical place.  And he has done so without their overwhelming the story - the power of the story remains.
The actors are perfect - Strider/Aragorn/Viggo Mortensen is just the right mix of self-doubt and self-confidence - a self-examining man carrying the sorrowful legacy of his ancestors and an intense man with tremendous courage who is completely unconscious of his power and greatness - all characteristics which will serve him well when the time comes for him to be king.  Frodo/Elijah Wood is the happy intelligent hobbit who is in complete touch with his fears but can draw on inner strengths only Gandolf knows he probably has.  And Gandolf/Ian McKellan is perfect.  He is the humble man/brilliant immortal wizard - human enough to covet the ring when it is offered, humble enough to fear the ring nevertheless and not take it, and wizard enough to trust his heart and use his tremendous powers for the greater good.  His humble wisdom enables him to see and understand the power of the ""simple"" hobbits.  And when he commands the Balrog ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"" one becomes aware of his own tremendous power and that he is, indeed, a great wizard.
I could go on and on with the actors.  Liv Tyler is wonderful as the courageous, insightful, gentle, loyal Arwen - Cate Blanchett is wonderful as the dangerous, powerful, understanding Galadriel.  All of the actors have conveyed the characters just as I imagined them to be.
And the music is divine.  Just as the books include songs and poems, the musical score surrounds the characters and action with the songs and poetic feeling of the books.  The lament for Gandalf is beautiful.
Any negatives?  Oh, I suppose.  I missed Tom Bombadil and the giving of the gifts by Galadriel (although I understand they include the giving of the gifts in the extended version coming out in November) but you know what?  If they included everything I wanted, this movie would be 6 hours long!  And being familiar with the books, I feel they picked exactly the right parts needed to tell the whole story without shirking any of the layers of meaning.
This DVD is wonderful.  And I CANNOT WAIT for The Two Towers.  Or for The Return of the King for that matter.  I have watched the DVD at least six times since I received it a week ago - and will watch it even more.",1029283200,4,2904,4.589147286821706
1321468,4,B00003CWT6,"I would just like to start by saying the movie presented in this edition is splendid looking and sounding. The visuals are still stunningly clear and sound still makes me jump out of my seat. The second DVD on the other hand could have been left out. It is just a blantant marketing ploy trying to convince us to buy the video game, Enya's CD, Two Towers, and the extended version of the movie coming out on DVD in November. The two ""In-depth Documentary's"" were made for TV before the movie came out, basically for promotional purposes. One of which I had already seen on Sci-Fi. Knowing that an extended version would be released at a later date and already knowing the sub-par material I bought this edition anyway just because it is the only way to get the theatrical version. Knowing what I did i wasn't suprised at how bad the suplemental material was. I would have been happy if they would have put just a commentary and movie on one disc, but then again I love commentaries.
As for the movie itself, it is a great action/fantasy/romance movie. If Tolkien could see this his only complaint would probably be more singing and for it to be longer. Its been along time since I've read the book so i'm not sure how much Jackson cut out but other than the noticable exclusion of Farmer Maggot and Tom Bombadil (sp?) it follows Tolkien's story pretty faithfully. I may get stoned by Tolkien and Peter Jackson fans alike for this comment but i would like to see another Lord of the Rings movie trilogy maybe animated. We need a quality animated version of the movie that maybe can be a little more faithful to the spirit of Tolkien.
I bought this edition of the DVD on sale for [money] and i don't think i would spend much more than that for DVD without a commentary and a decent documentary. Once again, the movie is a great little escape into fantasy for three hours or so but it is obvious Jackson wants us to buy two different versions of this movie.

The movie lasts three hours but it's worth it. It is about the Hobbits,  a group of small people. One of them is Bilbo Baggins, and he's weird. But the weirdest thing is that he's the owner of a very powerful ring, because of all the trips he has done. But the trouble starts when he gives it to his nephew, Frodo Baggins, to destroy it for good.

1321470,2,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings, to begin,disapointed me very much. Now this could be because i saw it on video and not in theaters, because the theater makes it more enjoyable. For some reason, you cannot get into the action of the movie. It moves WAY to slowly and just dragssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss on & on & on................. You know what I mean (It gets old)
The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the bonus disc. That is probably better than the movie itself. Without the bonus disc (on VHS), this movie would get 1/8 th of a star from me. The Two Towers looks much more active and just downright ""cool"", but I thought the same thing before I saw the first. The only reason I would recommend seing this is to compare it to the book. Its interesting to see what was left out and what changed and so on and so forth. But besides that, spend half the money and get the book.

Then I saw ""Fellowship of the Ring.""  I sat there mesmerized by the awesome scenery and special effects, and I was thrilled with the way Cook adapted the original novel.  The dialogue and exposition were cogent and easy for someone unfamiliar with the books to follow.

This 2-disc set was released to whet our appetites for the upcoming second installment, but the version to BUY is the more in-depth, feature-loaded version due out in November 2002. If you are only a casual fan, then by all means rent this film TODAY. You will be blown away by the gorgeous New Zealand scenery and the seamlessly-blended CGI effects. Director/Co-writer Peter Jackson has brought this epic piece to the screen with a fan's level of respect for the source material. Some elements had to be left behind, naturally, considering the massive scope of the saga. But his obvious respect for the source material shows in the attention to detail, character development,and the steady but unrushed pacing.
Not all movie fans will want to shell out $$ for the upcoming definitive version on DVD. This version will do just fine for many of us. It is a beautifully shot film, pleasantly and earnestly acted, and the special effects serve the film well RATHER THAN BEING THE REASON FOR THE FILM (ahem, George Lucas)!!

1321474,5,B00003CWT6,"The first installment of the Lord of the Rings Cinema Trilogy (the novel was not, in fact a trilogy, it was one novel published in three parts) is a Visual triumph.  Honestly I had my doubts about director Peter Jackson and his ability to bring my favorite novel to life.  Jackson did much to dispell my worries.
  The Special Effects were very well done.  I felt a chill run down my spine when the Ring Wraiths attacked the Hobbits on Weathertop.  I found myself impressed with the depth and detail of Moria and shuddered with the fear inspired by the forces of darkness in the few shots of Mordor.
  The cinematograhpy was simply fabulous. Hobbiton was exactly as I pictured it, and this would hold true for every location in Middle Earth.  Whether we were looking at the Misty Mountains or the Elven haven of Rivendell, I was quite impressed with the detail and the amount of work which had obviously gone into making this film.
  As for the plot and the story itself, this is where it gets tricky.  Having been a Tolkien fan for 19 years, I was bound to be disappointed.  Missing characters (Bilbo's relatives the Sackville Bagginses and Tom Bombadil to name a few), cut out scenes (the Journey through the Old Forrest) and re-arranged scenes (the scene at the Prancing Pony was edited heavily and to the detriment of the story).  The editing of the sequences between the time of Bilbo's party and the discovery of the Ring for what it is leads one who hasn't read the book to think very little time has gone by.  However, those of us who have read the novel realize this is far from the truth.  In fact almost 20 years go by!
  Having said this, I must rate this film 5 stars.  Honestly, Jackson did a FANTASTIC job overall.  My quibbles with the film are minor and overcome by the films' strong points.  Furthermore, unless Jackson opted for a film which was at least 1 hour LONGER than the 3 hour epic we have now there is NO way to get this film 100% right.

In a time  when special effects-driven films lack character driven plots,  LOTR:TFOTR scores on all counts--the special effects are simply unbeatable, the story is superbly fleshed out, and the acting is first-rate across the board.

I have never read any of Tolkien's books and have no interest in doing so, but, unlike so many other films, I don't think you need to be a fan in order to thoroughly enjoy it. I will be the first to admit that the only reason I saw this movie was because I got it for free at Blockbuster. Yet I'm soooo glad I did and cannot wait for the others to come out. The only problem I had with this movie was that I felt that some of the people who were given top billing had too small a part in this film. I think I saw Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett for a total of 15 minutes in this three hour film (don't worry, it goes by quickly) yet in the advertisements, you get the impression that they are a major part of the plot. Perhaps they will have expanded roles in the next two films? In any case, I think Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring should be on everyone's must see movie list this year.",1029196800,,999,3.9261083743842367
1321521,5,B00003CWT6,"I'm not one to read narrative prose, and although I have a friend who is an avid fan of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I could never get into them myself.  When the movie came out I was not certain I wanted to see it, but the trailers were so enchanting I couldn't resist it.  This seems to have been a fantasy film year for me-Planet of the Apes, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Spiderman, Lord of the Rings!  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
The story hung together extremely well.  There were no points where I stopped to ask myself, ""Is this credible?  Would he/she do this?  Is this a logical outcome of that?""  The bad guys were well and truly bad and the good guys well and truly good.  Furthermore, the actors chosen for each part were outstanding.  I couldn't imagine anyone else playing either of the two wizards than McClellan and Lee; each was given the right character to do and each did his part superbly.  Frodo Baggins spent a little too much time looking wide eyed and misty, but his eyes are so beautiful, I decided I didn't care!  I did find the use of the CGI characters a little repetitious.  Since Summers' The Mummy first brought creepy crawlies out in force through CGI everyone seems to use the same types of renderings and mannerisms.  It's time for something a little new in that direction, I think!
The settings were enchanting and fun.  I had seen a short preview of the film on TV which had discussed the Hobbit Shire and was impressed with the care that had gone into selecting its site and design.  It was, indeed, delightfully fanciful.  I was especially enamored, too, with the lands of the two groups of elves.  Their architecture, costume, and personal grace were arresting.  When Bilbo Baggins chose to live among them to write his book, I thought I could see retiring there to a life of contemplation and reading myself!  The film was an absolute visual delight.
When the CD came out I wasn't sure if it would take to a smaller venue-although my TV is 52""- but I needn't have been worried.  It transfers to the small screen without difficulty.  There are points when the dialogue seems a little forced, possibly because the smaller screen makes the human figures stand out more importantly from their background.  It might also be due to the fact that it was my second viewing of the film, so I already knew what was going to be said, anticipation making it seem more forced.
All in all the film is a masterpiece.  I can hardly wait until the next chapter comes out this winter.",1029196800,,2528,4.507692307692308
1321522,5,B00003CWT6,Absolutely loved the movie.  The DVD is excellent.  I now use this DVD to show off my sound system.  I also plan to purchase the Extended Edition in November.  Highly reommended.,1029196800,,178,4.645161290322581
1321523,4,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring, based on the first book of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien, is one impressive movie that exceeds most of the expectations of fans of Fantasy adventures. I suggest that you read the books because there is nore material covered in the book than in the movie. The world and scenery is incredible. The New Zealand setting is a good place to film the movie. The world, peoples, languages, and story shows how much of an amazing imagination Tolkien has through this movie. Elijah Wood is okay as Frodo Baggins but Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, and Hugo Weaving has done impressive acting as Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Arwen, Legolas and Elrond. The action and adventure in the movie is far superior that it beats the fantasy movie Dungeons and Dragons by a huge margin. The story is well developed in the movie and the crew has done an excellent job trying to stay true to the book. It is unfortunate that Peter Jackson and the screenwriters had to cut out some important scenes from the book in order to fuse the whole 400-page story to a three hour movie, making Tolkien fans unhappy but the movie continues work well without those scenes. As for the extra features, they have a huge collection of featurettes which gives a look at how the movie was made with the trailers and a preview for the next movie. The thing that disapoints me is that there is no deleted scenes and they are going to release it in another DVD edition that costs more. It's probably that there's no room in the two discs. This is a movie for those who love adventure and a great story so if you are not interested in these two things, go look for something else unless you really want to experience this great movie. If you have read the books, the Lord of the Rings is a great movie to experience the story. I am looking forward to the next chapter, The Two Towers on Christmas 2002.",1029196800,,1937,4.490084985835694
1321583,1,B00003CWT6,"Would you add solid lines to a Jackson Pollock?  Would you add a movement to Beethoven's Ninth?  How about putting a block of lard into your grandmother's special spaghetti sauce?  Of course not!
The Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring has been stomped all over by the movie's maker.  When I rented this movie, I fully expected that a few items in the 'back story' might be simplified because of time.  I never expected that the screenwriter would leave out entire characters and storylines, fail entirely to develop characterization for the main characters, neglect fully some of the most important aspects of the story, and make things up out of whole cloth!  It's unthinkable, unconscionable!
To name just a few of the problems with this movie:
-Tom Bombadil is left out entirely, along with the entire storyline surrounding him
-Frodo looks like he is 15, instead of the 50
-Saruman is made to seem as if he has gone over to the dark side entirely and is taking orders directly from Sauron
-The palantir is brought out in an entirely false manner
-Instead of Frodo sneaking off (with Sam) at the end, Aragorn gives his blessing for Frodo to go
-the story behaves as if Aragorn has neglected his throne, rather than is waiting for the appropriate time to take it
-While Boromir does go crazy for the ring as in the story, the movie fully fails to develop why he wants the ring(because of his people failing in Gondor)
-The movie also fails to develop that Boromir's father is the head of Gondor, holding the place that Aragorn should take as king,
-The movie fails to develop what species is what and where/when they have come from and why they matter
-Cate Blanchett has no business playing Galadriel
-The Hobbits keep changing sizes
-At the end of the movie Sam doesn't swing back to the coastline and intercept Frodo (as he does in the book), instead they make up that Sam goes out in the water after Frodo and nearly drowns, necessitating Frodo pulling him out of the water
-So,so,so many things are made up out of whole cloth
Perhaps the film maker thought that he was allowed to butcher this classic because he had the technology to make an attractive movie and great effects.  He didn't.  This movie is a wholly wasted opportunity to create a masterpiece of the movie.  I am glad that I rented it, and didn't buy it as I almost did.  I do not want anymore of my money going to support this shameful project.  I wouldn't even give it one star.",1029196800,10,2458,4.5636363636363635
1321584,5,B00003CWT6,"There are few critics for this film and so as it should be, and I find it difficult to add any more praise for the finished project than has already been penned. I read Tolkiens trilogy in high school and again in 2000 before I was aware that it was being brought to life. I've always loved the story and with all of it fresh in my mind, I have to admit, I was a bit worried about how well the film would be done. I'm a stickler for lousy casting when I've read the book prior to it being released on film. So, I heard about the ""Lord of the Rings"" Web site and decided to check it out. The first place I headed for was the casting information and was actually amazed, and pleased, at how well they chose the individuals who would portray these almost historic characters. Then, of course like all the other fans, waited in anticipation for it to open in theaters. Too awesome, though I did pick up on a few little details they left out, mostly narrative (some of which is added on the extended version that will be release in November) but overall I would venture to say that this will be one of the top classic films ever made. My only hope is that Peter Jackson, and maybe he already has, would consider the ""Hobbit"" as his next project . . . while Ian McKellen and Ian Holm are still available. That would finish-off the collection quite nicely.
Middle-Earth is a world much like our own . . . countries torn by war, brave inhabitants steadfast in their beliefs, the search for inner healing through love and fellowship and evil at times that lurks in the dark places waiting to devour those in its path, until . . .

1321585,4,B00003CWT6,"Critics everywhere have heralded Jackson's Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring as a visual masterpiece.  And truly, it is.  The sets are wonderfully done, every detail is there.  The movie stays very true to the book, except for a few understandable omissions (the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil) and Arwen's role is considerably more important.  The actors fit perfectly in their characters.  I cannot help but quote Orlando Bloom who said he always believed elves ""moved like alert cats"".  So why is there a but?  Let me just say that, aside from the movie, the extra material in this DVD fall short of my expectations.  I wonder why the New Line company had to make three different DVD versions of this film, when two could have sufficed.  All in all, I believe that the edited scenes are cruelly absent in this version, and that I regret not waiting for the special edition DVD.  If you're still hesitating on which DVD to buy, be more patient than I was and wait til November.",1029196800,2,988,4.594285714285714
1321586,4,B00003CWT6,"After seeing this film in the theatre, I was ambivilent. I liked the set design and cinematography, but I thought there were a few too many walking from here-to-there scenes and it needed a few less battles and more character interaction. I thought Jackson's direction was uneven and the battle scenes were muddled and confusing. After watching it for the second time (this time on DVD), I still feel some of those criticisms are valid, but somehow I enjoyed it much more this time. In the theatre I found it too long, but now I think it's not too long at all (and I can't wait to see the deleted scenes in the extended version). The detailed imagery, sets, and costumes in every scene are beautiful and epic. I believe in my heart that this cave troll would kick the arse of the one in Harry Potter too.
The acting is very good all-around, but I thought Sean Bean was a standout as Boromir, and Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Sam, and Bilbo were very convincing. A lot of people were upset about the expanded role of Arwen (and about Liv Tyler playing her), but I think it was a great choice. She looks and sounds appropriately beautiful and elven, and I thought having a little romance didn't hurt the story at all (it's a 3-hour movie and she's only in it for 10 minutes). Cate Blanchett as Gladriel actually bothered me more. I like her as an actress, and she looks the part, but I thought her tone was off. She just didn't seem true to what was in the book. The over-the-top ""dark queen"", Exorcist-demon-voice hallucination really took me out of the story. I blame Jackson for this, though, as I think she could have played it right, but he allowed and/or encouraged her to do it this way and he okayed the unnecessary special effects used for the scene.
Technically, this is a very good DVD overall, but it's not great. The transfer is excellent -- saturated, contrasty, and sharp. The audio is ok, but for some reason the dialogue seems to go weak in some scenes when listened to on a two-speaker system (this is the case with both the 5.1 and Dolby Stereo tracks). Listen to the scene with Elrond and Bilbo and you'll see what I mean. The extras are not bad, though a lot of the material is overlapping, and a full-length director and actor commentary is sadly missing. Personally, I'm waiting for the extended version to purchase, and I recommend you do too if you are a fan. Just rent this one for now.
Maybe this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. It seems so to me. I've read the books mnay times, and after letting this movie sink in a while, I'm not only not disappointed, but very happy with the outcome. It's not perfect, but it's an excellent start and I can't wait now to see what's in store for us in the next two films. It was no small task to pull this off, with all the expectations and previous failed attempts. I thank Mr. Jackson and the studio for first even attempting it, and second, producing a result that for the first time is worthy of its literary heritage.",1029196800,2,3015,4.444043321299639
1321587,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is one of the best examples of modern filmmaking.  It has all of the elements that a modern classic should have: good material, a plot-driven script, larger-than-life (or should it be the opposite in the case of the hobbits) characters, and fantastic imagery.  In short, epic filmmaking at its finest.
Unlike other genre films, ""Lord of the Rings"" transcends cultural barriers.  It doesn't matter whether you're a Tolkien fan or not; it doesn't matter whether you've read the books or not (although you wouldn't be disappointed if you did).  You will end up getting involved in the quest to destroy the One Ring, you will learn to dread the Ringwraiths, you will want to see Aragorn defeat the Uruk-hai, you will feel concerned for Gandalf when he battles the Balrog.  Tolkien die-hards will probably harp about the deletion of certain characters (Tom Bombadil, for example) and certain scenes and the expansion of Arwen's role.  But, overall, there is no significant alteration from Tolkien's work.  In any case, Tolkien's style and his penchance for long-winded descriptions, complex linguistic riddles, and genealogies would not have translated well onto celluloid.
Having said that, almost everything about the movie is perfect, from the choice of New Zealand as the setting, to the cast selection, to the music.  Middle Earth couldn't have been brought to life better than Peter Jackson and company have done.  I believe Tolkien would have been proud to see his creation brought to the screen with such passion.",1029196800,,1527,5.100401606425703
1321588,5,B00003CWT6,"When a movie like this manages to be as succesful as it is (criticaly and financially), it may appear that something's not right.  They would be right about that.  A fantasy film this good shouldn't be successful, but thank goodness it is.  Unlike  some of its predecessors (and the animated versions of the saga), ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" doesn't get bogged down in mythology so much that it detracts from the main plot of the story.  As a young Hobbit named Frodo (Elijah Wood) comes into possession of a mysterious and sinister ring, he is forced to leave his home in order to kee this ring from ending up in the hands of the ring's maker, the lord of evil, Sauron.  As he reluctantly embarks on this quest, he is helped by a small band of warriors (and fellow Hobbits) to see that tis task is accomplished.  But as they all soon discover, fighting the evil forces that seek the ring is not the only problem they face...  It's hard to point out a fault with this film.  Everything in this film (from the casting to the production to the stunning score by Howard Shore), is next to pitch-perfect.  The only real complaint is that the film ends with a open-ending.  But since there's two more films to go in the trilogy (and coming soon enough), it's a very minor complaint.  ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" was definitely one of my favorite films last year, and from the way it looks, one of my favorite films this year.  Very highly recommended.",1029110400,,1468,4.473684210526316
1321589,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson took a great risk making The Lord of the Rings trilogy. There is such a cult following to Tolkien's original work, that it is a great risk for any filmmaker to make. Especially after the Dungeons & Dragons flop made shortly before this film. The risk was so great, that I didn't even go see it in the theater. Especially when I heard that Elijah Wood and Liv Tyler had major roles in it. But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is this a good movie, but it is one of the best movies I've seen in the Fantasy/Adventure genre. Jackson is loyal to Tolkien's vision (I do admit, it has been a while since I've read Tolkien, but I think I remember correctly), and the production design and costumes are phenomenal. The attention to detail is amazing. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, and Dominic Monaghan are hobbits personified (as is Peter Jackson). Elijah Wood hasn't done that great of a job in the past, but I can't think of anyone who could be a better Frodo. Viggo Mortensen plays his role physical and dark, but still heroic. Wonderful job. And Sir Ian McKellan, well, I don't think I have to go into how great of an actor he is. These performances were excellent, the art direction is superb (they brought in two major illustrator's of Tolkien's books as consultants), and of course the story comes from one of the greatest. You don't even notice that almost three hours has passed.
Most of the featurettes cover some piece of information contained in another featurette, but they still add to the experience of the movie. The Houghton-Mifflin featurette covers a lot of what went into publishing Tolkien's books. The Sci-Fi channel special is the definite best of the three featurettes. Then there are the lordoftherings.net Featurettes, which are 15 2-5 minute featurettes which cover everything from the actors to the music to the locations. They compliment the other featurettes very well, giving even more inside information on the film. There are also previews of The Fellowship of the Rings Special Edition DVD, The Two Towers film, and The Two Towers video game.
It's a great movie, but I don't know if I'd buy this edition. There is a special edition coming out soon that has around 30 minutes of additional footage and many more extras, including commentaries. I think I personally will wait until all three movies have been released, and in their special edition packaging, because who knows what kind of great box set/packing extras, and so forth will be there once the trilogy is completed.",1029110400,,2545,4.7342342342342345

The next day we watched it again, but this time with the subtitles on, just to get all the names to match up with the pronounciation.  My 8 year old and 10 year old watched the entire movie, and not once did the movie lose their attention, and it's nearly 3 hours long.  We can hardly wait for 'The Twin Towers' to come out in the theatres, and my children are even thinking of reading the books beforehand.  I would also recommend watching the behind the scenes disks that are included, as they contain very interesting footage about the making of 'The Lord of the Rings' and a preview of 'The Twin Towers'.  I can see why it won 4 Academy Awards, and my daughters were the first ones to say it.  You should NOT miss this movie.",1029110400,12,881,4.271084337349397

Fellowship of the Rings kick's off the trilogy, and sets a new standard for all fantasy films that come in the future. (Sharing that position with Mr. Potter, in my little book of course.) Peter Jackson is at this very moment, while you read, creating the next installment's. How can a Tolkien Fan complain? Ah, technology. There are battles that are some of the best ever created. Frenzied and crazy, sword slashing, arrow wisping fun will keep you on the edge. The dvd is gorgeous. The picture is vivid, and the sound is exceptional. I read one review, claiming that he had some trouble. I wish I knew the answer to his problem, because for me, with a dolby digital/DTS decoder, it sounds fantastic.

I enjoyed watching the interviews (there's one for most of the main characters) and liked hearing about the actors' experiences from their own points of view. Also Peter Jackson gives a ten-minute tour of preparations for the release of The Two Towers, which gives you a look into the very idolized world of LOTR filmaking. Also you can watch the trailers and tv commercials for The Fellowship of the Ring as well as see Behind-the-Scenes shows for FOTR done by Houghton Mifflin, Fox TV Channel, and the Sci-fi Channel. There is more, but that is for you to find out! And if you're a fan of the music of FOTR, you'll be glad to know that there are nice little snippets of it in the second disc.

After talking it over with a few friends I have discovered I am not alone. I will not decry this as a bad film it is simply heavy going. For myself I had to watch it in two parts as I fell asleep after the first two hours.
Tolkein's stories, though regarded as classics, read like literary exercises rather than narratives and Peter Jackson's film follows suit. Where George Lucas got things very right with Star Wars (Episode IV, not Episodes I & II which coincidentally fall into the same trap as Tolkein's work) by plunging the audience straight into the action and showing us who were the good guys and the bad guys, The Lord of the Rings feels the need to describe it all in minute detail. Did we need to know the history of Wookies to know that Chewbacca was a good guy? No, it was simply obvious. Do we need to know the history of every species in Lord of the Rings? Apparently. The world of Middle Earth seems to be flung at you, Orcs and all, and you can either sink or swim. I sank and I won't be resurfacing for the next two installments, my curiousity having been sated by a quick search for online synopses.

1321614,5,B00003CWT6,"THE MOVIE: First of all, this a fantastic movie, and I think that A Beautiful Mind and Fellowship of the Ring should both have gotten Best Picture. The 5 stars go for the movie alone. You likely already know much about it, and if you don't, read the editorial and spotlight reviews. It is completely true to the spirit of the books, and I loved seeing what could only be imagined before (especially Sauron in physical form and his Eye). You won't be disappointed by this film in any way unless you really wanted to see Tom Bombadil.
DVD Features: The Quest for the Ring and A Passage to Middle-Earth are great behind-the-scenes looks at the movie, and if you see them, you can skip the Houghton-Mifflin feature because most of it is repeat information and/or interviews. My favorite feature was A Passage to Middle-Earth because it had a decent length, it had wonderful insights and information, and it did not have a ""made for TV"" look to it. The trailers, TV spots, music video, and video game preview are all about what you would expect if you've had any experience with DVD extras. The previews of the Extended Version and The Two Towers provide tantalizing glimpses of what is yet to come for Lord of the Rings fans. I am looking forward to the Battle of Helm's Deep, but I also want to see more of the friendships evolve, and it looks like Peter Jackson & Co. are going to do a splendid job with both. My ONLY gripe with the extras is that they do not go into much detail about places and events after the Fellowship leaves Rivendell. If complete information on every aspect of the film is what you desire, or if you only want to buy one version of this movie, wait for the Special Extended Version due out on November 12th. Otherwise, I would advise you to buy both; you will get two versions of the film and 3 discs of special features in all.

This review is the product of my lifetime of experience in meeting important people and thinking deep thoughts. This is a new kind of review, and will no doubt influence the way you think about the world around you and the way you think of yourself.
Bigger than infinity

Although my review deserves thousands of pages to articulate, I am limiting many of my deeper thoughts to only single characters. I encourage readers of my review to dedicate the many years required to fully absorb the significance of what I am writing here. Fortunately, we live in exactly the time when my review can be widely disseminated by ""internet"" technology and stored on ""digital media"", allowing current and future scholars to delve more deeply into my original and insightful use of commas, numbers, and letters.

My place in history

My review allows, for the first time, a complete and total understanding not only of this but *every single* DVD ever made. I call this ""the principle of DVD equivalence."" Future generations will decide the relative merits of this review compared with, for example, the works of Shakespeare. This effort will open new realms of scholarship.
More about me

I first began writing reviews as a small child, where my talent was clearly apparent to those around me, including my mother. She preserved my early writings which, although simpler in structure, portend elements of my current style. I include one of them below (which I call review 30) to indicate the scholarly pedigree of the document now in your hands or on your screen or committed to your memory:

""The guy who wrote the book is also the publisher of the book. I guess he's the only person smart enough to understand what's in it. When I'm older I too will use a vanity press. Then I can write all the pages I want.""

It is staggering to contemplate that all the great works of literature can be derived from the letters I use in writing  this review. I am pleased to have shared them with you, and hereby grant you the liberty to use up to twenty (20) of them consecutively without attribution. Any use of additional characters in print must acknowledge this review as source material since it contains, implicitly or explicitly, all future written documents.",1029110400,6,2313,4.753117206982544

Well I don't care because it has been at least a quarter of a century untill a real version of lotr came out. I thought it would be as [bad] as the cartoon, but I was dead wrong. This man Peter Jackson, is bent on trying to put every little detail in to this trilogy. I say he did an austonding job at it with a few little complaits like... Tom Bombadil,the elves that met them on there way to Buckleberry Ferry, and it wasn't supposed to be Arwen who fetched Frodo at the ford. Other than that he did an exceptioal job. I can't wait to see the Two Towers and The Return of the King. Oh if only Tolkien were alive today (1920?-1973) I belive he would be both impressed and disappointed that some of his characters were cut out. But you know what they say in the movie business, ""No matter how hard you try you cannot put everthing from a book into a movie. It would simply cost too much""

1321618,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay let me explain myself.  The movie is masterful, I have loved the trilogy since I was 13 years old, but the problem with this particular DVD is the fact that you have to buy this one to really find out what is in the special extended DVD release, that will be coming out in November.  So what's my beef?  Well if I had known what was on the special extended DVD.  I would have waited.  So now I have spent sixteen bucks on the regular version and now will have to spend another forty bucks to buy the special extended version in November.  It would have been nice for the two versions to release at the same time.  I want to believe that there is a logical explanation for the delayed release, but unfortunatley I have to believe that the reason for the two different release dates is to make a couple of extra bucks.  On the current DVD release they have a great explanation of what will be on the special extended release/director's cut.  So all those who are interested in seeing the incredible film uncut and in it's entirety will be forced to fork out around sixty bucks.  The movie is great, this attempt (which will succeed) to make an extra buck on a franchise that is growing as rapidly as Star Wars, is not!",1029110400,3,1221,4.315789473684211

Upon learning that LOTR was being filmed, I feared the worst, because of the realization of the magnitude of such a project.  Peter Jackson's adaptation of LOTR exceeded my expectations in all aspects of film-making.  The extra features on the DVD version demonstrate the painstaking detail with which Jackson and his crew approached this project.  The movie is not above criticism, but it is the best screen  adaptation of a serious novel since the Godfather.  Thank you, Peter Jackson, cast, crew and New Line.",1029110400,,600,5.134020618556701
1321620,5,B00003CWT6,"They said it couldn't be done. It would be too dangerous, too difficult, too long....they were wrong. Thanks to the passion and dedication of director Peter Jackson and his amazing cast and crew, this epic tale of good versus evil has finally been brought to life. And to discover how they did it will blow your mind.
The Fellowship of the Ring -the first part of the three part trilogy of the Lord of the Rings is truly only a taste of what is to come, but for anyone who missed it, you really need to see it to believe it.
My suggestion - read the books, including the Hobbit and then you will appreciate it better.

However, if you are itching for extras, Disc 2 is an utter disappointment. Most of the features come across as adverts for other Rings merchandise (they even advertise the Extended DVD which you will wish you had bought). Much of the same material is re-edited into the 3 documentaries -- you'll grow quickly bored with hearing Cate Blanchett say she's always wanted pointy ears -- and they offer no real insight into the specifics of creating the film beyond your basic ""this guy made the costumes"" and ""this guy drew concept drawings.""",1029024000,,705,4.693548387096774
1321651,5,B00003CWT6,"After having been disappointed many times over the years by blockbuster movies, I was extremely skeptical about LOTR.  Doubly so because I so enjoyed the books.  I am thoroughly impressed by this movie!  I am stunned by the amount of time and money spent on the production.  The richness of the details is incredible, and makes the film credible.  A lesser director would have used a lot of cheesy, overly ornate weapons and artifacts that bore no resemblance to anything ever used in the real world.  The fact that everything looks right, and real, adds to the feeling that we are looking over the shoulders of people on a quest, not watching a fantasy.
The acting is top notch.  Star Wars II suffers horribly from good-looking actors that couldn't act a lick.  Not so here.  The LOTR story is gripping and rich, a classic tale of good and evil with fully realized characters, each with their own faults and weaknesses.
I read a few of the negative reviews here.  Some people just didn't like the movie.  OK, fair enough.  I guess that is why they make both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.  No movie was ever liked by everybody, and if you don't like this one it is purely a mater of your taste, not the quality of the movie.
The one legitimate knock on this DVD is the ""special features.""  To tell the truth, I doubt anybody bought this DVD for the ""special features.""  But somehow, given the quality of the movie, and the fact that a second disk was included just for the special features, there are certain expectations raised.  In fact, all the ""special features"" amount to is multiple ""making of"" type shows from various sources, and trailers/teasers.  I wouldn't mind the ""making of"" stuff so much if any of it was a quality documentary on the filmmaking.  But all the versions are essentially the same pre-release hype shows.  And of the couple of hours of shows, most of it is the same.  The same clips, and the exact same interviews.  I am guessing the producers shot the interviews and provided them and the clips to all interested parties as a kit.  Kind of disappointing, but not a show stopper.
I agree it is a  bit mercenary to sell this DVD now, and have a 2nd version on sale in a few months.  But given the years (literally) spent on this production, and the amount of money invested long in advance of any possible return, I really don't blame them for doing what they can now that it is finally payday.  If you only want one version, just buy that version.  As others have pointed out, even if you buy both versions the price for a 6 disk set is still very reasonable.",1029024000,2,2589,4.502145922746781
1321652,5,B00003CWT6,"It is humbling to try and think out a review of this film.  When I last looked, there were some 1576 reviews posted and no doubt many more coming.  What can I say that has not been said before, and probably better than I can?  All this for the momentary honor of having reviewed something that has touched me deeply.  Think, 1576 reviews and the overall rating is 4-1/2 stars.  What an astounding accomplishment.  What more evidence does any need that this is something to treasure?
I actually avoided this film when it first came out because I could not believe that it would measure up to the Lord of the Rings that lives in my mind after 40 years of reading and rereading.  Nor was I sure that I was comfortable sharing in a theater what had become an intensely personal experience.  Alas, this was my loss.  At least, in this modern era, I can have that experience via this most excellent DVD, along with countless pieces of information on the making of the film.
I was in high school when I first read these books, but it was not until 5 years later, when the paperbacks came out, that 'The Ring' began to work its magic on me.  Years later, the film has renewed that experience.  What is great about this film is not that it is a reasonably faithful rendering of the books, or that actors bring their characters to life beautifully, although both these statements are true.  What is great about this film is that is captures the intent of Tolkien's story, which was far more than the telling of an incredible task.
When the ring first appeared in paperback, it came into the hands of a generation of people who desperately needed a legend of their own.  In a world gone crass and commercial, where people were being bent by an inexplicable conflict, 'The Lord of the Rings' promised that, if we were willing to pay the price, the balance could be restored.  That the source of good was truly just as inexhaustible as that of evil.  Forty years later, this film succeeds in recreating that lesson, and restoring that image.
If Peter Jackson had to turn and twist things in order to keep this film within reasonable viewing bounds, he left out nothing important.  I missed Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Downs.  And Sauron and Arwen have considerably extended parts.  But what Jackson has done is put a great deal of effort into making sure that what he did do felt right.  In many cases, his imagery was far in excess of the product of my poor and worn out brains.  As such, this is a film for which to be grateful.  For me this is a great gift - a fond memory revisited.",1029024000,8,2573,4.431914893617021

So I saw it five times in theatres and now once at home on the DVD. Wow! This movie just rocks sooo much! It is a great adventure movie, and also a movie that deals with different and really cool characters. I can't say how this movie is compared to the book. I haven't read the book, but I totally want to. You don't have to have read the book to enjoy the movie totally, though. No matter what, this movie is very interesting. Even after almost three hours, it's still interesting. Yeah, it's waaaaaaaaay long, but who cares??? It's cool. That's what matters. This is one of the best movies I've seen. Even if you're not a Lord of the Rings fan, this movie will totally make you one. So I finish my review by saying that I totally reccomend this movie. For anyone. See it. It's awesome. And, I can't wait for the second movie. Only four more months.........",1029024000,3,1009,4.343915343915344
1321654,4,B00003CWT6,"Well... where to begin? I myself have read the entire trilogy no less than 20 times.  I've also read ALL of Tolkien's supplemental works as well as some of his unrelated poetry and prose.  I can speak some of the ancient languages Tolkien used to develope some of his own languages in Lord of the Rings (Welsh, Cornish, etc.)  So I imagine you could say that I am a nutfanaticgeekandwhatever of J.R.R. Tolkien.
  As far as cinematics are concerned, the movie was excellent.  It portrayed most of the characters, places, languages, as they were very well supposed to be.  The way The Shire was depicted left me in tears as I know that we will never see a place and people so happy and carefree and beautiful while we live on earth.
  The battle in which Sauron was deprived of the Ring was absolutely stunning.  The orcs were, for the most part, well-done- although no Orc was ever any shade of green.  The detail of weapons and armor was exquisite.  The scenery altogether made me want to gather an army and claim New Zealand for myself.
  The story line, however, was not very well stuck to.  Some of the most terrifying and bizzare and entertaining parts of The Fellowship of the Ring were left out entirely.  The part where Fatty Bolger awaited the Ring-Wraiths at Crickhollow, the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil, the terror of the Barrow Downs, etc (if you've read the book)... all were left out entirely!  Some of the characters were changed as well.  Instead of meeting Glorfindel on the way to Rivendell, they met Arwen (va-va-voom by the way!)  Galadriel wasn't even as remotely beautiful as she was in the book.  I could go on...
  Altogether, it was... better than okay.  I loved it for this, hated it for that.  But I'll probably watch it as many times as I've read it.  I'd like very much for Christopher Tolkien to write a review here.

1321655,4,B00003CWT6,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is definately movie that fantasy fans will fall in love with. I have been a fan of Tolkien's book since my early teens. When I found out that they were making a movie about the books, I will admit that I was one of the first ones in line to see it in the theatre. There was very little about the movie that I could actually say I didn't agree with.
The cast that was picked seems to shine in this movie. I would never have thought that Elijiah Wood could be able to play Frodo, but he actually seemed to carry the character throughout the movie. The special effects in this movie are good, but not great. There are a few moments when you can tell that scenes were created using computer generation. But overall the movie is a beautiful piece of cinema.
The special features on the 2-disc DVD aren't exactly the best. There are a few cool things to check out, but unless you really want this movie now, then I suggeest you wait for the 4-disc DVD to come out where there is going to be a lot more extras, and deleted scenes. The 2-disc does have a look into the next movie, which is looking like it might blow this one out of the water with shear action and special effects. I can't wait...
Peter Jackson (the director) does an amazing job keeping the movie as close to the book as possible. I was a little hesitant to see the movie, just for the fact that I have seen movies based on books before and have been sorely disapointed. But this movie is sure to live on in the future as one of the most richly detailed movies of all time.",1029024000,2,1585,4.183006535947713

Each has its own amazing set of extras.  For a die-hard LOTR nut (like me), it's well worth it to by BOTH.",1029024000,,329,4.45
1321657,4,B00003CWT6,"I've already written one review for the cinema release of the Fellowship, and I still think it's one of the greatest movies ever made.  I have every intention of buying the extended version when it comes out, but I just couldn't wait to have my own copy.  For those of you debating between the extended cut and the wide release version, I thought I'd review the special features.
First of all, the biggest bummer about this DVD release is a complete lack of commentary.  I'm a big fan of commentary.  The special features are really just a collection of previously released materials: internet movies, promotional presentations, etc.  The two big things that impatient geeks like myself wil get out of this edition are the previews for the extended version, and The Two Towers.
The Extended cut preview, including a brief intro from Peter Jackson is extremely short.  We get glimpses of the missing scenes and a brief interview with Howard Shore about the additions to the score.  For those of you who were unaware of such a future release, this is a hard way to find out.  The Two Towers preview is quite a bit meatier and goes into locations, new characters and the making of Gollum.  We still don't get to see what he looks like finished, but even the unfinished product is pretty amazing.
Basically, if you are a big fan, wait, wait, wait for the extended version.  If you just can't wait that long, the sound and picture quality of this version are well above average and the story remains as incredible as ever, so you can get a decent fix.  I plan on giving this version away once I get my grubby little hands on the extended cut.",1029024000,4,1637,4.571917808219178

This one is terrible! The colors are bad, the encoding is blurry and full of artifacts and the sound is imbalanced, uneven and just plain bad. I was really looking foward to this dvd and had high expectations. What a disappointment. I'm not sure whether this LOTR is better than no LOTR.",1029024000,2,496,4.231578947368421

1321729,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie has to be one of my top 10 favorites.  It is positively a beautiful film.  The classic characters are brought to life through incredible performances from the cast, and somehow Peter Jackson managed to capture the charm of the novels on film.  No matter how many times I've seen it or read it, I still find myself in tears with the closing scenes.
The costuming is glorious, and the scenery is completely believable.  The sets ARE Middle Earth, and you are utterly lost in this story through the dramatic, wonderful way it is told.
The DVD is great.  The sound is better than I could have hoped for, and the picture is better than I had expected.  A wonderful carry over from the theater.
The special features are also a blast.  The 10 minute preview of the Two Towers is great, leaving you on the edge of your seat to see the next film, which (regretfully) we have to wait for December to see.  A slight insight into Gollum is given (at least how he is created in the movie), and even more great clips are waiting.  Of course, the trailers are great as is everything else on the DVD.
It would be an absolute crime against humanity to purchase the full screen version of this, considering even in the widescreen it is hard to take in everything in any given shot.  Go with the widescreen, the full screen is so chopped it has a clostrophobic feeling to it.  And of course, the VHS can't have as sharp of picture as the DVD, and believe me, the picture is great on this.
I'm looking forward to the extended version, due out in November, but this is a marvelous movie and a delightful DVD.  Pick it up and allow yourself to be swept away into middle earth.  Remember: ""It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your front door...""",1028937600,3,1741,4.420062695924765
1321730,5,B00003CWT6,"Occasionally, a controversy arises in advance over whether Hollywood can do a book justice in the movie version. In the case of Lord of the Rings, make that three movies. New Line Cinema gave New Zealand director Peter Jackson hundreds of millions of dollars to film the entire J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy. These were shot simultaneously in Jackson's native New Zealand. The first, The Fellowship of the Rings, was released last Christmas and is now on video and DVD. The second will open in theaters in December, the third in December 2003.
So far, Jackson has triumphed. While some purists have complained about certain elements of the movie  (for example, about the lessening of the Hobbits' roles in fighting the forces of evil), most fans seem quite pleased. The movie has been a huge hit both here and abroad, which indicates its appeal goes far beyond the books' rabid supporters.
The Lord of the Rings is an epic tale about courage and the dangers of power. It takes place in a time long ago in a place called Middle Earth, which both is and is not of our earth. It is peopled by far more than mere humans beings. There are hobbits and dwarfs, elves and goblins, wizards and assorted strange creatures.
Once upon a time, a great but evil wizard forged powerful rings in the fires of the Mountain of Doom. The mightiest of these he kept for himself, but he lost it during a great battle. One day, a hobbit named Bilbo [Ian Holm] found it and kept it. Now he has decided to pass it on to his favorite nephew, Frodo [Elijah Wood]. There is great danger for Frodo because the wizard will stop at nothing to get it back. With the help of another wizard, Gandolf [Ian McKellan], and others, Frodo begins a long and treacherous journey to where the ring was created, for that is the only place where it can be destroyed.
The movie is a visual feast. Computer generated imagery techniques have truly come of age. When you mix these cinematic tricks with the naturally awesome and exotic landscapes of New Zealand, the effect is magical. Some, but not all, of this is lost on the small screen, for The Lord of the Rings is designed to be seen larger than life.
One of the movie's great accomplishments is the way it seamlessly matches the small and large characters. You would swear that Elijah Wood is a midget in real life, and Ian McKellan a giant.
The cast is superb. Especially notable are McKellan as Gandolf, Holm as Bilbo, and Wood as Frodo. These actors will forever be known for these roles. Also mesmerizing is Kate Blanchett in her fairly small role as Queen Galadriel.
The Lord of the Rings will not please all viewers. It runs three hours. The characters travel on and on and on, in much the same way Peter O'Toole was forever trooping across the desert in the 1962 classic, Lawrence of Arabia. Also, because this is the first in a trilogy, it doesn't have a true climax. It simply ends with the main characters planning their next moves. I personally can't wait to find out what they are.",1028937600,3,2997,4.5602968460111315

The only explanation I have is that the DVD was recorded with very high gains on the battle scenes, and some stereo systems can't handle the full signal. Tempering it by sending it through an intermediary source helps it not to clip. It does tell me that I need to go out and get a new receiver before the next films come out on DVD :D.

But the wonder of this movie is that it is not limited merely to the surface level of action and adventure; it conveys deeper themes about life. In allegorical form, it shows the epic distinction between good and evil, the utter corruption of sin, and the sovereign care of God. It shows the joys of simple living, and the beauty of culture in middle-earth. All of this lifts you upward to the climax of emotion and gratefulness for the life God gave both the hobbits and us humans.

Though I missed seeing the Lord of the Rings in the theatre, this DVD made up for that tragic blunder. All the same, you may wish to wait for the extended edition, containing an extra 30 minutes of footage over 4 DVDs, to come out in November. It sounds very good.",1028937600,,900,4.660377358490566

  But me, I'm a sap. I want both versions of the film.
  I saw this film in theatres more than twice as much as I've seen any film since my pre-teen years. Why? Well, aside from the possibility that I have the geek gene -- LOTR: FOTR is the best fantasy movie ever made. There's action, great visuals, but most importantly (and this is something that's sadly lacking in modern Star Wars films) heart.
  The title of the film is ""Fellowship"", and that's also the theme. A bond of Fellowship or friendship which allows for some very intimate and heart-wrenching moments. Sam and Frodo's friendship. Merry and Pippin. Gandalf and everyone. Superb chemistry brought forth by great writing and dead on casting.
  For the unfeeling among you, there's a few beheadings. (g)
  And visually, this film is stunning. Wonderfully detailed and intelligent designs that require multiple viewings, pauses, zooms to appreciate it all. The DVD transfer is superb, making the visuals even better. In particular, I think the Balrog looks at lot better on the DVD than he did on the screen. There's some very sharp colours on this DVD.
  As for special features, this August version has mostly recycled TV and internet specials. But there's also a ten-minute preview of the Two Towers, the next LOTR film. And a preview of the extended DVD. The previews have me eagerly awaiting the next releases in this franchise.
  I highly recommend this movie. (And for the record, I've read the books, but I actually think the film adaptation improves on some things. The characters are more developed.)",1028937600,5,1840,4.781645569620253
1321736,5,B00003CWT6,"I first read Lord Of the Rings as an undergrad during the Turbulent Sixties, when it gained a cult following among several of us who considered the world to be Armageddon-bound by next semester, what with my countrys and the Soviet Unions reckless nuclear buildup, as well as both nations interventionist adventures in the Third World. There was saying back then, frequently appearing as graffiti: Frodo Lives. As potential cannon fodder in Vietnam, we weren't at all sure we would be doing so for very long. In retrospect, using this story as an escapist allegory to a less-desirable real world beat hell out of  following the example of the late Jim Morrison; I don't know whats gonna happen, man, but I aim to get my kicks before the whole thing goes up in flames. That philosophy knocked him off at age 27. Wishing that they could put this story on the screen, I was vastly let down by the animated feature of it during the 1970s, which modern-day Disney fare blows away in terms of imaginativeness. I don't know if you can even get that one on VHS and frankly I could care less. This film is a sprawling, mighty epic meant for big-screen TV tied into your stereo so that the rumbling subsonics in the soundtrack can give you the proper sense of vastness. Its very well cast as well. Viggo Morgensten as the laconic Eastwoodian drifter Aragorn. The booming, Falstaffian John Rhys-Davies as Gimli the Dwarf. Sean Bean as the emotional Boromir, a man too wrapped up in his own nationalism to see the big picture. I go along with one other reviewer who sees Cate Blanchett as a far too austere Galadriel, though. In the book, I saw Galadriel as more serene than icy. I think one side-effect of a really great role in a really great flick is that it absorbs the actor playing it. So I wasn't at all surprised to learn that the guys who played Frodo and Sam became very close friends in the course of the filming. And what a great idea to do the whole trilogy at once! That dodges two fatal pitfalls in a project this big, one being cast attritionin the Winds Of War/ War and Remembrance miniseries, two deaths and a case of actors boredom made it necessary to replace starring characters Natalie and Aaron Jastrow, as well as Byron Henry. And speaking of boredom, what better way to get around the attention deficit disorder found in much of the moviegoing audience? Now I don't have to worry that they might decide to scrap plans for at least one of the other two. People who are easily bored can whine and yawn all they wantmy copies of the other two films are probably already packaged and shrink-wrapped in some warehouse!",1028937600,2,2626,4.563559322033898
1321791,5,B00003CWT6,"I've been a Tolkien devotee for nearly 25 years and have needlessly raised my hopes over several attempts at bringing his masterwork to the screen, but Peter Jackson has done justice to what many agree may be the best literary work of the 20th century. This initial dvd offering features two discs -- one for the film itself (as released in theaters) and another for special features. ( A four-dvd edition will be released in November 2002.)

The film is a remarkable and faithful adaptation of the first volume of Tolkien's trilogy. Jackson masterfully carries this literary masterpiece into the 21st century with breathtaking sets, gorgeous costumes, sumptuous music, gloriously eye-popping special effects, and a touching attention to detail that evokes history-laden cultures. One does miss Tom Bombadil, and wonder why screenwriters decided to make Frodo ignorant of Bilbo's imminent departure from the Shire for example, but mostly one can understand the cinematic justification for changes that were made and just bathe in this beautiful film -- whether or not you are a devotee of JRR. If you are hesitant to see this film for fear of being disappointed -- race out and get it now. You will NOT be disappointed. From the introductory voiceover to a beautifully realized Hobbiton, the opening is mesmerizing and the film just keeps getting better, in some ways revealing Tolkien's rich and complex world even more clearly than the books. The characters are well-realized and the cast is exquisite. You can tell that the people who worked on this adaptation cared about the books even more than they cared about the bottom dollar, and I hope the awards start rolling in for Jackson, his right-hand man Richard Taylor and their talented cast and crew.

The special features include: three documentary features -- ""Welcome to Middle Earth"" (a publisher's in-store feature, 17 minutes), ""Quest for the Ring"" (originally aired on Fox TV, 22 minutes), and ""A Passage to Middle Earth"" (originally seen on the Sci Fi Channel, 40 minutes); fifteen featurettes about the cultures and locations depicted in the film; two teasers, a trailer and six tv spots; a preview of the extended dvd edition due out November 12, 2002; a preview of Entertainment Arts' video game, ""The Two Towers""; an 11-minute behind-the-scenes preview of the film, ""The Two Towers""; and an Enya video.

""Welcome to Middle Earth"" features a charming introduction to Robert Unwyn who, as a boy, originally reviewed The Hobbit for his publisher father and, fortunately for us all, gave the manuscript a thumbs-up with the comment ""should appeal to all children between the ages of 5 and 9"". Years later, as a publisher himself, he received the manuscript for The Lord of the Rings (originally presented as a single volume) and wrote to his father for advice, telling him that he thought the book was wonderful but would probably lose a thousand pounds; his father replied ""IF you believe this to be a work of genius, THEN you may lose the thousand pounds"" -- and off they went! This 17-minute feature also shows Tolkien's Oxford hall and home, describes two Houghton-Mifflin companion volumes and is really a wonderful treat for fans. The three features include interviews with Peter Jackson, WETA Workshop's Richard Taylor, artists Alan Lee and John Howe, and actors Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Billy Boyd, Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler and Sean Astin. The preview promises that ""The Two Towers"" will be amazing and one gets the impression that this team, as the fellowship members go their separate ways and new characters are introduced (including Gollum!), truly understand the story they are bringing to life, and will dazzle us all again soon.

There is something to be said for waiting until November and getting the four-dvd special edition, which will include 30 extra minutes of film (particularly in Hobbiton and concerning Gimli's enchantment with Galadriel). But for those of you who cannot wait -- this two-dvd set is highly recommended.",1028937600,,4150,5.080645161290323
1321792,5,B00003CWT6,"Before I begin, most people aren't considering buying this DVD. They think it's release is only a gimmick to make more cash before releasing the 4-disc Special Edition (complete with 30 minutes of deleted footage) set in November. Well, they're probably correct, but any serious fan wants every edition. (P.S. get the widescreen version.) This DVD is the version that Mr. Jackson and the editing team chose to release in theaters, so I believe it's essential to my collection. My review: The Fellowship of the Ring is overflowing with energy forged deep within the mind of Peter Jackson. Expertly crafted, he creates image after image of remarkable, unforgettable scenes, perfectly melding state of the art special effects with timeless literature. The entire cast is exemplary. Elijah Wood as Frodo, the courageous yet troubled hobbit, is a perfect choice, especially given the fact that he gives the best performance of his career. He matures gracefully on screen becoming hope for all who must conquer adversity or survive persecution. I'm a huge fan of film scores and this soundtrack instantly became one of my top five favorites. Howard Shore blows you completely away with an adventurous flowing rythym and enchants you with melodeous overtones. Absolutely exquisite. The last ten minutes of music, footage in the film sweep you off of your feet and place you gently within the courageous heart of Frodo Baggins. The Fellowship of the Ring is in class of it's own.",1028937600,,1471,5.082644628099174

Thought the DVD is good, I was disapointed to learn that a few important scenes were left off of this version, but are in the extended director's cut version.  If you have the extra money and patience to wait, I recommend getting that version so you can experience the full effect of the Lord of the Rings saga.",1028937600,,542,4.556701030927835

All the stuff about the location is fine and a lot of attention was given to the actors -all except CHRISTOPHER LEE! I feel that he had been slighted and not given his proper share of credit for being in this film, not even a mention from the director about how fortunate he was to have this man as part of his production.  Mr. Lee deserves better than this, it's like he was shoved into the background and of no real importance to this film - WRONG!!!

As far as the movie is concerned, I'll simply say that the movie is gorgeous in its cinematography.  The care that was taken to create Tolkien's ""Middle Earth"" universe are to my eyes extremely successful.  The mostly excellent performances are occassionally marred by a stupid line, or un-necessary comic relief from one of the Hobbits.  But don't let that distract you.  If you're looking for THE movie to show off your new home theater system, use ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and tell your neighbors to take cover!",1028851200,,733,4.607692307692307
1321796,5,B00003CWT6,"Roeper of Ebert & Roeper gave Lord of the Rings thumbs down, saying it's too long and found the plot silly. Ebert liked it but only gave it 3 because it didn't have elven songs from the book plus he claimed he was upset that the Hobbits weren't the heroes like in the books and needed people to protect them. I think he needs to read them again. Because Frodo Baggins isn't exactly Connan the Barbarian, he's a defenceless hobbit. In the books they need Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Boromir and Legalos just as much as they do in the movie. The Hobbits become braver and mnore comfident in themselves as the trilogy moves on. They basically come to realize that Gandalf, Agagorn and others won't always be there for them but not right away. Although the movie is missing some characters, like Tom Bombadil for example it's still a very extremely well accurate version of the book. Peter Jackson could of totally hacked the story to pieces like Simon Wells did with the Time Machine but he stays true to the books and gives the fans what they want. All the characters such as Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Legolas, Borormir, Gimli and others are extremely well played by each actor and make you believe they are really them. Sean Bean who usually plays villains gets to shine for once as a heroe as Boromir and does a really good job, probably should of been nominated alongside Ian Mckellen. I sort of just shrugged off Elijah Woods performance as Frodo the first time I saw it but now there's no doubt in my mind that he should of been nominatd. He goes from a cheerful and worryless hobbit to a troubled and frightened Hobbit remarkably well. His expressions of worry and panic are just fantasic. Viggo Mortenson shines as well as Aragorn, he has the character just right.
 Well anyway this is a long movie but if you could sit through Apocolyse Now Redux or The Godfather then you certainly could sit through an excellent adventure film with Hobbits, Orcs, Elves, Cave Trolls and Wizards. Some people say it just ends and says ""we'll see you next Christmas"" and it sort of does but at it least doesn't say ""see ya in another 3 years"" like StarWars does. Plus at least it delivers in entertainment before it just ends, I still can't see how anyone could not like it just because of that. It's the start of a trilogy so either way the first film is gonna end before giving you all of the story in one film. If it gave you all stories at once you'd have a 9 hour film then you'd really have a reason to complain about the length. To add to my review this extended edition is even better and if you didn't think the original version is enough like the book then this is definetely for you. Yes it's longer but it's surprisingy a lot better than the original version.",1028851200,,2761,4.467326732673268

1321800,5,B00003CWT6,"Books into movies... An age-old controversy.  Everyone has their opinion(s): ""The director won't do the book justice.""; ""Details will be overlooked, and/or changed.""; ""The spirit of the author will be overshadowed by the glamour of Hollywood."", etc., etc. All are sound arguments, and all, unfortunately, have been proven true throughout the past 100 years.
I've seen some of my favorite books tortured on the big screen, and others brought to life in a way I never expected and was left spellbound. I have been disappointed by the former and pleased by the latter, and sometimes vice-versa. I am, however, one of those who have not read the trilogy and was thus ""untainted"" by Tolkien's tale of Hobbits when I first viewed the movie. I was thus able to go without expectations and let Peter Jackson weave his (Tolkien's) tale before me.  And even if I had read the books, from what those around me (who did read the books) tell me, the movie was almost 100% faithful to the book, down to the most minute details.
Captivated from the very beginning, I became quite enchanted with the Shire, the Hobbits, and of course, Frodo. I instantly liked Bilbo and Gandalf, and immediately despised Sauron. The 9 Wraiths, the Orcs, and the Golems were just what I would've pictured these gruesome creatures to look like.  And they are even more vile when given the chance to freeze-frame the picture to see just how Jackson brought across the costuming to convey such evil.
Once the fellowship was formed, the rest of the ""party"" soon became a concern of mine. There were bits of comedy where needed, and several moments of heart-pounding excitement where necessary. ""Unseen"" Sauron scared me to death; never wanting to ever wear a ring. And you could actually feel the characters' struggles against the ring's ""calling"".
Character is vital to any picture, and Jackson did a marvelous job here. Although often the Hobbits seemed to be overshadowed by their taller counterparts (no pun intended), Frodo's choices, Bilbo's regrets and desires, and even Sam's stalwart friendship were strongly felt. Regretfully, the only human character I felt compassion for was Gandalf. His end(?) brought much sniffling. Perhaps my feelings for the other ""humans"" will change in the 2nd and 3rd installments.
Perhaps because I was not ""encumbered"" by having read the book and not knowing how the events would unfold and what would happen to the characters, I was able to take in the story and its players and not look for the liberties Jackson may have taken.
That is not to say that the movie was without my own reservations. The movie was, in my opinion, a tad long. At one point I wanted to scream ""Die already!"" regarding one of the death scenes. Would it never end? And did the river journey, and Gandalf's escape, have to be so elaborate?  But again, not having read the book(s), maybe I can't fault Jackson. After all, this was his interpretation of Tolkien's work, not mine.
Some of the character and locale names were difficult to understand and thus keep straight. Keeping-up was a challenge. (I am overwhelming pleased for the closed-captioning on the DVD.) With exceptions to Frodo and Gandalf, I found myself equating the character on the screen with the actor's name and not their character's name.
These are, in the end, minor trivialities, at least for me. I didn't grow up with these books, and they are not a part of a world countless many have cherished so dearly. I may not be able to quote the book or state, ""That happened at night in the book, not during the day!"", or ""That person didn't do that!"", but I can say that whenever a book adaptation is undertaken some liberties will be taken. And even if there were (and I'm sure there were), this final result was indeed a finely crafted work any Tolkien ""lover"" should be proud of. And if you disagree, just think: The end result could've been a heck of a lot worse...
Jackson has a tremendous vision for imagery, character, and direction. The actors, from Sir Ian McKellan, to Elijah Wood, to Cate Blanchett, and right on down the line, couldn't have been more hand-picked, and the most optimal of choices for their respective roles.  Everything about this movie says first-rate, devotion, detailed, and endearing.  It's a shame Jackson was overlooked for Best Director.  He can easily be compared to Spielberg, Lucas, Hitchcock, and others for their inate ability to tell a story and draw us in like nobody else and make us care(!) about the story and it's characters.
I look forward to multiple viewings of part 1, and wait with great anticipation for parts 2 & 3.  In the meantime, I will most definitely niche out time to become better acquainted with Tolkien's printed world.
I doubt I'll be disappointed.  And neither will you.",1028851200,,4779,4.811205846528623
1321866,5,B00003CWT6,"I received my DVD of the theatrical version of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring yesterday and had to view it immediately.  Although watching the film on a 27"" TV cannot compare to seeing it in a theater, I came away from the experience convinced that the first film of Peter Jackson's trilogy exceeded all of my expectations.
I have been a fan of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings since I first read it as a college student in the late sixties.  I've read it about every other year for the past thirty years and have discovered something new every time.  I felt the same way seeing the DVD last evening.  The film is so rich in it concept and execution that it can be viewed repeatedly without becoming stale.
As with any fictional work, especially a fantasy, a successful author (or, in this case, filmmaker) must draw the viewer into the imaginary world of the film and make them believe that world and its inhabitants exist.  Peter Jackson, along with the cast and production crew have done this magnificently.
I have been waiting for years for the art and technology of filmmaking to reach the point that it could do justice to Tolkien's masterpiece.  This film has succeeded in doing so.",1028851200,,1203,4.546296296296297
1321867,1,B00003CWT6,"I have to admit, I was pretty thrilled to open my newly purchased Fellowship of the Ring DVD.  But my joy turned to horror when the first thing that I saw in the DVD case was not the DVD itself, but a coupon for a $5 mail in rebate on the Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition coming out in November.  I felt like a sucker who just lost to the street gambler at the shell game.
For this, I would like to personally thank George Lucas and Lucasfilm's marketing division for making it popular to rerelease a movie 5 different times, all with different versions (original, THX, special edition, special edition widescreen, and the version that has all the previews of Episode 1.......you know what I'm talking about).
Anyone that likes to get the most bang for the buck should wait for the different version out in November and not waste their money on the ""butchered"" or ""sub-par"" movie release edition.",1028851200,3,903,4.567901234567901

1321869,5,B00003CWT6,"You can't make a novel into a film without losing something. Important things from the book are lost. The gentle ""Englishness"" of the Hobbits is only hinted at. The songs and stories, the love of food, tea, and ""Southfarthing leaf"" that makes the world of the Shire worth saving is only faintly present. The song and stories of the elves are barely present. I do miss those things. But Jackson would have needed six movies to leave all that in. This film does tell the story quite well. It captures the epic scope of the tale. It has the moral core intact. It is done as rightly as it could be done. It is exciting to experience. I dreaded seeing the first installment. Now I eagerly await ""The Two Towers.""
The Lord of the Rings was written by a man out of the nineteenth century who saw the rise of ""industrialized evil"" in the bloody twentieth century. To me, it has always seemed a requiem for a happier if poorer life. It also seemed to be about the necessity of that loss when evil rises over the world. Tolkien wrote that he hated allegory, but one cannot see the rise and fall of fascism is Europe and not see the lidless eye. This is a great book made into a different, but still great film. I recommend it heartily.
Some notes on the DVD itself: I'm not so attached to special features that I like 2+ disc sets. This is a 2 disc set, with more discs coming in an extended version later this year. This movie cost so much to make, I understand the need to sell the movie more than once, and I hope they do make money -- it should be possible to do a job this well and profit by it.

1321870,5,B00003CWT6,"That scene at the beginning with the huge armies battling this evil warrior just knocked my socks off when I was in a theater with dts sound.  I was most looking forward to seeing that again (along with the scenes of Frodo wearing the ring); only on my small pc dvd system.  I knew the DVD would test my sound so I bought an Altec Lansing 251 5.1 sound system a week before this dvd was to arrive and promptly removed that middle speaker making it 4.1 instead.  Hated that middle speaker.  Testing everything from Star Wars Episode 1 to Pearl Harbor to Godzilla 1998 all DVDs with exceptional sound.  I decided that I've had AM radios that sounded better than that little speaker.  But with the 4.1 setup and EX sound selected from the dvd sound menu FOTR (like the others mentioned) just sounds like an epic.  It's not a movie theater with dts sound but as close as I could get on my budget.  Add my 19 inch ViewSonic monitor and I was happy.  This will be a dvd I watch on special occations.  The picture is definately better than expected.  The character closeups are colorful and smooth with no noticable grain on my system.  Watching AI:  Artificial Intelligence recently I was disappointed that a current movie could be so grainy (Titanic was the same).  But FOTR is colorful and vibrant.  For sound and picture a solid 5 stars.  We get a LOT of short features, 10 minute preview of The Two Towers (part 2 of the LOTR trilogy...am I the only one who is losing sleep waiting for it?), trailers and tv spots, lame EA game preview (""...and players will be so immersed in the game environment they won't be able to tell if they are playing it or watching the movie."" Right),  Enya's beautiful video, and more.  What we don't get is the special extended version with 30 mintues of extra scenes and new music.  You'll have to pay extra for it.  Will I buy it?  Does a hobbit have hairy feet?  Be sure to get this widescreen version instead of pan&scan.  If you don't believe me then check the net for examples of the difference between the two formats.
Quick review of the movie itself.  Peter Jackson (the director) obviously knows his ""Tolkien"" even though you sure have to search the dvd before you see that name printed out (why not TOLKIEN'S The Lord of the Rings right on the front?  The man spend years developing this epic).  It would be fortunate for us to be able to view this same material done by a modern director who feels that long periods of dialogue without any setpieces (action or special effect) is disasterous in modern moviemaking.  Back to back effects with rediculous interactions by male actors who look like underwear models and females who've retired from Beverly Hills 90210.  The moments at the elvin city are among my favorite.  I was glued to my seat (while others choose this moment to visit the restroom).  I found nothing to dislike about FOTR.  From the beginning to the end it's my personal most favorite movie replacing my favorite since 1977 Close Encounters.  Way ta go Peter Jackson.  After the next 2 lets go back and REALLY see how Bilbo got that ring and unleased a very po'd dragon.  But please call it J.R.R. TOLKEIN's The Hobbit.",1028851200,,3175,4.521968365553603
1321871,5,B00003CWT6,"I had read ""The Hobbit"" in 7th grade, thought is was just okay.  In addition, I was put off by Lord of the Rings books. I never saw The Fellowship of the Rings when it was playing in theaters because I was uninterested in what I thought would be a bizarre Dungeons & Dragons-type film.  (my favorite movies, for reference: The Natural & Field of Dreams).  I saw the FOTR on DVD last night and was blown away.  The acting was spotless (even the usually detestable Elijah Wood did a great job), and unlike so many recent films, FOTR doesn't tell its story with the assumption that the viewer is an idiot (read: George Lucas).  Much of the drama goes unspoken (the way a film should be), such as (spoiler ahead) Frodo's pained look when Gimli tries to axe the Ring - you can see he has already become attached to it (like his uncle was).  Simply awesome.  There seems to be layer after layer to this story and I look forward to reading the books.  I've been thinking about the film all day and can't wait to see it again.  I am almost speechless at how much I enjoyed this flic, and I am not one to get overly excited about movies.

1321872,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson's first part of the collossal Lord of the Rings trilogy is nothing short of a brilliant masterpiece, with incredible SFX, great characters, and staying true to J.R.R Tolkien's story while altering some of the book's elements to make it more suitable for film.
Deeply rooted in the fantasy genre, Fellowship of the Rings sees a young Hobbit Frodo Baggins inherit a powerful mystical ring from his cousin Bilbo Baggins. The ring, worn by Sauron, the Dark Lord has ben passed down through many people until it reaches Bilbo. The mighty wizard Gandalf and a troop of dwarfes, elves and hobbits set out on a journey to destroy the dangerous ring by casting it back into the lava of Mt. Doom. But of course, there are bad guys, in the form of Saruman the White, played with relish by the brilliant Christopher Lee and his army of Orcs and Ringwaiths.
Director Peter Jackson (Heavenly Creatures, The Frighteners) has taken Tolkein's story and molded it into the perfect fantasy adventure. Some characters that were ciphers in the novel have been elevated to main characters, and while some purists may be upset over the loss of some characters, Jackson does do service to the story's originality. And the result? In a Hollywood summer of dissapointments, Fellowship was the standout, one of those rare films that come along like The Matrix that remind us of why we like movies in the first place.
In a film as ambitious as this, all the key elements are in place, the masterful storytelling, Jackson's brilliant visionary direction, superb acting (especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo), incredible visual effects and the wealth of imagination from Tolkien's extraordinary tome. The suppourting cast is great too, with John Rhys- Davies as Gimli the dwarf, Sean Bean as Boromir and Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf.
The film takes us where we've never been before, Tolkein's world of Wizards, elves, ringwaiths, orcs and all the other imaginative creatures on display are a thrill to watch. For such a huge scale, the use of CG is of course neccesary, and the visuals are incredible, utilising state-of-the-art technology to create entire landscapes, creatures and battles. The seamless blend of FX and amazing cinematography is breath-taking. Howard Shore's brooding score adds another layer of excellence to the myraid of adventurous escapism. There are problems; the film gets very dark at times and the ending feels somewhat of an anti- climax, but we all know that the real battles are yet to come. This is a film that takes you far beyond your imagination.",1028851200,,2593,4.976958525345622

As I finished the movie, I was amazed at how quickly 3 hours had passed.  And more amazingly was how truly thrilled I was by this movie.  I wasn't even bothered by the fact that I'll have to see 2 more movies to see how well the director tells the rest of the story.
The fact that so much attention to detail has been spent is obvious.  From the lived-in look of the hobbit homes to the costumes of the characters, you feel totally  immersed in this film.
The only problems with this movie are some of the facts/events that were left on the cutting floor (after all, they already had 3 hours up there!)  The signifigance of the cloaks given to the Fellowship, as well as the food they carry with them were deleted from the movie, but appear to be included with the extended cut movie.

1321905,4,B00003CWT6,"I don't believe my viewpoint has ever been more polarized on a movie. There are two ways to approach reviewing this film and each leads to a very different conclusion.
The first approach is to review from a purely cinematic point of view. Does Fellowship of the Ring work as a movie in and of itself? The answer is a resounding ""yes."" It is ripe with lush visuals, charged and touching emotion, directorial and performance excellence, richly detailed props and special effects that enhance rather than overshadow the story. Others have chosen this reviewing angle and so I will not expound upon its film-for-film's-sake virtues except to say that I liked it enough to have seen the film twice in the theater at full price. A full five stars from this perspective.
But the second approach is to compare the movie to its challenging literary source material. Is Fellowship of the Rings an accurate interpretation of Tolkien's masterwork? The answer this time is a (just as resounding) ""no."" And not by a long shot. The film abounds with alterations to both the plot and motivation of its characters. So much so that I was literally on pins and needles throughout the film awaiting the next sacrilege.
The pre-release press for Fellowship of the Rings paid heavy homage to director Peter Jackson's religious adherence to the source material. In light of this, I was appalled to see how often and how casually he departed from the book, even when there was no good excuse to do so. Certainly Jackson could not make an unabridged version of the novel without creating a 20-part series; but the argument that his every change was in the interest of condensing the story into an acceptable theatrical-length release just doesn't ring true. There was considerable material added to the film, the sole purpose of which was to either enhance the romantic relationship between Aragorn and Arwen, or increase the action-packed-thrills-n-spills aspect of the film. In both cases the film was made longer, not shorter, and in my opinion these additions (though perhaps to be expected) did not enhance the film enough to justify the omission of other more important source material.
....
So as an accurate interpretation of Tolkien's work, Jackson's Fellowship fails to deliver. While in its essence and its generalities Jackson's version seems faithful to the original, in its details and in so many ways, it is anything but and earns only two stars in this respect.
I know it sounds like I hate this movie; I don't. My rating of 4 is an average between my rating of 5 in the film-for-film's-sake review and 2 in the film-as-interpretation review. There can be no doubt that Fellowship is a rip-roaring modern-style action/adventure/fantasy tale--a true classic in the genre--but any Tolkien fan not willing to accept this movie on those terms is bound to be disappointed.",1028764800,4,2858,4.943866943866944
1321906,5,B00003CWT6,"Since I originally reviewed this movie when it first came out this review will cover the DVD aspects. Plus what else can be said that hasn't been said before about the movie? This has got to be one of the best movies ever produced from a book. After reading the books many times I can safely say I was not one bit disappointed in Peter Jackson's vision.
The DVD has, of course, many benefits. The crystal clear clarity, the sound options, the ability of one to pick scenes to go to. You know, the normal stuff. Where this DVD takes off is the amount of special features. The second disc is 2 hours of special features, from trailors to special reports to the making of the movie to the music video, etc. It also covers the fact that in November they will be releasing the ""expanded edition"" which adds 30 minutes of cut footage and new music. Since I didn't know that would be available until AFTER I bought this I was a little miffed at first. But then I realized I wasn't going to be able to wait to buy this anyways so it really didn't matter. I have had this DVD for 2 days and have been glued to the tube since.
If you possibly can wait until November then I would recommend purchasing the expanded version. From the decription on Amazon it will be awesome. If you're like me, then what the heck, buy now and buy in November. Peter Jackson will thank you.",1028764800,,1360,4.2957198443579765

1321908,5,B00003CWT6,"It is always difficult to translate the Big Screen to the small screen (no matter how good your TV and stereo are) but, in the opinion of this reviewer, the drama of the movie comes across well.  Much has been said about the merits of Peter Jackson's adaptation -- and Tolkien fans will be arguing those points for many years to come.  But the presentation of this DVD set is just tremendous.  The bonus material just whets one's appetite for both the Director's Cut and the next movie.
I have one friend who purchased a DVD player -- just to watch this movie.  In my view, this was money very well spent.
Yes, I'll get the expanded set in November -- but this sure is a good start.",1028764800,,682,4.3046875
1321909,5,B00003CWT6,"OK.  Serious fans should wait - like I should have.  But hey!  Its only [money].  The movie is excellent.  In some ways it adds life to some characters that the books left flat.  It does a better job of pacing than the books, and tells a better story.
Don't get me wrong book lovers, I like the books also.  Nothing can substitute for the imagination, but the parts the movie left out and other parts that were expanded upon made for a well rounded movie.  For example:
Tom Bombadil:  The ring has no effect on him.  This kind of takes away from the ring's 'hype' so to speak.  Its an all powerfull ring that the entire fate of middle earth hangs upon, but wait here is one guy that it has no effect over.  See what I mean, this takes away from the importance of the ring.  And the book's explanation as to why Tom couldn't keep the ring...he'd probably forget about it and lose it one day.  Good job movie for leaving this part out!
Saruman:  The first book didn't give a good enough account about the army he was amassing or what took place between him an Gandalf.  And furthermore, you didn't have to wade through one of Gandalf's standard 'I'll tell you what happened there 100 pages from now"" speeches.
Songs:  None!  I always skipped over the indented parts of the books.  Songs that went on for pages and pages that didn't contribute anything more that 53 new elven names and or locations that were never mentioned again.  But it looks like at least one will be in the Nov. edition.
It's a good movie and DVD, but I'll probably cave and buy the special edition in Nov. also.",1028764800,,1581,4.3493150684931505
1321910,4,B00003CWT6,"This is a great movie.  I wasn't surpised that Jackson decided to leave out a few minor characters and the parts where they stop to sing every 150 meters, that gets a little old in the books.  The problem with a movie is that it can never equal the readers imagined world.  However, it is difficult to imagine any movie ever coming closer than this one.
I thought the special effects were better than the latest star wars installment, especially the balrog and all the tricks they do with Gandalf and the Hobbits height.  The theme of the story is well presented in the movie, they don't insult your intelligence with beating you over the head with it 10 times, (Like Fight Club did, but I like that movie too.)  They only reason I would give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am far too picky about movies for my own good and this movie didn't have quite enough of an impact on me to elevate it to 5 star status.  I would give it 4 and a half if I could.",1028764800,,958,4.151351351351352

I rented this DVD more out of curiosity to see what all the ""hub-bub"" was about over this movie.  Well, it was a good movie; lots of action, a good story, great filming, but I am so tired of people saying that the books in the LOTR trilogy are the greatest pieces of literature ever to grace the printed page and that this movie is the greatest film ever made.  Get a life!  It's a movie, folks.  Agreed, a good movie, but JUST a movie.  I must admit, some parts of this movie I found a bit boring.  The movie really got cooking after about 1 1/2 hour, but the first part did seem to drag a little bit.  The acting was good overall.  Anyway, please don't send me hate mail over this.  I respect all the people that really love this movie and the books.  In fact, I am going to start reading the LOTR trilogy today just out of curiosity to see how different the book is from the movie and to see what happens to these interesting characters.

This DVD contains the cinematic version of the movie.  As far as dvd's go, the extra content leaves a bit to be desired.  The first disk contains only the movie.  The second disk has featurettes from the official web site, the ... show about the movie, the ...""making of"" special and some other footage.  Unfortunately a lot of the the material is repeated from one feature to the next.  Other bonus features include the Enya video, and a pre-view of the LOTR video game. There's also a behind the scenes look at the Twin Towers, and information about the extended DVD which will be released in November of 2002...
The extended DVD will contain an extra 30 minutes of footage that was cut from the original version to keep it under 3 hours.  It will also contain several commentaries from the director, crew, and cast, and contain 2 disks full of detailed behind-the-scene footage, story boards, picture galleries, etc.  (For more information about the extended dvd, see the official website - lordoftherings.net.)
True hardcore fans may buy this first version of the dvd and feel ripped off when they discover there's another one coming out in November with more stuff.  However, it's been promised that the bonus material on the extended dvd will not be the same as the bonus features on the first one...also, the first dvd is the only one with the behind-the-scenes glimpse of the Two Towers and the cinematic version of the film.  I suppose the case can be made for buying both, as each has a slightly different version of the movie.

I know this isn't as cool as the Special Edition four disc DVD set coming out in November with 30 minutes of extra footage incorporated into the film. But still, don't wait until November to buy this movie. This is still a well made DVD, with great picture and sound. The bonus features are great also.

Now you can own the magic of The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring with the brand new double decker DVD edition of the film. The DVD has an amazing selection of special features including 15 featurettes created for the lordoftherings.net,a ten minute previw of the Lord of the Rings The Two Towers ,Enya's ""May It Be"" Music Video,and Three In Depth Features.
The film alone has won four Acamdy Awards including a nomination for Best Picture. The movie got four awards and got nominared for 13 awards. The film won for Best Cinematography,Make-up,Score,and Visual Effects. The film is amazing and the DVD is one of my favorites.
The film had to be two disc even it it wasn't so popular because of it's lenght. The film is 178 minutes or an estimate of three hours. The second disc is filled of special features listed above. The lenght is the only reason that I had to give this film four stars. After a while it tends to get dull because you get restless or at least I do.
The only thing I did not like about the DVD is that it had no commentaries. I guess for that I will have to wait for the Special Extended Edition Four Disc DVD in November.
But lets forget the DVD and talk about the movie itself. I thought that The Lord of the Rings;The Fellowship of the Ring would not do good but I was wrong. The film got awards and praise and then I decided to go and see it. I was glad. The critics and the reveiwers were right.
The cast really made the movie what it was. Elijah Wood was never really my favorite actor and I hated him in Flipper so that was a downer for me but he made up for that. Flipper was a really long time ago and his talent might of grown but I loved it. Liv Tyler was always one of my favorite actresses. The rest of the cast includiing Sean Bean and Ian McKellan were new to me.
I don't want to tell you anything about this wonderful film. Peter Jackson is a wonderful director and writer and without J.R.R. Tolkien. He is the real maker of the film.

1321976,5,B00003CWT6,"The makers of Lord of the Rings invested incredible time, energy and talent in bringing Fellowship of the Ring to life. Their results would have proven intensely satisfying to Tolkein himself, author of Lord of the Rings.
Faithfully putting amazing effort into creating the world of Middle Earth, the attention to detail is evident in every frame of the film. Director Peter Jackson demanded the absolute best from every artist involved in the production. Sets for Hobbiton, Bag End and Rivendell were astounding efforts, made full sized and matching the description given by Tolkein with unrelenting exactitude.
The actors were perfectly suited to the roles they portrayed, particularly the characters of Gandalph the Wizard, Frodo Baggins, Samwise and Aragorn. Liv Tyler gives an amazing performance as Arwen. The Black Riders (Nazgul) were rendered with terrifying accuracy.
This production is to film what Shakespeare is to literature. While a bit longish, there is never wasted time or superfluous shots. The entire film is wholly satisfying to Tolkein fans who loved the books and were sorely disappointed by past efforts to dramatize Lord of the Rings.
I am amazed that there are sundry individuals who gave a bad review to this film. This speaks more to the character of the reviewer than the quality of the film itself, or perhaps failed to grasp the depth of Tolkein's writing. Do not allow yourself to be dissauded from seeing, and owning, this film by reviews penned by those who lack appreciation for the artistic merit and monumental effort of the filmmakers of LOTR. Read the books, see the film, and I am certain you will see how wonderfully the movie captures the spirit Tolkein intended.
There is no film of recent vintage that I would recommend more highly than Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring. Certainly no film of recent vintage has put forth more effort, more artistic faithfulness, nor inspired creative talent than the makers of this film. Working more than a year before production actually started, they transformed the New Zealand countryside into Hobbiton. They did so with amazing purity and faithfulness to Tolkein's work.
This film is excellent beyond my ability to praise appropriately. The best way to appreciate the film is to read Tolkein, then see the film yourself. You will discover, as I did, that the images Tolkein inspires in your mind have come to life in Lord of the Rings!",1028678400,25,2427,5.00990099009901
1321977,5,B00003CWT6,"It takes a lot in a film to fully satisfy me. Not many movies do. But one film has captured my imagination beyond all others: The Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Rings.
Peter Jackson's tremendous dedication to the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien is breathtaking. Jackson, a life long fan of the books, put all his energy into creating an amazingly accurate film version. Filming all three movies at once, and incorporating a cast and crew of thousands, he has crammed in so much detail in this world that for the first time, it really exists.
Jackson knows how to adapt the book's difficult scenes into a working film. The pacing is exquisite, lingering long enough on beautiful shots of the New Zealand/Middle Earth countryside, on the faces of the film's perfect cast, to let the emotion and awe of it to sink in. All the actors become their characters, most notably, Ian McKellen. The music is among the best of any epic film, from the delightful joyous hobbit theme to the beautifully haunting Elvish music in Lament for Gandalf.
There is not one detail left unattended to in this film, and I am eagerly awaiting the Two Towers and Return of the King. So far, Jackson has surpassed the world's expectations, and here's to him continuing that trend.",1028678400,,1249,4.681818181818182
1321978,4,B00003CWT6,"First off, I want to say that I enjoyed this movie and found it better than I'd expected, with wonderful special effects and a clear attempt to be faithful to Tolkien's structure and plot. It was clear that this was not just another Hollywood vehicle but a serious effort - from the casting to the script.
 Even so, I found some significant shortcomings in the movie. I felt that the book's emotional and spititual essence did not reverberate through this movie. Perhaps this was simply because this was an ""introductory"" movie, one of only several to follow and the director felt that the plot needed to be emphasized. But I didn't find myself thinking about this movie for days nor did I find that it had an emotional resonance, the kind of resonance that makes you want to see the movie again and again (just as I wanted to re-read the books). There were a few words of wisdom that stood out but, for the most part, it seemed as though emphasis was given to action and adventures at the loss of characterization.
 I know there are plenty out there who will disagree with me and I can certainly agree that Hollywood could have done worse. Elijah Wood is a warm and winning Frodo and others in the cast are equally appealing - to a point. But I urge viewers to think carefully about what makes a movie a classic, especially movies which have elements of fantasy. I'd argue that there has to be something enduring, a movie that goes beyond state of the art special effects and spectacle and gives equal weight to Tolkien's words, language and enduring soul. I didn't quite find that depth in this movie.",1028678400,3,1603,4.5432525951557095

I lost the book about 10 years ago and I'm thinking of getting a new one to check against the movie because I'm not so sure I understood the book as well as I thought. The scene in the mines was everything I hoped I'd be.

1322054,5,B00003CWT6,"Why didn't this movie win the Oscar for Best Motion Picture?
For an adaptation of a book, this film is perfect.  Every little detail was covered and covered extremely well.  It once seemed that the size and scale of the books would make it impossible to be adapted into a movie, but Peter Jackson hit every mark right on the nail.  In every essence of this, he stayed true to Tolkien's epic visions of fantasy grandeur.
The cast was portrayed perfectly.  There could have been no better an Aragorn than Viggo Mortensen, none as passionate to play Frodo than Elijah Wood.  I loved Sean Bean's performance, he gave his all to the spirit of Boromir, and in the end when he was tempted by the Ring, he was perfect-you could vividly see the turmoil in his eyes, and that is something not often found in an actor.  The elves were made up perfectly-even Galadriel, whose portrayal by Cate Blanchet I was not very fond of.  I enjoyed the hobbits' role as the comedic effect-they did it well.  And Gandalf.  Not enough can be said about Gandalf.  Ian McKellen's role as the wonderful wizard was better than perfect-Gandalf is one of those roles where you can either do it well, or make a complete fool of yourself.  McKellen was definitely the former.
The special features on this DVD were something worth mentioning, too.  I loved all the little featurettes and 'making-of' programs, which went into great depth of the movie.  I was surprised to see the several-minute long featurette about The Two Towers, that gave me a better understanding of it-can't wait to see that one in theatres.  I saw this movie four times in theatres and was thrilled to finally be able to watch it in my own home and I can not wait to get the four-disc collector's edition, it is sure to be as good as this one.",1028678400,,1783,4.53125
1322055,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is a wonderful experience, as well as an excellent adaptation of the book.  YES, there are differences, but I feel that they are justified because of the change in storytelling mechanism.  Face it, Gandalf explaining about Saruman's treachery is dull in a movie, as faithful as that may be to the book.  Here are some insights into the story that I never got from repeated readings of FoTR:
- The horror of the deforestation of Isengard.  (Did Tolkien have some sort of anti-technology bias, or what?)
- A real understanding of why Aragorn was reluctant to be king; because Isildur was such a huge screw-up and he didn't think he could do better!  (And face it, a Ranger walking around with only the supplies on his back would be STUPID to carry around the shards of Narsil.  They BELONG in Rivendell in a museum.  Thanks for fixing Tolkien's mistake.)
- The politics of the Fellowship; how Elrond had to placate a lot of factions.
- How tempting the ring is.  You can hear it *whispering* to people all the time... creepy.
- Arwen getting real stuff to do instead of being some sort of trophy wife.  Though I hated that she stole Frodo's defiance at the ford.
Some things I didn't like at all:
- Frodo was a lot more valiant than that.  I hated the many, many reaction shots of him just looking stricken.
- I really missed Gimli-Legolas interaction.  I wonder if they've jettisoned that plotline entirely.
- Galadriel.  Ugh.  I think they should have let the actress do that scene herself, with lighting changes much like Galdalf's menacing of Bilbo.
- Galadriel.  She is VERY important.  She narrates the opening.  Yet we don't see interactions between her and Gimli, or her and Sam, that have deep meaning for later.
This movie is far more than special effects.  It helps you focus on the major themes of the book, rather than being distracted by Tolkien's language or flood of background detail.  Try to clear your mind and focus on essentials, and take another look.",1028678400,,1982,4.646551724137931

1322061,5,B00003CWT6,"I want to start by saying that I am a long-time Tolkien fan, but this review is not about the literary masterpiece, but the movie based on the masterpiece.
I was perusing the myriad 1500+ reviews for this DVD, and noticed the few-and-far-between single star reviews.  Many of the people who rated this movie as 1 star all but state that they have never read the books and don't understand the movie adaptation.  It does help to have read the book prior to watching the film, but it is not necessary.  For those people who thought they were going to see Harry Potter, they were sorely surprised.
Harry Potter is rated PG because it is family friendly, but deals with mythical powers that some children may not be able to understand.
LOTR, on the other hand is rated PG-13 for a good reason as well.  It is violent.  It isn't violent because ""Hollywood"" knows that violence sells, but because it is true to the basics original story.
Tolkien didn't create a fun-filled romp through Never Never Land.  He designed and built a mythology based on a world caught in the depths of an epic Good vs. Evil struggle and how that turmoil was overcome.  ""The Hobbit"" was created as a children's bedtime story.  The LOTR series is definitely darker and visually is not for the faint of heart.
As for the special effects involved with this movie...  Some have stated that this movie is all about the computer generated effects.  Yes and no.  There are tremendous effects involved, but only to bolster the story and keep it true to Tolkien's grand vision.
This movie could not have been made without the top-of-the-line and newly invented CGI processes.  In addition, it could not have lived up to the epic scope as it was intended if it had been created completely on a soundstage with painted backgrounds and Vern Troyer (Mini Me) running around carrying a ring trying to save the world.
Basically what I'm saying is that the people who are distracted by the incredible special effects and use that as a basis to bash this film may simply have ADHD and they should really get that checked out.",1028592000,,2079,4.619565217391305
1322062,1,B00003CWT6,"Let me say that The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the BEST movies ever made and I am VERY happy to have it on DVD.  But beyond the movie itself, the 2 DVD set I just bought was very disappointing.  The ""extra"" features included are nothing but the same interviews and behind-the-scenes footage rehashed nearly a dozen times over the course of four TV features and a dozen or so web-featurettes.  By the time I was finished with the nearly two-and-a-half hours of Extra features I was almost sick with boredom from seeing actors and the director make the SAME comments from the SAME interviews nearly half-a-dozen times in each of the different features and many of the featurettes.  The Two Towers footage was the only real treat.  What upsets me most is that I have to now wait THREE MONTHS in order to BUY THE MOVIE AGAIN! - just to see the additional 1/2 hour of footage not included in the theatrical release (among other extra features - rumored to be more in depth than the ones included here).  Because this was such a great movie, I did not want to wait another three months to view it at home.  If you can wait another three months to own the definitive version of this excellent movie, then I recommend it. ...",1028592000,14,1246,4.414847161572053
1322063,5,B00003CWT6,"I waited for two or three years for this film to come out.  I have been a Tolkien fan since the age of eight, when I read The Hobbit.  I waited and hoped that I would not be disappointed.  I was not.  Indeed, it transended all of my wildest dreams.  I was especially impressed with Rivendale; it was exactly as I had pictured it in my mind.  The special effects struck me as better than any other movie that I have seen in my life.  It seamed more realistic because of the setting.  It didn't have to incorporate any of our modern day junk into it.
One of the things that made me the happiest was to find out who was playing Saruman.  I have long been a fan of Christopher Lee, and feel that he doesn't usually get a part that befits him.  I haven't seen him in anything for a long time and it was wonderful watching an old villian return in honor and glory.  Especially since he is the last one alive of the great horror movie group of the '50's and '60's.  This role seemed to fit him wonderfully.  He brought more life to the role than I had ever imagined was possible.  I can only hope that he does as well in the next installment.
As in all films, this one is not perfect.  The thing that bugged me the most was the way that Merry and Pippin were portrayed.  They are more like blundering idiots than intelligent spy-like characters that they are.  They don't pull their weight as they did in the books.  There were things that were skipped that were desperately needed.  The thing that pulls the whole going away together was not used.  They needed to show more of how hobbit-like Frodo was, instead of making him seem more like a human, which might be easier for us to relate to, but that is what Aaragorn is there for.  Also, the introducing of characters that are not supposed to be there was very annoying.
On the whole, this was a magnificent effort.  The actors were well chosen and the film was well researched.  They looked beyond just the trilogy and looked at The Lost Tales for more information, which helped cinematic viewers that want to know all of the secrets without any hassle.  A commendable film.",1028592000,,2121,4.324873096446701

1322127,5,B00003CWT6,"Unfortunately I have not read the LOTR books. I have read the Hobbit, however, so had some vague idea about all this before the film. And then I went to see it.
  Words, also unfortunately, simply fail me when it comes to describing it. The film is faultless. The cast are perfect, headed by Elijah Wood as worried Hobbit Frodo and Ian McKellen as wise wizard Gandalf. The story's praises don't need to be sung thanks to the legendary books that based it. The music is rousing and passionate. The ending is on just the right note to enfuriate you at having to leave, and ensure that you'll return for more. And even at almost three hours, I still wanted to sit and be told more.
  Peter Jackson's direction is enchanting, in one of the most picturesque epics of all time. And it is an epic - the finished trilogy will make the badly cast Star Wars prequels look like B-Movies. Yet it has so much more than visuals to offer. Everything comes together. It pulses with atmosphere, particular in the tunnel scenes when the Orcs attack... it's nail biting stuff. There isn't a moment of the movie that seems wasted.
  It feels like so much more than a simple movie, so much so that you simply don't want to stop watching when it's over. No doubt Two Towers will have just as well timed an ending. The question remains, will this dauntingly perfect masterpiece topple the matrix? I'm not doubting it. Because although that's brilliant, it's basing most on looks... and LOTR could survive on cast and script alone.
  It's pointless even trying to descibe the film. Just please, watch it. It is the finest movie I've ever seen. It is beyond perfect. It is beyond critisism. See it and be astounded.",1028592000,4,1690,4.554455445544554

1322129,4,B00003CWT6,"It's about time a film like this be made. The book is the greatest piece of fantasy ever written. It has influenced every modern work of the genre to come after it. It deserves to be made into a film. But besides that, I don't think people realize how much we sorely need a truly good, original fantasy film these days. There have been so many attempts at it, and all have failed. Ron Howard failed with Willow. Rob Reiner failed with The Princess Bride. Steven Spielberg failed with Hook. Ridley Scott failed with Legend. Chris Colombus failed with Harry Potter. Now, finally, where all these filmmakers have failed, director Peter Jackson has succeeded.
The Lord of the Rings trilogy is about a group of men, dwarves, elves, and hobbits who try to destroy the One Ring, a magical artifact forged by the dark lord Sauron as a way to channel his power and control Middle-Earth. It is from this simple premise that the film takes off, and what ensues is a very enjoyable, very epic tale.
There is something to be said for ""using your imagination"" to conjure up images while reading a book, but nothing compares to the grand, unbelievably striking images and visuals that fill this adaptation. The direction is nothing short of amazing: the art direction and visual aspect of the film is some of the best I've ever seen. The settings and scenery are vast and you never see the same type of land twice. Valleys, mountains, snowy peaks, caves, forests, riverbeds, it's almost too much to keep track of. The sets are huge and varied, and the massive amount of detail in them reminds me of films like Gladiator. They have a great quality of consistency, as well: the architecture and style of buildings changes as you travel throughout Middle-Earth and enter places inhabited by different cultures. Seeing how each culture has its own style in everything from architecture to weaponry is a sight to behold; it makes this fantasy world real.
The story has a soul, and what a soul it is, full of character development and themes of friendship, courage, sacrifice, and unlikely heroes. At its core, it is a study on one thing: power, as represented by the One Ring. Through all the characters and situations we encounter, a new facet of the responsibility of power is shown. Virtually every character in the story has to, at one point, make a decision regarding what they would do with the ring - no one is left unscathed, so to speak. It creates a blanketing, all-encompassing theme, one that isn't merely discussed here and there, but is rather brought up all the time as the story unfolds. The excitement is in watching each character's reaction to the notion of power in the form of that tiny little ring.
Elijah Wood stands out as Frodo; his unnaturally large eyes project the innocence of Frodo's character. But the most impressive actors are Ian McKellan and Sean Bean, because of the different dimensions they bring to their roles. McKellan inhabits his role as Gandalf, and it's a wonder that, at one point, Sean Connery was once considered for this part. McKellan is a great actor, and here he not only projects majesty but also makes Gandalf a very human character at the same time, capable of great compassion and temptation as well. Sean Bean rivals this with his portrayal of Boromir, and it is such a crucial role too; he convinces the audience he is a good man, just one with a tragic flaw. It's probably the best performance of the film, and one of the best of the year.
Action-wise, the first part of the film is made up of the Black Riders looking for the ring and chasing the hobbits, and it simply does not work. The Riders always, always appear where the hobbits are going. They're an omnipresence, and it ruins any suspense we may feel because we realize there's no point to the film having the hobbits try to hide from them -- they'll pop up anyway. There are also examples of very poor choices made during some of the chases, such as using extensive slow motion during a supposed fast-paced pursuit scene. Why the filmmakers decided on this, I don't know.
However, the rest of the film contains much more entertaining and ambitious kinds of action. The prologue contains glimpses of the kind of colossal-scale battles we'll be treated to in the sequels, camera flying over the vast armies to give us a full sense of scale. The other major action sequences are much smaller-scale versions of this, but they work very effectively. The Mines of Moria action sequence is intense and claustrophobic and is the first time we get to see the members of the fellowship fight in battle. The finale is an extended sequence that contains violent, intense action (this is one of the most graphic PG-13 films I've ever seen) and very satisfying emotional thrills, as well, as certain characters reach the heights of their development.
Despite some weak action as well as rushed editing and pacing problems in the first half, this is a great movie, a three hour long movie that I honestly felt was two hours long. It is, without a doubt, one of the most gorgeous films ever made. They have created Middle-Earth. Each frame of the movie is like a painting in itself, everything is set up so perfectly yet so naturally in the environments. Even the most mundane shots of a forest or a glade seem so perfect.
FOTR is probably the best straight-out fantasy film I've ever had the privilege to see. Like Star Wars, it takes you away to a different world. To see FOTR is to see the heights to which cinematic visual artistry can reach. To see it is to become a living part of Middle-Earth.

1322173,5,B00003CWT6,"When this film made it's theatrical debut, it did not receive a glowing review in the pages of a local paper (Desert Post Weekly in Palm Springs) for which I write DVD reviews. In fact, it was ridiculed and mocked in theme and execution. However, the movie went on to be New Line's highest grossing box office hit ever.  Not only that, it was on over 150 national critics' year-end top ten lists and received thirteen Oscar nominations making it one of the most honored films in Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences history.
So what is it about this first part of J. R. R. Tolkein's trilogy that touched such a nerve with a global audience and deserves a second look on the home screen?  The plot is a mythic, epic vision of good versus evil, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" recounts the heroic quest of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), a peaceful hobbit entrusted with a terrible responsibility.  Accompanied by an assamblage of elves, dwarves, hobbits, human warriors, and the god wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Frodo must travel through Middle-earth to the land of Mordor in order to destroy the all-powerful One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. Relentlessly pursued by Dark Lord Sauron's dark riders, marauding orcs, cave trolls and goblins summoned by evil wizard Saruman the White (Christopher Lee), the Fellowship must resist the ring's unlimited powers to seduce and corrupt.
Whereas ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is about gaining power through occult means, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is about resisting such powers -- and therein lies the higher moral imperative.  Complex and sophisticated in its nuanced unfolding, Tolkein's tale delivers a more timeless examination of the very real temptations that pull at our every day human lives.
Tolkein's story harkens back to the Ring of Gyges in Plato's Republic as it was told by Glaucon to Socrates. Glaucon argues the poiunt that men are inherently unjust, restrained on their actions only by law and society.  Glaucon's point is that unlimited power beclouds the difference between just and unjust.  A glance at the front page of any recent newspaper seems to confirm Glaucon's position.  Tolkein variation of Gyges ring has been called ""...perhaps the most brilliant and richly rendered portrayal of power and corruptibility ever conceived.""
Many readers, scholars and critics consider Tolkein's epic the best of original works of fiction in the last century because it ""combines masterful storytelling and overwhelming imaginative scope with the biggest of Big Themes.""
What writer, director, producer Peter Jackson accomplished is a major achievement.  He not only honored the source material  but managed to create the world in which Tolkein's characters live and breathe.  In this age of cynicism, it is easy ridicule this old fashioned tale of good and evil, heroism and villainy, freedom and tyranny.  The passing years have certainly not diminished the relevance of this potent metaphor of the responsibility of freedom.

Greed has motivated the producers of this DVD to not include very much in the way of the extra features we have become use to on DVD releases.  Why greed?  Because in three months they will release the four disc EXTENDED edition of the movie.  It will be this edition that will have the deleted scenes and the audio commentaries and the other features on the making of the movie that this current edition lacks.  Greed because among the ""extras"" this edition holds is a plug for the extended edition and the video game based on the first two films.
So I guess you can spend your [$$] now and then wait three months and spend [more $$'s] to see the deleted scenes (about 30 minutes worth) and all the other extra features that should really have been included on this release. I'm sure the producers hope you'll still have the [$$] left in your pocket to pay to see the next film in the triolgy that gets released a month after the extended DVD comes out.
We own the current release, and again the pleasure of seeing the movie in of itself is worth the purchase.

The last movie to absorb the audience this well was Star Wars, so that tells you how terrific this film is when it is being compared to Star Wars.  Ian McKellan was superb as the wise wizard Gandalf and Sean Astin gave a subtle and perhaps overlooked performance as Frodo's friend Samwise.

When one of the heroes was killed towards the end of the movie, I was actually surprised and even then it took him a real long time die. The special effects were fantastic but somewhat less dramatic on the TV screen. There were a lot of wide-angle shots making the characters look like ants on the TV.

1322233,5,B00003CWT6,"That Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS is indeed the Greatest Fantasy Story Ever Written is not in dispute.  That Peter Jackson has passionately managed to do the unthinkable - translate Tolkien's unequaled imagination, the book's literary wonders, tension and tenderness, to a movie masterpiece - is an incredible achievement.  Thank you, Mr. Jackson, for your great talent - we are privileged to enjoy the great beauty you have created.
While most LOTR fans will not care much about the marketing blitz surrounding the first VHS/DVD release of the Fellowship of The Rings - Book/Movie 1 of 3 - some fans able to control their natural inclination to buy anything LOTR-related (fine for many of us) may want to read between the lines of the marketing onslaught. So here's a brief comparison of the DVD Aug 6 release vs. the DVD Nov 12 release to help.
Aug 6 DVD --- Disc1 has a good, crisp image and sound of film, in its original theatre release length, translated exceptionally well to small screen. Disc2 contains all the ""special features"": 3 Documentaries, Enya Video, FOTR Theatrical Trailers (now someone tell me: why are these here when you have the full movie on Disc1 ???) - all these, I would say, rather weak. The best part, of course, is the Two Towers Preview (feeding our impatience to see Movie 2 of 3 come December 18), and an inside look at the ""Extended DVD Edition"" due Nov 12 - a teaser to go out and buy the Nov 12 DVD as well.
Nov 12 DVD --- aka ""Extended Edition"" in widescreen format --- has 30 minutes added footage to the original film length, including: extended Shire sequence (with a hobbit musical number of sorts); extended Moria battle has Aragorn saving Boromir's life; fleshed out backstory on Aragorn, visiting his mother's grave at Rivendell; the complete Lothlorien gift-giving scene with Galadriel; a second Gollum cameo as ""log with eyes""; and a fuller, zippier battle scene with the Uruk-Hai.
The studio's marketing plan seems to be: ""skim"" all fans ready to buy the VHS/DVD on Aug 6, then upgrade them again to buy the Nov 12 release (which is a must-have). A classic business case, and, of course, most of us will fall for it; but if you are both a VHS and a DVD buyer, as I am, and you will get both formats anyhow, you will do best to buy the VHS on Aug 6 - after all, who can wait until Nov? ;o) - then buy your DVD ""keeper"" on Nov 12 - DVD's hold out much better in the long-run, and the Extended Edition is so much better.",1028246400,2,2464,4.534831460674157

1322235,5,B00003CWT6,"I first read the Lord of The Rings trilogy while in college in 1982.  Even during the first reading I realized this was an epoch worthy of a major motion picture!  After viewing the animated ""Hobbit"" film and the first animated installment of the trilogy, I was left wanting more.
To date, I have read the trilogy at least twelve times and was excited to finally hear about the making and release of this literary masterpiece.
Having seen the film three times (once alone then twice with my two sons) I realized that to match Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth we had to wait for today's cinematic technology to bring this masterpiece to life; and this was done very well in this film. From the opening in the beautiful Shire to the escape from Moria you are held fast in your seat.  The effects, cinematography, actors, scenery and action all came together to make me admit this was worth the wait.  It will you, too.

The way he recreated Tolkien's World of Middle Earth is fantastic, and the visual effects were astonishing and completely spectacular. He did leave out the Tom Bombadil part featured in the first book(this movie, the Fellowship of the Ring), but that part was something okay to cut out, due to the fact that it was not imperitive to the story. But who knows, even the diehard fans may be satisfyed with the Executive Edition that is coming out in November, with I believe at least an extra half hour of footage (don't quote me on that, I am not exactly sure).

2.40:1, with the image squashed slightly. Just compare it to footage of movie in the supplemental material on Disc 2 or footage from The Two Towers also on Disc 2.

Although I had been waiting for a Lord of the rings movie for quite a while,  and I thought the books were so unbelievable, I found it difficult to believe that anyone could believably bring all of Tolkien's characters to the big screen and do the story any justice.  But when I saw the movie, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprise. It still doesn't compare to the books but it was a wonderful attempt,and probably the closest that we'll ever get to seeing the books come to life.",1028160000,,554,4.368932038834951

It is also inconsistently wrought--busy when simplicity would better serve it, or too intimate when it should be grand. Its effects are often unnecessary and even silly; disappointing to stifle chuckles at uninspired digital ripples and color inversions, when we know what a spectacular vision Jackson and his team are capable of realizing.",1028160000,,599,5.451612903225806
1322339,5,B00003CWT6,"If there is a better movie made I haven't seen it. Simply put Peter Jackson took the ""unfilmable"" classic trilogy by JRR Tolkien and made it into an instant classic film. How did he do it?
He was faithful and trusted the source completely. The story is already a sure thing. It isn't the highest selling work of fiction in history for nothing. Jackson was dead on aim when trying to get the look, and feel JRR Tolkien expressed in print.
The Lord of the Rings is about change. Middle-Earth is in the process of change and is very vulnerable. The time of the elves is ending giving away to man. This is a very sad thing and it is one of things expressed very well. The friendship between Sam and Frodo is also done very well. They are like war buddies prepared to give up their lives for each other. Throw in some awesome special effects and good fight scenes and you have it all. If you have never read the books you can't even appreciate the small things that are so detailed in the movie. Like when a character says something word for word from the book, or when Gandalf says ""Ah the Long Expected Party"" which is the name of the first chapter. Things had to be taken out simply to cut it down and make it fit. This is understandable. I also like seeing things that you aren't in the story but just mentioned like Gandalf going to Minas Tirith to look up the history of the ring. Above all the feel and the emotion are there.
Ive heard one issue that it was unbelievable that a few heros could take out so many enemies. Well these heros are the most powerful and best warriors on middle-earth. They are lords trained in the art of battle no mere foot soldiers or anything. Plus they are going up against Orcs which are not greatly skilled and whose true threat is numbers. If it was too long for you then I think you have attention issues. Trash it if you must because the majority speaks for itself and Ive found that even the most learned Tolkien fans love it too. Btw it is not a Hollywood picture so quit calling it a ""typical hollywood film."" Also it is only 1/3 of the story.

There simply is nothing to complain about.  The acting is superb, with several cast members giving the performance of a lifetime.  The special effects are breathtaking, and the stunts and fight scenes very memorable.
This film captivates you from the very start, when it tells the story of the rings, and holds you until the last moment, where we are left to wonder about the fate of the scattered fellowship (well, those who never read the books, at least).  I knew this film was a masterpiece when my wife, who hates the fantasy genre, insisted on seeing it 3 times in theaters.

1322343,1,B00003CWT6,"Take heed! Whether you have seen this movie before or not, do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this edition. Its one of the cheapest marketing ploys to ever hit the DVD scene. In case you aren't in the know, New Line Cinema is releasing 2 editions of Fellowship of the Ring. The first edition, this one, is being released August 6, and the second one is being released November 12.
The first one is basically the theatrical version that showed in the theatres, along with some very basic special features. Do not be fooled by the title ""In depth documetries"". I have seen all 3 of the shows and they are anything but. They are essentially TV shows that aired before the movie was released, and include very basic information. In addition to these documentries there are a bunch of short featurettes that were on the website... These feturettes are slightly better, but they hardly go in-depth. This whole release, in fact, can be summed up as laziness. New Line has essentially taken all the material they already had made, and stuffed it into a marketable package. What is even more insulting is the shameless nature with which it's done. There 3 advertisements here that pass as ""features"". One for the video game, one for the special edition being released in November, and one for The Two Towers. It's a pity that the last two are actually more entertaining then all the rest of the features combined.
Don't get me wrong, the movie is incredible. But this edition hardly does it justice. It's just a marketing ploy to get the general public and anxious fans to buy 2 editions of the same movie. Trust me, once the Special Edition is released in November this edition will become so obsolete it will be frogotten beyond recall.
Do the math yourself. For less then $10 more you get an extended edition of the movie that includes 35 minutes of new footage edited into the film, 4, I repeat, 4 commentary tracks by more then 30 people combined, and 2 extra DVD packed with hours upon hours of brand new material on the making of the movie. And there are no advertisements for any other products. Which sounds like the better edition, or if nothing more the one that give you better value for your money. It saddens me that the August widescreen edition is the number one selling DVD on Amazon right now. It just shows how much marketing genius New Line has. They have even released sad PR announcements saying how the two editions are equal and Peter Jackson (the director) supports them both. But if you buy this edition don't say you weren't warned when November 12'th comes around. Look past the marketing and make your own decision.",1028073600,336,2629,4.607675906183369

Peter Jackson found the moral center and the theme to Tolkien's saga and successfully imbued his film with them. The cinematography is intense, focusing on telling the story of Frodo and the rest of the fellowship and also focusing on telling the larger story of Middle Earth. The acting is infallible.  Every single actor is spot on and the pace of the movie informs their work with crackles. We see intimate moments where Frodo doubts himself, Bilbo almost gives in to temptation, and Arwen and Aragorn show their love. The theme of good versus evil is immortal, and depicted wonderfully, with no bows to gray perspectivalism, but with clear manifestations of the many forms of evil.
While there are characters and mini-subplots in the books that are omitted in the movies, they are of no consequence to the grand scheme of this cinematic epic.

The overwhelming support this putrid film is getting showcases how very removed modern society is from the time in which this masterpiece of fiction was written - and from the author's original vision. This is a dumbed down, illiterate, `cool parts' skim of one of the most resonating books ever written. Not only is the whimsy and quaintness of the story completely forgotten, but the depth of characterization has been chucked in favor of meaningless aerial sweeps interspersed between moments of Dungeons and Dragons-like violence (not a knock to Gary Gygax -he could've written a better script). Every character under five feet is likewise given the short end of the stick (pardon). Gimili is turned from an honorable, stoic flintheart to a stereotypical bearded barbarian - alternately blubbering and uttering idiotic oaths (see the title of this review). Merry and Pippin's familial motivations for joining the quest are completely missing -they come across as a pair of dunderheaded frat boys - and Sam and Frodo are merely along for the ride as we are meant to `oo and aah' (as most of us did) to the CGI wizardry of Gandalf and friends. The Nazgul scream like banshees -more annoying than frightening, the battle of Weathertop features an amazing and ridiculous `Black Rider catches torch in his teeth and flounders about' shtick, and Sir McClellan's admittedly statuesque Gandalf faces yet another cartoon peril on the Bridge of Khazad Dum. Where was the re-forging of Anduril? Why did the Hobbits follow Strider blindly into the wilderness before learning he was Aragorn? Where was the gift-giving scene at Lorien? Why does Bilbo go all Roger Rabbit in one sequence? Does anyone care at all? Apparently not. What is most shameful is that this will be the definitive version of this story in the minds of children who have never read this glorious book and will be bored by its comparitively slow pace. My only hope is that the 30 minutes extra will explain all that went wrong with this shallow film.

But this movie did a damn fine job of covering the really important and entertaining parts of the Fellowship of the Ring.
I would like to point out how [angry] I got sitting in the theators and listening to people here and there complain either about how long the movie was, or just not getting the storyline.  Well of course you don't get it, it's based on a very long and complex book with an enormous cast of characters and plotlines.  If you're not a science fiction/fantasy fan then obviously you won't like this movie. But if you are or if you're very open minded and like to see fantasy based action movies, this is definitely a must-see.  The only complaint that I have about Fellowship is that I wish more of the story could have been put into the film but that would have made the movie obscenely long, which I would not have complained about but some people might have.
Seriously folks, pick up the book, give it a read, then watch this movie. You'll enjoy the film that much more.  Even the small story changes are forgivable and make the movie more entertaining.

1322458,5,B00003CWT6,"OK, OK--I didn't read the books! Yes, believe it or not, I made it this far in life without knowing a Hobbit from an Orc! That confession out of the way, let me just say I saw the film as someone who neither knew what parts of the book were left out, nor held the epic in reverence as have so many who know the tales by heart. I have to admit, I came out of the theater with many questions. I also have to admit, I enjoyed the film much, much more than I could have ever imagined!

This is the story of a ring which possesses the power to grant not only invisibility, but also immortality, to its wearer. In return however, the 'One Ring' seeks to corrupt any who stand in the way of its powerful force, and is ever bent on returning to its evil and ancient master, who lost in long ago in wars for Middle-earth.
From watching ""Fellowship of the Ring"" I understood how Tolkien's deep religious knowledge played out in a complex tale of good versus evil. In a nutshell, it is the search for redemption and salvation by a fellowship of representatives from all creation. It is the search to free a creation which has fallen under the shadow of a lord of darkness.
I appreciated the author's personification of the ill-fated Adam-figure Isildur, who, at the moment of opportunity to forever vanquish the evil influence of the ring, failed to master temptation's enticement. As a result, one man unleashed a force of evil into the world even he could not have imagined. Yet, hope is not lost. Through this man's lineage is a noble and rightful king (Aragorn)--in exile from his homeland, and desirous to join the fellowship and purge evil from Middle Earth.
There is marvelous theology for those who know where to find it in ""Fellowship of the Ring"", and I can now appreciate how Tolkien's student C.S. Lewis was profoundly influenced to write his Christian allegories ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". What this film does best is to capture the power of evil, and portray its virulence in seeking to dominate everything it touches. Even a good and noble wizard (Saruman the White) is corrupted by the dark side.
I winced at the deafening hoof beats of the horses of the Ringwraiths, who do the bidding of the evil and disembodied dark lord Sauron the Deceiver. I sat in amazement at the glimpses of the hellish fires of Mordor and Mount Doom where the ring was forged""and, where also, the ring can only be destroyed. I bordered on vertigo as the fellowship faced unimaginable terrors and evil in the Mines of Moria, and I marveled at the grace of Arwen Evenstar, who not only saved the life of a hero, but whose selflessness gave up immortality for one she loved. Yes, there is wonderful theology here! But ever creeping through the shadows is the eerie and mysterious Gollum, who will have a most unique roll to play.
In summary, it proves true that the less you know about the trilogy, the more you may appreciate this film. It is a tale that will un-nerve you with its sheer volume in places, astound you with its special effects, and in some ways make you wish you'd left the younger kids at home. This is NOT a kid movie. It is a complex, and intricate story of how one of the least, and most innocent of God's creatures (Frodo), attempts to master an evil force that would overcome him, in order to save creation from the darkest evil. It is also the story of friendship and heroism. Good does not win out at the end but neither does evil, and I cannot wait for the The Two Towers!

I read the books and the film is not exactly the same but I understood the changes they make because it was nearly an impossible mission to port this book to the screen.  I think sincerely that it couldn't be better than that.  The spirit of Tolkien is not authentic because Tolkien never focus on the action in his book as the film.
This part could be a bit weird for some if you don't want to read... hehe ;)
The people must know that the goal of Tolkien when he wrote this story was to bring people to the faith (he was christian).  And when we look closer, the analogy is superb !  For example,  the redemption of the world came from the small people (like Jesus, like the Hobbits).  It's not the power that save us, and we don't need that to be saved.  The hobbits are the weakest of the species, and it's from them that Sauron will be deafeat, and not from the greatest knight in the world... or the greatest wizard.  The hobbits was the only species that could be the salvation of the Middle Earth, because they don't want the power for us, like us, humans...  There's also the tentation of the evil that every character of the story have.  Some fell in evil, some don't.  There's the long agony of the hobbits in the country of Mordor like the agony of the Christ to save the world.  THERE'S A LOT MORE... There a lot of spiritual in that !  Tolkien wrote this story to make the life of the Christ more attractive ...  Do some REAL research and you will find ;)  Watch the movie in this perspective and you will be more impressed by the story , like me !
This movie is incredible !",1027468800,,1657,4.163522012578617
1322461,5,B00003CWT6,"Synopsis: In the land of Middle Earth, a hobbit named Frodo Baggins comes to possess a magical, vastly powerful gold ring. Centuries before, the ring was the possession of the Dark Lord Sauron, an evil sorcerer whose spirit still inhabits his fastness of Mordor. If reunited with his ring, Sauron will once again have the means to enslave the world. Frodo, gentle representative of a peaceful and timid people, must find a way to convey the ring to Mount Doom - the heart of Sauron's kingdom - for destruction. Along the way he will be beset by the savage and remorseless emissaries of the Dark Lord. Aiding Frodo in his quest are eight representatives of the free peoples of Middle Earth: an elf, a dwarf, two men, three other hobbits, and the wizard Gandalf. The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story of the first leg of the quest.
When I arrived at 11:30 a.m. on December 19th for the local cineplex's first public showing of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the guy who ripped my ticket made it clear that he thought it pretty strange for someone to show up an hour early for a weekday matinee. I told him that, given that I'd been waiting a quarter century to see this movie, arriving an hour early to assure a good seat wasn't all that hard to understand. I've been a Tolkien fan for quite a long time and have read and re-read the books to the point where I could probably quote (at least) short passages of them unaided. I don't know if that nets out to a plus or a minus in qualifying me to review the movie. But I thought you should know.
First, a few words about The Fellowship of the Ring as a book adaptation. While leaving the story overall remarkably intact, the filmmakers omitted a few scenes from Tolkien's epic (Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wights are gone, for instance), conflated some other events and characters, and generally tightened the action in order to fit it comfortably within the movie's roughly three hour running time. Those changes will doubtless outrage extremists among the Tolkien True Believers; I heard one such individual harrumphing that director Jackson had turned the book into ""just a long chase scene."" In fact, the changes not only make The Fellowship of the Ring a better movie, they actually improve upon the story. Here's one notable example. In the book, an elf named Glorfindel has an exciting but brief role in events, and then is essentially unheard of throughout the rest of the saga. Jackson and co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have taken Glorfindel's part and given it to Arwen, an elf princess who occupies an important place in Tolkien's Middle Earth but appears rarely before the trilogy's final installment. The change at once helps unify the action of the books, makes Arwen a far more interesting character, and adds tension to the film's action by contrasting the elf maid's seeming delicacy with the malevolent might of her evil pursuers.
How does The Fellowship of the Ring stand on its own as a movie? All in all, magnificently. Visually the film is a tour de force, combining sweeping, majestic vistas with lovingly detailed sets and costumes, and enhancing its stunning New Zealand outdoor shots with monumental CGI effects. Decades ago C. S. Lewis, in describing the appeal of the Icelandic sagas that inspired both his and Tolkien's work, talked about their ineffable ""northern-ness"": a spirit that is compact of the land, the climate, the old religions and languages and worldview of Northern Europe. Somehow, with his crisp, blue-skied landscapes and stony ruins, Jackson manages to capture that Nordic geist. Without it, this movie would not have worked. And the director uses his genius for composition and color to reinforce the themes of the story. Some images of the One Ring remain indelibly in the mind a week after seeing the movie: a close-up shot of Boromir examing the ring, spellbound, against a backdrop of azure sky and white snow; a scene of council delegates arguing with increasing violence - all reflected in the smooth, seemingly innocuous surface of the ring; and over and over, the ring lying in silent menace in an outstretched palm. Jackson never lets you forget this golden artifact, whose power ultimately motivates the action of the entire trilogy.
The Fellowship of the Ring scores big in nearly every area, including the performances. Ian McKellan is superb as the wizard Gandalf, the backbone of the fellowship. He combines warmth, irascibility, intelligence, solicitude, and righteous menace - moving seamlessly from one to the next. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are perfectly cast as the main hobbit characters Frodo and Sam, respectively. Frodo's vulnerability and sensitivity are balanced (as they are in the books) by Sam's sturdy optimism and simplicity. Among the other parts - and there are a lot of them - Sean Bean is notable as the troubled warrior-prince Boromir, Billy Boyd shines as Frodo's impish cousin Pippin, and Ian Holm gives depth and tragedy to the old hobbit Bilbo Baggins.
The film makes a few missteps. A wizardly slugfest between Gandalf and the traitorous Saruman doesn't work particularly well, especially when Gandalf appears for all the world to be break dancing under the command of Saruman's magic staff. Some sound effects become irritating after too much repetition. The most tragic shortcoming is the music; this movie and the story it's based on demand a truly transcendent, imaginative score. Instead we get some undistinguished Enya and generally overwrought orchestral work by Howard Shore.
But those are quibbles. The Fellowship of the Ring is a triumph. If the two remaining movies live up to the promise of the first, The Lord of the Rings should take its place with multipart works like The Godfather and Star Wars among the greatest film sagas ever made.",1027468800,,5827,4.875

Sure, some of them turn out to be great movie despite the fact that it doesn't live up to the book. Then, there are those that not only not live up to the book, but just down right bombs. (The Shining with Jack Nicholsan for example.) However, with Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship, the movie lives up to the book. Even though it excluded some of the off side adventures of the story in the book, the movie remains loyal to the book's main story line. (It can't be expected that the movie could include everything, it already is three hours long, I'm sure if they had the money they would.) For all those who haven't seen the movie in fear that it will not be loyal and true to the book, rest assured.

This movie get under your skin when you watch it. It's greater than Star Wars. It suprises how J.R.R. Tolkien could have such fantasy as he described all he's ideas in the book. I say, only great mind can do it. And J.R.R. Tolkien was a great man and he,and he's Middle Earth, still lives in OUR imagination. In The Lord of the Rings you can see what is real frendship and it can make you cry. It made me cry, and I'm proud to say it 'cause you don't see movies, or read books, such as The Lord of the Rings. All I can say now is:"" Can't wait for Two towers!""",1027382400,,708,4.13768115942029
1322653,5,B00003CWT6,"This is a spectacular film! I saw this back in December by accident actually. I was planning on seeing the just released 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and had disregarded this as a slow, boring film for fans of the books of which I had never bothered to read.
I couldn't have been more wrong! I went up to the ticket booth only to find that the movie I was going to see was sold out.
I surveyed the other options eliminating them one by one, until I came to The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. I had seen almost all the other films and finally decided to see Lord Of The Rings. I figured if nothing else I could see what all the hype was about so I paid my [money] (Ouch!) and headed into the theater. Well, I thought to myself as I watched the new Star Wars
trailer, it would appear that the next Star Wars movie is going to be all love story, I was wrong again, as I found out later.
Lord Of The Rings started playing and from scene one, (Galadriel telling the story of the ring thus far, if you remember) I was hooked! The fascinating storytelling kept me engulfed inside another world, Middle-Earth, in fact. The magnificent cinematography and terrific art direction had my eyes riveted to the screen for every single second of film. The spellbinding score was perfect for each and every scene, not one note was wrong or misplaced. The direction was fantastic and the acting, which has received some grief somehow or another, was perfect. Every line was said with perfection, nothing wooden in any of the actors performances. The movie ran for around three hours, which was amazing to me because when I walked out it had felt like two hours at best. I would have sat there and watched the entire trilogy with only a small bathroom break in between if I could have.
After seeing the movie I rushed here, to my computer and got online to Amazon.com and bought the entire Lord Of The Rings set and The Hobbit and have thus far read, The Hobbit, The Fellowship Of The Ring, and am currently reading The Two Towers which I plan on finishing before the first DVD release of LOTR next month.
I went out and saw The Fellowship Of The Ring when The Two Towers trailer was packaged with it and loved the movie just as much as I
had when I first saw it if not more so. Now there has been some
controversy over leaving out and changing some of the original story in the book for the movie. I can tell you now that this move
without a doubt, kept the film going and never slowed to the pace that it would have slowed to had Tom Bombadil been included.
I thought the parts with Tom Bombadil were the slowest in the book and I, for one am glad that they were excluded. The other scenes, such as the deeply moving gift giving scene, I have heard will be included in the November Special Extended Edition DVD release with new music scored by new Academy Award Winner Howard Shore and will be contained on two discs, with two more discs for over 6 hours of special features. I am planning on getting the Collector's Edition
of that DVD that also includes a National Geographic Beyond The Movie DVD and several other Lord Of The Rings items.
But until then I am awaiting The Two Towers, due out December 18th. I also can tell you that the very overrated 'A Beautiful Mind' should have lost Best Picture in favor of The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. I just realized that it's Tuesday, which means that this DVD comes out Two Weeks from today!

It was pretty close to the actual book which impressed me and the things they added to it that were not part of the book were well worth it and made even more sense to the outcome of the story. The violence destorying the orcs (old english word for ""demon"" by the way) was a little crude, but that would be my only complaint.  The actors were well chosen and really resembled their characters as if they stepped out of the book!  It was all in all a great movie!

I overlooked the fact that it was a 3 hour long movie, and noticed how excellent the story was.

The movie did a wonderful job of trying to follow the book, make it interesting, and tell the story within the time span of three hours. I have read the books(all three) four times.

This film stays so true to the original text that it thoroughly envelopes even those who have previously read the work.  The pictures I had imagined while reading this series as a child magically appeared before my eyes.  ""How did they know?  How could they have possibly captured my imagination in such detail?!"" I kept babbling like a delightfully befuddled idiot after the movie was over.  This is a credit to Tolkien's excellent storytelling, a gifted director's passion and dedication and a superb cast and crew.
The Lord of the Rings is the kind of movie making that most artists only dream of--a project that allows the proper time for their craft so they can produce an exceptional piece of art--and an honestly exciting one to boot (so refreshingly unlike the typical Hollywood moneymaker).  I hope that others will take notice of this project and follow suit!
Bravo!",1027036800,,942,4.930379746835443
1322693,1,B00003CWT6,"I really, really did not like this movie. Saying this when almost all the other reviews are well written explanations of why this movie deserves 5 stars is very difficult indeed. Nevertheless, after seeing this movie I felt very disappointed. I am a fan of both fantasy and science fiction, and I read and enjoyed (to some extend) one of the books in the Lord of the Rings series. So it is not that I just dislike fantasy/sci-fi.
The reason I disliked this movie is that when I saw it in the theaters I almost fell asleep. There was no dramatic tension at all. Although I have to admit the opening sequences were very good, and the special effects and scenery were great - I would claim that the filmmakers got totally carried away with special effects. Once the hobbit and company started fighting computer generated monsters, I grew less and less interested until I was at the point of walking out of the theater! I mean, I have nothing against fighting in movies, especially fighting with well done special effects - but enough is enough! After a point there is no more excitement, and it becomes monotonous and dull.
Honesty, the sad thing about movies today is that the reliance on special effects has led to a decline in the quality of the other aspects of the film, such as dialogue, creativity, etc, etc. In my opinion, there is nothing interesting in watching hours of computer generated fighting scenes. Come on - where is the excitement in that?
In addition to the excessive fighting, I feel that this movie was badly acted. In one scene, there was a close up on the hobbit's face after somebody was killed (the fact that I don't remember who shows how much I really cared at that point) - and the whole theater began laughing out loud. I don't think that this was the desired effect, somehow.
Anyhow, this is only my personal opinion. After viewing the movie, I felt that it was very bad due to the excessive fighting (and subsequent lack of creative dialogue, character development, etc, etc.) and poor acting. Hollywood really needs to go back to watching some classic movies - which did not use any special effects - because it seems that filmmakers have lost the ability to entertain audiences without massive doses of sepcial effects. And even worse, as proved by this movie, sometimes even special effects cannot make a dull movie interesting...",1026950400,19,2363,4.6826923076923075

The story grabs ahold of you at the beginning, and never lets go, a truly EPIC film.  Buy this movie, it's awesome!",1026950400,3,485,4.563218390804598
1322735,5,B00003CWT6,"First of all, I'd like to say that I loved this movie. My generation missed out on seeing Star Wars for the first time in the theater, at a time when the special effects were still very impressive and the movie was still original, but in return, we get this. And you know what? If I had a choice between the two, I'd pick this in a second, and anyone who knew me between fourth and sixth grade will know from that just how much this movie impressed me. If you haven't seen this yet, I pity you, because you won't be able to see it in the theater anytime soon, and believe me, you want to.
That said, the movie's excellence makes its flaws all the worse. If you paddle boats on one side only, they don't go in a straight line! There are also some continuity errors that become maddening once you notice them. One of the statues on the Great River, for instance, holds up its right arm when seen from the front but its left arm when seen from the back. (Or was it the other way around?) This is particularly annoying because the scene is one of the best in the movie, and the corresponding passage from the book is, in my opinion, one of the best in all of Tolkien. The changes made to Merry and Pippin were also questionable, since they weren't nearly so silly in the book, and the comic episodes detract from the movie rather than adding to it. (Why, oh why, did the scriptwriter have to add a comic line to the movie's most emotional scene? It didn't even involve Merry or Pippin.)
As hard as it may be to believe after that, I mean everything that I said in the first paragraph. The casting is superlative. The only significant mistake, aside from the aforementioned ones, was Liv Tyler as Arwen; I didn't find her a convincing elf. The visuals are utterly beautiful or horrific, as the scene requires--I would go so far as to say that the art in this movie is the best I've ever seen in any movie. They also remembered to put in dirt, which is actually rather unusual. Clearly, Peter Jackson has some of the best artists in the industry working for him. The score is good too, although some part of it seem a little too Carmina Burana-ish.
Of course, some things were changed, and some were omitted. For example, Glorfindel is gone; his part goes to Arwen instead. Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-downs are skipped. The movie does not go into as much detail about some characters' backstories as the book did. No doubt the alterations will offend some Tolkien fans, but I think they are mostly defensible. In a movie that is already three hours long, it is necessary to slim down the cast of characters and the plot. Some of these things, such as Tom Bombadil and most of the songs, would be very difficult to translate into film anyway. Those things seemed out of place even in the book, although they would have fit into The Hobbit seamlessly. Of course, some of the characters and places will not be as you pictured them. Personally, I found that Frodo, Legolas, and the Balrog were all significantly off, but when evaluated independently of my expectations, they stand up well enough.
Anyone who has read the books doesn't need to be told that the movie is no substitute. It gives you an intense rush for a while, but in the end it lacks the power of the original. That aside, it is the best movie that we could have realistically expected, and the best I've seen in a long time.",1026864000,,3382,4.395534290271132

I went to the theater three times to see it and I've pre-ordered both editions of the DVD.  Actually I'm almost as excited about the Special Extended Edition as I was about the theatrical release.  I eagerly anticipated it for over a year.
Kudos to all involved in the making of these movies.  The result was fabulous.  You have boldly gone where no one dared and astutely shot all three movies in one continous effort (Are you paying attention Mr. Lucas?).  Brilliant!  None of you need put other entries in your curriculi.  It was time someone showed Hollywood the proper way to adapt a classic.
I understand that to bring such a richly described story down to an acceptable duration for a theater session certain sacrifices had to be made.  So I'll miss Tom Bombadil, time in Lothlorien was too short (it was fine but I would have liked more).  Some events were oversimplified but it had to be done for the sake of time.  I understand the need for this.  The only thing I did not like was that Aragorn seemed timid, unsure about his destiny.  I prefered his unwavering determination to seize his birthright; how he waits patiently, yearning for the time when he'll need to face unsurmountable odds to right an ancestor's folly.  I find the books' Aragorn much more interesting.  I suspect this was done to develop the love story a bit more than the book and the movie appealing to a broader audience.  I can live with that.
Don't take my rant too seriously.  I found the movie incredible.  And there were a lot of very pleasant surprises.  The movie was superbly cast, all the roles.  Sir Ian McKellen is Gandalf and I was pleased to see Christopher Lee in the role of Saruman.  The special effects were masterfully used, as they needed to be, bringing that magical and complex Tolkien world to the screen.  This movie ranks way up there with Lawrence of Arabia and 2001 A Space Odyssey.  I love it, this is the type of film that stretches the ratings to 8 stars, 5 stars don't even begin to do it justice.
Once again, thank you very much Jackson and company.",1026777600,6,2159,4.51937984496124
1322740,5,B00003CWT6,"Having read the entire work years ago (as well as The Silmarillion) and several times since, I always dreamt that there could be a visual to compliment such fertile text. My fear was that any attempt made would be as hackneyed and disappointing as Ralph Bakshi's animated version from 1979.
It's a double-edged sword putting a classic book like this to film.
Fortunately, my worst fears were allayed with Peter Jackson's triumphant direction and screenplay. Not only has he given us a piece of work that stands as a masterpiece of classic and epic film, he has given us a film that can stand alone from the written work.
All of the characters were truly made real. The actors playing their roles never once allow you to think that they are just there to cash a paycheck. The film is perfectly cast and I was truly immersed in middle-earth and loved it.
The necessary changes in the screenplay from the book are numerous but truly only the nit-picky can gripe. The role of Glorfindel is replaced by Arwen and Tom Bombadil is completely missing but I didn't miss them. The pace of the story and the continuity of characters really leaves you breathless by the closing credits. It never felt like a 3-hour movie. It felt much shorter.
For those of you who never read the books, I can only say that you have truly robbed yourself of a great work, however, I do know many, many people who have also not read it and still loved the film as much as I did. As I said, the film really stands alone from the book.
My only regret is that I have to wait an entire year between Acts II (The Two Towers) and III (The Return of the King). The hype surrounding these films is well deserved and I am more than pleased to have a film to share with my children that compliments a book so perfectly. Highly recommended.",1026777600,3,1799,4.438066465256798

1322849,5,B00003CWT6,"J.R.R Tolkien was a Catholic man. If you look at this movie from a Christian point of veiw you will see much more than just a good movie. Look at Frodo and how his situation resembles that of Christ. He had a heavy burden to bear but he was willing to sacrifice himself to save the rest of the world by destroying the RING {or the certain death of sin}. Such a little thing it's not a big deal. But as it takes control it is a big deal! The Orcs and goblins were another form of sin. Sam is the reflection of the human race. He is struggling to follow Frodo {or Christ}through the extreme sacrifices of doing what is best for you and others even though it's not fun. Merry and Pippin are also our reflection. Aragorn is sort of like the Holy Spirit. He is their wise guide and is also a king. Perhaps, Gandalf is their concience and their strength.
  This was a wonderful movie with or without a Christian point of veiw. It is well made and there is nothing bad in it except ugliness. I really reccommend it. Now any Christian parents who were wary about letting their children see this can tell them to look for these great examples of strength in intergity towards God.",1026691200,7,1171,4.27027027027027

My friends just kinda looked at me when i told them but guess what when i dragged them to see it they fell in love with the movie instantly! All I have to say is that this movie is a must for a fan of fantasy stories. Come August 6 i will be purchasing the DVD and whenever the extended version comes out i will also be purchasing that one. and come Dec. 18 i will be one of the first ones in line to see the secon movie: The Twin Towers and also the third movie Return of the King in dec 2003.,1026691200,,764,3.811320754716981

I immediately asked who the director was hoping to hell that it wasn't Speilberg or Lucas. Thank God for Peter Jackson. His vision and choice of staff have made reality out of my mind's eye interpretation of the LOTR Trilogy. As a twelve year old in the summer of '79 I should have been busy swimming and looking at girls...but instead found myself enthralled by the Tolkien books. It was nothing to read 60-70 pages a day. The whole while my mind was creating visions of the words for me. Now, I have a further extension of that world thanks to Hollywood. The screenplays are well written and stay as true to the books as ever. The sets are fantastic and absolutely transcend the ages. The development could have been more complete, such as adding Tom Bombadil (who saved the Fellowship right after it started) and the story of the Barrow Downs. But minute for minute this is the first time that film has done justice to books. If you saw this movie you know I speak truth...BUY THIS MOVIE!! It will not disappoint.

For those who haven't even glanced at the cover of Tolkien's LOTR stories, the Lord of the Rings is surely an adventure. This movie was nominated for 13 Academy Awards, and deserved every one of them. The acting was awesome. Every single actor and actress in this film gave it their best, and their best was more than enough to bring Tolkien's story to life. For those of you that are not familiar with the story, the movie basically starts out in the Shire, where Frodo Baggins is living peacefully...unaware that he will soon be in grave danger. He inherits the 'one' ring. This ring corrupts many people, and creatures, and fills them with greed and betrayal, for it was made by the Dark Lord Sauron. Along with his friends, Frodo sets out to destroy the ring, while running away from those that hunt it...and those that hunt him. The stunts are spectacular, the scenery is wonderful, and I don't think you could have made any book come to life in a movie better than this one. As for agewise...I let a five year old see it and she wanted to watch it again...it depends on the child. The orcs (ugly and evil creatures) are pretty scary for youngsters, but the heroes of this film make up for the scary parts, and can leave anyone from ages child to adult with their mouthes hanging wide open.

1322914,5,B00003CWT6,"Most simply put, this is masterpiece, a film that graphically epitomizes what an unbounded treasure an artistically derived adaptation of a simply wondrous novel (split into three segments because of size) can really be. Given the fact that Tolkien was himself a genius, a noted Don of Literature at Oxford , and a lifelong friend of famed novelist CS Lewis, it is no wonder that much of contemporary science fiction genre and the fantasy genre are all largely derivitive of his thought and work (especially contemporary efforts such as the Harry Potter series). Which is not to say that none of it is any good, but to point out the singular genius and imagination that this work represented when orifginally published as literature in the 1960s.
Given all that, it was hard to be very optimistic in terms of one's expectations for the series, having already suffered through an animated attempt to portray portions of the legends associated with his work long ago. Yet, to my utter amazement, this really is a very faithful and imaginative recreation of all that one finds in the books, yet done in a way that in some way even exceeds the power ofthe novels. Thus, I heartily agree with the opinion of earlier reviewers who laud this film on the basis of its being a ""fantasy adventure and also as an adaptation of a beloved literary classic"". On this basis, then ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" stands alone as a worthy example of what kind of cinematic possibilities can be attained with enough vision, imagination, and, of course, money. For the cost of bringing this adaptation to film was astounding.
Yet, everything associated with the film  is consistent with Tolkien's somber vision of a world bent on a long-term devolution from magic and possibility to the crushing weight of politics and power. Indeed, the surreal mood set in the film catches Tolkien's dark vision exactly as one would envision it in one's head, and to this end the set and the special effets are of enormous benefit. So too, the casting lends itself to the mix of whimsey and amazement that the story weaves through its chapters, and the levels of dark of forces that gather round the not-so-merry band or fellowship signal the way the world is going, at least according to Tolkien.
Of course, the cast of characters are really the key to the tale, and Director jackson has a terrific feel for this element as he weaves the characters through the tale. They, of course, represent the contradictions and the struggle of good with evil that we each hold within ourselves, and it is this struggle set in mythical times that is the key to the success of the venture. But stay tuned, for much more is to come! A simply astounding movie, and one that should need no recommendation. Enjoy!",1026518400,9,2783,4.738144329896907
1322915,4,B00003CWT6,"I've seen the Fellowship of the Rings twice, and I liked it a lot.  I've read the books many times, and I'm thinking about buying the DVD.  In my opinion, the movie stayed pretty true to the book, and I appreciated that a lot, but I have a few problems with it anyway.  First of all, it left out one of my favorite characters: Tom Bombadil!  I was disappointed about that.  Also, I think that maybe the two actors who played Aragorn and Boromir should have been switched.  The only other problem is, when you watch the movie after reading the book, you lose the sense of how much time it took for everything to happen.  I know that probably couldn't be changed that much, and it was a three-hour movie anyway, but take the Mines of Moria, for example.  It took the group at least a few days to get through them, and it seems much shorter than that in the movie.  In spite of all that, it was better than I expected, and I did like the way they did Gollum.  I thought Gollum was perfect, and so was Gandalf.  Gandalf was almost exactly the way I had imagined him.  I enjoyed it a lot, and I strongly reccomend it to anyone who likes fantasy.",1026518400,2,1140,4.202764976958525
1322916,5,B00003CWT6,"I definently have to say (actually I have about 1 trillion times) that this is the BEST movie that has been made...so far. I admire  Mr. Jackson for laying down Tolkien's ideas plain and simple, I just finished reading FOTR again, and this movie is incredibly accurate with the book. But I'd like to set the pace for you people who don't understand the books or the movie (despite the excellent screenplay) look deeper into the characters, the story, the settings. Especially Sauron and the ring. Tolkien establishes the fact that there is evil in the world and it is very elusive. Most commonly it doesn't like to be called what it is. Sauron is the personification of Pride, that feeling inside all of us that exaggerates our own self-esteem, making us think we're something we're not. Just think of Boromir, how once the thought of the ring in his possession entered his thoughts, he was quickly overtaken with pride of Gondor's armies and powers and easily underestimated Sauron. In his mind he became Bormir the great: the wise king of Gondor. Just a thought for you fantasy-lovers out there: Look deeper into what Tolkien was saying, he was very wise in his time.",1026518400,,1169,4.730392156862745

The film is truly fabulous to look at, containing some of the most beautifully imagined and created sets and backdrops I have ever seen on screen. We are also treated to the great natural beauty of New Zealand, no small bonus. The battle scenes were well choreographed and acted, the main characters either endearing, intriguing, or both, the Ringwraiths truly terrifying, and the story was laid out for us with just the right mix of horror, humor and drama.

I'd just seen Harry Potter and was terrified LOTR would be the same: a movie that so strictly adhered to every minute detail and line of the book that it refused to transform from a bunch of disconnected scenes into a movie.  But Peter Jackson's direction couldn't have been more perfect.  The movie retained all the original meanings and feelings of the book.  A couple scenes vital to the book were noticably, but not irreplacably, absent as the film was kept at the perfect length.  In some ways, the film even went beyond the book as the superb acting, amazing music, excellent direction and camera angles, and marvelously used scenery all banded together to focus on the true meaning of the book: the awesome courage of the characters.  Every time I watch it (and I've watched it an awful lot) I get this gut-wrenching feeling as I am completely overwhelmed at the ability of the actors to bring such bravery, and somehow such mortality, to their characters.  From the first five seconds Jackson completely submerges you in this world where self-sacrifice and loyalty is key to the existence of all it's characters, where magnificent landscapes must be protected from the growing darkness, and where evil takes so many faces.  Even having read the books, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Simply an amazing movie, and an even more amazing adaption.",1026432000,,1399,4.771784232365145

She pointed to ""The Hobbit"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy in a little corner off to the side. When I came home that day, I tore into ""The Hobbit"" and then slashed my way across Middle-Earth in the Trilogy. What I found was the perfect balance of prose, humor, fantasy, plot, and characterization. The Books were and still are to me, perfection.
  Now as a senior in high school, ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" made its way to the big screen and as an avid fan of Tolkien, I was thoroughly, utterly, and completely satisfied of Peter Jackson's take of the epic story. Everything about the movie appealed to me: from the well chosen cast (Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, especially), the special effects (amazing, simply amazing), the music (the score could not have complemented the film better, although at first it seems a bit cliched), and the wonderful, accurate depiction of the world of Middle-Earth (although Tom Bombadil and the greedy Sackville-Bagginses were not present).

1322968,5,B00003CWT6,"Magical golden rings, staff-wielding wizards and furry-footed hobbits are just a few of the strangely wonderful elements that await you in Lord of the Rings.  This first installment of the forthcoming fantasy trilogy is a carefully crafted cinematic adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's immensely successful novel.  Starring Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan and Sean Astin, the movie chronicles the hobbits' quest into the land of Mordor to destroy the evil One Ring.  Packed full of epic battle sequences, mind-boggling special effects, and exemplary performances from its all-star cast, 'Fellowship' will not only entertain and delight audiences, but also help to redefine the fantasy genre previously occupied by such films as Willow, Legend, and the recently released Harry Potter.

New Zealander Peter Jackson directed 'Fellowship of the Rings'.  Inspired by such movies as King Kong and The Beast from Twenty Thousand Fathoms in his early childhood, Jackson began experimenting with filmmaking in his teenage years and soon made the decision to take on directing as a full-time profession.  Jackson subsequently produced several other special effects-laden films before beginning work on Lord of the Rings; these films included Heavenly Creatures, Braindead, and The Frighteners.

Lord of the Rings is packed full of things to love, including strong and often touching emotions, charming and fascinating characters, and its epically proportioned storyline.  The sets and costumes are lush, colorful, and often awe-inspiring; Jackson has presented us with a fantastic yet eerily believable reality that is overflowing with details and subtleties. This constant attention to small distinctions makes Middle-Earth seem more historical than mythical in origin.  And perhaps best of all, Jackson has been careful to apply just as much creativity and effort to the scenes of darkness and evil as to those of goodness and light; many of the sequences featuring the nine Ringwraiths, the eye of Sauron or the demonic Balrog are incredibly creepy and are almost guaranteed to send satisfying chills down your spine.  The movie's phenomenal musical score adds an extra touch of grandness and splendor to the film, especially when coupled with its swooping, large-scale cinematography.

While 'Fellowship' contains no crude language or inappropriate situations, the film's PG-13 rating is hardly unwarranted; its many battle scenes are graphic and violent and may be a bit too much for younger audiences.  And, while a few impatient individuals may complain about the movie's length, (some 3 hours and 15 minutes) for the rest of moviegoers, critics and Tolkien fans alike, the film will seem to pass almost instantly.",1026172800,4,2699,5.492753623188406
1323017,5,B00003CWT6,"Director Peter Jackson can crown this the major accomplishment of his career along with the two other movies to follow ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" A longtime LotR junkie, Jackson was the ideal choice to do a movie that would have so many die-hard and critical fans of the trilogy and he doesn't disappoint at all. Jackson's attention to detail is one of the highlights of this film, and makes it one of the best big-budget films to ever hit the market.
Slight digressions from the book had to be done in order to make the film watchable, and already clocking in at nearly three hours, these changes are greatly appreciated. The dialogue is a little bit lack-luster, as what can be said in a book, fantasy, no less, cannot be appropriately taken to screen with the same convincing form and tone. While I personally would have loved to see Tom Bombadil and was suprised at the inclusion of Arwen, these slight changes made the film a more cohesive and viewable piece of work.
Aside from that, the actors did a superb job keeping the film within it's context and becoming believable in their roles. Casting director Victoria Burrows picked many of the actors not on sex appeal or popularity but on how well they fit the mold of their on-screen counterparts. Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin,  and John Rhys-Davies are the two most notable of these: actors who absolutely fit their on-screen molds in mannerisms, physical features, and are entirely believable in their roles. While Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, and Ian McKellen are all superb in their roles, it's the minor characters that bolster them and the movie into a convincing story that can exist independant of reading the novel.
The story is what drives the film, and that's what makes this one of the most exceptional movies (and soon to be trilogy) of all time. While other director/writers who have attempted to create worlds, many of them stole directly from the depth of Tolkein's world and attempted to create something comparable, only to fade in the pyre. Jackson's exceptional knowledge of Middle Earth and it's workings make this movie unbelievable to watch and jaw-dropping in beauty and sheer possibilities, making it an early highlight of the decade and one of the largest achievements in filmmaking ever.",1026172800,2,2271,4.868217054263566

Not since THE GODFATHER (I and II, respectively) have I been so enraptured by a film. It transcends its genre (fantasy) to a level that easily places it among the best of ANY genre. It is the THEMES; love, honour, devotion, sacrifice, loyalty, duty, compassion, restraint - I could go on and on with the TRUE beauty of this film....its themes. It's ultimately not about the story arc or the characters themselves, etc; it is about the magnificent underlying current of how the characters act and react with such realism. How they fit into those themes. That is why the books are so captivating as well. It's the purity of Tolkien's spirit & beliefs flowing though every page. Peter Jackson HAD to somehow get that out from the page and onto the screen & he absolutely nailed it. A beautiful film in every sense, even in the darkness and evil. Yes, there is beauty in that as well. And I agree too that the fight scenes were top notch filling me with the edge-of-my-seat tension that these characters CAN die (and some do), and the scenery, costumes, special effects, acting, etc. were all glorious in every detail as well but what makes this movie so amazing are the humanistic touches; where Aragorn gets on bended knee with tears in his eyes and clasps his hands over Frodo's and says that he would have followed him to the end; when Sam & Frodo at the end look towards Mordor and Sam comforting Frodo says that they will see their friends again someday; when Gandalf sacrifices his very LIFE to save those dear to him against a foe he knows he cannot defeat; Boromir's fall & then redemption (and life sacrifice as well) to protect the smaller and weaker. His sense of honor and duty winning against the lure of the Ring. I could go on and on and I wish that I could but again, I say this with fierce conviction; Lord of the Rings is truly one of the best films ever made......and get this....there are 2 more on the way. With that being said this is a great time to be alive for my eyes, ears, heart & Soul are going to continue to witness such wonderful magnificence up on that movie screen. Thank you, Mr. Jackson...I cannot wait.",1026000000,3,2248,4.485365853658537

I wouldn't recomend this film for young children for violence (battles),and scary images (Orcs and Uruk-hai).  The movie was a good interpetation of the book.  Better than1970's cartoon versianby Ralph Bankshi.  The movie is rather voilent by good in everything else.

Tolkein.  I was amazed that the director(s), producer(s), and all involved managed to create a film that really was true to Tolkein.  A marvel.  The settings were exactly as described in the books.

1323023,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson's first part of the collossal Lord of the Rings trilogy is nothing short of a brilliant masterpiece, with incredible SFX, great characters, and staying true to J.R.R Tolkien's story while altering some of the book's elements to make it more suitable for film.
Deeply rooted in the fantasy genre, Fellowship of the Rings sees a young Hobbit Frodo Baggins inherit a powerful mystical ring from his cousin Bilbo Baggins. The ring, worn by Sauron, the Dark Lord has ben passed down through many people until it reaches Bilbo. The mighty wizard Gandalf and a troop of dwarfes, elves and hobbits set out on a journey to destroy the dangerous ring by casting it back into the lava of Mt. Doom. But of course, there are bad guys, in the form of Saruman the White, played with relish by the brilliant Christopher Lee and his army of Orcs and Ringwaiths.
Director Peter Jackson (Heavenly Creatures, The Frighteners) has taken Tolkein's story and molded it into the perfect fantasy adventure. Some characters that were ciphers in the novel have been elevated to main characters, and while some purists may be upset over the loss of some characters, Jackson does do service to the story's originality. And the result? In a Hollywood summer of dissapointments, Fellowship was the standout, one of those rare films that come along like The Matrix that remind us of why we like movies in the first place.
In a film as ambitious as this, all the key elements are in place, the masterful storytelling, Jackson's brilliant visionary direction, superb acting (especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo), incredible visual effects and the wealth of imagination from Tolkien's extraordinary tome. The suppourting cast is great too, with John Rhys- Davies as Gimli the dwarf, Sean Bean as Boromir and Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf.
The film takes us where we've never been before, Tolkein's world of Wizards, elves, ringwaiths, orcs and all the other imaginative creatures on display are a thrill to watch. For such a huge scale, the use of CG is of course neccesary, and the visuals are incredible, utilising state-of-the-art technology to create entire landscapes, creatures and battles. The seamless blend of FX and amazing cinematography is breath-taking. Howard Shore's brooding score adds another layer of excellence to the myraid of adventurous escapism. There are problems; the film gets very dark at times and the ending feels somewhat of an anti- climax, but we all know that the real battles are yet to come. This is a film that takes you far beyond your imagination.",1026000000,2,2593,4.976958525345622

Within the first several scenes Frodo was a dozen different sizes when shown beside Gandorf or whatever his name was, so I spent the rest of the movie watching him change sizes.  Sometimes Frodo came up to G's waist.  Sometimes he was taller than his shoulders. Sometimes he was a wee tiny thing.  Sometimes he was the height of a normal person. You never knew how big Frodo was going to be.
And the fight scenes were SO redundant.  I didn't leave before it was over, but only because the people I was with were enjoying it so much.
So, if you loved the books, by all means, see the movie. You'll probably love it. If you thought they were long and boring, the movie will be the same.

1323083,5,B00003CWT6,"Having read the books, I went to the movie expecting disappointment. However, this wasn't the case.  Aside from minor plot adjustments and skipping some areas of the book (these, in my opinion, make it into a better movie), the film as a whole is true to the book.  The characters are very well acted and also true to the book. In addition to this, the scenery (New Zealand) and special effects are absolutely magnificent.  It amazed me how often the scenes portrayed in the movie matched those which I had imagined whilst reading the book.
There were also areas where the movie went further than the book would be able to do so. For example, the black riders, while true to the book's description, were truly scary - something the book wasn't able to do for me :)
So whether you look at it as a movie (not taking into account it is based on a book) or whether you examine from the viewpoint of how successfuly it portrayed the book, I think this movie is a true modern day classic and well deserving of 5 stars.",1025913600,,1012,4.401069518716578

I went to Jackson's movie prepared to be satisfied with crumbs from a literary banquet.  I knew the cinematography would be great but would this movie have heart?

Disclaimer #2: If you hated the movie and decided to write a review of it anyway, try and keep it clean. And try and include intelligent reasons why you disliked the movie and not childish excuses like 'I don't have a good attention span so this movie bored me'. Unless you've been living under a rock, you should have known you were walking into a 3-hour long fantasy epic. If you don't like fantasy, why did you watch the movie?

Disclaimer #3: This review is directed to the open-minded movie fan. I write this on the assumption that you, open-minded fan, need a good reason why you should see/buy this movie.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring...

What to say that hasn't already been said? I assume that the open-minded fan at least knows the basis of the plot (Come on: LORD of the RINGS...Obviously fantasy, involving rings, etc.) so I will not summarize the movie plot. You can find that by scrolling up.

So why should you take a small chunk of your hard-earned paycheque and/or allowance to buy this movie? I'm assuming, of course, that you haven't seen it yet, or were not overly impressed with the theatrical release.

I can't change your mind, or force you to buy the DVD/VHS. These are, after all, merely words on a computer screen. But I can tell you what I would like to hear if I were an open-minded, LOTR-less movie fan.

I'd like to read about how magical and colorful the visuals of this movie are. I'd like to read about how the effort with which the cast took to become their characters was clearly represented on the screen. I'd like to read about how special FX were incorporated flawlessly into the film without making it seem burdened.

I'd also like to read about how the story--though now considered formulaic as it has been adopted many, many times--never ceases to tug at the heartstrings of the viewer. I would delight in hearing that this movie is incredibly touching and poignant without being sappy or cliched.

I'd also be ecsatic to learn that there is no sex, swearing or drugs in this movie and that the violence is not excessive but receives about as much screen time as the Harry Potter movie.

As an open-minded, LOTR-less movie fan, last but not least, I'd like to know that, when I watch this movie for the first time-- reserving judgment until the end, keeping my mind open, and allowing myself to ""fall into"" the movie--I will be rewarded for my three hours by being moved beyond belief in the incredible symbolism and deeper meaning of this film and will be guaranteed a true honoring of the virtues lacking in our society today but are not lacking in the characters of this movie. Yes, dear open-minded, LOTR-less movie fan, I will be shown courage, nobility, honor, loyalty, self-sacrifice and love in ways that I have never seen before.

Then, I'd like to know that this movie hurt my heart in a beautiful way and that I am all the richer for having it with me whenever I want to feel that heartache again.",1025827200,,3200,4.547826086956522

I fretted over this movie when it was in the making in NZ - the leaks were very unnerving. (Not unlike the distant rumors of resurgent Mordor coming to the Shire in the beginning of the book, by the way.)
I needn't have. The movie is an independent creation, not a soulless, Soviet-style copy with every line and scene anxiously copied, but Peter Jackson's absorption and view. The movie, mirrored through Jackson's temperament, heart and soul, is a living, enthralling thing - as real as life itself (or more!).
The cast is eerily perfect, absolutely dead right on the money.
Elijah Wood just absorbs Frodo's personality and walks around in it. Ian McKellen must have rehearsed his role for most of his life (did he see this movie coming?). Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Christopher Lee and everyone one else are an All Star Team, no less. And I thought Liv Tyler was just an MTV-videorette! She is a grand actress with passion, composure and poise - I am reminded of a beautifully cut diamond with more beautiful facets than the eye can keep track of.
And the acting is beyond perfect - it is just life, real as life itself, in a universe as real as our own, and Jackson was just there with his camera.
Special effects, scenery, settings throughout are all as good as they come - or better. Maybe a little like Simon & Garfunkel's best songs that are beautiful enough to stop your breathing - then take a slightly unexpected turn to a beautiful final chord.

SPECIAL FEATURES: I found the special features on the FOTR DVD of better quality than most people did- obviously the preview of The Two Towers is the best and most anticipated.

1323139,5,B00003CWT6,"8-9-02:
I have changed my rating from four stars to five.  The quality of the transfer is so good it makes an improvement on the big screen.  The scenes in Moria are clearer and you can see the balrog much clearer.  The negatives I wrote in the earlier review seem to be much less noticeable or important now.  The extras on disc two are interesting and the previews for the extended version and TTT accomplish their purpose extreemly well.
***original review below.***
First the bad.
 The movie CHOPS 20% of the book -in one big chunk- (muttering a chapter title doesn't count!). The story of how Merry and Pippin become involved is cut and CHANGED. The old forest and the Barrow Wights are also missing. Some of Tolkien's best descriptions are found in the forest scenes (gnarly, old, and aware trees; gloom and darkness; spiders and other creatures lurking! The Galadriel scene is BAD. And there are two things wrong with Moria. 1. The cave troll scene is too long and it should have some texture on its skin (of fur). 2. I would have liked to see a bit more of Moria. The special effects when the ring is worn are overdone. One too many sweeping helicopter shots of the river. Finally, the scene where Sam goes into the river at the end was done all wrong!
***Now for the GOOD***
 The history of the ring is told very well. Many scenes show a great deal of very good creativity. The Shire scenes are wonderful. Good humor (except in Rivendell, and taht the ""conspiracy unmasked"" was cut out). ***The reactions of Gandalf and especially Boromir to being near the ring really helps display the evil power of the ring. Their acting (and the direction in these scenes) is PERFECT!*** The wraiths were also done very well.
 The special effects and music are teriffic. The color and ""tone"" of the river and the huge statues at the end are especially tastefully done. Shrinking the Hobbits was just plain unbelieveable when they were running around several other characters. The scene at Orthanc was visually spectacular and the duel was creatively and tastefully done.
 Substituting Arwen for Glorfindel neatens things. The moria scenes (except for the above criticisms), are superb -especially when Gandalf ""defeats"" the balrog.
 [All of the smaller plots of the book could have been done except it would have confused and blurred things for the unread, and the movie would have been five hours long! Maybe six movies would have been required for everything???]

Then be aware that Peter Jackson and the studio have prepared an extended cut of the movie (with about 30 minutes of newly included scenes) to be released in November.

Readers need not fear, for the film illustrates every nuance of the story. From the masterful Gandalf, to our gallant protector Aragorn, each character is a rich tapestry of wonder. Every scene is artfully composed around sets filled to the brim with quirky details. Though a bit long, viewers will not feel the fatigue usually associated with a three hour film. The story moves quickly enough, with enough force and action to rival the best of the blockbuster shoot 'em up flicks. One effect of a tour through Middle Earth is that it leaves the viewer with a sense that we are somehow bettered for having seen the film. That is a rare and true quality found only when the right combination of character, plot and setting sing together in perfect harmony.

Anyway, moving on: LOTR blew me away. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. The number one thing that stood out to me was how heartfelt and passionate this film turned out to be. The movie radiates a distinct aura with truth and sincerity and a reality that binds you in the many wonderful moments. The actors did an amazing job at making fictional characters come to life with real conflicts and emotions as blazing as Sauron's eye. The settings were breathtaking and sharpened a mark of extroardinarily earnest inspiration. The plot is equally engaging, if only because it is so epic. Some may think that the movie is too long or that it meanders along too slowly, but if you appreciate fantasy and inspiration the way I do, if you get that rushing welling of wide-eyed wonder inside your chest, than LOTR will capture an epic tale of an inspired world.",1025308800,,1139,4.560975609756097

It Is different than the book in many aspects but all the plot lines and themes are kept in tact.  Peter Jackson did a wonderful job adapting the screen play and then putting it onto the big screen.  I have seen the trailor to the Two towers and it looks equally as impressive.  The actors were briliant, the special effects where like a James Cameron film and the sets were beautiful and finally the score was moving.  Great music.  It really added an extra punch to some very poingant scenes.

I understand why Arwen's role had to be enlarged.  The movie had to make money.  It's still a sell-out no matter how one looks at it. There has been so much talk about the lengths that Peter went to, trying to be true to the original story, but there are still major embellishments that don't ring true to this old-time Tolkien fan.

All in all...  A dynamite movie.  I take nothing away from that fact.  I will see the next two and buy all the DVD's.  Forsooth!  The Fellowship of the Ring was that good!",1025308800,2,679,4.411290322580645

Peter Jackson's bold and vivid account of Tolkien's epic classic has singlehandedly resurrected the fantasy genre--an accomplishment more than worthy of Oscar's highest honor.
For those who are unfamiliar with Tolkien's tale of Middle-earth (there still may be a handful of you out there), please note that I will refrain from discussing the details of LOTR in this review; there are literally hundreds of reviews on this site that summarize the plot of this superb film in minute detail.  My only advice to the unintiated:  buy the VHS (or DVD).  Then sit back--with an open mind--and allow Tolkien's formidable, yet simple story (good vs. evil) sweep you away during a three-hour breathtaking cinematic experience.
The film breathes life into Tolkien's beautiful but dangerous Middle-earth.  Yes, some of the Tolkien ""purists"" may be disappointed that the movie made some ""artistic"" adjustments (no Tom Bombadil or Glorfindel, for example), but overall the film stays true to the majestic components of the story.  And please don't be intimidated by the film's length:  as Tolkien himself lamented in his ""Forward to the Second Edition,"" the book (all 1,000 pages) is ""too short.""  And for the ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" the first installment of the LOTR trilogy, the movie itself--in its valiant effort to capture the scope and feel of Tolkien's masterpiece--is far, far ""too short.""

As dedicated a Star Wars fan I am, I must say this film outdoes Star Wars (at least since the first one in '77, but that's another story).  The only single fault I have is in the Hobbit Pippin's character portrayed as a dimwitted trouble maker who fell into the adventure. In fact, all the Hobbits bravely accepted the fate of the journey. Other than that, the character development is incredible and the special effects are fantastic and not overdone.  Additionally, I think the director did an outstanding job of compressing the movie.  Sure Tom Bombadil added to the story line, but his character is not, by any stretch, necessary to the story.  Also, showing us scenes that are merely eluded to or infered in the book made the movie incredibly intense and gave me greater empathy for the characters (eg; the Orc fight at the end).  Tolkien, in the book, pulls off the ""Hitchcock"" flare of suspense by inferences to what we assume is happening elswhere, but the by adding it to the movie, the director keeps us involved.  Per the book, I was expecting a fairly entertaining story from the movie. What I got was an adventure leaving me wanting more.

1323267,3,B00003CWT6,"June 25, 2002
I knew going into this movie that Peter Jackson's
sensibilities were far from my own. I expected the action
scenes to be disorienting and over-edited, and they were.
Extreme close-ups, slow motion, swooping cameras, utter
disdain for master shots--audiences today don't seem to
mind this sort of thing (even though they usually rip me
right out of a film), so I was prepared to overlook
the issue. I'd heard good things about how determined
Jackson was to make an earnest adaptation of J.R.R.
Tolkein's books, how well written the movie was.  That's
where I felt a bit let down.
For starter's, the film's pacing is off. Narrative time
escapes 'FOTR' like water running out of a cracked jug. The
meeting of Strider and subsequent flight to Rivendell are
downright vertiginous after all that time (some of it wasted)
spent in the Shire. At the other end of the film, the last
fifteen minutes feel like a clock running down.  Also, great
visuals aside, the film's prologue is inferior to its
counterpart in the Bakshi animated film, which at least
supplied the relevant information about who Gollum was.
With a wonderful cast at his command, Jackson's most
serious misstep was to trim dialogue scenes and then bury
them in special effects. Cate Blanchett, for one, should
sue. The scene at Galadriel's mirror is embarrassingly
off-tone.  The quaint humor of the book is largely abandoned,
a result I never dreamed might come from a New Zealand director
and his UK cast. It's one thing for a foreign production to
adopt the modern American hyperbolic film-style, it's quite
another to adopt the modern American leaden script-style.
This time it's Sean Austin who should sue.  He gives his all,
but the part of Sam is chop-suey.

Although I cannot agree that all of the special effects
come off perfectly, they are often stupendous. The cast
is mostly excellent. I can see a lot of hard work in
Fellowship.  Unfortunately, I don't see much subtlety or charm.

For that rare blockbuster not made in Hollywood,
those should be its trump cards.",1024963200,6,2050,4.856733524355301

  Elijah Wood was excellent as Frodo. Everyone did a good job, especially the newcomers. There wasn't too much romance in it, but enough to spark the interest of those who like romantic movies.

As of now, I've just only recently finished reading ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" because I've been busy reading the Harry Potter novels. I saw ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" in theaters and it was wonderful! The casting was done brilliantly...Elijah Wood has finally gotten the media attention he deserves with his role of Frodo Baggins. I'm glad he got the role--he really did deserve it. I've never even heard of most of these actors (with the exceptions of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Liv Tyler, Christopher Lee, and Cate Blanchett) until I saw the film.
The plot is pretty simple and straight-forward, but the action and excitment is what makes this movie so worth-while! All the actors really do a tremendous job and the visual and sound effects are breathtaking. The Howard Shore musicial score is beautiful and I especially love the theme song by Enya called ""Maybe It Be"". Peter Jackson did an amazing job with the directing, too. The scenary is spectacular and I'm so glad they decided to film these movies in New Zeleand because it really does look like a Middle-Earth. ""The Two Towers"" continues the story and ""The Return of the King"" concludes it. I hope the other two movies will be just as amazing as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Sure, they left out some parts of the novel but, like the first Harry Potter movie, the novel was just too long to fit it all into the film. And unlike the Harry Potter film, you don't really need to read the whole ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy before you can see the movie...but it would be a good idea to anyway because the books are excellent!

1323344,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings was one of my first books in the genre of fantasy. I started with David Eddings and Jack Vance, but J. R. R. Tolkien, even though being a hurdle for a young reader of fantasy novels, was finally really thrilling due to its complexity and also to its richness in detail and also due to its very easily understandable main motives (George R. R. Martin, Tad Williams, Robert Jordan and some others are writers that followed the traition of high and complex fantasy are also adorable). In this novel, heros are truly heros, sword fighters are true artists, bad is truly black and the good is usually white and shining (I do not not necessarily agree with this philosophy).
About twelve years after I read the books, I still was captured by the imaginative pictures presented by the film, but some of the fine details may have been lost (like details were lost in Dune or in Blade Runner).
Seeing the film was meeting again the world of Tolkien. The film is not free of criticism (additional scenes - like the ones includig Arwen -, the ending taken over from the second book etc.) but I very much enjoyed the film anyhow. And what else do you should do when watching a movie? I watched his film a second time, and this happended only with Episode II and with Episode VI some nineteen years ago.
It is, as far as to my feeling, not a film to be watched by kids younger than 16teen, but it is entertaining and it resembles very much the feeling I had while reading the book (I heard Simply Red songs while reading the books, but the todays music score is nevertheless fascinating, like the Episode II score).
I do recommend the film to every true fan of fantasy and to every fan of a somewhat different movie of a not to complicated content. It is mainstream somehow, but it is made whith a very sensitive feeling for the genre.
To boldly go... may the power be with you... one ring to bind them!
I love them all. You can criticise them, but you have to do it better to overcome the critics.
I request critics to be free of emotion (as long as not otherwise indicated) and to try to be objective.

1323349,3,B00003CWT6,"Honestly, this is a frustrating review to write. The Lord of the Rings has got to be the most entertaining film I have seen in years.  But it is also the most disappointing film I have ever seen in my life.  There is love and laughter and fear and pride and action and drama and special effects that make Jurassic Park look like stop action photography.  But through it all, all I could think, over and over again, was, ""Gee, this movie would be so cool if they had just filmed it the way Tolkien wrote it.""  My biggest gripe with director Peter Jackson is that, while adapting the story for the big screen, he has also adapted it for a twenty-first century moviegoer, which is to say, a teenager or a college student with the attention span of a hamster with a caffeine habit. In Tolkien's original masterpiece, by the time we've read a hundred pages we're up to our helmet plumes in mysteries and questions.  Who is Strider?  Where the heck did Gandalf get to?  What the heck is this Ring that Bilbo stuck Frodo with anyway?  (By the way, I know that if you haven't already read the book or seem the movie, nothing in the previous few sentences makes any sense to you.  Sorry.)  But Jackson apparently decided to tax the concentration and patience of the modern movie audience no more than absolutely necessary.  From start to finish, he lays everything out plain and simple in strict, linear, chronological, no-room-for-doubt-or-imagination order.
Maybe Jackson figured that no one would miss the lack of suspense and mystery if he put threw around enough special effects.  In a movie as FX laden as The Lord of the Rings would have to be, you would think that, art aside, Jackson would cut the effects to a minimum just to stay in budget.  But, for instance, it's not enough that Bilbo gets mad.  He actually has to momentarily grow pointy teeth.  This movie gives new meaning to the phrase ""over the top"" in the scene of the brief transformation of the elven Lady of Lothlorien (apologies again to those who have no idea what I am talking about).  Tolkien tells us ""She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illumined her alone and left all else dark.  She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond enduring ....""  Jackson's FX crew decided they knew better and turned the Lady into something so whacked out that she would be alot more at home in the final scene of 2001: A Space Odyssey. And then there's the wizardly Sceptre-Fu fight.  It would have looked great in The Matrix, but here, it's just embarassing.
Speaking of the Lady of Lothlorien, another thing I couldn't stomach was Jackson's periodic obeiances to the currently ruling PC powers that be.  The Lady of Lothlorien has become pretty much the Earth goddess that Tolkien neglected to put in his story.  Then there's the wizard Saruman, deciding he has to go to war and tearing down the forests to make room for his war machines.  Tolkien has Gandalf relate this in a poignantly short and simple manner: ""I looked on [the valley below] and saw that, whereas it had once been green and fair, it was now filled with pits and forges.""  But Jackson seizes the opportunity that Tolkien missed to beat us over the head with an environmentalism message and obsesses over this scene for far too long and in far too much detail.
To my own surprise, I can't get too mad about how the movie enlarges the role of the elven woman Arwen.  It actually works, fitting in well with the story, partly because Liv Tyler does an excellent job of making Arwen a strong character without turning her into the ""Arwen: Warrior Princess"" that many fans were afraid of.  And all that really gets sacrificed here is another elf character that we would never see again anyway.  Unfortunately, the film's portrayal of the romance between Arwen and the human
Strider is really just a bunch of juvenile silliness.
But more than a few good things can be said about the film as well.  Without exception, the casting was excellent. I've already mentioned Liv Tyler as Arwen.  Elijah Wood and Ian McKellan give us pretty much the best Frodo and Gandalf I can imagine.  Christopher Lee is excellent as Saruman.  As anyone who grew up watching Hammer Horror Films can tell you, Christopher Lee's bad guys make Hannibal Lecter look about as threatening as Richard
Simmons.  Casting Lee, perhaps the twentieth century's most under-utilized actor, as Saruman was a stroke of nothing less than genius.
The portrayal of the northern elves of Rivendell was nicely nuanced.  I was surprised at how much the scenery resembled the way I imagined it when I read the book.  The battle scene with the goblins was brilliant, from both visually and narratively.  (Of course, this was one scene where Jackson took very few liberties with the original story.  Hint, hint.)
So it's a fun, entertaining movie.  If you haven't read the book, you'll probably be wondering what I was raising such a ruckus about.  Nevertheless, I still must contend that the movie falls far short of what it should have been.  Tolkien is not the greatest writer to have ever lived and The Lord of the Rings is not the greatest novel ever written.  But I am convinced that The Lord of the Rings is every bit as much a classic as any of those books we were force fed in high school and college.  Fully understood, The Lord of the Rings is a serious, mature story (which just happens to be great fun) and it deserves a silver screen treatment that is in the same league as ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  Jackson has given us a fun movie.  We get from him what we deserve for the price of admission (or the price of the DVD).  But Tolkien hasn't gotten what he deserved, and that's what I'm raising the ruckus about.",1024272000,26,5809,4.599029126213592

1323412,5,B00003CWT6,"...Peter Jackson captured the essence of the book perfectly: from the lively town of Hobbiton to the desolate kingdom of Mordor.
But, being a musician (not professionally) myself, it was the score that touched me most. Howard Shore was an ideal composer for the soundtrack, and even Enya mustered up enough talent to perform relatively well. Every piece was beautiful. Some, like Concerning Hobbits, begged for laughter. Others, like A Knife in the Dark, was at once terrifying, enthralling, and magnificent. It added depth and emotion to the film - qualities which were already abundant.
The actors were superb. Except for a few tiny slips, they were flawless. The main characters were not valiant or heroic (except, maybe, for Aragorn), as is portrayed in most films of today. They were merely human. They felt fear, joy, regret, anger. They were not 2-dimensional characters, more to grace the set than to present a story.
Most important was Jackson's judgement. The book was carefully transferred into film. Some aspects were changed or removed, of course, but the best were retained. After all, they only had 3 hours to work with; we cannot ask for more. It was fascinating to see the characters - which I could only imagine before - come to life on the screen.

1323415,5,B00003CWT6,"Easily the most visually stunning film of 2001, it's worth owning for the special effects alone.  Yet even more remarkable is the success with which Jackson and his team managed the process of adaptation. This seems to have been achieved through two things. First, casting and performances which are utterly flawless, perfectly capturing the essence of the characters - the loving warmth of the hobbits, the isolated nobility of Aragorn, and the tragic weakness of Boromir. Secondly, an elegant and economical screenplay which excises, reworks or re-imagines whole chunks of the novel, without doing any real violence to the story. Indeed, if anything, it is improved by the changes - I certainly found it more exciting, more gripping, and more moving. This is what an adaptation should be: not a simple translation from page to screen, but a transposition from one register to another, making the film the occasion for a new imaginative experience without losing the qualities for which the novel is so loved. That's no mean feat - and if there were any justice in Hollywood, come Oscar time this spectacularly successful effort would have been more amply rewarded.  For my money, it left 'A Beautiful Mind' in the dust.",1023926400,4,1221,5.03960396039604
1323416,5,B00003CWT6,"This ONE movie had me going on for the fantasy type movies. Elijah Wood does a great job in portraying a scared but courageous individual in a terrifying situation. During the movie, my fingers were swollen from clutching my arm rests so hard. I had thought the book was confusing and, I have to admit, boring when I first read it. But this movie brought out the true greatness of J.R.R. Tolkien's work. The characters were perfectly portrayed by the right actors. But they could do without Liv Tyler. Ian McKellen makes a great wizard. He's got that oldness to him that makes him seem feeble, but once he gets worked up, powerful. Viggo Mortensen is very good-looking. All the more want to watch him. He does a good job acting like a mysterious loner. Now, Orlando Bloom, you got to love him, i really thought he was an elf. Even in his documentary, he knows exactly how to act like an elf. ""Legolas is like a cat; always silent. Its just the way he kind of sneaks up on you."" That is a perfect way to describe him and thats what Orlando did. And also, 9 out of 10 girls who've seen him have fallen in love with him. The hobbits are really funny and I think they bring out the comedy of this movie. This whole thing is mystifying and is the perfect example of a fantasy movie. You can forget what everyone says about the ending. Even though it just stops in a bad place....its called a cliffhanger. Peter Jackson is a genius, he knows what hes doing. The ending was like that to build up to the second movie of the trilogy.

The acting was wonderful.  The special effects were flawless.  The movie was still dark and serious (but don't worry, the hobbits still had cute furry feet).  It followed the book very faithfully.  And the very best part was just how well it brought that world to life! The sets were unbelievable.  I wished places like that truly existed.  The hobbits were tiny, the elves were lithe, graceful...elvish, the characters true not only to the book but true to life.  This movie was everything it could have been and more.  (Just like AI could have been so much but didn't quite make it all the way.  Just like the first 2 Batman movies were good and dark, before they deteriorated)  All right, enough from me.

The only problem I have with it is it may have been too much of a good thing. At the end of the first half of the film when the Fellowship was formed I was totally stoked to see the next film. I hadn't been this excited to see a sequel in a long time. Then I got my wish immediately. There was still another hour and a half to go and by the time I was done with the film I was worn out. The second half of the adventure was almost as good as the first. Given my druthers I would have gladly paid to see six shorter films spaced six months apart.  Especially since the last book, ""Return of the King"" is more gruelling and heavy than the first two. But thats just me.

The widescreen DVD makes it all the more real. With beautiful surroundings, like the stunning ""Rivendell"" (where the elves live) is enough to take your breath away.
Also, truly an all-star cast- The absloloute babe Elijah wood plays Frodo, the star. A hobbit. who is destined to travel across middle earth, and destroy the ring of power, in order to free middle earth from evil forever.
Cate Blanchett- Galadriel, an elf sourceress
Hugo Weaving- Elrond, Head of the elves of rivendell.
Christopher Lee- Saruman, the once good head of all wizards.
Sir Ian Mckellen-Gandalf, a good wizard, and friend to frodo.
Sir Ian Holme-Bilbo, frodos uncle. He finds the ring to begin with.
Viggo Mortensen-Aragorn, ally of frodo.
Sean Astin-Sam, a hobbit, friend of frodo

1323449,5,B00003CWT6,"I have to admit, the movie, ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is the best movie that I have seen in a long, long time.
I have read the book myself twice and going on a third time and Peter Jackson's vivid adaption is much better than I expected it to be. His casting for the roles were near flawless, the acting exquisite and the visual effects (which won an Academy Award) were stunning.
The movie itself contained all the themes within the novel: human interst, good vs. evil, triumph, love, romance, comradery, hope, persistence, and the anger it portrayed in fighting for a fight greater yourself and persistence. And the thing is is that these themes appear often throughout the movie and it NEVER gets redundant or boring.
Also, Jackson managed to do what Tolkien always focused on during the creation of his literary classic: a respect for the characters and text, which is portrayed better than any other director could have done.
It also conveys the effects and the storyline that J.R.R. Tolkien had in it, with the right attitudes and presences the cast carried with them, such as Ian McKellen's commanding and powerful presence he had in the movie; he did not need to rehearse for that, and I say again, Jackson's casting was great.

1323452,5,B00003CWT6,"Visually, Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring might be the most impressive film ever made.  Within the first ten minutes your jaw has dropped at least four or five times, and as the film progresses it never stops delivering the viewer sumptuous, imaginary worlds that feel real, even tangible.
Unlike the new Star Wars trilogy, Jackson's new trilogy seems to  understand that audiences don't just need eye candy, but a combination of characters, plot, and effects that work as a whole to bring you somewhere you've never been before.  And if you have read the books (which I have not), it still probably can't prepare you for just how fully realized Jackson has made Tolkien's Middle Earth.  It is alternately ethereal, menacing, and best of all feasible.  It looks like a real place, and it looks like it has been actually lived in.  This sounds easy, but it's the failing of many sci-fi/fantasy films.  Most treat their sets as either museum spaces so pristine you'd think the characters were forbidden to cough, or as futuristic garbage dumps that couldn't house a rabid dog, much less an actual person.  Here, Middle Earth fascinates you, and you soon envision yourself in it.
FOTR has been described as a foundation-laying first step in the trilogy, and in that sense it is a success.  Essentially a three hour chase after a ring that does some very, very nasty things, it picks up new characters as it goes along, and this is where the film has its major flaw.  While the characters played by Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean, and Liv Tyler may be readily identified by Tolkien readers, they remain elusive to the series' newcomers.  Those characters, and others, are barely introduced, much less fleshed out.  So the events involving them can be confusing and, at times, irrelevant.
Of course, that leaves more room for the audience to become better acquainted with Elijah Wood's Frodo and Ian McKellen's Gandalf.  And that's where the movies succeeds the best.  The audience sees Middle Earth through Frodo's eyes, and as he travels the landscape, he conveys the same sense of wonder and fear that we go through as well.  It makes the battle for the Ring feel important, and not just like a plot device.  All of it feels real, and that's the ultimate compliment to any fantasy.
But there's even more to behold.  CGI creatures that, at last, feel real and threatening.  A villain, dark lord Sauron, who looks like the personification of brute evil.  A truly astonishing fight sequence between McKellen's Gandalf and Christopher Lee's Saruman.  The ominous Ringwraiths.  And much more which is best unspoiled.
DVD owners may want to wait the fall out.  November promises an extended, R-rated version of FOTR.  While the film already is much too frightening for children, adults might appreciate a few more gory details.  The extended version will also hopefully flesh out the more marginal characters in the Fellowship (and the pause button will allow weaker-willed viewers multiple bathroom breaks).  Because that would serve to improve what promises to be a film classic for many years to come, perhaps surpassing the original Star Wars trilogy as the ultimate cinematic fantasy.",1023667200,4,3183,4.9491525423728815

The hype of the movie really failed to bring it to light.  It spends a lot of time mired in long scenes where nothing expansive of plot driving really takes place.
While the actors were well picked, the much talked about special effects left a lot to be desired.  Some of the digital backgrounds felt detached, and if there was human style movement, the figures were robotic.
A lot of the plot and dialogue is easy to determine just due to the events that need to take place before they could be allowed to die.  The dialogue sometimes just goes on and on when a few sentences are needed.
A few of us even laughed with the whole opening flashback involving Sauron.

1323527,5,B00003CWT6,"This truly was a movie based on the books.  This means that people who see it will have to have half a brain and more than the usual 90 minute movie attention span to appreciate it.
Many people complain that if the book wasn't read beforehand the movie was unfollowable.  I disagree.  I had read The Fellowship of the Ring years before and barely remembered it at all going into the movie, and had no problems at all. I found myself just as spellbound as my friends next to me (who know the books by heart).  The movie inspired me to reread the whole series.
For me one of the biggest pluses of this movie was how un-entertainment value oriented it was.  Phil Jackson didn't throw in stupid cheap effects like so many movies do to add ""entertainment value.""  The violence in the books could have been abused in a gory manner.  While some scenes still were not for the faint-at-heart, everything was done tastefully.
This movie coming out around the same time as Harry Potter saddens me, because there are many incorrect and unfair comparisons made.  While I love the Harry Potter books as much as the next person (though I found the movie somewhat disappointing), many people seem to have things backwards.  If anything, Harry Potter would be a takeoff on Lord of the Rings, not the other way around.  LOTR had been a hit decades before Harry Potter came out, and the movies were in the making when Harry Potter mania was just beginning.  People calling The Fellowship of the Ring any sort of ""spinoff"" are horribly wrong.
The Fellowship of the Ring deserves the highest marks and I can't wait for the next segment of the series to come out.",1023494400,11,1641,4.5476190476190474

That hopes and dreams are still possible, that they do exist. I love all of the characters in the movie and in the book (even though I haven't finished it yet). Peter Jackson does an excellent job of taking us to an age long forgotten. An age where magic existed in all things in life. An Age that we all wished we could visit and perhaps partake of in our own dreams. And of course we cannot forget Mr. Tolkien for creating it in the first place. Without him, our hopes could not have been renewed. Our strengths could not have been replenshied.

Both times I saw this movie, I couldn't even notice it's length. And plus, it's not like, just because a movie is long, that means it's slow. Through my opinion, I believe ""LORD OF THE RINGS"" was amazingly fastpaced, because it has so much to tell. Which I think is amazing, because even though it has so much to tell, it still leaves out a large quantity of the book itself. But nevertheless, I belive this movie would be great for a person who's read the book(Such as I), or even someone who hasn't read the book.
I am still mad about Ian McEllen not winning the Best Supporting Actor Award(I didn't seen ""IRIS"", but even if I had, I probably still would have not agreed with the Academy voters)!

Though far from accurate this adaption is good enough to earn the praise of those who have never read the book to those like myself who have read it numerous times and keep two versions for when one gets worn out.  Though it clocks in at over three hours, and some people I have gone to see it with complain that they thought it dragged at times, everyone agreed walking out of the theatre that it was engaging and grabbed thier attention whenever they started to wander.  Those who are unfamiliar with the story will be slightly disappointed at the cliffhanger ending and the Obi-Wan like reappearance of one of the characters, it is a trilogy, be patient.
I won't rehash the story or even summarize aside to say that it is good against evil with insurmountable odds to overcome.  There are a few flaws, no Tom Bombadil which of course means no barrows.  I also wasn't a big fan of Arwen saving Frodo or Elrond despising humans, his brother after all was human and a distant ancestor of Aragorn.  The changing of Frodo's disappearance and the omission of the seventeen years difference between the two Baggins' departures was minor and not too troublesome.  Any other changes are not worth mentioning.
The movie is visually stunning and the opening sequence should have earned Jackson the Oscar just in itself.  As for the acting, on a whole it is above average.  However, Viggo Mortensen did a fantastic job and Ian McKellan was superb in what certainly was the best performance I have seen in some time probably since Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan.  Hanks also inexplicably lost out in the Oscar race.  I can't wait for the next installment and see if it can be as good as the first.  As The Two Towers was my favorite of the books it should be a real treat.
The special features on the DVD look interesting, I caught the Sci-Fi documentary and I can say it was rather entertaining.  As for the rest of it I guess it's wait and see.",1022976000,2,2157,4.528350515463917

1323590,5,B00003CWT6,"I must admit, I didn't go and see this film till the end of January because I really could not be bothered. Up until that point, I thought Harry Potter was the best film I ever saw.
How wrong I was.
FOTR is outstanding. Full credit to the directing team, especially Peter Jackson. That guy rules. And also his accent kicks [rear]. I had tried to read the books when I heard that LOTR was coming out, but I couldn't because they are a very hard and somewhat confusing read. Lots of magazines had basic reviews and told the basic story, but the film does all that for you. There's a 10 minute introduction read by Galadriel 'AKA Freakish 4000 year old elf' that sets the whole scene, eg how the Rings came into being (yes there are rings, but 'The Ring' is the most important one). This intro sets the whole scene, and from that point on I was completly engrossed.
The cast - wow. For the rest of his days, Ian McKellon is Gandalf. In the books, Gandalf is not really humorous, but in the film. he actually makes me laugh. All the hobbits are great, but especially Merry and Pippin. They are genius actors, and bring some light relief from what could be a depressing film. Orlando Bloom as legolas (lets just say, I never thought a guy with long blond hair, pointy ears and a tights fetish could be that hot). But the one that amazed me the most was Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn. I had never heard of Mr Mortensen before, but after this I guarentee we will be seeing a lot more of him. He is Aragorn, he brings the true spirit of who Aragorn really is to the screen. The Weathertop scene? Mercy me. The film also explains the whole family history of Aragorn better than the books (Aragorn is the lost king of Men). Of course the romance with Arwen had to be beefed up a bit,(its Hollywood for Gods sake) because she is the only reason that Aragorn is really fighting, he is fighting so he has the right to marry and make babies with Arwen. She is what inspires him. And also Aragorn is hot. Liv Tyler as Arwen is great, shes like a [Kickin]-Long-Haired-Perty-Necklace version of Elrond. The chase scene with the Ring Wraiths is woohoo! Oh yeah and Elijah Wood was good too. I watched Deep Impact recently and I kept expecting Wood to go 'This is the One Ring'
It is somewhat scary, yes. I nearly wet myself in one scene, and thats because the Ringwraiths (black was so last century, darling) are so damn scary. They are servants of the bad guy, Sauron, a man with a Ring and spiky helmet obsession. Also if you have young children one scene with Bilbo Baggins, and a evil Uruk Hai will scare the [heck] out of them. The Cave Troll just looks like it has run into a wall too fast though.
Yada yada yada, I have now seen this film about 4 times, and like a fine wine, it gets better with age. I have also read the books and (oh dear) all the extra bits in ROTK. I just hate the fact that we have to wait till December till the two towers (which is the best of the trilogy). The huge cafoodal at Helms Deep looks outstanding. If anyone wants to know where I'll be on December 16 its at a cinema with surround sound!
And for all you movie buffs out there, yes you can see a car in the background of one scene!

1323637,5,B00003CWT6,"I just saw this film for the third time (in the theatre). The first time, I thought it was good. The second time, I thought it was absolutely brilliant. The third time, that was reinforced. The only bad thing I can say is that it is only one third of a movie. At the end, I was ready to see the next 6 hours (*The Two Towers* and *Return of the King*).
Ultimately, the thing that makes this movie outstanding is not the scenery, the acting, or the special effects, but its humanity. Don't get me wrong. The scenery was breathtaking, particularly the Shire. The acting was impressive, particularly Wood's Frodo and McKellen's Gandalf. The special effects were special, particularly the small height of hobbits. All of these things are ingredients to make a great movie, but a truelly outstanding movie needs more. It needs heart. The Fellowship of the Ring has that.
It is an *epic* tale of good and evil, where even the smallest person can make a difference. Of course we know that good will win out in the end, so it could be dismissed as being predictable. That isn't the point. The true power of an epic tale lies not in the result but in the characters that make the journey. My favorite line from the movie is an often overlooked one from Sam: ""If I take one more step, it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been."" That line captures Sam perfectly. He is not keen on adventure, but he will do it for Frodo. Similarly, Frodo makes the decision that he will take the Ring, though he does not know the way. Sam and Frodo will not be highly rewarded for their bravery when this journey comes to a close, but they undertake it anyway. These are epic heroes. Other highlights of humanity are Gandalf and Bilbo puffing pipe weed in the Shire, Frodo's face after leaving Moria, and Merry and Pippin's sacrifice that allows Frodo to escape the orcs.
It's brilliant how a tale of such humanity actually doesn't contain many humans (not that Aragon or Boromir aren't important and worthy companions). These hobbits, elves, and dwarves are much more alive (and human) than most of what you will see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. It was a real travesty that *A Beautiful Mind* walked away with Best Picture. Though it was more or less a true story, it failed to be as real as *Fellowship of the Ring*'s fantasy.",1022803200,3,2321,4.541766109785203
1323638,5,B00003CWT6,"Before i review the movie, I just wanted to make sure everybody knew that this is a 2-disc set and that a 4-disc set is coming out in november. just so you know if you want to buy this and that or just this or that. :)
now, this movie is one of the best movies ever made. i guess it was fitting that it did not win an oscar back in March, after all, Citizen Kane also did not win an oscar for best picture. (by the way, raise your hands who knows what movie won in it's place. do you think 50 years from now we'll remember A Beautiful Mind or Lord of the Rings?)
The movie begins with a 10 minute prologue about the Ring of Power and its journey from the finger of Sauron to Bilbo's possession. from the very start this film breathes life to the story. unlike Harry Potter, a superb book turned into a mediocre movie, Lord of the Rings the movie has life of its own. All of us who read the book by Tolkein know the plotline, and while the movie follows it faithfully, leaving out only a few sections, including the Tom Bombadil part (which i feel was a divergence even in the book), and introducing new plot lines, the movie moves along with passion and intensity. we want to know what will happen to Gandalf when he meets Saruman. we want to know how Frodo sees the world when he puts the ring on his finger. the movie breathes of vitality.
There are also many parts of the film that sent chills down my spine, such as when the Wringwraiths surrounded the tiny hobbits on the ridge, or when Gandalf and Saruman fought each other, or the entire scene in the Mines of Moria.
The music for the film is superb, composed beautifully by Howard Shore. the music invokes peace during the scenes at Hobbiton and danger in the mines of Moria. Well done Mr. Shore.
So in the end, i congradulate Peter Jackson and all involved in making this movie. what's more, i'll be very happy these next two years knowing that the next two are going to be just as good. All three were filmed at the same time, which means that they will all be the same quality! great work Mr. Jackson! I can't wait until the Two Towers!",1022716800,20,2097,4.205955334987593

I felt like I had watched the author write this blasted thing word by word it went so slow.  The attention to detail was excruciating, painful, laborious, you get the picture.  While the visuals were beautiful, the novelty of that wore off in about 15 minutes and then it was scene after torturous scene of this Baggins jackass on his horribly boring hike to the fiery mountain (which by the way he never gets to, that will happen after 6 more illegally boring hours of this gruesome ""epic"").  If your idea of ""magical fun"" is watching wierdo's hike through neat scenery for hours and not get anywhere, you'll love this.  I'm 35 years old and I can honestly say that I've NEVER been so happy for a movie to be finished in my life (I would have left but I was there with a friend who appeared to be in to it, so I was nice).  For my part I'm going to skip the next two and maybe watch some grass grow, it's free and I won't feel bad if I fall asleep.

It certainly deserves every bit of praise it gets.  To tell the truth, I was a bit worried; films never live up to the books, do they? Peter J. proved me wrong along with all the cast.  I was really impressed, each of the five or six times I've seen it...Anyone who hasn't seen this film is really missing something.  Like I said, it's a classic, with all the care and love put into the scripting, directing, acting and filming that Tolkien  put into writing it in the first place, along with a whole lot of skill and talent all round, it's a cinematic masterpiece and probably the height of Peter J's career, as sadly he has said he wouldn't attempt such a big project again.

I fully expected a big budget epic of Lord of the Rings to be a typical ""Hollywood"" style rendering of a beloved tale complete with shortcuts changes in storyline etc.
What a nice surprise to see a fine film instead.  True to the storyline and to Tolkien in spirit the film cuts and changes only what it needs to in order to tell the tale on screne.
Elijah Wood does a fine job as Frodo Baggins.  Ian McClellan IS Gandalf on the screen as far as I am concerned, while the casting is well done throughout.
What is especially endearing is the attention to detail throughout the film.  Little things such as shields, clothing, furniture are all done in such a manner that it seems indigenous to the culture of Middle-Earth.
It's also a great benefit that most of the film was done in one filming and edited into three movies.  The continuity should be much better than in other sequels.

1323645,5,B00003CWT6,"Every once and a while a movie comes along that changes the way you think about movies in general.  Most productions that come out of Hollywood today have several good things in them: whether it be a worthy story, a good adaptation or writing, the cinematography, acting, direction, special effects, or a  vast variety of other elements.  We see one or two of these in many of Hollywoods productions today.  But whatever happened to great epics like Lawrence of Arabia? or Ben-Hur? or The Bridge on the River Kwai? or I could go on forever.  These films had every piece of the puzzle and they are considered masterpieces.  Their feeling and message transcended the screen and took form in the very lives and ideas of the audience.  There are several exceptions: Braveheart and Schindlers List and several movies that have been recently released.  But for some reason this film really stands out in my mind.  In the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, I see a glorious return of this great epic movie to Hollywood.
Not since Lawrence of Arabia, have I seen such images on the screen, that stay in my thoughts whenever I think of the film.  Not since Gone with the Wind, has a film held up so true to the original book.  Finally, a movie has come along that I believe is worthy of comparison  Every piece of the puzzle is present in the Fellowship of the Ring, and the image that the puzzle presents to us is a beautiful, breathtaking picture.
It has received much criticism that the film was left too open at the end and there was not enough closure.  Of course, this is necessary to leave room for the sequels, however I see this as a good thing.  If I am to expect two more movies to be released in two more years of this caliber with the same vibrance, passion, and attention to detail or perhaps better than the first  That notion along with this movie has rather restored my faith in Hollywood, and hopefully The Lord of the Rings success will bring about a trend of significant, thoughtful filmmaking.",1022457600,7,2017,4.533149171270718

Obviously there is no way to fit everything from such a rich and well rounded story onto the screen but Peter Jackson did an amazing job at capturing the vital elements.
The only major complaint I have is how Aragorn is portrayed as somehow not having ""kept the faith"".  The man goes into the wilderness for 70 years (he is 90 at the time of the LOTR) toiling endlessly for the cause of good, only to be casually dismissed by Elrond (in the movie) as having turned away from his destiny...
That however, is my only real complaint.  One of the things I loved the most about this production was how it showed aspects of the characters not portrayed in the book.  Things like Boromir teaching the hobbits sword fighting around the fire, greatly enhance the story and shows the bond between the members of the fellowship.  Gandalf's deep love of the Shire and his desire to protect it at all costs is portrayed wonderfully too.  And lets face it, Ian McKellan IS Gandalf.  What an amazing performance.
For the uninitiated, I would recommend going over a companion guide or summary prior to seeing the movie.  The sheer volume of details packed into this production could definitely cause confusion at times.",1022025600,2,1476,4.686046511627907
1323699,5,B00003CWT6,"The casting, the direction itself, the music, the pacing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. In my humble opinion this film is outstanding on so many levels. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is, I think, just fantastic. I mean really, it's fantastic. A lot of actors, I fear, would be tempted to focus more on the powerful wizard's wizardly tricks. But McKellen's Gandalf feels human. He's sad that he has such an important role in this quest, or more accurately, that his innocent hobbit friends do, yet realizes his place and is determined to triumph. [I've got to personally thank Mr. Jackson here for sparing us the corny lightning-out-of-the-fingers magic in this movie. I agree with him that it would not be appropriate.] I am, for one, disappointed that McKellen didn't win an Oscar for his performance. Here I must be careful that I don't belittle the other actors. Elijah Wood does MUCH better than I thought he would as Frodo. (In fact, I just did not at all picture Frodo looking like Wood. But it turned out all right, in my opinion.) He is a good Frodo. Sean Bean is, I think, the PERFECT Boromir. He looks the part to a T. He plays him well, although perhaps a little bit more exaggerated than necessary concerning the ""darker"" side. Near perfection, really. I know that a lot of people were disappointed with Hugo Weaving as Elrond. I wasn't. I loved Weaving as Elrond. He was majestic and powerful. Fierce, but kind. Please, just see this movie.
Now I'll move on to a couple of things I didn't like about this movie. My first criticism is that some of the earlier chase scenes seemed a bit too dramatic to me. In my opinion because they pumped up the earlier chase sequences so much they slightly damaged the later scenes that truly are extremely dramatic. And I think the choir was used too much for the same reason. My other criticism is that I think the drowning scene with Frodo and Sam at the end was unnecessarily melodramatic. Coming off of a very intense and emotional sequence (which I won't spoil here for those who haven't seen the movie) this scene just strikes me as a little corny. The message it delivers (loyalty and friendship) is wonderful, but it could have been done a bit better, I think.

I was excited to hear that it was coming to DVD in August and I was all ready to buy it the day it came out.......untill I read on it's offical website that a SPECIAL ADDITION (i.e. the director's cut) with 30 minutes of additional footage INCLUDED in the film will be released in November!!!(making the movie about 3h45mins long) WTF?? They want me to buy the movie and a better dvd version will be released three months later??? Needless to say I'll be renting it in Aug. and buying it in Nov. So if your like me and you want all the features and see what the director really wanted you to see (before he had to cut it down)rent it and wait till November.,1021680000,3,709,4.144927536231884
1323744,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is by far the greatest film I have ever seen.  It's amazing it is rated PG-13, but then it is a bit gorry and rather frightening--a five-year-old was sitting in front of me in the theater saying he was scared. Anyway, the reason this film deserves a rating BETTER than just five stars is because of its great battle sequences, characters, the actors who play the characters, sets, scenery, etc., etc., etc. This movie is so good that it makes you practically sit on the edge of your seat.  Though I had never read the books, I had heard what the main point was--Frodo Baggins, a hobbit of the Shire, takes it upon himself to take the Ring of Power to Mordor to destroy it forever--but I hadn't had any real motivation to actually read them.  So when my friend took me and my sister to see it, I was greatly looking forward to it, not only because there was a rather handsome young actor (Orlando Bloom) in it playing an Elf, and not because there are a lot of other cuties in it, but because this story intrigued me.  I ended up sitting through the whole movie squeezing the life out of the half-full Skittles bag I was holding in my hand.  But really, the film is a great, great, GREAT piece of work.  I really admire Peter Jackson, the director, for taking on such a huge project.  What's more, all three of the movies were made in three years since 1999.  I also admire Peter Jackson for not wanting to release all three movies in the same year; he was hoping to let other films have a chance.  Which tells you that it was a blockbuster right from the start.  Please rent and/or buy this great movie.  You WON'T be disappointed unless you're the type of person who thinks movies based on great novels should be EXACTLY like the novel.",1021680000,,1748,4.364197530864198

but the way the movie was directed and how well the actors resembled to their characters was fantastic, though I wish that the movies weren't so far apart. My favorite character from the movie was the lady Galadriel,her ancient wisdom and age was astonishing and to think if you have already read the silmarillion you would realize how old she really was.

While I do have small quibbles with the film (where is the scene of Gimli asking Galadriel for a lock of her hair?!) there was nothing so major that could possibly ruin the experience of seeing this film.  I mean, watching Ian McKellan face off against the Balrog was well worth the price of admission!  I plan on buying all the DVD's and watching this movie for years to come.

After that Phantom Menace fiasco, I've been waiting desperately for something like this to happen. I've also been waiting for Elijah Wood, my favorite actor for 10 years, to hit it big time. I am grateful that I'm alive to see this...I believe that The Fellowship of the Ring has its faults, but they are obscured into oblivion in the blinding beauty and grandeur of the entire production. Sure, I can do without the scene with 'breakdancing' wizards, which is painful to watch, really. But how can you complain when the Nazguls jump out at you with maximum terror? Or when the Fellowship breaks down in tears after Gandalf falls? Or when Frodo gazes into Sam's unwavering face and says ""Sam, I'm glad you're with me""?
The amazing acting, artistry, and technical wizardry all come to life in perfect grace and harmony under the leadership of Peter Jackson, who I presume would  achieve the status of George Lucas after all three trilogies are released. My hope is that next year, the Oscars will realize its mistake and commend the people who REALLY deserve it.

1323877,3,B00003CWT6,"But I'm writing a review anyway.  3 stars for it being a review of the movie and not the DVD.  Although I am pleased to see the whole movie will be on one DVD!
Anyway...I've seen it twice, the first time, going in as a Tolkien fan of more than a decade, expecting certain things (such as I had heard Arwen wouldn't do too much) only to be hideously disappointed by the loss of what I thought to be a crucial scene for Frodo (telling off all nine Ringwraiths when you've got nine toes in the grave shows some WILL...but instead we get Arwen usurping the power of Elrond, Gandalf, stealing Glorfindel's horse, and making Aragorn look bad), so I was somewhat disappointed in the film; there are a number of other details I could gripe about, generally Tolkienite technicalities, not things like the condensation that took place (I understand that that much book has to be snipped, and they did a generally good job snipping!). The Ringwraiths were rather weak as 'synchronized swimmers', and I felt really bad for Frodo the designated Dartboard that every bad thing in the universe was out to get...but I must confess I was still over-awed and would have very willingly sat in the theatre for 6 more hours to see TTT and RotK.
Upon the second viewing I was much more impressed, because knowing what was going to happen in certain places, I was able to see that Jackson had shifted the crucial Frodo scene from the Ford to Weathertop; the scene is much different, but it still gives Frodo the sense of iron will...instead of telling off Ringwraiths he pulls the Ring away from the Witch-King while pinned to the ground by a dagger.  Very different, but the end effect is similar.  There were other shifts like that which I didn't catch the first time.  I came out of the second viewing with the realization that there were two movies here--one for the Tolkien fanatic like me who would be ecstatically gleeful when they saw the attention to detail (Legolas walking on snow) and how much of Tolkien's actual writing was used (such as the part about Pity, and that Fool of a Took), and a second movie for those who were not previous readers or fans.  It made me wonder about what that second movie was like...I could only catch a glimpse of it.  I was very impressed the second time through by Elrond and Boromir--Hugo Weaving and Sean Bean did a spectacular job.  The look of outraged amusement in Elrond's eyes when Hobbits start popping out of the woodwork is priceless, and Boromir was well played through-out.
I can understand the frustration of non-readers when they get to the end--I saw it first with my parents and my mom was wondering how in the world they were going to wrap the story up in the next ten minutes.
As it stands, I'm torn about which edition to buy...I want to see more movie (especially as I've heard what the scenes cut were), but then the idea of not having to change discs partway through and ruin the experience is very appealing....",1020816000,,2957,4.555555555555555
1323878,5,B00003CWT6,"I had read the trilogy when I was in junior high - many years ago and of the many books I read back then, it was one of the few that stuck in my memory.  I was very excited to see it was coming out in the theater.  It definitely did not disappoint me.  I saw the movie 5 times and each time it only got better.  After seeing it the first time and getting through the special effects and intense scenes - and there are some intense scenes - I enjoyed the next 4 viewings even more.  After the initial shock I was able to think more about the dialogue, develop the characters in my mind and realize what a beautiful, deep story  Mr. Tolkien created.  The vocabulary and creativity of story line is something that is truly lacking in today's literature - and I am a huge reader.  Each bit of dialogue in the movie held me spellbound, stuggling to remember it because I knew that it meant something more than what was being said.
I too was very moved by the scene where Frodo steps forward during the creating of the Fellowship and volunteers to take the ring to Mordor.  The visual of Frodo's small, insignificant size amongst all those large and authoritative elves, etc. reminded me of scenes in my mind of the young David in the Bible volunteering to take on Goliath.  I was also impressed by how the good characters, especially Aragon appeared so incredibly cool as he prepared to take on the Ring Wraiths and Orks.  He almost appeared as if he knew that good was going to overcome evil and since he was part of the good, he was indestructable as long as he pursued what was right.
The movie was beautiful, intense, touching, funny and incredibly deep.  Those who complain that they didn't get many parts, well, I would encourage them to read the books or look deeper while viewing the movie a second time.  So often the movies of today are a light bit of meaningless entertainment not even worth coffee afterwards to discuss.  Here was a movie that was so full of discussion material, my friends and I still discuss it 5 months after it came out.  Most of the other movies I've seen since then I can barely remember the title let alone the dialogue.  I know it is a movie I will not easily tire of like 99% of the movies created today.  I also agree, it was robbed at the Academy Awards.  My hope is that the Academy realized that Two Towers and Return of the King will be back for tries two and three and one of them will get best director and best movie.",1020816000,,2458,4.306521739130435

There is too much about this movie that is excellent to list it all here. The soundtrack, the scenery, the actors, the special effects and Peter Jackson's vision for a movie. Its all just fantasic. But I'm going to force myself to wait for the Director's Cut which will be released sometime in October/November.

1323880,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is based on the first volume of the greatest fantasy epic of all time-The Lord of the Rings. It's the first of a trilogy-The Fellowship of the Ring.
for all the serious Tolkien fans-let's get down to the details. Like all based-on-a-book movies, it's not 100% true to the book. The main differences:
1. in the movie, Tom Bombadil was left out for simplicity. Personally, I don't mind much as I thought he was slightly annoying(though very interesting of course).
2. Glorfindel the Elf(a male) is replaced by Arwen Evenstar( a female). This really makes me mad. Arwen does not belong in the movie!
3. Aragorn and Arwen fall in love in Rivendell. In the books they don't fall in love till much later.
3. Boromir's death is placed at the end of the first movie, rather than at the beginning of the second movie. This is ok with me-I can understand that it might not be a good idea to begin the second movie with a death.
4. the showdown between Saruman and Gandalf is much scarier in the movie than in the book. They use their magical staffs to spin each other around into the air and thrust each other onto the ground.
The movie would probably be better without these differences, but it's still a great movie. Awesome special effects, beautiful music, outstanding actors, and the greatest story ever combine to make it the best movie that I have ever seen.

I've lost track of how many times I read Tolkien's trilogy while growing up.  The amazing thing about this movie is that it is almost exactly as I pictured Middle Earth in my mind and I can't imagine it's far from what Tolkien himself envisioned.
Director Peter Jackson stays very true to the story while creating a movie that captures your attention and your imagination and holds them for almost three hours.  The visuals in the movie are stunning, but not at the expense of character and plot development.

I felt this scene was important and shouldn't have been cut.  From what I can tell, it was shot, and then cut afterwards.  Probably dealing with the length of the film.)

1323960,5,B00003CWT6,"Confession - I am modern man and, as such, am frequently very representative of my generation - skeptical and dismissive, irreverent and difficult to impress.  In the past, I would be hard pressed to admit satisfaction without finding some grievance with anything, let alone a Hollywood blockbuster.  But here's the deal - Peter Jackson's Fellowship of The Ring is as perfect as the Hollywood adventure gets.  I would defend any and all of the changes that were made in adapting Tolkien's opus in a blood fight against any JRRT geek who shall step forward.
Fellowship - this first part of the trilogy, more than Towers and ROTK, begs for contraction... it is longest in the number of pages and approximately 18 years falls between the beginning and the end.  I've heard complaints at the lack of Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wights and I have to tell you that the Bombadil section of the story is the most easily omitted, mainly because he dominates the one chapter or so and then never comes up again.  The main point of Bombadil is the insertion of some more singing and to dish out magic weaponry.  This really isn't worth ten minutes of screen time.
What I love about this movie is the speed and sense of urgency that moves things and, yes, the result is that a lot of moments of the book get cut.  This movie has kept the focus solely on the movement of the ring to mount doom.  This is the best way to do adventure on screen - make sure that the characters have major (life or death) objectives that they continue to pursue.  Some express that the movie omitted the sense that the fellowship had a decision to make over whether to go to Mordor or Gondor.  It was not an omission; something that they accidentally forget... it was a change and a damned good one.  I love the suggestion that the ring is going to Mordor - period.  This is the doubtless objective that drives the film that makes it move well.  If there was a lot of hesitation and the sense that they were just going south and making the decision later then we're left with aimless location driven drivel (Phantom Menace anyone?).
There's been disdain for the fact that Frodo tells Aragorn he's going by himself to Mordor and Aragorn accepts it.  I cannot put into words how genius I think this move is, primarily because in the book Aragorn figures it out quickly anyway and here we're spared a boring scene where they all stand around scratching their heads.  Secondly, I always felt it was peculiar that Aragorn (in the novel) wants to protect Frodo and yet when he figures out that Frodo went off and that Boromir tried to take the ring (possibly scaring him off) that he does not go after him.  It seems like cowardice because he himself proposed the idea that he go to Mordor with Frodo and Sam and that the others go to Gondor.  In the film, Frodo gets to look him in the eyes and Aragorn knows that he is going off for the right reasons.
Then there's those that gripe about the extended role of Arwen, probably feeling that it's been Hollywooded up by adding more of `the girl' and `romance'.  But isn't it queer that Aragorn marries Arwen, who does so little.  If it happens exactly as the book, the audience will end up liking Eowyn more as a stronger character.  Not that Aragorn has to love the stronger character, it's just that by showing more of what George Costanza would call `relationship Aragorn' - Aragorn out of the context of the quest or war, it doesn't just add more Arwen, it adds dimension to the future king - adds humanity, which honestly isn't in the book.
At least one fan review says something to the extent that many fans take great offense to the fact that Glorfindel was eliminated.  What they don't understand is that in a movie it can be hard to throw in extra characters with extra names mainly because the names are frequently missed (their not written down for you to see every few lines after all).  Since Glorfindel doesn't ever come up again, why burden an audience that's already taking in a lot of info with his presence?
I feel that the reason some fans are so attached to these small characters (Glorfindel, Bombadil, Lobelia, Lotho) is because there's something lacking in some of the power players in the books.  My examples are Aragorn, Saruman and to a lesser degree Gandalf.  Tolkien creates Aragorn and Gandalf as almost arrogant know it alls and though he often says that they show mercy or compassion or love or kindness, he doesn't show them do it (this, by the way, is a frequent symptom of fantasy - and other genre type - writing).  The film has taken bold moves to flesh out these characters and show them as Tolkien meant for them to be.  Saruman in the trilogy is an almost sniveling and pathetic villain. His power and the power of his voice are stated repeatedly but the few times he shows up there is a real weakness.  The film has vastly improved on his strength and created a Saruman that far exceeds my imagination in venom and charisma.  In summary, I think the great characterization of major players is well worth the expense of the likes of Glorfindel and Bombadil.
Now, it may seem that I am bashing Tolkien in my defense of the movie but... well maybe I am and I'm sorry.  It's not that I'm a JRRT detractor or don't love his works.  It's just that I have experienced lots of different fiction and seen it adapted and frequently characters and dramatics are slighted in a condensed form.  Here, that is not the case at all.  Not that LOTR is not a staggeringly fantastical work of imaginative power, it's just that... well, Faulkner it ain't.",1020297600,27,5584,4.519880715705765

Might I also suggest that you read the books, including The Hobbit, before you see the movie because it's a proven fact that books are always better than the movies based upon them, although the director of LOR did stick to most of the book and did not leave out enough to ruin the story.",1020211200,,632,4.422413793103448
1324012,4,B00003CWT6,"What struck me throughout watching the movie was - Wow there's a lot of action!  Having read the book long ago, I simply didn't remember that much, but it was there!

In fact, there was so much action, and so many people in the story, that some viewers unfamiliar with the books might get lost.  Therefore, if you are new to the story, sit on the edge of your seat, and pay close attention.

The one theme in the film that I doubt any will miss is ~ One ring to rule them all ~ a theme repeated so many times, that, as one who had read the books a number of times, I started becoming irritated by its repetition.  But I controlled my irritation when I thought to myself, Okay, those who have not read the books might lose sight of this crucial and overriding theme.  So I let go, and kept enjoying the movie!

As a long-ago reader of the book, I was disappointed that Tolkien's wonderful songs and poetry were all but missing.

As a youth, I read the Lord of the Rings ""trilogy"" a number of times.  One of the main things that kept me reading - since there was an overwhelming amount of detail in places - were the songs, the Elven/Elvish poetry, and the beauty of the landscapes and the people.

The movie - The Fellowship of the Ring - does indeed capture much of the beautiful landscape visually, but gives very little space to the wonderful songs and poems that Tolkien wrote.

(The movie's own music isn't bad, but mostly too slow for my taste, with very little that was memorable.)

All in all, I'm glad they released this movie, the first of three planned (six movies might have been better!), and I have bought both DVDs, the regular release and the extended version.

The extended version is better for those who read the books.  But it makes the movie even longer.  If you complain when movies get long, either take an intermission part way into the movie, or watch the shorter version!  (If you consider yourself a true fan already, don't get mad at that advice!  I'm trying to win the uninitiated.  Tolkien fans will probably want to watch the extended version.  But by this time, I'd guess almost all the Tolkien fans have at least seen the theatrical release!)

I appreciated this movie FAR more than the ANIMATED versions released many years ago, which as an adult I hated: The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Return of the King.  I recently watched all of these animated version, but they weren't ""real"" enough to one who had read the books multiple times.  The animated versions might be fine for very young kids, but adults and older children will most likely want to watch the movie version that is not animated.

In this version of The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, animation is, gladly, subdued, and mostly appropriate.

TO SUM UP:

This is one of the best fantasy-genre films to date, NOT corny as some are.  The film is based on serious literature from the ""fantasy"" genre, and is a serious adaptation.  But the feeling of the movie is ""darker"" or heavier in my memory than the book felt, at least, in the book, The Fellowship of the Ring.

Well acted.  Well directed.  Some beautiful visuals.  Music, slow and haunting.

A very good film overall.

Ah, but for a portal to a REAL Middle Earth!

SIDEBARS.  SIDEBARS.  SIDEBARS.
  - For those who want more specific information!

FAITHFUL-TO-THE BOOK SIDEBAR:

Is the movie faithful to the books?

For any really lengthy book, most movies cannot hope to be. But it has been more than 20 years since I read this! For the most part, it seemed faithful to me. But even at 178 minutes (wow), the movie is still by far shorter than the book.

There were some notable parts that were left out, of course.
For example, where they met the enigmatic Tom Bombadil and his wife comes to mind. And I already mentioned the songs and poetry.

ANIMATION SIDEBAR:
The animation for the scene where the Elf Queen Galadriel was tempted with ""the one ring"" could have been done better; and the feeling of the scene could have felt more real.

TECHNICAL SIDEBAR:
One small audio glitch in the theater, which I did not notice in the DVD, was a scene with the Elf Elrond.  It seems some background audio was missing, for there was a strange silence that caught my audio-engineering ear!

VIOLENCE AND OCCULT SIDEBARS:

Violence?

Yes, there are many battles.  But though these battles are numerous, they are not overly gratuitous, or overly graphic (to my mind).  It's simply part of the story.  There is thankfully little gore.

Occult?

For those concerned about the wizardry -
Compared to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone or Chamber of Secrets, the wizardry in this film feels far more serious and realistic, so to speak, while in Harry Potter it feels silly and childish.  For some reason, there are far stronger reactions from parents and Conservatives regarding the Harry Potter films than there are toward the Tolkien works.  Maybe it's because the Potter films appeal to younger audiences.  Maybe it's because wizardry and witchcraft are hugely prominent in the Potter films.

There IS wizardry in this film, however.  And the overall theme ""One ring to rule them all. One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them. In the Land of Mordor where the shadows lie"" is certainly dark.

Yet the Tolkien books don't focus so much on the wizardry as they do the Good Will among the people in the Fellowship, and within the Land of Middle Earth, and on their desire to RID the land of ""The Dark Lord"".  Therefore, it is a dark quest, with dark beings in it, and dark magic.  It is the commonality of the pursuit of safety, peace, and goodness, however, that permeate the story.  (I won't give away the ending.)

Now but for a world where such cooperation exists so strongly as it did in Middle Earth in those days.

1324013,5,B00003CWT6,"No matter who you are, overwhelming odds are you'll love The Lord of the Rings (LOTR). I've read the whole trilogy, but even if that coloured this review of the film, it would be more likely to make me dislike the film as incomparable to the literature. However, I found the movie (dare I say this) practically equal to the literary trilogy. Peter Jackson (who was robbed awards-wise) did an amazing job with this. Tolkien's vision becomes stark reality, with breathtaking cinematography, larger than life special effects, and outstanding acting performances. If you wish to have a comprehensive film collection this is a must-have!",1020124800,,632,5.086538461538462
1324014,5,B00003CWT6,"Truly a magnificent dedication to the work of Tolkien. Though he may have been just a little annoyed at the fact that his beloved elvish and hobbit poetry was dropped, I think he would be well pleased at how closely Peter Jackson has followed his story.
The effects were so incredible that you didn;t even notice them and THAT's the hallmark of a great movie. Attack of the Clones would pale beside this!",1020124800,,404,4.5479452054794525
1324015,5,B00003CWT6,"The story, aside from the movie was an amazing one.  It is always terribly difficult to make a movie from a book or vice versa.  Someone once asked me how true the movie was to the book, and I merely answered, ""This isn't the movie of the Lord of the Rings, its  a movie ABOUT the Lord of the Rings.""  There just wasn't enough time to fit in characters like Goldberry and Tom Bombadil because they aren't exteremely intrical to the story.
I was in awe of so many of the actors.  I had read the books many times before, and never could find a true interpretation of some of the characters and when I saw them on the screen, I said ""oh, thats what they look like.""
The scenery and sets where amazing, unlike anything I'd ever seen before.  The costumes (why moulin rouge won out on costumes escapes me)
I was a bit disappointed in many people for disliking Cate Blanchett's performance.  I'd read many people thinking her to be too ugly to be Galadriel.  CATE BLANCHETT IS NOT UGLY.  I thought that is exactly what The Lady of the Golden Wood looked like.  She filled Galadriel's shoes perfectly.  I think in many ways, even more than perfectly.
I do have to point out, though the entire universe knows it, Ian McKellen was the PERFECT Gandalf.  Elijah Wood was also a great Frodo.  Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Boromir, Sam, Pippin, and Merry were all also amazing in their roles.  Saruman was awesome.  Just thought I'd throw that one in.",1020124800,2,1434,4.461538461538462
1324016,5,B00003CWT6,"Thus far, I have seen LOTR:FOTR in the theater three times.
The first time I saw this movie, I was somewhat disappointed because I kept comparing it to the book and the animated version that came out in 1978.  But when I saw it a second time, I found myself appreciating the film on its own merits.
I still do have a couple of minor quibbles.  I believe they should have shown a couple of quick scenes with Gollum following Frodo and his comrades as they rowed down the Anduin River.  This is important for viewers who never read the books, because it would have served to remind them that Gollum is still pursuing them.  Instead, we get a brief glimpse of him in the Mines of Moria and then nothing more afterwards.  But perhaps such a scene will be included in the expanded DVD version that comes out later this year.
My only other gripe is that the scenes leading up to Boromir's attempt to seize the ring should have been truer to the book, with Frodo's companions conflicted over whether to go to Minas Tirith or onward to Mordor.  That tension was missing from the movie.
But apart from these minor issues, this movie was just about everything I could have hoped for.  Some purists object to the exclusion of the Tom Bombadil character from the movie, but as much a fan of the books that I am, I never really understood what purpose his character served and that at best the episode in the Old Forest was mere filler to provide the Hobbits with some adventures.
I can hardly wait for the second installment to be released, as well as the expanded edition of FOTR on disc this coming winter.",1020038400,2,1596,4.426621160409557
1324017,5,B00003CWT6,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" may be a big-budget epic, but it's got the heart and soul of a well-crafted indie. That's a thesis that I've been considering ever since I first saw the film in December, and actively propounding ever since I saw it a second time in February. As rich and beautiful and visually mesmerizing as this first adaptation of the J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy may be, its most valuable asset is both immeasurable and increasingly rare in Hollywood filmmaking -- restraint.
It's a quality you certainly won't find hiding within the schlocky morass of half-realized sentiments and outright lies that is ""A Beautiful Mind,"" which inexplicably beat ""Lord of the Rings"" for the 2002 Academy Award. The joke's on DreamWorks -- they may loft and embrace every one of their four undeserved trophies, but at the end of the day, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is just another dusty relic on the shelf of forgotten Best Picture winners. ""Lord of the Rings,"" which isn't a year old and has already attained classic status, moves on to a higher pedestal.
Hiring Jackson has made all the difference. Watch his 1993 psychological thriller, ""Heavenly Creatures,"" and then watch this film; you'll notice the same virtues: masterful pacing, a tremendous visual imagination, a genuine curiosity about character and, of course, restraint. In spite of the $100-million budget, ""Lord of the Rings"" doesn't feel like a $100-million movie. It has its sweeping panoramic flourishes and its eye-popping battle sequences, but they're integrated so unobtrusively, and with such enormous fluidity, that they feel absolutely inseparable from the story.
That story, of course, is well-known: Frodo (Elijah Wood), that gentlest of Hobbits, has the most unenviable task of destroying the One Ring, which seems capable of corrupting anyone or anything (including the camera; Jackson focuses his lens on the ring so unnervingly that it assumes the magnetism of a full-fledged villain). Aiding Frodo in his quest are the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the seven other members of the eponymous Fellowship.
In an age of cynicism, there's nothing more difficult to take seriously than a fantasy epic -- how ""Lord of the Rings"" manages to be so effortlessly convincing, and so unembarrassing in spite of its proliferation of pointy hats and funny cloaks, is hardly the least of its miracles. The idea of Gandalf glaring into the fiery face of a Balrog and screaming, ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"" at the top of his lungs inspires a groan on paper; McKellen, acting at the height of his powers, turns it into one of the most singularly riveting scenes of the year.
That's ultimately what makes ""Lord of the Rings"" so thoroughly resonant and refreshing; behind the stylistic ingenuity and pitch-perfect ensemble, it has a very real sense of the human consequences of evil. And despite the PG-13 rating, there are scenes here that can and will make you squirm in terror -- not just the kind of terror that has you cowering in your seat, but also the kind that fills you with a positive thrill of gratitude, that real drama and real magic are still alive and well at the movies. Here's to the next two.",1019952000,4,3178,4.942056074766355
1324018,5,B00003CWT6,"It would not be possible to capture ALL of Professor Tolkein's great work on one film.  Thus challenged, the makers of this film sought to bring it to life, and if they could not put on film exactly what he wrote, they would film what any fan of the Tolkein universe wanted.  So far, they have won.  Right from the start, when the history of the ring is being explained, and the brutal war in front of the gates of Mordor at the end of the Second Age of Middle Earth is being shown, the detail and spirit of this great work hits the viewer in all its intensity, darkness, and triumph.  The pace is maintained throughout Fellowship, so much so that any real fan is left breathless by the time the Fellowship ends and the story takes its first great turn.  One can always niggle at this or that technical problem or some part left out (Tom Bombadil, for example), but once you have seen Gandalf confront the Balrog--if that didn't get to you, you are probably brain dead and unable to read this review.

New Zealand was an excellent choice for the filming of ' The Lord of the Rings' the countryside is beautiful.

True, Glorfindel was replaced by Arwen, and the Old Forest/Tom Bombadil scene was omitted, but the attention to detail and impressive scenery and acting more than make up for it!  The casting was great, and the special effects were fantastic.  The storyline itself, as Tolkien wrote it, send you through a flurry of emotions.  The movie draws you in as you watch the Fellowship move through Middle-Earth, and you become as joyful, greived, or frightened as they themselves are.

I don't really like fantasy movies or books preferring non-fiction but I must say that this movie really blew me away. Though I've been told that the movie is not totally loyal to the book, I dare say that it has done justice to it. Peter Jackson's vision brought back good old fashioned movie making when movies were simply about the plot, the story and the deliverance of it and not about making money or feeding the ego of movie stars who just earned too much. The cinematography was amazing and the actors brought much depth and soul into a movie enhanced with loads of digital effects. Without Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood, the movie might have come across as another poor man's 'Star Wars'. All in all, this changed my mind about fantasy movies.

Though most of the movie used digital imagery, the actors themselves provided the depth and soul for the movie, thus really standing it out amongst other fantasy movies made in the past. Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee were simply fabulous as the good and evil wizards. Elijah Wood was adorable as the confused Hobbit out to save the world.

That someone reviewed this film just to quibble over dirty hands ( did you see anyone with indoor plumbing in Middle Earth? Hobbits live IN THE EARTH!!  Its made of dirt.  Look it up.

I thought this movie was fantastic. The visual and audio effects were terrific, and I have to say that the casting was extraordinary. I thought they found the exact people to fit every role, from Gandalf the Grey to an elf extra, they all fit the book's description perfectly, giving you the appearance that you imagined when you first read the book.
I also must say it is commendable that the movie held so true to the original storyline, with only minor changes mainly because of time restraints (although the entire film does end up being very close to the 3-hour mark) and to add some of the usual Hollywood-style action and suspense for the audience.
Overall, this is the best movie I have seen at the theatre in a long time, and I can't wait for the home video release. I would definitely recommend it to any Tolkien fan.",1019692800,,960,4.522988505747127

I read the first of the trilogy agian after I watched this movie in December.  The book did have some boring parts to it and jackson knew that and what he did was pure genius.  With those rather long parts, he made more action and more fantasy come out of those parts.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings had an awesome adventure.  It was like a rollercoaster ride, we were on our seats to see what new path awaits our heros.  One Ring to rule them all puts such terror into those hearts but courage and righteousness fills those who bestow the journey to lay the rings in the bowls of mordor.

It's very important that you know you don't have to be the world's biggest science fiction or fantasy fan to love this film. My ex-girlfriend went to see this with me and she hates anything in the sci-fi/fantasy realm, and she still said Fellowship was a beautiful film with amazing special effects and a hell of a storyline.
Get the widescreen DVD. NOT the fullscreen.

Now I'm something of an anomaly in my family, because all the otherGuys'n'Gals did devour this trilogy. So really, for someone who never read it, I've certainly heard enough about it over the years. I know character and place names, the way children sometime pick up details about the parents' childhoods through hearing twicetold tales.
Twenty years ago, I saw the lambasted cartoon version of LofR. Well, contrary to what so many have said--I don't see the difference between the two! I mean, that wasn't SO bad, but this is not at ALL as good as I was led to believer. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this movie badly: after all, threee hours is quite an investment of one's time. But I felt cold and unaffected by the goings-on. Probably didn't help that I was there on an unsatisfactory date, either. But all the more reason to escape into fantasy, you see!
And the one detail that annoyed me more than anything else, was this: There are SO many scenes of an outstretched palm on which the ring is sitting. Every single palm--and there were several that had a go at this--was filthy dirty. One friend countered and said that I had to understand that folks were on this journey and would of course get dirty. But I turned right around and said, Yeah but this ISN'T a depiction of real life in the Middle Ages, it's a a fantasy. So why couldn't these people be clean? I had silenced my opposition.

1324149,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson's LOTR has become an instant classic in the fantasy film genre.  It justly received wide critical acclaim for its outstanding cinematography, faithful adaptation of Tolkien's material and ensemble acting.
Those Tolkienites who gripe about changes to Tolkien's must remember that material must be re-contextualized for the time.  Do Tolkien fans miss Tolkien's original dialogue?  Yes.  Do I, as a Tolkien fan, think that said dialogue would come off as corny and unintentionally funny onscreen?  Yes.  It's a different time and Jackson also has to appeal to a mass audience.  I think he balanced the interests of devoted fans and Tolkien virgins beautifully.
Other character changes and story revisions, particularly Arwen, have been the center of much controversy.  Again, changes need to be made in order for the story to work as a film.  Remember, Tolkien included an encyclopedic amount of detail in his books - there is no room for that in a film!
Jackson's LOTR is a great movie that stands alone.  The ensemble cast works together beautifully, with Oscar-nominated Ian McKellen as a standout.  Jackson should have gotten a special Academy Award for the extraordinary amount of exposition condensed into a 5-minute opening sequence!
So you should definitely get the DVD.  The REAL question is - should you wait?

Arwen Evenstar really should not have had such a big part; and some find it a great offense that she took Glorifindels place when rescuing Frodo!  Others feel that the movie is quite incomplete without the whole Old Forest/Tom Bombadil/Barrow Downs ordeal.  And, the whole account at the beginning of the movie regarding the history of the ring is not quite accurate when compared to the book.  However, we must remember that trying to capture the true essence of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, is virtually impossible.  If you wish to experience the enchantment the books offer, and the magical spell that the books cast, I would suggest reading the books themselves!  It is crazy to expect one who does not know the mind of Tolkien to portray his thoughts quite accurately. I really do feel that an excellent job was done in capturing the characters looks and personalities!  Also, the scenes were quite amazing!  If you are concerned with the movie sticking to every detail in the books, you will not like the movie!

First, Liv Tyler is entirely amatuer in this film. I didn't like how Peter Jackson replaced Glorfindel with her. It is changing the original work of art.
Second, I know that Jackson did his best, and I loved it. As did many people across the world, but I think he cut out a lot of important parts in the story. For instance, the gift giving in Lorien. If they showed it, it would have made more sense to why Frodo was holding up a vial and the silver leaves on their cloaks. Anyone who read the book would know why most of them had these things, but a person who did not read it might(not trying to be rude) not understand it as much.

What I think happened is that all the uber-Tolkien fans were so excited and just couldn't wait for the release of this film, that when they saw it, they were in denial of how good it wasn't.

so, yeah. great production value. decent acting and all that. but one of the best films ever made? come on, people. you obviously haven't seen very many good films. i don't mean to burst your bubble or anything, but this ain't no Citizen Kane. in terms of cinematic relevance, this is more akin to Major Payne.

1324254,5,B00003CWT6,"There are not enough words to describe what Peter Jackson and his team have made to bring to life one of the most amazing stories ever told. There are thousands of thoughts, impressions, reviews and many kinds of things said about Tolkien's wonderful story. In my opinion, his tale is not jus about good and evil, but a recreation of the story of christianism, where there are martyrs willing to sacrifice, symbols to be feared and proteceted at all costs, a company of friends almost like apostles, making a pilgrimage to a distant land where evil is supreme.
Peter Jackson was brilliant choosing to make three movies in one, and to film them all at once. Each part of the lord of the rings has a depth that of its own, and to condense the story in only one movie would be a disastrous crime. Either the story would have to be mutilated, or the movie would have to be twelve hours long. With three movies, there is enough space and time for everything in Tolkien's imagination to be brought to life and, which is better, accurately.
The visual effects are simply fantastic (the Balrog being the most amazing one), worked on to the last and smallest details. New Zealand is a wonderful country and the right choice for the photography and photography effects, like the famous scene of the two stone-figures guarding the entrance of the river.
The casting was appropriate also, a blend of old and proved talented actors and the new generation of stars of medium shine.
Ian McKellen is, again, superb as Gandalf. Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are the beautiful ladies of the elven. Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood do their parts very well. Mortensen and Tyler also learned how to SPEAK the elven tongue for the shooting of the scenes.

LOTR is the recreation of the magical world of Middle Earth which was created in J.R.R. Tolkien's magical triology of books.
Watch the movie and read the book and you will see the best ever book to movie transformation.
When Bilbo Baggins deceides to leave the home he has loved for so long to go on an adventure he gives his entire estate to his adopted nephew Frodo Baggins. The estate includesa magical ring that once belonged to a dark lord. It's to bad for the dark lord has returned and now seeks his ring of power. An army of orcs, black assasins, and the ring itself are all enemy to Frodo. Frodo is given one option and one option only, he must destroy the ring from which it came from. A volcano in the lair of the dark lord. Not only is the dark lord after the ring, he has acquired the help of Sauraman, Gandalf's collegue. Frodo however is not alone.

1324316,5,B00003CWT6,"This was a truly excellent movie, no doubt about it.  Anyone who is still waiting to go see this, should definitely go.  It is a wonderful piece of movie-making and a treat for anyone who loves movies.
As a visual rendering of Tolkien's masterwork, Fellowship of the Ring is wonderfully evocative of the spirit of Tolkien, and this, I think, is why Peter Jackson should have won the best director nod from the Oscars.  If ""A Beautiful Mind"" won for subject matter, then LOTR:FoTR was a far better piece of filmic creativity.
LoTR is about power, and the way that power corrupts. The task of defeating the greatest and most evil entity in Middle Earth, is destined to fall upon the least conventionally heroic of peoples: the rustic, ""English countryside"" -dwelling hobbits who love food, smoking and running around barefoot.  To save the wiser, more war-like and subtler races of ""the free peoples"" of Middle Earth, Frodo and his servant Sam must overcome evil not by head-on confrontation, but by destroying the Dark Lord Sauron's ultimate source of power: his gold ring.
The drama of LoTR cannot be denied, the scenery and the cinematography were breathtaking (the Second Age battles at the beginning of the movie and the over-flights of Saruman's transformation of Isengard particularly stand out)and the action scenes, while a little 'sensationalized' for the video-game audience, were pretty gutsy. The combat scenes in particular had much more of the feel of hand-to-hand fighting than sword and sandal travesties like ""Gladiator"".  That said, I did have a couple of moments of disconnect with the movie.  One was the silly wizards' duel between Gandalf and Saruman.  It looked more like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, than Tolkien.  The other was the petulance of Elrond (although I very much enjoyed Agent Smith's portrayl of the Elf-Lord, he seemed a much less impressive character than he was in the book). Still, in the final analysis, LoTR is not about the individual characters (except Frodo, Sam and Smeagol/Gollum). As a work of literature, and as the ur-father of fantasy novels, it is about big ideas, and this is where (for my money) Peter Jackson's talent really comes through.
On one level, LoTR (both the movie and the books) are just good entertaining fun, but on another level, there are deeper and more disturbing issues: As many scholars have pointed out, Tolkien's story was about the denial of power rather than the triumphant use of it. It's a story with deep humanistic (and religious) roots.  Tolkien himself refuted the idea that LoTR was about the atom bomb, but there are more than enough interesting links between Tolkien and Milton for us to see that the central issue for Tolkien was the nature of good and evil and the way in which humanity (via its various avatars - elves, humans, wizards, dwarves, hobbits, and even orcs) come to terms with the demands of both good and evil as guiding forces in the world.  It should be noted in these more multicultural times, that Tolkien's moral universe was a thoroughly English form of Christianity, and a mixture of late 19th century and Dark Ages Christianity at that.
One of the most important differences between Tolkien and the more simplistic versions of fantasy that make up the bulk of what came after the publication of 'The Lord of the Rings' is Tolkien's insistence on the inevitability and sadness of endings. Even if the good guys win, much will be sacrificed, and the world as the protagonists know it will come to an end.  This is most evident in his handling of the elves, but also in figures such as  Aragorn who is shown not as a young man, in the glorious morning of adulthood (as he would be in almost any other fantasy author's hands), but as a guy who is definitely a little the worse for wear and tear, even if he can still decapitate orcs with the best of them. This is not Walt Disney's world of primary colors or John Wayne-style westerns with unambiguous good guys and bad guys.
In fact, in Tolkien's universe, the good are often hampered by their own deficiencies, or tempted by their own delusions, or disabled by the treachery of erstwhile allies.  The bad guys often unwittingly facilitate their own doom through the same kinds of in-fighting and mutual suspicion.  No one in LoTR has absolute moral clarity, and that, I think is part of Tolkien's creative genius.
Through careful casting, camera-work and scripting, Jackson has been able to capture this essential ingredient in Tolkien's Middle Earth.  Cate Blanchett's Galadriel and above all, Ian McKellan's Gandalf embody this to the tips of their boots.  Huge cheers for the whole cast and the technical crew for this movie.  Tolkien's spirit goes on into the new millennium.",1018828800,4,4735,4.862111801242236
1324317,5,B00003CWT6,"The American Film Institute (AFI) was accurate, while the Academy was wrong this year.  ""The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring"" was easily the best film of 2001.  That said we turn to reasons why it was so.  First of all, it should be said that the film was amazingly true to its source material (unlike one other major film which was pure fantasy disguised as biography), and that was no easy matter. The attention to detail was stunning, especially when one went back to the books to review those details.  Certain dramatic license was taken to accentuate this chapter and set up the next, but littel was done that was not in the books somewhere.  It was also beautifully produced (the Academy at least recognized that). New Zealand's ""chamber of commerce"" was handed a free ad campaign here.  It was a literate tale, of course it had to be given its source.  How wonderful to be able to commend a film that may encourage Americans to read, and one that emphasizes literate speech. Across the board the film was very well acted with several performances that warranted recognition. Overall, an epic version of an epic tale.  And time will show that this entry, along with the other two that will be seen over the next two years, will be considered film classics. There is a school of thought that holds that ""The Lord of the Ring"" was the best novel of the last century, and a solid case can be made for that claim.

After I watched ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring"" for the first time, I felt so excited that I was longing for more.
I have never read J.R.R. Tolkien's books, and now I am really interested in reading the story of Frodo Baggins and his journey to return the ""only one ring"".  All the cast is extraordinary, and these great actors get their job done.  Thankfully, Peter Jackson doesn't rely on visual effects heavily and his characters are not bidimensional, they are true human characters who feel the danger and the difficult task that lies ahead for them.  His crew members also did their jobs right, especially the visual effects people -led by ""Star Trek: Insurrection""'s Jim Rygiel, and Richard Taylor -who carry out their task without flooding the movie with so many effects; and Howard Shore who created his best score ever, with a little help of Enya.
It would be ridiculous for me to give a summary of a story which is so wildly popular.

1324405,5,B00003CWT6,"This was a wonderful film. It was everything I expected and more. To anyone who disliked this film, all I can say is get a life! The acting, direction and cinematography were great. I did have a few problems with the film such as:
1. I'm sure Hugo Weaving is a fine actor, but his Elrond was dull.
2. Did anyone notice that Legolas did not have many lines, he just stood around or fought, but I guess everyone was too busy drooling to notice (I'll admit Orlando Bloom is hot!)
3. Cate Blanchett took Galandriel a little too extreme (but she was good anyway.)
I enjoyed the rest of the film, and have to give props to Ian McKellan who was born to play Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen who IS Aragorn, and Sean Bean who not only gave an excellent potrayl of Boromir, but made him more likeable in the movie than in the book and I felt his performance was underrated by critcs and fans alike!",1018656000,,881,4.281437125748503
1324406,5,B00003CWT6,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001)
One of the most anticipated movies of all time, one of the most famous and best books I've ever read, one of the best ensemble casts since Magnolia, one of the best New Zealand directors out there - this movie had a lot going for it. I was careful not to get my hopes up too high with this film because I was afraid I would get so excited I wouldn't like it. No chance of that! This movie was amazing - and that's one of the only words than describe it!
The fact that this movie was made in New Zealand worked on a personal level for me because I'm from the country and know how much of a quiet country it is, but it is clear to the world now that my homeplace holds many beautiful sets and secrets. The scenery of the mountains, hills and towers made me appreciate my country more than I could imagine. Thanks for the tribute, Peter Jackson, to Tolkien and to one of the most brilliant places on Earth.
On the subject of Peter Jackson, I have to say that there is not another man, director or not, out there like him. Jackson had the courage to bring up the well-known tale of the fellowship of the ring, taking a whole lot of risks and time of his. He wrote, directed, produced and even made an acting cameo in the movie - the man put so much of his heart and effort into this film and it establishes him as finally the best director from New Zealand and one of the best around who ever lived.
Okay, on with the movie, this is not a review of New Zealand! The film's design and structure was excellent. The sets were truly magnificent, from the fiery keeps of Mordor to the quiet, beautifully strung-together holes of Hobbiton and the Shire. The special effects were really something else, taking us to a whole new dimension in the visuals and FX stage. The movie is very artistic and perfected to the very last detail, all the effort that was poured into the film has certainly paid off - it looks and feels (in the atmosphere sense of things) fantastic.
As for the acting, the cast was really something to treasure. I was looking forward to seeing how the characters turned out. Elijah Wood in his first major leading role is charming and believable as the brave but inexperienced hobbit Frodo. Sean Astin plays along Wood as Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's best friend. Astin is a very heartfelt player and I felt his characters' decisions were worthy and respected the performance and the character. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are fantastic and the 2 hobbits who play mostly in the movie for comic relief. Liv Tyler plays Arwen, the brave elf, daughter of Lord Elrond (a cheesy Hugo Weaving). Tyler doesn't have much screen time (in the book she appears for about a half a page) but she was definitely picked correctly, she had the great deep voice for speaking Elvish and the beautiful eyes and face to bring across her character. Viggo Mortensen is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated actors of his generation, he was excellent in A Perfect Murder and even better in this. Ian McKellen brings across the major best performance, though, as the wise and elderly Gandalf. No one could've played Gandalf like McKellen, and I'm still not quite sure why. He just has a certain presence as an actor like nobody else. In smaller roles, Christopher Lee (who reads the Lord of the Rings books once every year) is particularly evil and well cast, Cate Blanchett is stunning yet again (though I felt her scene where she transforms is a little unnecessary), Orlando Bloom is defines cool as the elf archer, Sean Bean is very developed and subtle, John Rhyes-Davies kind of annoyed me but had a good accent and Ian Holm - my personal favourite supporting actor (bar McKellen) - was adorable as the tiny Bilbo and used neat acting techniques. Also Andy Serkis has the perfect voice for Gollum, and Peter Jackson makes a neat cameo as the first creepy person the hobbits come across in Bree.
The movie keeps the atmosphere and tense and evil as the fellowship take on their brave journey. The production overall was just fabulous and the swooping camera shots and amazing artistic techniques kept me on the edge of my seat.
The script for the movie is also very powerful. The scenes were Frodo (Wood) and Gandalf are just talking and discussing the ring were very subtle, witty and enjoyable. The characters were developed a lot more at the Council of Elrond scene and the characters were introduced nicely and quickly, but the sense of humour never faded, although this is a very seriously written film.
The continuous evil creatures the fellowship comes across are very imaginative. You've got orcs, bigger orcs, a brilliant and giant cave troll, a demon with a whiplash, and my personal favourite - the Ringwraiths - past kings who track down the ring for the lord of the ring, Sauron. The Ringwraiths provide more atmospheric touches than anybody or anything in the movie, their black hoods are evil, their voices are whining and creepy, their movements (most scenes with them in are effectively done in slow motion) are scary and quick and damn, even their horses seem evil!
I think I've said about enough of this film now - I could go on for days and days, but I'll stop now before I get carried away. If you have not this movie then get out and do so right this minute, it doesn't matter if you have or haven't read the books, the movie will engage you all the same, and probably persuade you to read the books if you haven't already. I conclude this review with a whoop, a clap, a cheer and big BRAVO! for one of the true modern greats. I can't wait for the next two films.

It follows the book very closely, so if you've read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you have to buy this!

1324409,4,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings-The Fellowship of the Ring is an epic tale of a little being who lives in middle earth, or a hobbit. It has an exquisite plot, where the hobbit, named Frodo Baggins, is being hunted just for the sacred Ring of Mordor, which the dark lord Sauram had previously owned. The ring is a magical ring with the power of cloaking, but if it gets in the dark lords hands, everyone in the world will be enslaved by him. So, Frodo, with the knowledge and help of Gandalf, a magical wizard, goes on a journey. Frodo meets many friends along the way and has many obstacles also. The Fellowship of the Ring can't be compared to anything, because there hasn't been anything this great ever.
 Peter Jackson is the creator of the movie, but J.R.R Tolkien was the one who had evolved the book itself. Elijah Wood does an excellent job of portraying the character Frodo. It was nominated for thirteen academy awards. It is 178 minutes long, but each second is a thrilling joy ride.
 I think The Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent movie, because it has a great cast, and a great plot. It is also a stunning movie, because it has such good makeup and graphic designs, making it seem like reality. I like this movie because it has many exciting battle and fighting scenes all throughout it.
 I enjoy its plot, monsters, and main characters because they are all what make up why this is an extravagant movie.  The Fellowship of the Ring could have added a lot of scenes to make it better, but it is already long enough, so they did the right choice in cutting out some scenes.
 I suggest someone twelve or older to go and see this movie, but there is violence in it, so you have to be at least thirteen or older, or have someone with you that age.",1018656000,,1745,4.356923076923077

I have been very anxious for the ""Lord of the Ring"" movies to come out and the first movie ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" didn't disappoint me. It was wonderful and was like seeing your friends come to life! The sets were very artistic... awesome! I'm an artist so I could appreciate all the work that went into the sets as well as the costumes. I don't think it is really a movie for young children, as it is too advanced for them and I noticed many children in the threatre twitching in their seats from boredom! I will definitely add this DVD to my collection of Tolkien's works. The books are worth buying too and some sets have beautifully illustrated pictures of the heroes. The director variated from the books a little in the movie, but the story for the most part follows its original plot. I love it!",1018569600,,870,4.343558282208589

1324473,5,B00003CWT6,"The ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is an adventure story, the story of the quest that was started in ""The Hobbit"" to keep the ring safe that Bilbo has, and make sure that Frodo returns the ring into the fire. It is a children's fantasy tale come to life. It is the story of the members of the ""Fellowship"" many who did not seek to go on the adventure that they find themselves on. And they rely on ""Strider"" or Aragorn, who is a Ranger, to help them make their way. It is the most brilliantly executed film that you will ever see! It is the most beautifully done film that can be viewed. And Sean Bean, who plays ""Boromir"" joins ""Frodo"" the Ring bearer, as the bravest warriors of them all who will strive to overcome all obstacles to make sure that the ""Fellowship is safe, and that Frodo is safe! The story and the beloved characters will remain with you after you watch the film! And the beauty will continue with the ""Two Towers,"" in December. I have the Sean Bean club on Yahoo Groups, come together and talk about his warrior spirit, as the one character who was so entranced with the ring that he sought possession of it. Its a film that you will never forget! And the companions will make you weep, and they will make you smile! This film is one that you will never forget!",1018569600,,1275,4.2946058091286305
1324474,5,B00003CWT6,"When it comes to ""event movies,"" I've become a bit jaded.  I waited 16 years for Star Wars Episode 1 and wound up with Jar Jar Binks.  With Lord of the Rings, the stakes were even higher: a story that arguably gave birth to modern fantasy, and one that seemed as if it could never be translated into film.  When I walked into the theater on opening night, I went vowing not to build myself up for disappointment.  However, Peter Jackson has lovingly delivered a movie that finally lives up to the title of ""event movie.""  The Fellowship of the Ring, wrongfully snubbed at this years Oscars, is definitely one of the greatest movies ever made.
Although Gandalf plays a supporting role in the movie, he stands out in two scenes that truly break my heart.  In the first, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mordor while the others at the Council of Elrond are bickering.  Watch McKellen's Gandalf--pause the screen if you have to.  He has a pained expression that shows both thanks (for he knows only Frodo could do the task) and heartache (because he loves Frodo so much that he hates what will happen in the future).
Second, The Fellowship of the Ring is a perfect post 9/11 movie.  In one scene, Frodo tells Gandalf that he wishes the Ring had never been found because of the trouble that has occurred.  Gandalf tells Frodo that nobody wishes to see such horrible times, but we must accept them and do our best to see that good overcomes evil in the end.  As involved as I was in Jackson's brilliant translation of Tolkien's world, I couldn't help but think of the bravery of our firefighters and soldiers.  Gandalf's words still bring tears to my eyes.
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and certainly one of the best book-to-screen translations in film history.  Thankfully, unlike George Lucas, Peter Jackson isn't making us wait 3 years before each new installment.  I can't wait for The Two Towers!!!",1018483200,,1920,4.576023391812866
1324475,5,B00003CWT6,"The perfect movie!!!!

1324476,5,B00003CWT6,"I've been a fan for almost five years now.  The first time I read this book, I was engrossed in a way I have never been before while reading a book.  I have read all of Tolkien's works, including the Silmarillion, and not only understood it, I even *enjoyed* it.  So I've been looking forward to this film as much as anyone, slightly worrying about unfaithfulness and cheapness (both can be seen in the cartoons The Hobbit, The Return of the King, and, to a much lesser extent, Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings).
Although a few things have been changed or left out, this film otherwise remains extremely true to the book.  Most changes as have been made, such as lines moved from one part of the story to another, are at least just as good, although some might be only slightly annoyed by Arwen and Saruman's somewhat larger roles.  But really, Saruman's role isn't much bigger than it was in the book, and Arwen merely replaces Glorfindel.  That's all.
So far, this review has been aimed toward longtime LoTR fans.  I'm addressing the worries many fans have about changes.  Believe me.  It's good.  It's very faitful to the book, and it makes things come alive in spectacular ways - you forget that you're part of the audience, and not a tag along on the journey.
The Lord of the Rings is an epic story, which has survived about fifty years, without diminishing in popularity or appriciation.  In fact, it has been named the Most Popular Book of the 20th Century.  To call it fantasy is like calling Frankenstein  horror or sci-fi.  This book literally created the genre of fantasy.  There was no fantasy before Tolkien.  He set the standard, and pretty much no one since has come anywhere close to what he did, in scope and quality.  This is not your average, cheezy paperback fantasy novel adaption.  Harry Potter fans beware: It is a powerful, moving epic, and the movie is an instant classic, bringing an enourmous vision to life.",1018396800,10,1933,4.60233918128655
1324477,5,B00003CWT6,"I've read the LoTR Trilogy many times, and The Fellowship of the Ring has got to be one of the greatest movies from a book.  The imagery was beautiful, the characters were dead on, and the saying that the book is always better than the movie is almost proved false in this case!
I am so glad that LoTR was made into film because it opens up this amazing world to a whole new audience, and everyone should have the oppertunity to visit Middle-Earth!",1018396800,,448,4.333333333333333
1324478,4,B00003CWT6,"For all the work they put in to get everything else right, they sure got the characters wrong.  Most of the personalities were completely revamped, and personally I found that far worse than having their names mispronounced or their costumes wrong. The only one left unmangled was Gandalf.  Arwen shouldn't even be in the Fellowship of the Ring, she was hardly even mentioned in the books and they made her a central character (replacing Glorfindel, who always seems to get left out of things).  They spend too much time on the cave troll, cutting out far more important things to make room for it, mainly plot stuff which I guess isn't as popular.  It was good, but I do think they could have done a better job.",1018396800,2,712,4.582677165354331

The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, was the most entertaining movie that I can remember seeing in years! The cast was perfect. I felt like I was in middle Earth. The battle scenes were incredible and the bad guys were viciously believable! The action is intense and the story is thrilling. My whole family went together and while some scenes were scary for my six-year old, she couldn't take her eyes off of it. She loved the movie, too. It captivates your imagination from the very beginning and doesn't let go. When the end of the movie came we were wishing it was twice as long! We can't wait for The Two Towers to come out.

The movie is fantastic. I have readen the book and I didn't belive that the movie could stand up to the book that well but it did because of all the effects and all the great actors. Still, the director has not used to much effects and that makes the movie even better. As everybody knows the movie is about a litle  hobbit named Frodo and he starts a fantastic jurny to the evil land called mordor. On his jurny he has 1 dworf, one alv, 3 other hobbits and two humans. I must say that Viggo Mortensen was outstanding when he played Araghorn.

I went to the movie with zero expectations so as not to be disappointed. I came away one *happy* camper. The direction, costuming, casting, and makeup alone was worth ten times the ticket price. I went to see it a total of 3 times, and I wish I could see it again. I wait with great anticipation for the video release.

1324522,5,B00003CWT6,"At last a film worthy of Tolkiens trilogy! Ian McKellen's Gandalf is every bit the wizard I pictured 30 years ago, when I first read the book. Tolkien's dialogue is treated as respectfully as Shakespear's. You'll recognize many passages  directly from the book. The New Zealand locations are spectacular, and the trek through the Mines of Moria is as memorable, as any sequence I have ever watched. John Rhys-Davis plays the perfect Gimli. My only regrets are that Saruman's character is revealed too soon; the hostility between elves and dwarves is glossed over, so the bond between Gimli and Legolas seems a bit too ordinary. And most surprising of all, much of what Galadriel says to Frodo at the Mirror, one of the most memorable speaches of all time, is distorted to provide a ""special effect"", that would be better served by the soft clarity of Galadriel's voice. Nevertheless this ""Lord of the Rings"" is the best film version we are likely to see in this age of the world.",1018224000,,979,4.758823529411765
1324523,3,B00003CWT6,"...To be truly honest I wasn't specting that the special effects would be so good for what I had seen in the trailers, but I was pretty certain that the story would remain almost untouched, cut, yes, but not with reinvented parts, or at least ""so bad"" reinvented. And actually the plot wasn't heavily changed, but I was brokenhearted when I saw that many beautiful details were lost, and replaced with invented scenes. I was marveled about the beautiful artwork and screenplay, I never thought It could equal my imagination, but it was without a flaw, I must gladly admit it, amazing. But I won't forgive that they replaced the scene when Galadriel tells the dwarf's poem to show Gimli he is welcomed for her, after he had been humilliated for the elves, what makes him fall inlove with her, and ask her a single hair of her as a gift when they leave, instead of that they put a Gimli talking about her as a ""witch of the forest"". I think those little details are tender and gives you a view of the dignity and kindness of every race that appear in the story, and takes away the meaningful beauty that comes from the future friendship between Gimli and Legolas. After all, it is an epic story of ""knights"" (the good ones) fighting against the evil, even if they are dwarfs or hobbits, they are always gentlemen. Then they put that horrible scene of Galadriel beeing tempted by the ring, seeming a wild witch, which did not happen that way, and made her loose the perfection in wisdom and beauty she is. I have no complains about Gandalf (marvelous!), Bilbo, Frodo, Legolas (pretty nice too), Sam, Boromir and Gollum.
I liked very much they added the love story of Arwen and Aragorn, nice touch to put it insted of Tom Bomabadill's part, but I don't think Viggo Mortensen has enough personality to fulfill that role. I adore Kate Blanchet, I'm sorry the script twisted the image of Galadriel. Anyway, I put 3 points, because it caused me the same plasure and the same sorrow at the same time, I went to see it twice, I was dissapointed the first one, and I went againg hoping to change my mind, it didn't happen.
I spect the next movie with some fear, I like very much the characters from Rohan, specially King Theoden, who looks great in the picture, but i am afraid Eowyn doesn't look to be a hit, I hope to get a nice surprise, I really do.",1018224000,4,2342,4.461538461538462

  from experience, as i hadn't read the books. You might conceivably enjoy
  it more if you've read the books, but then if you haven't, you don't
  know what's coming, which makes for more fun too  :-)
  I, for one, loved the movie, and i'm told that this is just the 'appetizer'
  & the plot really unfolds in 'The two towers' - i can hardly wait !!
  The sets are magnificent, in fact they don't look like sets. The special
  effects, the cinematography, script - all the technical aspects are
  excellent. The performances are good, with Ian McKellen as Gandalf being
  outstanding, for which he bagged an Oscar nomination.
  Some may crib about the story being 'compressed', but the film's already
  three hours long(though those that enjoy it won't realise!) - come on,
  give Peter Jackson a break here, the guy's done a great job of what
  might've been a daunting task for any director.
  My interest in the trilogy's been aroused to such an extent that i'm
  now reading the books and will greet 'The two towers' with the anticipation
  of one waiting to see if his imagination agrees with that of the director.

  you're likely to love this film !!",1018051200,,1301,4.548245614035087
1324528,5,B00003CWT6,"When I first heard that there would be another film adaptation of LOTR, I really didn't think much of it.  Because I hadn't read any of the books.  But as more announcements were made, stating that not only would they make a movie, they would make three back to back, with a relatively unknown director from New Zealand, staring the child actor from Forever young, I began to listen.
Almost four years later, after four viewings of The Fellowship Of The Ring, the first installment of the famed trilogy, I stand in awe of this achievement.  I being a filmmaker myself, a screenwriter also, may see this as a greater win for everyone involved more so than the average viewer.  Again, those viewers being Tolkien fans, maybe not.
Elijah Wood, Sir Ian MacKellen, Christopher Lee, and Viggo Mortenson, a man with which stardom should have been begging years ago, inhabit the story that so many people worldwide have been trying to imagine in one form or another for nearly fifty years.  They've pulled it off.  From the luscious Academy-Award winning cinematography of Andrew Lesnie to the harmonizing sounds of Howard Shore's graceful yet emotional score, from a beautifuly written adaptation to the sure-handedness of Peter Jackson's direction, this film will certainly take you on a journey, eliciting every emotion only few motion pictures these days can- and succeeds!
Now, given a year that was rife with politics, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to bestow the honor of best picture to A Beautiful Mind, a competant picture in it's own right.  From many critics and Academy members themselves, it has been said that this film could not have won this year solely on the excuse that there are still two films to come, so why not reward all three with ROTK?  Well, I was under the assumption that the best film of the year would prevail as the best film of the year.  I guess not.
Is LOTR:FOTR as good as it is being praised?  Yes, and then some.  But rather than hear it from my mouth, go out and see the film, and enjoy it for what it was originally written for:  Entertainment.",1018051200,,2107,4.695652173913044

I was absolutely awestruck at how well Peter Jackson portrayed this fantasy world as reality, and how I fell in love with it.  I feel bad that some of the 'little' characters were not so well developed (as I found them to be once I started reading the books) and would hope that in the next two they get a little more life to their part of Middle Earth.  This movie is by-far the best that I have seen in a very long time!!!  I anxiously await the release of the DVD in August and November... I will be first in line to get them... and also at the opening of The Two Towers.",1018051200,,804,4.037735849056604

It had every genre imaginable- action, comidy, romance, fantisy, mystery, and more.  It made me very interested in J. R. R. Tolkien's writing and when I got home, having not read the books at the time, I picked up the second book.",1018051200,,392,4.27027027027027

After seeing the film though, I was absolutely overjoyed.  Everything about it was great.  I have now read all the books, and see what an amazing job the film did of recreating Middle-Earth and everything in it.  Director Peter Jackson did a wonderful job, and all of the cast was very well chosen.  All the actors seemed as if this was the part that they were meant to play.  I reccommend this film to everyone, if you have read the books or not.  I can't wait for the DVD to come out, and be able to watch this film again and again.",1018051200,,674,4.091603053435114
1324571,5,B00003CWT6,"I loved this movie!!! I don't have anything to say that's bad about this movie except for Legoles is in it. I think the coolest character in this movie is Aragorn because even though he is tempted by the ring and Evil forces he resists and pulls through for the Fellowship and really kicks butt. THis is a real must-see movie, as the Fellowship travels deeper into the Evil Realms of Sauron, they learn about friendship,and trust. Anybody that reads this should either go out and see it or wait until Mid-November for it to come out on a 4-Disc DVD.(If you go see LOTR right now, there will be a special trailer of The Two Towers)",1017878400,,630,4.3931623931623935

Lets see, the special effects were amazing, the best I have seen, the sets and scenery were awesome too, and the actors fit the characters that they played perfectly. THis movie was not all about visual effects(which I was happy about) It had a strong emotional side to it, snd rightfully so! This movie grabbed me in such a way that no movie has ever done. When the movie was over, I couldn't believe the 3hrs and 10mins were up! I wanted the movie to keep going so I could see that the characters would be alright!(I hadnt read the books then, but Ive read them all now) and I am still very anxious for the next movies to come!!!Remember, you can OWN THE VIDEO ON AUGUST 6th!!!!!! IM COUNTING DOWN!!!!! ANyways, this movie is amazing in everyway and it will captivate you! Ive seen it 3 times, and I loved it more each time!!

1324573,5,B00003CWT6,"In my eyes, this movie is brillant. Wonderfully edited, with an amazing soundtrack(acutally Im listening to the soundtrack right now. Track #2 is pure bliss.). It is a movie I would recommend to all those wanting to get and meaningful movie, but im warning you all out comedy fans, It might be a miss in your opinion. There are several points of comedy but not enough to balance the whole movie. I took a comedy fan to see it and she hated it. Brillant acting by Elijah Wood, who plays Frodo Baggins, and he is not only cute, but has wonderful acting skills. I almost cried when he tried to save a certain member of the Fellowship (I won't name names for those who haven't seen it.). He was overlooked by the Academy, but hey, there are two more movies. Oh and for all you people living under a rock, This is a trilogy, so don't get upset by the ending. I loved this action/adventure movie and im sure you will too.",1017878400,,915,4.325581395348837
1324574,4,B00003CWT6,"The movie was rather accurate to the books.  There were things that were unexplained, but other things that were foreshadowed prior to thier initial time, giving those of us that have read the books a bit of a suprise.
The effects were good and the casting was done very well, and the story is portrayed with out major flaws.  One of the best book to movie films I have seen.",1017878400,,375,4.3428571428571425
1324575,5,B00003CWT6,"The movie, like the ring, has this irresistible power. It consumes you and pulls you to it.  To adapt a phrase, ""It WANTS to be seen"". I've only managed to see it three times on the meager savings of a college student, but I find myself trying to plan seeing it again, I can't say enough about this movie.
When you see the movie you feel like you are IN middle earth. Every little detail is believable, that's what makes this movie so good, the details. Amazing effects, outstanding cast, beautiful scenery and so much more, this movie has everything and, I think stays true to the essence of the book.  As I watched, I heard lines that I remembered straight from the book. Like when Gandalf falls into the abyss and utters ""Fly you fools,"" before falling.
While there were things taken straight from the book, it was condensed and certain things from the book were left out. Such as the encounter with Tom Bombadil, and some things were changed, like Arwen saving Frodo instead of Glorfindel meeting the companions and sending Frodo off on his horse, which I think was more dramatic, but, that's just me. I found that in whole the main idea was there. I also like how at this point they make Arwen and Aragorn's story more prominent. It does not detract in any way.
One qualm is that it did seem hurried along, things happened very fast, and yet the movie is still three hours long.  Obviously, they couldn't follow the book exactly, that would have added at LEAST two more hours to the movie, and I understand that, but everything else is so close to the book that I am very pleased with the result. They should have not cared about length and put an intermission in, maybe we'll get some more ont he DVD?
Having read the books though, I obviously know the story. But what was so wonderful even still about this movie is that it still found ways to get me emotionally involved. For example make me nervous, when the ringwraith is sniffing for the hobbits which I was pleased about because that sniffing is described in detail in the book, or startle me, like when Bilbo tries to take the ring again in Rivendell.  I even cried when the fellowship grieves Gandalf, even though I know that... well I won't ruin it for people who haven't read all the books. Little twists like this kept me on my toes and made me fall even deeper in love with a story already dear to my heart.
The cast is amazing too, not only are they wonderful actors and make you believe in their relationships and the feelings they have about the things going on around them, but the look of each character is perfect. Not perfect to how I envisioned them when reading, or how you or anybody else envisioned them when reading, but perfect because they each have enough of the basic descriptions given in the book that your own imaginings kind of adapt to what you see on the screen. Gandalf has the hat, and the beard, and the way he lets his emotions about the ""halflings"" show, is so heart warming. Frodo, well Elijah Wood looks other worldly to begin with perfect choice I think.  In the book it talks about Frodo and Bilbo looking alike, and I wonder if they could have found a way to do that, even though I think Ian Holm does a wonderful Bilbo.  Also it was supposed to be both Frodo and Bilbo's birthdays at the party.  They have the same birthday and explaining that in the movie may have shown how close their relationship is better.  Sean Astin is PERFECT as Sam, that way he has of speaking, who knew a Goonie coulda come so far. Merry and Pippin are just that, Merry and Pippin, they just look the part to me. Sauruman is just amazing, honestly, the moment you see him you know he's turned evil.  I like how his fingernails are rather long like claws. John Rhys Davies is absolutely perfect to give Gimli that dwarf spark and attitude, like a friendly little Klingon, perfection. Legolas, I don't know where they found this kid Orlando Bloom, but hold onto him, he's masterful. When I read somewhere that he took archery classes and that's really him launching those arrows within milliseconds of each other, I thought, he really IS an elf. Which is why I can't wait for the next two movies to see how they conclude this epic adventure, and especially to see how they've portrayed Gollum, one of the most interesting, scary, and even pitiable characters ever. The few teases we get of him in the first movie are not enough, and I'm on pins and needles.
Whatever the next two movies hold I know they will live up to the books as this one and keep the feeling of Tolkien and his story intact.
After seeing the movie the third time I was pleased to be graced with a ""preview"" not a trailer of The Two Towers!  The preview was such a tease.  I think they ruined it for people who haven't read the books, though, because they show Gandalf coming back.  But I was pleased to see how different he looks as Gandalf the Grey as opposed to Gandalf the White.  They showed the Ents!  I'm so happy!  They will be interesting to see.  Plus they give us a tease of Eowyn, and more of Gollum!  I am so excited and anxious to see this next installment, I can't wait until Christmas!",1017792000,10,5148,4.41921858500528
1324576,5,B00003CWT6,"In my younger, pre-Christian days, I was one of those early-1970's LOTR fetishists (and there were enough of us around to outnumber all the fell hordes of Mordor) who who regarded Tolkien's meisterwerk as something of a spiritual map. I've outgrown quite such an un-nuanced belief in Tolkien's grasp on Eternal Truth. In fact the last time I read the book, I was a little (dare I so much as whisper it, even in the well-lit halls of Rivendell?) cringed by the political incorrectness, the imperialistic assumptions, the sheer darn chauvinism of the narrative. Literary fashions move on, and Tolkien is an increasingly dated form of cool. But then the same could be said of Shakespeare. LOTR still ranks as my favourite novel of all time, and it shows every sign of being the most enduring piece of classical literature to come out of the English-speaking world in the 20th century. In a generation that is steeped in sword and sorcery imagery, it is so easy to forget that (allowing for his largely unacknowledged debt to Wagner), Tolkien invented that whole industry single-handedly.
In the light of all this pseudo-spiritual baggage, I was highly sceptical that anyone could ever translate the essence of the tale into another format. Previous attempts in the animation and RPG media had not helped to inspire confidence. After all, it was reading Tolkien that taught so many people what used to be quite a rare feat of visualising fantastical landscapes and creatures for themselves; Middle Earth was almost designed as a solipsistic bolt-hole from reality. How could anyone put visual clothing on it for others?
Of course the secret of Jackson's success is that the world of Fantasy Landscape & Creatures has become a mature global industry. There is now a little-noticed but very real consensus among the book-reading, film-going and game-playing public as to what lonely mountains, evil fortresses and all manner of hobgoblins should look like. This consensus has been nurtured and built up by illustrators, film set designers, graphic artists, computer programmers and the like over the last thirty years or so,  through a broad conformity that (like radioactive half-life) has transcended their individuality. It has even (in a manner well understood by literary historians) re-shaped the way the book will be visualised in the imagination of people who first read the book far earlier. Most of these die-hard fans of the original book will be unaware of how much flesh has been put onto their original, private visualisation of the story by these external inputs, but it is axiomatic that we visualise the unfamiliar strictly in terms of what we know.
It follows that the original, individualistic, numinous,  Wholly-Other (and possibly Acid-tinged?) landscape that existed in the minds of many older readers has been gradually and subtly been supplanted by the more mundane and concrete imagery from a generation of picture books, calendar and poster artwork, films and computer games. All that Middle Earth has been waiting for, then, is for someone to come along with the technology,  the budget and the elephantine ambition to sum up thirty years of this cross-media artistic consensus and flow it round a simplified story-line lifted from Tolkien's books. Thus the original inspiration for the genre and its entire progeny are joined together. We have come full circle. As far as the Fantasy industry is concerned, the creative cycle is complete.
This may just be long-winded wibble, but it may help to explain why so many filmgoers (including people who like myself have been reading the books over and over again for decades) came out of the theatre wondering how Jackson could have read their minds so accurately. In one sense of course, it is all a psychological trick. In a nutshell, the creative media have been telling us for so many years what a magic world looks like, we have all forgotten what it looked like when we were left to picture it for ourselves. But then again, all artistic appreciation is guided by social convention. Much of Jackson's phenomenal achievement lies in how he has tapped into that collective consciousness, how in other words he has held a mirror up to our cultural soul.
In consequence, as a theatrical release, this film is just about the most roundly satisfactory watching experience I can remember. The three hours go like a flash, and I am looking forward to all-night ""Lord of the Rings - Complete"" sessions once all three episodes are on release. I am less convinced that the film's vast visual and sonic impact can ever be conveyed in home-video format (particularly on pre-wide screen kit). However, in the balance I am optimistic: This isn't just a visual spectacle. It is a finely scripted theatrical work (using an abnormally large amount of the original author's own dialogue). The stripped-down story-line of the movie works well in its own right, both as a self-contained epic and as feeder to the larger trilogy to come. The casting is a major achievement all by itself. The acting performances are all (with the exception of one or two senior elves) exemplary. Ian Holm (Bilbo) and Sean Bean (Boromir) are particularly intense and moving as the characters with the most internal torment to convey. That much at least will come across in any format.

There were more battles here than your average action movie, yet it still managed to be boring!? The wizard fight is more laughable than Denzel's fight in ""The Bone collector"".

Although it was an impossiblity to tranfer the entire book to film, the director did a marvelous job. The acting was superb. My favorite character is Legolas and I really enjoyed the way that Jackson brought out his wonderful qualities. I'm sure that Orlando Bloom in all his gorgeousness had a lot to do with it as well. I highly recommend this movie. It deserved to win Oscars, however I feel that it should have won best picture. I am happy that it did win for Cinematography and Score.

Yes, even a grand epic such as this movie, ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" So to compare the movie to the book on the level of equating the two is, in my opinion, non sensical.
What we do have here is a movie of breathtaking proportion. The story moves along at a good pace. The scenary is amazing. The special effects are done quite well considering they're not done by ILM. Let's be honest folks. Peter Jackson, the director, has remained true to the overall feel and the overall story of the book.

I had re-read the trilogy just before FOTR released. Yes, Tom Bombadil was cut. Yes, Arwen's part was expanded. But these changes did not change the intensity [one whit] with which the more memorable events are experienced.
This movie is visually stunning. The attention to detail is astonishing - all the way down to the Elven runes carved into the blades of a sword and the hand-tooling of the leather garments. Elrond's golden armor is beyond expression, not to mention Rivendell.
It is quite evident that the actors put their soul into this movie and their efforts are fully realized on the screen. For this I am truly appreciative. Peter Jackson and company took my most beloved story and made it breathe.

1324673,5,B00003CWT6,"I was amazed when I left the theater after seeing ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" Peter Jackson and his crew have done the best job on the classic novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. The scenery, the characters, the geographical locations in New Zealand and everything in this movie was done with such precision and effort that I smiled every time I saw something that I loved in the book actually appear before my eyes. This is easily, in my own opinion, the best quality film that I have ever seen.
 Let me get something straight. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is my all time favorite novel and I was really hoping that Peter Jackson, his crew, and the characters wouldn't screw up on the first part of the best fantasy saga ever written. They didn't. From the first minutes of the film, I was drawn in to the world that I know and love so much. The geographical locations and the sets in New Zealand were breathtaking and were crafted and found oh so well.
 The characters that were casted for this movie were the absolute best. Every charcter that was presented in this film was just as I had imagined the charcter from the book. Frodo, Aragron, Gimli, Legolas, and everyone else that played a role in this film did a superb job.
 A lot of har work was put into the making of this film and every last drop of it was worth it. The action in this film is like the pages of the actual book just came to life; Peter Jackson really made this movie from the actual book unlike other movies that were originally books.
 With the Academy Awards coming up, I truly hope that this film takes home all of the gold. It really deserves it. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" was probably the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't say that just because ""The Lord of the Rings"" is my all time favorite novel but because of the sheer perfection that came with this movie. I smiled seeing something from the book appear on screen. This is a movie that you'll watch again and again. All in all, totally recommended. I can't wait for this film to come out on DVD and for ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" to hit theaters in late 2002 and 2003. Watch this movie, I guarantee that you'll love it.",1016841600,4,2199,4.291566265060241

Ian McKellen is best-suppoering-actor nominated as Gandalf. While he is certainly good, I think it's the dimunitive Hobbits that steal the show. I read the book years ago. In all the details I can remember, this movie is an accurate retelling. It should make Tolkien fans out of some who haven't been before, though I would't call it a substitute for the books themselves. But it is a must see for those who are fans already, and it can be considered a wonderful supplement to the original. Often I find movies based on books I've read to be visually disappointing, but this made Middle Earth even more visually stunning than I had previously imagined. I'm sure many of us will be eagerly awaiting the sequels.",1016755200,2,831,4.659863945578231

I went to see the movie about three times and would have gone more but my parents said 3 was enuff. i actually had an argument over the phone with the people who work at the movie theater cuz they said thay weren't gonna bring it back. AARRGG!!! the movie is rated PG-13 cuz of the violence but during the battles u can barely see what's going on. there are a couple of scenes where you see someone's head flying off (nobody important tho). The movie could have been a thousand times longer and i wouldn't have cared.  all in all it was excellent. the only problems i had with it was that it was too short and the ending is such a CLIFFHANGER!!!!!!!!!! i hated it! when the credits started coming up i was like ""but wait, u can't just end it there!!"" anywayz.... the movie was excellent and u have to go see it.",1016582400,,1078,4.1826923076923075
1324735,5,B00003CWT6,"I read the hobbit when in grade school, but didn't get around to reading the trilogy until high school, and now that I've just seen the movie for the 5th time, I can truly say that I'm a middle-earth fanatic. But about the movie:
The omit of Tom Bombadil just shouldn't have been. (Although, when the hobbits are with Aragorn, just before Arwen comes they are standing in front of the tree that pulls them(literally) into the Bombadil tail).
The interpretation of Galadriel and of Lothlorien as this darkish place was truly saddening. In the books, Lothlorien is a place of light, described as an expansive, beautiful forest, where no one wanted to leave even after they had spent months there.
The focus on the battle scenes(which in the books take only a page or two) instead of the conversation and journey really irks me.
But all in all, I liked it. The director managed to capture the essence of the books... the pure heroism and honor of the characters, and the true depth of the evil.
As a note: do not take small children to this movie. They will either be scared, bored, or both intermittantly, annoying absolutely everyone else in the theater.
Also, did anyone else notice that the statue up on Amon Sul(Weathertop) that the camera shows right before the nazgul make it up there migrates to the forest(seen when Legolas is explaining that it's not the East side of the shore he's worried about) and is behind Boromir as he makes his last stand?
and the tear on Frodo's face, as he looks out on the lake, knowing he is leaving everyone and going to his doom? It's a truly touching moment, until the camera pans back and the tear has switched sides? (for the first the left side of his face is dry and on the right side there is a tear, the second being exact opposite).
and the Orc that is supposed to be dead but watches Aragorn as he runs to dying Boromir?
Every time I see the movie, the story is fresh and the characters believeable. Believe me, I'll see it again before it comes out on video.",1016409600,,2006,4.483606557377049

The cast was wonderful and acted wonderfully, bring the characters to life with shocking realism that has you leaving the theater looking for the Dark Lord and the hobbits (and very sad when you don't see them).

1324794,4,B00003CWT6,"Once upon a time, J. R. R. Tolkien taught the world what fantasy could be. Peter Jackson, many, many decades later, re-defines the genre with a fantastic and almost-flawless masterpiece.
If you've read the books, you'll know what's been cut out - but every cut is made with the utmost reverence. You can see the effort in every single frame - the fantastic art direction, costumes, the languages even. The addition of conversations in (subtitled) Elvish - one of Tolkien's invented languages was a master stroke - it manages to give us an idea of the sheer expanse of Tolkien's creation without overwhelming us with its detail.
The acting is fantastic - from Sir Ian McKellen, who will probably be this century's 'definitive Gandalf the Grey' to Elijah Wood, who is wonderfully apt for the film's main-role, Frodo Baggins, the unlikely hero. The movie's other two wonderfully nuanced performances come from Viggo Mortenson, as brooding king-in-exile Aragorn, and Sean Bean as the flawed-hero Boromir. There are other noteworthy performances - Liv Tyler, as the Elf-princess Arwen (who actually doesn't appear in the first book at all), Hugo Weaving as Elrond and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, who manages to look beautiful and sinister at the same time (you've got to watch out for her face when she says - All Shall Love Me And Despaaairrr!). Even the criticism that has often been made of the books - that the characters don't have enough 'psychological depth' can't possibly be made of the film. Sir Ian McKellan portrays Gandalf as human - and varies his body language accordingly in every scene; humble in the scenes with Christopher Lee as Saruman, the head of the order of Wizards, and authoritative in others. Watch for his reaction when Frodo offers to carry the ring, or when he delivers Tolkien's famous 'don't be too quick to deal out death in judgement' line - he speaks those lines with the greatest possible sincerity, making them mean so much more.  I'm rooting for him to win the Oscar, as I am for Peter Jackson to win Best Director, and for the film to win best Adapted Screenplay.
The special effects are fantastic, and wonderfully subtle - there are no laser-rays coming out of Gandalf'f staff; but more importantly, Peter Jackson's directorial vision comes across in every scene - you can see that this is a lot more than a 'SFX-flick' or a 'swords-and-sorcery' epic. I had thought it impossible for anyone to have brought the Lord of the Rings to the screen, but Peter Jackson has managed the impossible, and done it admirably. Criticisms? Yes - I found Elrond's letting the hobbits join the Fellowship a little improbable (the book makes it much more believable), and would have liked more 'character'-scenes - I suspect these were cut in editing, and expect they'll be included when the DVD version is released. But I cannot find another flaw - the direction, screenplay, acting, all make this the best film I've seen this year. The only problem - we need to wait one whole year for the sequel.",1016323200,4,3018,4.83752417794971
1324795,4,B00003CWT6,"I really think that the only people who have the right to be disappointed in this movie are the family members of the Late Professor, possibly including some of his students in that grouping.
To those who have read the books, the script was editted for integrity of the story, and, for the most part, that editting goal was achieved. What was different:
The departures of Frodo seemed to happen in the same year as that of Bilbo, instead of seventeen years after; The journey from Hobbiton was much editted, seemingly reaching Rivendell within a handful of days instead of over a month; Instead of Glorfindel coming to rescue them, it is Arwen, daughter of Elrond; The Council of Elrond; Frodo is the one who unriddles the door of Moria; The scene in the mountains right before that has no wolves, and the storm that sends them to Moria was sttributed to Saruman, instead of being Sauron's or natural.
The weak points: The scene at Weathertop does not adequately state why the RingWraiths backed off; the rage of the Ford of Rivendell, being attributed to Arwen, and not quite powerful enough; the scene of the flight to the ford; the entire Rivendell section, particularly the Council of Elrond, and the overplayed bigotry between the races. Overall, the elves were very unTolkienesque-until the seen at the well of Galadriel. That was perfect.
The Moria sequence was excellent despite, and perhaps a little because of embellishment, and the final scenes were great, despite lacking the Fell Rider, and with a little overlap with the next Book, the Two Towers, which had to happen given the nature of how the Fellowship of the Ring ends. Overall, the dialogue does not start off quite as true as the cartoon version did, but it stays at that same level, whereas the cartoon plummetted in integrity toward the end. A little more accuracy of the overall history of Middle Earth would have been nice, but it was still very true. Watch it.
To the non-reader(including those who have read this series but have not idolized it): This movie was made to bring Middle-Earth to you. Watch it. Definitely watch it.",1016150400,,2104,4.782967032967033

I am in the middle of the second book and I must say that I'm a little dissapointed that they left out so much stuff but if they put every thing in it that was in the book the movie would have been about 18  hours long or something for that ONE movie!

I did not read the LOTR until after I got out of High School some 30 odd years ago and in that time have read the Trilogy at least a dozen times if not more.
As much as I enjoyed the film I wonder why they did the changes to the story that they did.
I understand that time is a constraint, but why did
Arwen/Liv Tyler take over the roll of the Elf Lord and Warrior Glorfindel who is prominent in the history of Middle Earth?
Was it the need of a pretty face?
And please tell me why did they completely cut out Bombadil?
A Being so powerful that the One Ring had no effect what so ever upon him.
I have read where critics have said it's to long, but I say it could have been longer.
I look forward to the release of The Two Towers and the Return of the King.
And can only hope that these films will prompt people to read the Hobbit and the Lord Of The Rings.
That's where the true adventure lies.

1324856,5,B00003CWT6,"Living in Japan, it was a total disappointment for me when I heard the movie would be coming out in March instead of December 19, 2001. Being a great fan of Tolkien's work on ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"", I knew I had to see it and have been excited and impatient for it to come out. So finally the other day I went out with my friends and my father to go and see it. And let me tell, I sure was glad I got to see it! It's one of the best movies I've ever seen!
""The Fellowship of the Rings"" is the first installment of three movies which will be coming out. The hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is very surprised and shocked when he finds that his uncle Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) has left the Shire to go be with the Elves. Bilbo leaves everything to Frodo, including the magical ring which he had taken from the strange creature Gollum (Andy Serkis). Frodo thinks nothing of it but his good friend, Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), troubled about the ring when he sees what a strange reaction Bilbo has when he leaves it. Curious, Gandalf tries to find answers about the origin of the ring and finds out that the ring is actually the Ring of Power from the Elven lore:
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
Lost for centuries, if this ring should fall back into the hands of the evil Sauron (Sala Baker), he would be enabled to destroy everything which is good in Middle-earth, bringing the land into darkness. Frodo and his hobbit friends Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee (Sean Astin), Peregrin 'Pippin' Took (Billy Boyd), and Meriadoc 'Merry' Brandybucktravel (Dominic Monaghan) to Rivendell to seek counsel from the Elf Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving) on what to do with the ring. It is decided that the ring must be destroyed and the only way to do that is to cast it into Mount Doom, located at the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom. Thus the Fellowship is created to help Frodo in his journey. The Fellowship consists of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn the Ranger (Viggo Mortensen) who is not what he seems, Legolas of the Elves of Mirkwood (Orlando Bloom), Boromir a man of Gondor (Sean Bean), and Gimli the dwarf from the Lonely Mountains (John Rhys-Davies). Together the nine set out for Mount Doom. But the way is treacherous and the dark, evil Ringwraiths are searching for them... Also starring are Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, Liv Tyler as the beautiful Elf Arwen, Cate Blanchett as the mysterious Lady of Lothlorien, Galadirel.
As I said, enough can't be said about this movie. Everything just seems to go so well and smoothly, from the acting, directing, sets, costumes, music, graphics, and cinematography. In my opinion the people who stands out the most for their astounding acting is Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Ian McKellen (Gandalf). Of course everyone is terrific, especially Orlando Bloom as Legolas who is my favorite character in both the books and the movie. I was also very much impressed with Sean Bean as Boromir. The end, though changed from the book, gave him such a noble death that I didn't complain much about the ending.
And of course the cinematography and sets were just so real you just wish you could visit Middle-Earth. There's the peaceful Shire, the dark and worldly Bree, Weathertop, the beautiful Rivendell, the terrifying Mines of Moria, the mysterious Lothlorien, and more places which I would like to see. The graphics are just so well done that it's hard to tell what's real and what's computer graphics. There's the spectacular battle scenes, the scary creatures like orcs, Uruk-Hai, Balrogs, and cave trolls, Legolas' faster than lightning arrows, the short hobbits and tall wizards, and much, much, more.
The music by Howard Shore was just perfect in all places, making it so that at just the right moments you are made to feel peaceful, frightened, curious, and excited. Enya's song, ""May It Be"", was just so beautiful and splendid.
Of course everyone movie has some of it's bad points though there are very few for this movie. Many people are probably a bit put off that a lot of the story is changed from the original book, ""The Fellowship of the Rings"". Some parts are taken off (Tom Bombadil, the letter from Gandalf at Bree, nothing much is explained about Bill the pony, etc.) and some parts are added (many of the fights scenes, Aragorn's meeting with Frodo at the end, etc.). It didn't disappoint me that much, I knew the end had to be hyped up a bit for the audience but there was one thing which I was kind of upset of Galadriel. In my opinion the character of Galadriel was portrayed well. In the book she was beautiful yet had authority, was kind but was somewhat mysterious. But in the movie she was made to be very mysterious and given an image of a scary and creepy Elf, there was no beauty to her. Though I bet Cate Blanchett could have done a better job, I think she was directed to be that way.
But still, this movie is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and could recommend this movie to anyone. Best for kids 13 and older since in some places it's a bit violent and the whole movie would be a bit intense and scary to younger children. I can't wait till ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" come out!",1015977600,11,5277,4.532494758909853

1324858,4,B00003CWT6,"I've waited until I thought the time was right, but now feel I must speak.  People who have read my reviews know that the writings of JRR Tolkien are and have been very important to my life.  Thus, I have eagerly awaited the release of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"".  I award the movie a very solid 4+ stars.
Things I liked:
Item:  Most of the casting decisions.  Gandalf, Bilbo, Saruman, Gimli and Sam all get 5 stars; Frodo, Boromir, and Strider all get 4.  All in all, brilliant choices were made by Peter Jackson and crew.
Item:  The Shire.  Bag-end was wonderful!  I'd move there tomorrow.  The hobbit-holes were very well done.
Item:  The cinematography.  Spectacular.  Absolutely spectacular.  Orthanc, Moria, The Gates of Argonath, Amon Hen.  Just WONDERFUL!  (While noting one glitch, namely the view of the mountains from the Shire.  This was a continuity problem which should have been caught.)
Item:  The Soundtrack.  Again, wonderful.  (I'm listening as I write this review.)
Item:  The special effects.  Again, wonderful.  From Gollum, to the Orcs, to the Nazgul, to the huge battle scenes.  Truly a tremendous effort.
Item:  The relationship between Frodo and Sam.  Wonderfully filmed, wonderfully acted.  Absolutely splendid!
Things I would have liked to have seen done differently:
Item:  A better indication of the time that passed between Bilbo's party and Frodo's departure.
Item:  More time in the journey from Hobbiton to Bree (including Tom Bombadil!)
Item:  Arwen's replacement of Glorfindel.  I know why it was done, but I'm enough of a purist to wish that it hadn't been!
Item:  Better character development with Elrond and Galadriel.  These characters got short shrift, in my opinion.
Item:  Over-the-top special effects.  Yes, the effects were spectacular.  In a couple of cases, though, I thought that there was too much.  The Watcher in the Water was far more scary in the book than in the movie (when all you saw were tentacles).  The giant multicolored octopus from hell was a little much!  Ditto with the cave troll sequence.  Ditto again with the final departure from Moria.  But I'm nitpicking here.
Overall?  I understand and respect the Tolkien family's hesitation to endorse this (or any other) attempt to visually portray ""The Lord of the Rings"".  But Peter Jackson has done well - indeed, he has exceeded my expectations considerably.
I will immediately purchase the DVD when it becomes available, and (like last December) will be in line at midnight to see the opening of ""The Two Towers"".",1015804800,34,2552,4.976190476190476
1324859,5,B00003CWT6,"This was and is one of the best movies of our time.  The cinematography is better in this movie than I have ever seen.  I am very positive with reliable sources that this movie is up for best picture among other awards.
Just imagine every one of your child hood fantasies coming true on screen.  This movie is for all ages a like, the young and young at heart.
You will be amazed at the costume designing, lighting and soundtrack throughout this movie.  The acting is superb, and Peter Jackson (director/writer/producer) made sure that every detail of JRR Tolkiens fantasy was brought to life and put onto the big screen, it will thrill you, touch your heart, and maybe even make you cry.
Best of all, all of the series of JRR Tolkiens books have already been filmed, meaning that each series will follow eachother one year at a time. There will not be any two to three year waits for the next one!

The technology has finally arrived to portray the great armies of orcs, cavernous domains of the dwarves, and the hidden woodland realms of the elves.  The actors filled their roles admirably, and the direction was exquisite.  My only objection is that the movie at times deviated signifigantly from the book itself, but not to the point where it irrevocably changed the story; hence my award of 4 instead of 5 stars.

1324861,5,B00003CWT6,"let me just say that I've seen Lord of the rings 13 times, I've read the books 2 times and I'm madly in love with Elijah Wood.
  First of all, Lord of the rings is awesome! You smile when you see the cozy Shire. You cry when Gandalf falls. Your teeth chatter whenever orcs appear.
  The acting is marvelous! Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo. His fear and love seem so real. And, might I add, he makes huge hairy feet beautiful. Ian Mckellan Is profound as Gandalf. He is passionate about his role and acts astonishingly. Sean Astin is great as Samwise Gamgee and Billy Boyd is halarious as Peregrin Took.
  The music is enchanting! I cry whenever I hear ""in dreams"" by Edward Ross. Enya has a wonderful voice and Howard Shore is a great composer.
  Middle-Earth is bewitching. You feel that you can actually travel to the fair valley of Rivendell, the hidden forest of Lothlorien, the fearsome gates of Moria.
  The characters are stunning. The hobbits are so kind and care-worn. The elves graceful. The wizards powerful. I agree that Galadriel should have been a little more kind. Tom Bambodil wasn't such a big loss.
  You have got to see Lord of the rings: Fellowship of the ring. It's absolutely breath-taking. You won't regret it. 13 times isn't enough and yet, even after a hundred times you'll still be craving for more. Peter Jackson has truly outdone himself this time.",1015632000,7,1377,4.598360655737705

Reading the books is a strong recommendation to learn more about the characters in JRRT's novel and the character's left out of the movie line.  JRRT wrote this epic and makes the serious reader believe that the characters, Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas, and Gilmi really exsisted--that's real talent that's not easy to master.  Can't wait for the second and third movie!!!!!!",1015632000,,837,4.866197183098592
1324863,5,B00003CWT6,"I must admit for starters that I had never read Lord Of The Rings or The Hobbit. Having a well versed background and sci-fi one would think that I would have naturally gravitated toward it. Most of my early reading when I was a teen was spent trying to forget the drudgery of the rather ""lackluster"" selections made for me by the New Haven Public schools....but I digress.
Simply put, if I had known Lord Of The Rings was this good I would perhaps be a more advid reader to this day.
Bringing a story of this magnitude was no easy task to say the least. Now having read the original material I can honestly say that this is probably what J.R.R. Tolkien envisioned when he first concieved this epic tale. It was said that back in the 1960's Stanley Kubrick was first presented with the offer to make a film rendition of the Lord Of The Rings but passed it up. Saying that it would never translate into a movie. It took 30 years and the vision of director Peter Jackson to make him eat those words. This is about as good a movie as you are going to see this year. At least until LOTR: The Two Towers is released.
The film tells the tale of Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit from the Shire in the realm of Middle Earth. Frodo is left to him by his uncle Bilbo, among other things, a ring. Little does he know that this small and seemingly ingsifiicant item would hold the fate of an entire world. Now I've heard some people complain that this is not a ""complete movie"" and to their credit they ARE right. This is only the first part of a trilogy. Remember all those commercials that said "" The Trilogy Begins""?
Simply put, this movie will set a new standard for the action adventure genre. Many film critics and historians often point out that George Lucas ""borrowed"" many aspects for his Star Wars trilogy from Lord Of The Rings. Now Peter Jackson brings it back full circle.",1015545600,3,1863,4.340974212034384
1324913,4,B00003CWT6,"Wow!  The special effects were remarkably and seemlessly integrated into the best adaptation (by-far) of The Lord of the Rings.  The top three scenes: the cave troll, Gandalf and the Balrog, and Lady Galadriel of Lothlorien.  Powerful performance by Ian McKellen as Gandalf.  Unfortunately, even after splitting the story into three full-length movies there still isn't enough room to do justice to the actual books.  There is more character development in the books, more identification with the main characters.  For example, when the sorrowful scenes played out in the movie, I remained unmoved.  Maybe it's only me, but there wasn't enough time with the characters to feel any emotion for/with them.  That's my only criticism, however, on the whole I loved the film (I saw it twice).

Peter Jackson did an excellent job on this film. Everything looks as it should, as I imagined. The Shire, the Faire city, Mount Doom, all of it.
Pacing was good, color was great. Music was just right.
Am I gushing? Yes. So what? I want people to know that this film, while intense in places, is no more violent than 2-3 Saturday morning cartoons and much better written.
The 2 death scenes were done tastefully, with a minimum of blood and you felt thier loss...as it should be.
I recently picked up a screening disc of this film and will probably watch it again a few times before the retail one is available. Why? Because I really liked it.",1015459200,19,814,4.469798657718121

I saw the movie 11 times, and would have gone more if it hadn't been removed from the theatres.  Until it came out, Star Wars (the original) had been my all-time favorite.  Well, guess what?  It's been replaced.  To anyone who has not seen it, please do!  I don't think you'll be disappointed.

1324920,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of the Rings movie was faced with an incredible challenge from the very start: Tolkien's book is just so good, how can the movie ever be its equal?  In the end, this challenge was just too great, and fans of the book will find that the movie could never quite meet their expectations.  A three hour movie can never match the grandeur and epic scale of a 500+ page book.  But having said that, as far as efforts go to reproduce Tolkien's world and plot in a movie, it's hard to conceive of an attempt being much more successful than this one.
To be honest, I went to see the movie with meagre expectations.  I feared that gore would triumph over glory in typical Hollywood style, but was pleasantly surprised.  One of the highlights is the world which the movie re-creates.  The New Zealand location is wonderfully convincing, and many viewers will discover that it matches their mental picture of Middle Earth.  The scenery is breath-taking.  The characters - particularly the actors of Gandolf, Bilbo, Frodo, and Aragorn are memorable and just as I imagined them from the book.  And the film-makers have gone to great lengths to reproduce the small details that make Tolkien's Lord of the Rings so beloved: the pipeweed smoke-rings and Gollum's lamp-like eyes are a few of such details that come to mind.  Many times I found myself thinking delightedly: this is exactly the way Tolkien describes it!  Attention to such details shows that the movie is in many respects faithful to the book.
At the same time, it is impossible for even a three hour movie to capture all the intricacies of plot and character that the 500 page book has.  Consequently, the movie is forced to make short cuts and even minor alterations to the plot to accommodate this.  It would hardly be fair to criticize the movie for this - one can hardly expect to have a 24 hour ""full version"" of The Fellowship of the Ring.  The elimination of Tom Bombadil, and the introduction of Merry and Pippin in a manner different from the original is somewhat frustrating, but hardly avoidable.
An important question: should you read the book before or after the movie?  If you read the book just before seeing the movie, you will find yourself becoming unnecessarily frustrated by the minor alterations that the movie-makers were forced to make, rather than enjoying the grandeur of the movie's achievement.  To appreciate both the books and the movie the most, I would suggest reading ""The Hobbit"" before the movie, and then reading ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" just before seeing the second movie in the series. People entirely unfamiliar with Tolkien's books will likely have a difficult time understanding the intricate plot, let alone appreciating the lengths that the movie-makers have gone to reproduce Tolkien's middle earth.  Admittedly, the recounting of the history of the ring at the beginning of the movie is an ingenius device that may help those unfamiliar with the background of the story and characters.  But ultimately, this movie will be best enjoyed by lovers of Tolkien.  It won't diminish their claim that nothing can beat the book, but you can be sure that the Tolkien faithful will be among the first in line when the next movie in the series is released.",1015372800,,3250,4.78175313059034
1324921,5,B00003CWT6,"I never read Tolkien's LOTR books but did see a TV show which explained the religious aspects of the characters/story.  The show helped me understand the LOTR movie.  I walked away with a spiritual renewal.  The movie is rich, deep, and emotional.  I truly felt like I was reading the book and living the adventure with Frodo and the gang.  The bad characters were powerful in getting across the evil they possess.  Elijah Wood was a perfect Frodo.  He acted in a way that made me feel the intense emotional drain his character, Frodo, endured as he carried the ring.  I've never seen a modern film that possessed so much purpose and reflection on man and society.  Truly LOTR was released at the perfect time in which man is questioning himself with God and his fellow man.  Since Sept. 11 I see a spiritual renewal in people.  LOTR reflects an inner look at ourselves through characters that truly reflect man's conflicts with power, greed, etc.  I saw myself in a few of the LOTR fellowship characters--their reactions, behavior, etc.  If one looks within him/herself he/she would see a little of Frodo, Bilbo, Samwise, Gandolf, perhaps even Gollum?  Each LOTR character reacts to the power of the ring differently, just like each person reacts to temptations: power, greed, etc differently.  I can't say enough of this awesome movie.  I can't wait for it to come out on video and see the last 2 installments in the next 2 years.  Watch this movie...and you will walk away with some inner reflection.",1015286400,,1503,4.741312741312742

Okay,the movie had great special effects,obviosly it had a great story,but it was still Terrible...well,maybe I'm Being to harsh,just I personally didn't like some parts of it....So I'll mark the good and the Bad of it....
  GOOD THINGS:
 1. Great scenery...
 2. Speicial Effects....
 3. The Make-up,it was Really realistic........
 4. Actors,Most were awesome......
 5. Story......
  BAD THINGS:
 1. The monsters,I'm 12 and it still freaked me out!
 2. The Battles,why does everything have to be so gruesome?????
 3. Did I metion the Monsters,demons,devillike things,goblins,and everything else????
  Another thing I did not like was the fact that they portrayed this film as a family film,it should definetly be PG-13,But I would've waited 'till I was about 20 to watch this if I knew what really went on in it!

It really draws me into the plot.  However, story telling disappears very quickly in the second half of the movie.  The second half of the movie is filled with cheap special effects that don't do anything to the movie in my opinion.  You see people running around smashing this and that mindlessly.  There is virtually no dialog... no story telling...  The second half is so bad that I actually want to leave the movie theater.  If I have to compare this movie with another movie, I will say that the movie Princess Bride is a much better 5-star original.  I have never read Lord of the Rings.  So, I will go see the rest of the movie when it comes out just to see how it ends.

I had never read the books, but after seeing the movie and being one hundred percent blown away, I immediately bought The Hobbit and Fellowship.  After reading Fellowship, I must say that I became even more delighted with the movie. A fabulous job was done adapting the book to a screenplay. Everything was amazingly done. Gandalf is so powerful and impressive. The scene with him on the bridge of Khazadum is still my favorite.
The cinematography was stunning, the acting supberb. I would gladly have sat down for the other two movies right then and there.  If you are a long time fan of LOTR, go see this movie. If you have never read them, do so and see the movie, in either order. It's a must see and a must own when it is finally released on DVD.

George Lucas might as well retire right now -- his Star Wars work (as good as it sometimes has been) would not be qualified to stand as a footnote to this staggering production!  The depiction of Middle Earth is so convincing that we feel completely immersed in the illusion.  The effects are so consistently seamless that I usually had no idea where the digitalization began and ended!  And the details of the various depictions draw the viewer inexorably into the scenes.  The screenwriting is so finely tuned that we quickly find ourselves caring simultaneously about a great number of characters. Ian McKellan, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchette, and various others are magnificent. This is the most creative production I have ever seen!

A little trivia about the movie:
1) The whole film was shot in a continuous 2 year period in New Zealand.

From the moment you enter the Shire you are taken away to the world Tolkien describes. After seeing the movie I immediately went out to get the books to make sure I would not miss the tiniest detail. Tolkien put a lot of work into his novels by describing every detail and Peter Jackson does a wonderful job of bringing it to life.
Ian Mckellan is the perfect actor for Gandalf there could be no better choice. The Hobbits are all played well Elijah Wood does a wonderful job of Frodo a Hobbit who wants to go on adventures but does not want to leave his beloved home in the shire. Sean Astin as the devoted Sam Gamgee. Although I do not particularly agree with the changes to Pippin and Merry they are well played.
The effects in this movie are indescribable. A perfect mixture. Sometimes it is nearly impossible to tell which is real and which is not. The cinematography is perfectly mixed and you can barely believe how well they showed the hobbits as 1 half the size of humans.
The score for the film is moving to say the least. You feel the happiness felt while you see the shire you feel the change when you see Mordor. The script is wonderful leaving all the important points in and even adding some stuff that is pure fun.

All of the cast members excelled in their roles, most notably Sir Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, and Hugo Weaving. The special effects were outstanding - the Ringwraiths were terrifyingly spooky, and the computer-generated landscapes breath-taking.
I have only two complaints about the film (which, given its considerable length, isn't much:)
1.) The Hobbits' feet. While the Fx team did an amazing job hacking the human actors' legs off at the knees (pretty much,) the large, rubbery, obviously-fake bare feet were just appallingly awful. With everything else done so well, it seems they could have done a better job here.

2.) The Cave Troll's animation - it seemed clunky and out-of-date to me. With the incredible CGI work elsewhere, this scene stuck out horribly.
That's it! For a 178-minute film, two nitpicky criticisms seems pretty darned good to me. The original story the writers were working with was rich and full, and they've done it justice here. I could go on and on about how indescribably beautiful it all was, veritably frothing at the mouth and drooling as I try to convey the depths of my enthusiasm, but really, you should just go and see it for yourself, if you are among the 14 or so people who have yet to fight the lines for a seat.

I was totally absorbed by the superb characterisation.  Most people have commented on Ian McKellan's role and, of course, Elijah Wood - I also felt that excellent choices had been made for Bormir, Legolas, Gimli - in fact all the principal characters.
The movie really brought the book to life for me, with superb imagery.

I was skeptical about this film, remembering the Ralph Bakshi abortion of several years back.  I have rarely been so pleased to be proven wrong.  Even at three hours, there is an unavoidable compression of events; nevertheless, all of the important scenes that I remember from the book are here, and they are presented with the highest degree of artistry.  The cast, the production, every element is right.
I commend New Line for having the courage to give director Peter Jackson the budget and time needed to tell such an epic tale.  It's good to see that they have been rewarded by box office and critical success as well as a slew of Oscar nominations.  It bodes well for the next two films in the series.  When the trilogy is complete, it may well stand as a landmark in cinema.

My own mother who doesn't care for movies much and really doesn't care for fantasy wants to own this movie on DVD when it comes out. That surprised even me. My only complaint was the scene where Galandriel morphs. That was way off base from the books. If you want to see the correct way that should have been done, watch the same scene in the cartoon. The cartoon is enferrior but that one scene is actually better than the way Peter Jackson did it. Other than that, the show was perfect.

When I first saw this movie I exited the cinema with a sense of ..this is a great movie but why?
I saw the movie a second time (a first) and it dawned on me how beautiful it was and I realised why I loved it.
More importantly I realised why I felt vaguely confused when I left the cinema the first time.
It was different.
It was a completely different movie experience from that which we have become accustomed to and more dangerously that we have come to expect.
We have become so used to formularic movies that start with a rumble build over the 1-2 hours, deliver a rousing climax and end happily ever after.
Readers Digest versions of tales and stories that are often long and complicated with the added insult of having their endings changed to fit the demographics.
This is based on an epic novel with none of it's message twisted for political correctness or paced purely for the rush at the end. It is a slow unfolding of a tale about a complex world facing a simple age old truth... that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
It's content is taken seriously, the acting is beautiful and it has a sad soulful earnestness that befits the story.
This is where it's greatness lies.
I went out and bought the trilogy and read the lot over the following weeks which made me appreciate the film even more.
Then my brother who had not seen the movie asked if I wanted to see it again with him.
The fact that I not only agreed but enjoyed it again despite it's length is as far as I'm concerned a milestone in this film lovers life.
This is a beautiful movie. A masterpiece.",1014336000,8,1633,4.3927392739273925

The beginning adventure of Frodo and how he must rely on this fellowship that must battle forces of evil such as Orcs, Goblins. In order to protect a ring that rules all rings from falling into the hands of the evil Sauron.

I hadn't read the books in years, but they were as present in my mind as if it had been yesterday.  I can remember thinking to myself when I read the trilogy the first time, what a great movie the books would make.  How right I was.  This movie was historic, one of those movies that if you didn't go to the theater to see it, you were missing out.  Peter Jackson is truly visionary, streamlining the Tolkien classic and yet not sacrificing the things that made it great in the first place.  It was a perfect portrayal of what Tolkien undoubtedly envisioned in his mind when he wrote the books all those years ago.  I was so enthralled by the movie that I saw it in theaters twice, as filled with suspense both times as I've ever been.  I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, to the Tolkien lover or the Tolkien ignorant.  It definitely didn't disappoint and the sequels won't either, I am sure, particularly since all 3 were filmed at the same time.  I have yet to find anyone who didn't like this movie and again I heartily recommend it to everyone who likes movies.

I am so glad that these wonderful books were put into movie form or I might have never read them. They are a great experience for all readers.

There were a few minor changes to the book but these only served to translate the story to film more effectively. Ian McKellen is an outstanding Gandalf, as are Viggo Mortenson (Aragon), Sean Bean (Boromir), Liv Tyler (Arwen), Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee) and Elijah Wood who is an excellent Frodo. He conveys the weight of the burden he is bearing simply through his facial expressions.

Ian McKellan as Gandalf steals the show. He is wise, benevolent, courageous. He fills the screen with a poweful and memorable performance. Liv Tyler as Arwen, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Elijah Wood as Frodo, Cate Blanchette as Lady Galadriel and, a favorite of mine, Ian Holm as Bilbo all turn out superb performances.

They never read the book.

The only thing that happens in the 2nd book is Aragorn and friends wander around aimlessly. This movie just wasn't as good as it could have been. My first peev is the action scenes: was Peter JAckson even on set? It's like they gave a hobo a camera and had him run around with it. The effects were brilliant, but we didn't get to see them clearly for more than half a second. Watching a simple action scene should not give you a headache. They did in this. Elijah Wood's girlish acting just [made me mad], the only one who seemed to know what he was doing was Ian McKellan, who died half way through. don't worry, he comes back in #2. Go see this at your own risk",1014249600,2,759,4.135135135135135
1325204,5,B00003CWT6,"First of all, see this on the big screen!!  I know the DVD will be great, but no matter how big your HDTV, it will not compare to the theatre - no TV is the size of the side of one's house!!
This movie is extraordinarily well done, and can be appreciated by both non-readers and readers of the Tolkien books, though I think the latter will especially enjoy it.
This movie pays great attention to the details from the book.  For instance, when the Fellowship is attempting to cross over the mountain Caradhras, Legolas can be seen walking on top of the snow rather than sinking in as everyone else does, for elves are light of foot and do not sink in the snow.  Also, there are events which are included in the movie though they aren't able to spend the time to really show them - such as when the Fellowship is leaving Lothlorien, and Galadriel gives to them all gifts (they only showed her giving the gift to Frodo in the movie) - in the book, they were all given new cloaks to wear that were clasped at the neck with a pin shaped like a green leaf veined with silver. Though the movie didn't show them being given to the Fellowship, suddenly from that point on in the movie, all the Company are wearing new matching cloaks with pins exactly as described in the book!  I loved the inclusion of details like that.
As far as exclusions go, good choices were made here as well. Tom Bombadil would have been fun, but if anyone is expendable I guess it would be him, since he really doesn't play a future role.  Also, it may have confused unread viewers if the movie showed that the ring had no effect on him - they may not understand why he doesn't just take the ring to Mordor then, instead of Frodo, and then the movie would have to explain that too, etc.
I also thought the movie did a great job with casting - everyone pretty much looked as Tolkien inspired me to imagine them, with the hobbits being even better than my imagination!  And that was vital, since everything revolves around Frodo and he's in nearly every scene, at least in this first movie - if he hadn't been cast well, it might have ruined the whole movie for me.  As it is, he was beyond even my highest hopes and greatest expectations!  His face was just so sweet and sincere and he seemed so genuine in his goodness - I could believe that he could resist the evil of the ring and have a chance of fulfilling the quest.  Pippin was really funny - actually, all of the hobbits were outstanding.
If I have any complaint, it is that Lothlorien should not have been so dark - the book describes it as much sunnier and happier, and Galadriel kinder in her tone of voice and gentler in her treatment of Frodo.  She seemed to me to be pretty stern until the farewell scene, and I didn't feel that when I read the book.  But that's a minor complaint - overall, this movie delivers all!  Don't miss it!",1014163200,10,2863,4.291280148423006

1325206,5,B00003CWT6,"Never have I been so awestruck in all my days of theatre experience.  I went into the theatre with high expectations, which were not only met, but exceeded.  For the full three hours of the movie, I sat in still astonishment.  The vigorous movie created a kind of visual and audible elation that I rarely experience.  The entire audience, including myself, were hushed with amazement by the captivating epic.  Much acclaim must go to Peter Jackson for his meticulous and arduous efforts taken to bring ""the greatest story ever told"" to life on the big screen.
  With the combination of beautiful terrain settings, scrupulously designed movie sets, and computer generated graphics, Jackson's team has formulated a visual dream world;  a dream world full of visual ecstasy.  The costumes in the movie are incredibly ingenious and dynamic, giving even more life to the cast of actors and extras.  For those of you who are musically inclined, the movie offers a mystical, alluring, and haunting score composed by Howard Shore; which also includes two songs by the elegant voice of Enya.
  To me, Peter Jackson's Trilogy is setting the standards to which all fantasy movies from today until tomorrow will be made.
The movie is enough to captivate any human's creative mind, and in future speculation, gives birth to a new respect of the next generation of filmmaking and filmmakers.",1014163200,,1377,4.991228070175438

What an emotional, beautiful, gripping, and feel good movie. When good overcomes evil it feels SO rewarding in this movie.  In many ways this movie is very spiritual in nature. Your classic good vs evil. LOTR has really left its mark on me.  I haven't been taken by a movie like this not since Star Wars A New Hope.  The music is so beautiful, the scenery is breathtaking, and no matter who you are you will find someone in the movie that you can relate with.  The cinematagraphy could not have been done any better. Some of the shots in the movie are just downright awesome. My fav shot is when the Fellowship are in the underground caverns and they are running in the huge open cavern away from the shadow demon. The sweeping long shot was SO awesome.
I can honestly say that LOTR is the best movie I have ever seen.  A movie that has captured my heart and soul. Bravo!!!",1014076800,3,1040,4.232323232323233
1325209,5,B00003CWT6,"I think...Well, it doesn't matter what I think. I could never say for sure whether Tolkien would like this movie or not. I've read alot about the man, though and I can't help thinking, that he would have at least been interested to see this human depiction of his novels. Though yes, things are different in the movie at some places then they were in the book, there is no need to get upset over it. Afterall, think of it this way; it could have been worse. And no, they don't sing the songs from the book (I personally, am glad. I would have been very sorry to see those actors try to sing at all and the poor soul who got the job of writing music to the rhymes, well I'd pity him). I do think, however, that at least all of the characters carried with them some of the essence and appeal that they have in the books. My older sister says that if she could ever re-do the movie, she would use all the same actors. I think that says something for their performance right there. Even though some people might not like the people chosen to play the characters (e.g. Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler), they do have to admit that considering the task they were undertaking, no one else could have done it. I mean, who would you have of all our modern Hollywood actors play Arwen; Julia Roberts? I hope not. As for Peter Jackson's take on LOTR, I am glad that he did change a few things, even if they were important details. Exactness is not always the best when attempting to convert a novel to a movie. Also, Peter Jackson is not J.R.R. Tolkien. I should hope that he wouldn't pretend to be and go about making the movies as if he were someone he wasn't. The movies are one mans impressions of an epic story. It is wonderful that they are significant enough to share with the whole world. If you feel you could do better, I say to you: THEN DO IT! HA! I'd like to see you try.",1014076800,4,1863,4.206703910614525
1325210,5,B00003CWT6,"Like many good action adventure stories, the hero is an unsuspecting one.  He finds himself with a monumental and very dangerous task to fulfill.  Here the hobbit, Frodo (played by Elijah Woods) has the job of destroying a seemingly innocent-looking ring that is responsible for evil and the destruction to all mankind and other living beings. Along Frodo's journey, he meets all kind of foes and a fellowship of interested parties form to protect and help him complete his mission.
All the characters are convincing and the film is filled with a lot of suspense.  It opens with a gripping scene of battle against Lord Sauron, who wants to control that world, and his army.  The movie is visually pleasing with beautiful and dark scenery - from the hobbits' village (The Shire) to the other places that Frodo crosses during his quest.
At the end of the movie, the viewer is left wanting to immediately see the second part and then the third part of the trilogy.  Since the continuing film versions of the trilogy are still in the making, one will have to do with watching this first part again.
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings will inspire you to read the book if you haven't done so before or re-read it if you already have.

I was totally engaged by this film even though I thought the depiction of the Lord of the Rings story was very average. It was more sword and sorcery than Tolkien. I thought the performances by the primary actors were very good (especially Wood, McKellen and Bloom). However, I wish the hobbit protagonists would have done a little more fighting on their own. It seems like they're riding Mortennsen's coat tails. I guess that means I'll probably enjoy the Two Towers a little more since the fellowship is now scattered and The Two Towers promises bigger and better battle sequences. All in all the Fellowship of the Ring, while definitely not a film classic(You hear me all you idiots who made this the number one film of all time on IMDB.), is worth seeing because of Jackson's directing talent, Elijah Wood's brilliant acting(best actor under 30 today bar none), and splendid effects.

This, by far, was not the case! This has to be one of the most exciting movies ever filmed. Even knowing the plot (which the movie followed almost religiously) you're still on the edge of your seat. To me the highlights was of course the special effects and the musical score, which was just tremendous. The cast was outstanding, without a weak spot. My 14 year old daughter, who had never read the books, was able to follow the plot well and enjoyed the action, even though this isn't her type of flick.
This is a movie for anyone who enjoys exciting and intense movies, even if you're not a fantasy fan. Just be forewarned: I would not take a child under 10 to this. This is not Harry Potter! The evil creatures are very scarry to young children, as witnessed by many parents having to escort their children out at certain times.

Don't miss this one in theaters because watching it at home won't give you nearly the same effect. Here's hoping it takes all 13 awards it this year's oscars!!!",1013817600,,598,4.598130841121495

1325297,5,B00003CWT6,"Finally over 40 years after The Lord of the Rings was first published this literary classic (or at least the first part of it) is given justice on the big screen. This is indeed a movie classic that everyone should go and see. The plot is consistent and detailed, leaving no important, leaving no blank spots and never seems rushed. (Which is where its counterpart Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone failed) To add to this the acting was phenomenal. Ian Mackellan as Gandalf and Sean Bean as Borrimir were the top of a magnificent acting crop, who each performed their roles to near perfection. And I would think Peter Jackson should win a trophy or two for his stunning directing skills, skills that are evident throughout the movie. Then there is an emotionally stirring soundtrack that sets the perfect mood for every mood. As for the special effects? Well eye popping is the understatement of the year.
There really isn't anything that I've said that hasn't been said already. Hundreds of people have given positive reviews for this movie, and they're all right, whatever they say. This is a brilliant movie, and certainly one of the best in years. If you are not blown away by this movie there is something definetely wrong with you.
So lets make some numbers.
Plot: 5 stars (Its Lord of the Rings so you know its brilliant.)
Plot Handling: 5 stars (Cheers to Peter Jackson for doing his job perfect to every detail.)
Acting: 5 stars (Frodo, Gandalf, and Borrimir lead a pack of actors who performed at their peak.
Special Effects: 5 stars(An excellent combination of camera work, atmosphere, and CGI get the job done.)
Soundtrack: 5 stars A wonderfully done piece of work with a heart warming, tear-forcing Enya track.
Overall: A perfect 5. Not only a classic of 2001 but a classic for all time. And not just in literature anymore. See it TODAY!",1013731200,3,1854,4.7253086419753085
1325298,5,B00003CWT6,Having read the books I didn't think anyone could take me to Middle Earth. Boy was I wrong. I have seen the movie 8 times and each time I am amazed by the way Mr. Jackson has woven the story together. The musical score is fantastic and the contrasts between the scenes is great like when the camera shows the fellowship going down the peaceful river and then switches to the Orcs running along the shore. I agree with other reviews that this isn't a movie for young kids. The bad guys are really bad and will cause nightmares!!! The only downside to the movie is that I have to wait until next December to see the next part.,1013644800,,624,4.2521008403361344

1325300,5,B00003CWT6,"I have noticed that many movies that are based off of books don't do a very good job of it, but Fellowship of the Ring was awesome!  The special effects were great and the movie didn't stray much from the book's story line.  It was an excellent movie.",1013644800,,251,4.208333333333333
1325301,4,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson's film version of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an amazing achievement.  It is an adaptation of a novel that takes place within an imaginary world with an astonishing level of geographical, historical and linguistic detail.  Yet the movie manages to be understandable to viewers who have never read the book without either boring them with long passages of exposition or seeming over-simplified.  The clarity of the film's script and direction achieve this result and fully justify the film's Oscar nominations.
The film's visuals are amazing; scenes like those where the camera flies through the workshops and caverns of the nefarious wizard Saruman's stronghold seem like something out of an Omnimax movie.  Unlike the landscapes seen on the big screens at science museums, however, the places Jackson's camera visits had to be designed and created by the filmmakers using models and computer graphics or, at least, chosen from the multitude of gorgeous vistas in New Zealand in such a way that they would match Tolkien's descriptions in the book.  The details incorporated into the film from the book, both in the topography of Middle-earth and in the costumes, sets and props, are amazing to behold for Tolkien fans.  For example, when the characters are walking along beside the Misty Mountains, one can see, at the far right of the screen beyond the end of the Misty Mountains, the White Mountains between Rohan and Gondor -- exactly as one would expect from the geography established in the book.
The film is by no means flawless.  Having read much of the commentary on the Internet over the last few years bemoaning the film's proposed changes to Tolkien's story, I had thought that the Tolkien fans who reacted in this way were being overly fanatical and not understanding the necessity of making some changes in any adaptation of a book into another medium.  When I saw the film I was surprised how much of a purist for Tolkien's story I found myself to be at heart.  I was especially irritated by the treatment of the sequence wherein the Elf-maiden Arwen (Liv Tyler) helps Frodo (Elijah Wood) escape from the evil Black Riders -- a function performed in the book by a male Elf named Glorfindel who is omitted from the movie.  I se nothing wrong with Arwen replacing Glorfindel in this scene; I don't understand why it was necessary to restructure the sequence so extensively, making it almost unrecognizable as derived from the equivalent sequence in Tolkien's book.  (I do think, however, that Tyler delivered the controversial line ""If you want him, come and claim him"" very well.)
I also feel that some of the acting in the movie does not deserve the praise which has been heaped upon it.  Elijah Wood's performance as Frodo does not impress me much at all.  One must remember, though, that in practically every scene he had to deal with the complex cinematic tricks required to allow him, a full-sized actor, to play a diminutive Hobbit; therefore, the competence of his performance shows that he has a great deal of talent.  On the other hand, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Sean Bean as Boromir, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel and, especially, Ian Holm as Bilbo and Orlando Bloom as Legolas are all excellent.  Opinions may vary on Ian McKellen's performance as Gandalf, for which he has garnered the film's only Oscar nomination for acting; he underplayed the role a bit for my tastes, but that's his prerogative as a British actor and will be the very glory of his performance for many.
The brilliance of Jackson's direction is best demonstrated by one remarkable moment early in the film:  the moment when Frodo picks up the Ring for the first time.  This is a crucial, iconic event -- the Ringbearer's first contact with the Ring that will necessitate his quest -- and by underplaying it, Jackson makes it far more powerful than any amount of emphasis could have done.  For that scene, and for the fact that he directed two equally complex movies at the same time as this one, Peter Jackson definitely deserves the Oscar for Best Director.",1013644800,3,4112,4.875179340028694
1325302,5,B00003CWT6,"I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!  I have already seen it 3 times and I plan on seeing it again!
I though the way Peter Jackson pulled this off was amazing!  I can't think of any way I would chang it.  Yes people will tell you that it was long but it had to be!  If you know anything about the story you would know that you just couldn't do it any other way.  I found it refreshingly long!  A comment on the ending, the first time I saw it I didn't want it to stop there.  I could have sat through another 2 hours!  But the secound and third time I saw it, it was a very logical place to close.  I thought all of the actors did fantasticin portraying the characters.  Expecially Elijah Wood.  I could tell you to go to it just for the CG alone!  I just found myself totally, captivatingly lost in the movie.  It is very odvious how much time and dedication the makers put into this.  I can't wait for the second and third one!  Well I could go on for hours but then I would miss the next showing!",1013558400,,1009,4.0
1325343,5,B00003CWT6,"Yeah, this movie is the best I've seen in a long time. Harry Potter was good, but LOTR rocked! For someone who hadn't read the books before seeing the movie (where have I been living?!) I thought it ruled. Seen it twice and gonna see it again this weekend. First off, Peter Jackson is brilliant. Mad props to him. No one could have pulled this project off more perfectly. Also, Elijah Wood was fantastic (not just in looks but in acting as well!) Perfect as Frodo. The rest of the cast rocked to.  It was good to see John Rhys- Davies  in another monster movie (Indiana Jones rocked too). Mckellen, Astin, Morteson, Lee, Tyler, Blanchett, everyone was great. A visually stunning film, its gonna kill at the Oscars. 13 nominations- its just incredible. It is everything that anyone could hope for in a movie. It's groundbreaking. Not as groundbreaking as Star Wars was when it first was released, but its high up there. It was good to see Christopher Lee as Saruman, someone who is also in Star Wars E2- bridging the divide. Anywho, I shouldn't give this film a 5 star rating- it truly deserves a perfect 10- perfectly executed, great acting, amazing effects, beautiful to watch- bottom line- SEE IT!  When its released on VHS and DVD go get it! But after myself of course- I'll be the first in line to buy it. LOTR rocks!!!!!!!",1013558400,,1327,4.567226890756302

Transport yourself into Middle-Earth, a land of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and humans (just to touch the surface of the multiple layers of characters in this movie). This is THE CLASSIC QUEST of the century.
Frodo, the hero of this classic tale, becomes the unwitting owner of the One Ring, forged by Sauron, the Dark Lord, to rule all the Rings of Power.  You journey with Frodo and his compadres as they attempt to destroy the ring in the Cracks of Doom.
This story has it all - drama, comedy, battle.  J.R.R. Tolkien must be cheering from the heavens as his story has become an on-screen masterpiece!",1013558400,2,637,4.834862385321101
1325345,5,B00003CWT6,"What can I say?  Its the Lord of the Rings.  I've been waiting for this movie since I was ten and it really lived up to my expectations.  When the started the movie and Gandalf entered Hobbiton I had a grin like a six year old in Disney World. If you haven't seen it, go, I beg of you, you don't know what you are missing.

1325346,1,B00003CWT6,"I went in expecting it not to be as good as the book. Book's are tricky things to interpret on to film so I figured that if it was a reasonably good movie I would declare it to be a success. It was not a reasonably good movie. I personally like special effects, however I like them to be subservient to the plot. In this movie the plot was subservient the the effects. They inserted a effect were ever they could. One of course wonders why, for instance, Galadriel morph's into something resembling Bruin Hilda while having to Frodo about the Ring. Or why they could not really on Ian Holm to come up with a adequate look of desire and a to create a CGI one for him instead. The only response the CGI expression elicited from me was one of laughter. As for suspense I feel that the director should have followed the book on two accounts.: 1. Never show the dark lord only talk about him. 2. Don't show what's happening to Gandalf when he disappears to talk to Sauraman. Failing to do either of the above two, the director was forced to create suspense by having Elijah Wood look like a frighted rabbit for three strait hours. The one good thing I can say about this film is it is better then the animated version.",1013472000,4,1213,4.301310043668122
1325347,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson accomplished the impossible with the creation of the film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.  It was a good adaptation and this film has the best casting I have EVER SEEN.
This movie is great because of the amazing cast especially:
VIGGO MORTENSEN as ARAGORN
LIV TYLER as ARWEN
And
SEAN ASTIN as SAM
Everyone notices Elijah Wood but the film depended on the other actors being just as good, and in most cases they were better.  They are not getting the attention they deserve.
This film did have some flaws. I am saying this hoping people who made he movie will read it and think about what i am saying.
1. Too much time spent on Frodo and not enough development on supporting players. Hopefully on the DVD
2. Not enough of the first book in the film especially, Rivendell and Lorthlorin
3. Frodo being a leader. When he is a hobbit who does not know the outside world. Gandalf and Aragorn are the leaders.
The acting was the best part of the movie, every actor could say so much with just a look.  The scene with Arwen and Aragorn (the best characters in the film and book!) is a perfect example.
I loved that Arwen had more screne time and one of the most beautiful romances ever, Aragorn and Arwen, was shown on the screne.
The direction was breattaking. They got the only man for the job.
This adaptation is good but the fight scenes were getting too much and there needed to be more time spent on the characters
That is the soul of the book.  That these characters are fighting evil and the only things that make it worth while are the people and places they love so dearly.  That is why Tolkein took the time to show them.
LOTR is an amazing film and I hope more people will find the book.
If you think the film is astounding the books are 100 times more so. Lord of the Rings was the best kept secret in literature and now I hope more people will experience it.",1013472000,,1898,4.30532212885154
1325348,5,B00003CWT6,"I really don't think LOTR could be called the greatest movie of all time, but certainly the greatest fantasy movie. Is it better than Star Wars? I don't know, it's hard to compare a space opera to a pure fantasy. I do know that Lucas was ""heavily influenced"" by LOTR. I won't say he stole from it, but just look at the similarities..
I am a fan of the trilogy. I read it first in the 8th grade, then in my twenties, then again last year because I knew Peter Jackson was making it into a series of films. I had forgotten a lot, (I'm 40 now) and reading it this last time was the most enjoyable of all. LOTR is truly an epic, grand tale. I know a lot of people find the books boring in parts. Yes, Tolkien could spend ten pages just describing a forest, but it really makes you feel like you are there. People must have the attention span of gnats nowadays.
LOTR-THE FILM is definitely not boring. It is an action film. If you want the full backstory and character development, read the book, it has plenty. I actually like the slow parts in the book, they break up the chase\battle scenes. I've heard people complain that the movie is just chase\battle\pause, over and over. This is a story about a perilous quest, what do you expect? And it is a LONG quest, Frodo has a lot further to go at the end of this film. If you haven't read the books, believe me, it just gets better! The film has quite a few scary images, but LOTR is not a children's book, it's a serious story about the corruption of power, filled with horror, war and despair but with an ultimately uplifting ending.
I loved everything about the movie, with the exception of the giant crumbling staircase sequence in Moria. That wasn't in the book and just seemed like something out of an Indiana Jones flick. Other than that, Jackson's vision of Middle Earth was pretty much exactly like what I pictured in my mind. And I didn't miss Tom Bombadil a bit. I've seen it twice now and enjoyed it just as much on the repeat viewing. Acting, special effects, costume design, cinematography, and especially sound are all top notch. Jackson and crew truly did Tolkien's work justice, and accomplished what many thought to be an impossible task. I'll be buying the DVD for sure.
I can't wait for ""The Two Towers"". It'll be interesting to see how they bring the Ents to life.",1013472000,3,2329,4.393518518518518
1325349,5,B00003CWT6,"As I sat in the movie theatre, crammed in from both sides by japanese tourists, american kids, and children and adults of all shapes and sizes, i looked around and marveled at the number of people inside the cinema. As the lights darkened, and the film began, the clear, mystical voice of Lady Galadriel filled my head. The magic had started, and it wasn't going to end.
I had not read the book before witnessing this movie, but I can safely say that the movie will not only appeal to those who have read the book. Despite being fast-paced, complex and mystical in its own way, people who are not die-hard Tolkein fans will still love this movie. Nor is it a brainless action movie with fight after fight. Moments of sentimentality and tenderness, of power and greatness, and of the power of temptation override this movie, making it an emotional as well as a physical rollercoaster. In particular, Viggo Mortensen, a relatively unknown talent, puts in a stunning and moving performance as the wise, brave and noble human Aragorn, supported by almost equally fine performances from Ian Mckellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as the ever-innocent Frodo. Special effects and excellently thought-out moments of suspense and tension pepper this movie and no doubt contribute to the 13 Oscar Nominations this film recently received.
Having seen this film, it now steals my number one film spot from Moulin Rouge (another stunning movie). Movies like Harry Potter, which I thought good when seeing it, simply pale in comparison to this epic, moving, and breathtaking journey. I went to Middle Earth and back in two hours 58 minutes.
Just for people who don't like long movies; this movie does not seem long at all. When compared with three-hour movies like Pearl Harbour, Titanic and Meet Joe Black, which I swore I would die before being made to sit through again, (even though, as I am at the emotional age of 14, Brad Pitt appealed to me ;) ) it is a positively enlightening experience and most people will notice things the second time round which are very interesting yet peripheral details. It just shows the thought which went into the movie.

This first chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", followed the book excellently, with plenty of action and astounding special effects! As for the acting, I have to give a lot of credit to Ian McKellen portraying the wizard Gandalf. One of the absolute best McKellen performances that I have seen since ""X-Men""! The other actors, including Elijah Wood (Frodo), Liv Tyler (Arwen), Viggo Mortensen (Stryder), Sean Astin (Sam), and Ian Holm (Bilbo) gave great performances alongside Ian McKellen. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" takes place after the story of Bilbo Baggins in ""The Hobbit"". This time, it concerns Frodo Baggins (Wood), a hobbit that unexpectedly gets a mysterious ring that overpowers all others, etc. But this ring is no ordinary ring...this ring can control everything in the world! Frodo's longtime friend and mentor Gandalf (McKellen) knows all about this ring and tells Frodo that it must be destroyed from where it was made from. And during the film, Frodo volunteers to destroy the ring, and a fellowship of nine, including Gandalf and a ranger named Stryder (Mortensen) is formed in order to destroy the cursed ring. In conclusion, this first chapter has it all! Great storytelling and a top-notch cast led by Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood! I cannot wait for ""The Two Towers"" (due in Christmas, 2002) and ""The Return of the King"" (due in Christmas, 2003)! This is definitely a DVD must-have for any ""Lord of the Rings"" fan!",1013472000,,1623,4.779359430604982

It starts out from the middle of the book, considering all of the back-stories to coincide with it.  The characters were portrayed very accurately, and all the ingenious speech is included.  Of course, the movie has scenes that were and were not in the book, as well as some of them deleted from it also.
The computer graphics used were tremendous and most awesome.  Of many people, it left me in awe, which is a little unusual for a big budget film.
The ending was awesome, and anyone who had not even heard of the trilogy could tell that there was going to be more to it than just ""Fellowship of the Ring"".",1013385600,,727,4.2700729927007295

I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it however.  It follows the books extremely well considering that they only had 3 hours to show it in.  I went to see the movie 5 times and still want to see it again.  The costume design was especially amazing.  The detail and work that went into these movies really shows when you see it.  The only thing I would suggest is don't go in expecting to see a great conclusion.  Remember that this movie ends at about the same place as the book and is not meant to be a conclusion to the story.  The movie ends rather abruptly as well.  Another suggestion is if you have not read the books before it might not seem quite as good as if you had read them.  The movies leave quite a lot unsaid (since there is only so much they could put into 3 hours) and having read the books makes a big difference.  Overall, I would say that I have not seen such a good movie in many years.  It may be the best movie I have ever seen.",1013299200,2,1122,4.045454545454546

I will be the first to admit that my first viewing of the movie was met with the expected jaw-dropping ""woooow!!"" and about a week of post-LOTR raving.  Subsequent viewings have tempered that first impression with just a touch of criticism.
Yes, the plot is gripping and as faithful to the book as is possible given the constraints of cinema.  Yes, the characters are brilliantly, sometimes dazzlingly well acted.  The action, once it begins, is intense and relentless and is backed up by some masterful effects.  The shining forces of good and the dark hordes of evil are perfectly portrayed and the one ring is as grim and threatening as it should be.  BUT!  amidst all this, it is not without flaw.  The early scenes while visually very attractive are overly long and I found myself wishing that it would just get on with it.  I also got the impression that there was quite alot of footage removed from said early scenes as they sometimes seemed slightly disjointed.  Small things I know in what is overall a triumph in fantasy film but they do make a difference.  Perhaps the DVD version with the much talked about deleted scenes will remedy these minor complaints.

Because of this, I don't think I'll ever be able to totally detach from my love for his works and judge ""LOTR:FOTR"" solely ""as a movie"".  I also think it's far too early for anyone to judge this in terms of ""greatest movies ever"".  The fact is it is only with time that the true stature of a movie reveals itself.
Having said all that, I have nothing but praise for Peter Jackson and everyone involved in making this movie.  It was visually the most stunning movie I've ever seen, and was packed with exciting, brilliantly staged scenes.  It strikes me that the film succeeds spectactularily given the MASSIVE problems inherent in trying to bring Tolkiens epic vision to the screen and at the same time make a good movie. Perhaps the biggest single problem facing Peter Jackson et al was providing a satisying dramatic experience using only 1/3 of a story (imagine how satisfying ""The Shawshank Redemption"" would have been if it stopped 1/3 of the way through).  My feeling is that many of the supposed weaknesses in this film will over the next two movies emerge as necessary elements in the construction of the whole.  We'll have to wait and see of course, for final judgement should at least wait until we have all 3 pieces of the puzzle in place.  I really don't think we could have hoped for a more promising start though - it may just be that cinematic greatness is unfolding.",1013212800,,1473,4.595419847328245

 he is a fantasic person in acting ability and looks.
 He has the agillity of a cat and the accuracy of a homing missile. i think he is FANTASTIC and should be commended on his role.

1325419,5,B00003CWT6,"Alright, I've heard both the negative AND positive review, but I still think this is the best movie ever made. I'm a huge Tolkien fan, and have read the books more times than I could count, so when I first heard the movie was going to be released, I got tremednously excited. 2002 had THREE movies I HAD to see (Unbreakable, Hannibal, and Lord of the Rings). The prior two were a bit of a dissappointment, but Lord of the Rings saved the year.
Two weeks prior to it's inital release, I pre-ordered tickets, and seriously grew more and more excited as the days went by. Thank god it was not for nothing. The movie was far better than I ever dared to expect (Even though it didn't stick to the book as well as I'd hoped), and the soundtrack was truly amazing. The choir-part in Moria (when the company is being chased) was magnificent!
The special effects are gorgeous as well, and the actors were each acting as if they were born for the parts. Two of them excelled actually: Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and Legolas (Orlando Bloom. Expect to see more of this guy. He was (in my opinion) the best one in the whole movie). Liv Tyler, when speaking Elvish is absolutely incredibly sexy :)
Four things that bugged me about the movie though:
- Galadriel was portrayed a little sinister; In the book, she's the embodiment of good. The movie made her look more or less evil, if you ask me
- No Tom Bombadil; My favourite character in the book (And from what I heard, Tolkien's favourite character) didn't make it to the big screen
- Narsil didn't get reforged; A key issue in the book. Maybe in part 2?
- We have to wait a fricking year for the next movie :)
I've seen the movie 5 times so far, and I can only hope that next December, (If the worldwide release-day is the same again) the cinemas will do as they did with this one; Start at mindnight exactly, but then WITH The Fellowship shown RIGHT before the Two Towers.
Looking forward to the DVD (I heard there'll be an Elvish 'speech'-version. EVERYTHING IN EVLISH!), and a trip to New Zealand to actually SEE the wonderfull (and often jaw-dropping) scenery :)

1325420,4,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings is a good movie, even great in parts.  But the praise has gotten way out of hand.  It isn't perfect, I don't think a faithful book adaptation ever really is.  It is extremely well-made, it feels epic which is huge, and something most larger-than-life movies fail to convey, Gladiator being one of them.  My criticisms begin with the relentlessly annoying Hobbits except for Elijah Wood, they are the Jar Jar Binks of this movie, they are so relentlessly stupid, I just wanted to smack them.  The Hobbits in the book were more interesting and consequently I felt for them more.  Elijah Wood is the exception, he comes across as a highly emotional hobbit who is intelligent and he is the only hobbit I rooted for.  The other criticism is the beginning, it is tedious and tries to be funny and fails, miserably at times.  I just wanted to get to the good parts.  Now I will start with the gushing.  The battle scenes are intense and extremely cool and involving.  All the characters mean something, and you don't want to lose one so seeing them live is in your interest.  Also, since the characters have well defined characteristics and motivations they inherently become interesting and the quest they are involved in becomes interesting as a result.  The biggest thing is that the movie seems epic, it seems like these people are on a world-changing quest, and everything is huge, I especially the statues of the Gods by the lake, that was just ridiculously cool.  The last thing about Peter Jackson's direction of this movie is that he makes the ring become evil, it never moves or speaks or does anything, but it has a presence on screen.  That is quite an accomplishment, at least I think so.  I don't think Lord of the Rings is a bad movie, but it is no Star Wars.  It's well made, well-acted, and entertaining except for the beginning.  But let's get realistic here, some critics are calling it the movie of the year, that's a little ridiculous.",1013040000,,1967,4.619596541786744

Not only that but it'll probably frighten and scare most children that are under 13. The plot, costumes, special effects are excellent. Its obvious that its well made, and well acted. Its definately worth seeing and worth spending money for.",1013040000,3,519,4.909090909090909

1325424,5,B00003CWT6,"J.R.R. Tolkien's book, ""The Lord of the Rings,"" has been voted in several worldwide polls as the ""Book of the 20th Century."" Peter Jackson and most of the people who worked with him on this project, were huge fans of Tolkien's works. As true fans, they all went to incredible lengths to stay as true as possible to the books, in making this film adaptation. That, and sparing no expense for the talent necessary to bring the chracters and landscapes alive, has resulted in a movie that is incredibly rich in detail, more so than can be perceived in a single viewing.
My hat is off to Peter Jackson and Co.! They have done what no others have been able to do: bring to life and realism the fantastic realm of Middle earth.",1012953600,,721,4.428571428571429

1325465,5,B00003CWT6,"For me, LOTR was a foggy and distant 7th grade memory. I had a general recollection of the book and having enjoyed it but was dim on specifics. A good friend of mine (Alfredo, who loved this book so much he was nicknamed Alfrodo in school) got tickets to see it opening day--so I went though I couldn't imagine tranfering this tale to film successfully.
Wow! What a great job Peter Jackson, cast, and crew did. The movie is incredibly enjoyable and brought a feeling of truth to the existence of the Middle Kingdom. You feel the fellowship between the different groups of inhabitants, as well as the evil and goodness within the individual characters. The special effects are very good for the most part and convincing enough to give me a vertigo on several occassions. Ian McKellen is very good as Gandalf,Ian Holm spot-on as Bilbo Baggins and Elijah Wood portrays Frodo with an absolute sincerity that is charming. The Warriors are also incredibly well cast, they are all very different, very complex, very believable and with the exception of the dwarf warrior (John Rhys Davies--Sorry, John your a hottie but not in that make-up) very attractive. I was also very impressed with how cleverly they shot the scenes to so those portraying the hobbits seemed so short in relation to everyone and everything else. The sets are also excellent.
It's always sign of a good movie when you don't want it to end (which I didn't). Also, we didn't realize the movie was three hours long until afterwards when I checked my watch to see what train I could catch to get home. I highly recommend this film. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it immensely.
I'm now rereading the Lord of the Rings (the film really captures the book) and look forward to the second installment of the film trilogy coming out later this year.",1012953600,3,1809,4.6918238993710695

Have seen the cartoons but they're not so good. Anyway, I went to the Premiere here in Mexico, I have seen it like 4 times and I still find the movie awesome. Cna't wait to buy the DVD. I won a contestfa special package about the movie, I have some crystal cups and dolls, I'm emotioned with all this stuff. I want the DVD now, the movie in it's 180 (aprox) minutes, is totally the first book, is the best adaption for a book in the screen, thanks to all of you who made it posiible!",1012867200,,661,4.131782945736434
1325467,3,B00003CWT6,"First off, let me state that I have never actually read the books. HOWEVER, I believe all you Tolkein-heads who say the movie was close to the books.
I guess for fans of the book, this was a good thing. For the rest of us, however, three and a half hours of fantasy is on the long side. By the third hour, I wanted to yell ""Haven't you guys heard of FedEx?!""
That being said, I liked the rest of the movie. The acting, visual effects, music, and location choices were all top notch. For the first part of the movie, the story moved along at a good pace. When it hit hour two and a half, though, things began to bog down. Spending forty five minutes in one spot is something that most movies try to aviod.
I would have rated this movie higher if the following had been done:
1) Chop it down to 2.5 hours, or at least put a lull in the action half way through so I can go buy more food without missing anything
2) The ending was a real bummer. The director could have done a much better job of wrapping things up and leaving you wanting to go see the second and third movies.",1012867200,,1073,4.066037735849057

1325469,5,B00003CWT6,"A film adaptation of this book is quick to come to mind, because it would easily be a visual spectacle and a cinematic feat.  However, simply trying to conceive where to begin with such an immense tale--and with such a large and faithful fan base--is unfathomable to say the least. Regardless, Peter Jackson accomplished the impossible and did it well too--in fact, it was Tolkien's son that said it was impossible.  But clearly for anyone to say from this point on that a book is unable to be adapted to the big screen, new hope lies with the success of this film--commercially and artistically.
Usually the decree is that film adaptations stray too far from their source material.  In this case, the filmmakers did everything possible to maintain the feel of the book, if not every individual scenario.  And it works well because of that.  Many have criticized the film adaptation of the first Harry Potter for too closely following the book.  In the case of The Lord of the Rings, it follows it suitably, diverging where necessary, omitting where obligated, but maintaining everything about the narrative, the characters, and the settings that made the books the success that they continue to be.
To dissect the individual aspects of the production, the film appears seamless.  The performances are well done all around.  There is a thin line that the actors must all walk, bordering between natural and over-the-top, to achieve the necessary degree of fantasy and solemnity.  The actors succeed, and come across perfectly.  The screenplay is well written and intelligently incorporates all facets of Tolkien's universe, regardless of its original presence in the main LotR text.  It is obvious that everyone did their research, and it shows in the clever writing and subtle references to other aspects of MiddleEarth.  To say all this is still to speak nothing of the special effects, which come out of nowhere and surpass even the most ambitious efforts from the 2001-year.  In a year when it appeared that Industrial Light & Magic had finally been presented with an imagination that exceeded their capabilities (read: The Mummy Returns, Harry Potter), it comes as a godsend that the no-name special effects company Weta could surpass the competition and bring a nearly perfect visualization of all the creatures and worlds in LotR.  The effects are not perfect, mind you, but intertwined with every aspect, as well as the ambitious nature of the project, makes you forget any--minute--shortcomings that might be apparent.
But perhaps the most prominent star of this film has to be Jackson's direction, which some might find over-the-top, but which occurred to me as a necessary and exciting aspect to this film.  One can literally see Jackson's enthusiasm as the camera moves around and about, but never ostentatiously or in a distracting way.  It is very appropriate and does so much to incorporate the viewer into the movie.  It might mean little to suggest, but it almost seems that some films find the subject matter too daunting to put the effort into creative filming.  In the case of LotR, some of the shots are so complex and long and intense--and from the looks of it, impossible--that Jackson appears to love every minute of it...and thereby the audience does too.  Indeed, some shots are like a roller coaster.  Implemented correctly as they are, it is a truly enthralling excursion into this intense and fascinating world.
And so the finished product of this massive cast and crew is one of the greatest films of the year and perhaps the greatest fantasy film ever.  If there is one downside, it is that I've got two more years before I can see the conclusion.  All around great efforts coupled with the ubiquitous passion for the text has helped to craft a perfect film and a spectacle for the big screen.  Moreover, this is certainly not one to be missed on the big screen; rental or video can never capture the grandeur and the vision that have built the impossible book into a great movie.",1012867200,5,4011,4.900887573964497

Consider that when Star Wars hit the scene, and became an instant success, no one was complaining that the movie was incomplete and left some cliff hangers that would not be resolved until the second movie was released. Star Wars clever marketing, as a return to an old fashion movie serial, allowed us to forgive them and so, we would have to wait for resolution to plot.  We waited 3 years before the second movie was released and then another 3 years for Episode VI! Jackson, however has done a great service by filming all three films simultaneously so that the second part of the Lord of the Rings will be released this  December and Part 3 the following year. So don't be dissuaded by going to see the film now.

1325493,4,B00003CWT6,"With all the hoopla surrounding this film and recommendations from friends that had seen it, I couldn't wait to get in the queue and see what all the fuss was about.
Well, I recently saw that flick and believe that is has its merits, as well as its detractions.
The pluses are many: 1) sweeping panoramic images of lush country sides, snow-capped and treacherous mountains, unearthly and ominous caverns, and majestic and deadly towers; (2) good computer effects that bring life to the words of Tolkein; (3) impressive camera tricks that allow the ""Hobbits"" to appear very diminutive in relation to the other inhabitants of this mystical world; (4) great performances from Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan, Billy Boyd, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean and Ian Holm, (5) a rousing score by Howard Shore, featuring vocals by Enya; and (4) remaining true to the classic novel.
Credit for all the above must be given to director Peter Jackson.
It is also great to see horror film legend Christopher Lee in the plum role of Saruman the white, the wizard that succumbs to the will of the Dark Lord.
On the downside, though, is the pacing that I find to be a little slow. The battle scenes seem to drag on endlessly and are filmed in a style reminiscent of Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" of two years ago.  There are also times when the audio is unclear, especially in pivotal moments of significant revelation.  The latter could have been the result of a poor sound system at the theater showing the movie. As earlier stated, the computer-generated effects while effective can't hold a candle to the stop-motion and technical wizardry of Ray Harryhausen or even ""a cast of thousands"" assembled by DeMille.
But, the movie is still worth a look, and upon its release on video, a purchase.",1012694400,4,1763,4.796052631578948

And the ones that vary are quite acceptable.  When I heard about some of the cast I was doubtful about how they could portray their characters, but was pleasantly surprised.  Elijah Wood (Frodo) portrays the increasing burden of the ring with clarity.  Ian McKellen (Gandalf) is more playful than I had imagined, however upon rethinking, I realize his delight and love of the hobbits and their lives.  I would recommend this movie for J.R.R.

1325495,4,B00003CWT6,"I witnessed the first installment of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy on the last day of 2001, before everyone and their grandmother began raving about it. I had high hopes for it because of the good reviews I had heard, and the commercials alone were enough to convince one to see it. But did it live up to the hype? Was it the modern masterpiece that everyone said it was? Did it deserve to be #1 on the IMDB polls?
Well, to some extents it lived up to the hype. I don't think it is a masterpiece (well, maybe a modern one). And I certainly don't think that it should be ranked higher than Citizen Kane or The Shawshank Redemption.
It is, indeed, an remarkable accomplishment for Peter Jackson and co. They've created a powerful epic (I know, it's such a cliche), focused equally on style and substance, and is overall fun to watch. The visual effects and set designs were stunning, groundbreaking, and almost overwhelming. The acting was also very good, especially Elijah Wood and Ian McKallen. The Orcs, the Balrog, and all the monsters were just damn cool.
However, although I said it is fun to watch, I personally think the books are bit more fun. There is a strange charm that inhabits Tolkien's novels that the makers of the movie seemed to miss. They were more hell-bent on inserting action sequences every two seconds than fulfilling Tolkien's vision. I guess I did expect it to be a bit different from the novels, but I'm just sayin'...
Also, I thought some scenes were a tad stretched out, especially the last 30 minutes of it. There were many times that I stretched, getting ready to get up and leave the theatre because I thought the ""ending music"" was cued in. But then, THERE WAS MORE!
Overall, I felt it was worth my six dollars, despite the couple of minor complaints above, and I am definitely anticipating the next two installments, The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).
By the way, whatever you do, don't be late if you see this movie. You'll see why.

Movies are a form of art,not science I think this movie was a beautiful version of Tolkien's world. The cenematography, the scenery, and the score were a feast for the senses. The cast was exceptional. At first I thought Kate Blanchett played Galadriel a little too menacing, but I realize she did have the reputation of being an evil sorceress. I wanted to see more of Strider, but I think Viggo will not let us down. Surely they will go into more depth about Aragorn in the next part. Elijah and Ian were no less praiseworhty than I expected. All the hobbits brought charm and humor to the movies. Sean Bean made me like Boramir much better than I did in the book. How sad he won't be in The Two Towers.

1325541,4,B00003CWT6,"Basic story:  Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit who resides in the Shire, is left a magical ring by his aging Uncle Bilbo.  The ring has the ability to turn the wearer invisible but people have noticed that those who wear it long began to get a bit angry and suspicious of everyone.  Gandalf the Gray, the Wizard who has traveled extensively with Bilbo, tells Frodo that this ring is the one ring that the evil Sauron needs to take over
the world.  He advises Frodo to take the ring from the Shire before Sauron's henchmen can get there.  Gandalf believes that the only thing that can stop this is to destroy the ring.
 Frodo leaves on his quest accompanied by his faithful friend, Sam, and their compatriots Pippin and Merry.  On the road they are chased by something that seems more animal than man yet rides on horseback.  They encounter the Ranger Strider who agrees to take them to the home of the elves.  Frodo is injured in an attack and the group makes it to sanctuary
in the nick of time.
 After Frodo is healed it is decided that a group, a Fellowship of the various races, will have to journey to the realm of Sauron and destroy the ring in the fires that created it.  Frodo is accompanied by his Hobbit friends, as well as Gandalf, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and two humans Boromir and Strider now revealed to be Aragorn the last descendent of the King who first defeated Sauron.
 The Fellowship begin their journey and come face to face with hardships both natural and unnatural.  Gradually the group is torn apart by competing desires as to how the ring should be destroyed.
 Peter Jackson has done an incredible job of directing this movie.  This is a very thorough adaptation of the book.  Sure, some things have been cut out from the movie and some things have been added to flesh out character but for the most part Jackson has followed the style of the original book.
 The pacing of the movie is, for the most part, well done.  He gives us the background of the ring wars at the beginning and then drops the pace for the party in the Shire.  This is the only time I thought the movie was slow.  Then things pick right back up and go straight forward to a wild finish.  His cinematographer deserves the utmost of credit.  The
visuals of this movie are almost second to none.  Also the sequences involving the demon riders are done in almost a dream sequence which increases the tension.  The collaboration involved to show the various race's and how they react around each other is worth watching.  The Hobbit's are a tiny race and when humans are around they tower over everything and have to watch for destroying the surroundings by accident.  The dwarf sequences and the Elf's are wonderful to watch.
 For the most part I found the characters all well cast.  Ian McKellen was born to play the role of Gandalf.  He has the appropriate age and gravity with his Shakespearean background and brings the rage of wizard fully to this role.  Viggo Mortensen plays Strider/Aragorn.  He has been frequently seen as a secondary characters in most movies and has received the chance to step forward with this one.  Not only does he step forward but he runs with the movie.
 The only questionable casting choice I found, unfortunately, was that of Elijah Wood as Frodo.  Elijah is a good actor and has a solid resume. However I found that he brought almost an Elvish quality to the role of the Hobbit.  He looks almost angelic as the Hobbit.
 The battle scenes are chaotic but wonderful.  They follow the various actors and their fighting styles, Aragorn and Boromir with their swords, Legolas the Elf with his deadly Bow, Gimli the Dwarf  with his axe, and the Hobbit's with their almost berserker attacks against superior odds. The cameras swirl around the battle scenes showing as much as possible
and leaving you hanging for more.
 This is not necessarily a movie for the young children as it does have some dark sequences and the various Orcs can be rather frightening. There are also a few slow moments near the beginning.  That being said, this is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.  I know some complaints have been made concerning the ending but it tends to make me wonder if the people complaining understand that this is part 1 of a
trilogy.  I am strongly looking forward to next year for part two, The Two Towers.",1012608000,,4359,4.535897435897436
1325542,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie has turned out to be highly controversial.  When you think about it, it's hardly a surprise.  This is the first attempt at live-action adaptation of one of the most beloved novels of all time.  And I think that it had to wait this long to be done well.
And done well it is.  There isn't much deviation from the novel, especially compared to the treatment other novels have received in big screen translation.  The cast is wonderful, working as an excellent ensemble while still defining their own characters.  Ian McKellen stands out as Gandalf the Grey, bringing a keen emotional depth to his character while also taking on the mantle of wise leader.  Elijah Wood is also great as Frodo, showing through his actions and emotion just how great the burden of the One Ring is.  Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, and Sean Bean as Boromir are all well cast as well.  This film is about relationships, and these relationships feel real.  Liv Tyler is surprisingly good as Arwen.
The fictional Middle Earth looks great as well.  Filmed in new Zealand, it's hard to take your eyes off of the beautiful landscapes that surround our fictional company.
Howard Shore delivers an excellent score here as well.  Very 'classic', yet it feels new.  Using lots of chorus and brass, Shore helps convey the urgency of Frodo's quest.
Kudos to Mr. Jackson.  Bring on The Two Towers.",1012608000,,1420,4.766393442622951
1325543,5,B00003CWT6,"I would have to say that this is easily the best fantasy movie ever. I pretty much like what everybody else liked, and if you want to read a gushing review, just check out 99% of the others. A few things I noticed that I really liked.
1.) Boromir. You could tell that Sean Bean is the most experienced actor by how he shows Boromir as being a complete person, a man who wants to do good, but is torn by the possibilities of the ring. Unlike, characters such as Legolas or Pippin and Merry, you can actually identify him. He wasn't just portrayed as eye candy for the ladies (Legolas) or as comic relief (Pippin and Merry).
2.) Extremely gorgeous backgrounds. Isengard, the Shire, Moria, the mountain, Amon Hen, everything is beautiful.
3.) Peter Jackson was no name before this movie, but I think he will start to become well recognized as he should for doing a marvelous job.
4.) I loved how the movie was true to the storyline but didn't include Tom Bombadil or else the many, many poems which are....well...umm really not that good that Tolkien seemed to have everywhere in his books.
5.) There seem to be two main plots; Aragorn becoming king and Frodo destroying the ring. With seeing his relationship with Arwen and his leadership, I am far more interested in seeing him and his accomplishments in the next 2 movies than what Frodo does.
6.) Boromir dies in this one and not Two Towers. This was good because it brought more closure to the movie and you could feel it winding down.
Things I didn't like as much...
1.) I know the movie is true to the book but it seemed like Frodo was nearly dying left and right. Especially in the mines of Moria where he was saved by the mithril. It seemed like the camera was on him for 10 minutes while he was in agony. Also, everybody seemed to drop what they were doing if he got hurt at all and he was always the target, Yet you didn't see him doing much to help the others except for saving Sam which was really saving Sam from his over-zealousness/puppy dog trait of always wanting to be with Frodo and protect him.
2.) Hugo Weaving as Elrond. While i think he is a good actor and has a rather ominous voice, I dont' feel he is ""graceful"" enough to be the elf king. He sounds more like a wizard or a narrator then the smooth, soft melody sound that an elf would tend to have.
3.) Merry and Pippin as comic relief...and that's it. They seemed to be pretty useless and only caused trouble. It always seemed like aragorn, boromir and gandalf were bailing them out of trouble. i.e. the creature in the water and dropping the bucket down the well and of course getting carried off at the end. Althought that wasn't so bad because they did actually show some use by diverting the Uruk-Hai from Frodo.
All in all, it realy was a great movie, it would be perfect, the best movie ever if nto for a few of those irritatoins that i mentioned.",1012521600,3,2878,4.371268656716418
1325544,5,B00003CWT6,"The movie is gorgeous!  From the opening voiceover to the haunting Ringwraiths to the enchanting Rivendell, it never ceases to amaze its viewers.  The actors could not have been chosen any better, each one portraying their character with amazing realness.  Ian McKellan is wonderful as the comical and wise wizard, Gandalf, as Elijah Wood is fantastic as the wide-eyed Frodo Baggins.  The movie seamlessly and effortlessly flows from scene to scene.  The first half introduces us to the world of Middle Earth and presents us the plot, giving even the most un-Tolkein of fans a clear history of such a complicated world.  We witness Frodo journey to Bree, where he meets Viggo Mortensen, wonderfully cast as Aragorn, the heroic human who guides Frodo on his journey, and become chilled with the characters during the eerie scene at Weathertop.  Liv Tyler, ethereal and beautiful as the Elvish Princess Arwen, rescues Frodo by fleeing the Nazgul in the most thrilling scene of the movie.  It wraps up the journey to Rivendell on an extreme note of energy.  Then we are introduced to the rest of the Fellowship in the enchanting Rivendell.  The movie carries on, with never a dull moment.  We visit the frightening mines of Moria and the mystical world of Lothlorien.  Cate Blanchett is fantastic as the mysterious Galadriel.  The movie ends with anticipation and a surefire next-year box office hit, The Two Towers. Not one to miss.
Notable Performances:
Ian McKellan- He plays the wizard in such a grandfatherly way, we feel we can all confide in him, a character which we never even knew.
Liv Tyler-  She deserves her leading credit and definately not the negative views of the Tolkein fans.  She portrays Arwen splendidly and you'll leave the movie wanting to see more of this character.
Elijah Wood-  Up and coming, we will be sure to see more of this young man in movies to come.",1012521600,,1882,4.852664576802508
1325564,5,B00003CWT6,"When I read the LOTR books...I was just amazed...but to see it on the big screen...it was absolutely crazy. Although there are changes here and there, the changes didn't spoil anything and although some people are ""nitpicking"" by saying they saw a car zooming by in the background (I found it when I went the second time but it was hardly noticeable even when I was looking for it) etc. those things failed to ruin the fine details, accurate casting and work put into this project. But one thing I should mention is that the relationships between the characters, some of them aren't expressed as strongly as I would've liked but hey with only 3hours, it was a job well done! I wouldn't mind watching it again and again!! A must watch regardless of whether you have read the book or not.",1012521600,,786,4.542253521126761

The only ""problem"" is that some of the peaceful middlesekvenses (e. g. the first meeting with the elves, Tom Bombardilare) are left out. Some spoken lines differ a lot from Tolkien (Let's hunt some orcs!!!), but that maches the movie. If a person is biblic about the book, the film migth be to ""fresh"" and a large disappiontment. The actors do a wonderfull job, and in the end, you wish that the film goes on just a minute more, though you know it is ending.

Adventure,love and hate, friendship, death and loss, magic, and redemption; all there waiting.  The direction, the acting, the cinematpgraphy--all simply marvelous.  I read the books, and I really enjoyed them, but the movie made a good thing perfect.  I have seen it three times and would do so again (as soon as I get rid of the crick in my neck that resulted from sitting in the front row twice).
Kudos to Peter Jackson.  Kudos to Elijah Wood (who made me swallow my tongue with his performance--has he finally broken away from the McCauley Culkin syndrome?  The answer is a resounding ""yes!"")
I read most of the reviews and I have to disagree with those who thought Peter Jackson sold out by making Arwen, who rarely appears or has any line in the books,a central character.  I must admit that, at first, I was of the same opinion.  However, it was so tastefully and logically done that it works.  The whole movie works.
People go to the movies for entertainment, and the movie provides that and more.  Be prepared for some eye candy, but that is not what makes this movie so wonderful; it is a credit to Jackson, his amazing feat, that he has made a movie out of a fantasy classic and he has done it justice.",1012435200,,1329,4.504166666666666

But then I also would have to give praise to: Orlando Bloom,Billy Boyd,Liv Tyler, Dominic Monaghan, and the many, many others.

Nevertheless,  I have to admit that I took a nap in the middle of it.  My version of the plot:  beautiful pastoral scenery, cute hobbit scenes, ominous bad guys, lots of noisy galloping by black horses, beautiful pastoral scenery, elves, sword fights, sword fights, sword fights, pastoral scenery, galloping horses, sword fights, sword fights.  Yawn.  Admittedly, part of the problem was that even though I haven't read the ""Lord of the Rings"", I found the story very predictable.  It's a story you've seen lots of times - admittedly this is the original source and all those other fantasy tales are derivative.  That doesn't mean that it hasn't since been done to death.

Incredible.  Amazing.  Mind-blowing.  FAN-TAS-TIC....I rarely award five stars to any film but this pretty much takes the cake.
I knew when ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" was going to be in theaters.  I had, in fact, been counting the days `til its release since I first heard of it sometime in 2000....for...three hours, I was mesmerized.
Wild horses couldn't drag me from my seat.
It was everything that I wanted it to be and everything I expected it to be, and to be quite honest, it surpassed my every expectation.
Director Peter Jackson has done a fantastic job in conceiving Middle Earth and all it practicalities, right down to the narrowest detail.  With the assistance of Frances Walsh and Philippa Boyens, these three men have crafted a satisfying screenplay and were stalwart to Tolkien's story, cutting corners where necessary but the whole remaining truly and utterly complete.
Jackson and his enormous assemblage of set designers, graphic artists and various other artistic breeds toiled over a grueling 18-month schedule in the lush landscapes of New Zealand, painstakingly incarnating Tolkien's universe of yore.  Middle Earth comes to life with an accuracy rarely seen and many of the author's small details become pertinent, from the sign on Bilbo's gate (No Admittance Except on Party Business) to the architecture of his home (round windows/doors) and the ornate entrance to the Morian Mines.  He not only made sure that Tolkien's work would be rendered nearly flawless (Middle Earth historians and elven language coaches were brought in and devoted a generous amount of their time and knowledge) but made movie history in the process: he is the first director in the history of motion pictures to film three major productions simultaneously.  Along with Jackson's monumental project came a record-breaking budget...Although it seemed an insurmountable task, Jackson's financial bravado and meticulousness paid off handsomely - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visual extravaganza and will no doubt be eligible for a string of awards once the tallies for Oscar are announced.
In the opening of this colossal feature, we stare into a black void as the whispers of an ancient dialect sound with Cate Blanchett providing a translation along with an informative narrative.  This five-minute intro is a quickie timeline that sets the tone and pace for the film, following the travails of the dark lord Sauron's ring of power, a ring forged in the volcanic flames of Mt. Doom.  Sauron loses this very ring in an arresting battle scene to Isildur, heir to the throne of Gondor.  Isildur is consumed by the ring's energy the moment he touches it and instead of surrendering it to Mt. Doom's hellish heat to vanquish its power once and for all, he turns on his heel and claims it as his own.  Because of the ring's self-exuding impiety, Isildur is slaughtered by a barrage of orcs and dumped into the river, the ring lost to all for the next 2500 years.  A reclusive creature named Gollom becomes the ring's next possessor, half-wittingly stumbling upon it while digging in the dirt.  His ""precious"" remains with him for the next 500 years and then finally comes into the keeping of a halfling named Bilbo Baggins (Holm), Sauron's infused power now consuming a new host.
For 60 years, Bilbo (Holm) tells no one of his remarkable discovery until Gandalf the Grey (McKellan) arrives at the Shire to attend his 111th birthday bash.  Gandalf warns him of the ring's profound influence and Bilbo relinquishes his prize to his nephew Frodo (Wood), journeying to the elven city of Rivendell to find peace in his old age.  Frodo is now strapped with the task of destroying the ring permanently and he alone must make the journey, casting the object of Sauron's culminated evil into its fiery chasm.
Quite a heavy story - one that left many fans skeptical as to whether or not Jackson could do the author's extensive saga justice converting it to film.  Some sneered that Tolkien's legacy was being marred by the ostentatious nature of Hollywood...Even a random fan argued that if other films were to be made from Tolkien's books...that ""only the British should ever attempt it"".  Well, it came close - LOTR has an Australian director and a number of British actors (McKellen, Weaving, Bloom, Monaghan, etc.)....In spite of these naysayers, I will not present my own argument, for I would be wasting my breath - I'd much rather praise the film and besides, there are so many people who have already voiced my opinion far better than I can....I was more than eager to see the story go from paper to celluloid.  Fantasy enthusiasts who haven't read the books will love every minute; Jackson's presentation of events sweeps the viewer away into a whole other world.  The versatile topography of New Zealand coupled with state-of-the-art visual effects (armies of orcs, elves and humans were created with a high-tech program called MASSIVE) make the terrain and atmosphere of Middle Earth and all its precincts that much more believable.  To further enchant, FOTR offers superlative and intricate opuses from composer Howard Shore, the man responsible for the original scores to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""M. Butterfly"" (among many others).  Shore has created a beautiful and resonant soundscape of strings, woodwinds and chorals, lending a rich and harmonizing texture to the film's magical aura.  I was surprised to learn that while perusing the CD booklet for the soundtrack that Elizabeth Fraser (formerly of Cocteau Twins) lends her pipes to two verses sung entirely in Tolkien's elvish patois (she can be heard during ""Lothlorien"").
As for performances, it's obvious who the centerpieces are.  Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen are arresting, fleshing out their characters and making them seem more real than the rest.  Wood's baby blues get many a close-up, enhancing their clarity and color.  He is the embodiment of the childish and innocent Frodo, manufacturing many a tear and furrowed brow to translate Frodo's fear of a seemingly insuperable task.  McKellen, who is wonderful no matter what part he plays, is a casting dream-come-true as Gandalf, the wise and tempered counterpart to Frodo's navet.  Sean Astin is perfect as Sam, Frodo's eager but somewhat gullible companion and Cate Blanchett impresses as the ethereal Lady of the Wood, Galadriel....",1012176000,2,6380,5.0389733840304185
1325680,4,B00003CWT6,"First of all - the movie was great.  I only have one comment;
When reading this as a teen, of great importance is the sword of Elendil.  Although you show the shards of Narsil, you do not mention that the sword is re-forged in Rivendell (unless I missed something while busy with my popcorn).  From the chapter ""The Ring Goes South"" ....""The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the cresent Moon and the rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor.  Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen.  And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it Anduril, Flame of the West.""
What I would love to see........
If perhaps there is a recap of Fellowship of the Rings... a scene where the elvish smiths are reforging the sword...and then the sword coming forth on the screen while the above passage is read...where the design on the sword is seen and the new name are made clear to the audience.  ANDURIL !!",1012176000,,1175,4.27027027027027
1325681,1,B00003CWT6,"This movie was one of the most prodigious wastes of time and money I've had the misfortune of suffering in my 28 years of earthly existence.
It was way too slow moving, and the pacing was way off, with trivial scenes being dragged out interminably while important sequences were rushed unceremoniously through. The scenes between Gandalf and Saruman were a joke (hey look, Saruman is putting good ol' Gandalf through a blender, lookit him spin !). And that fire monster (Balrog was it ?) looked like a ridiculous cross between the computer generated Malebolgia in Spawn and the devil-dogs in Ghostbusters. And don't even get me started on the way Cate Blanchett's character looked during her ""evil"" transformation. She looked less lifelike than the obviously computer generated characters in Final Fantasy, for crying out loud !
I'll admit the scenery was pretty in a few scenes. But even then the camerawork left a lot to be desired. And what's up with that laughable Scottish score during the later part of the movie. I began to fear that I was watching another Highlander sequel, then started to wish I was, because bad as those were, they couldn't come close to how bad this movie was.",1012176000,6,1189,4.833333333333333

1325683,5,B00003CWT6,"The most promising film of the year is here. It promises to thrill you and it promises to impress you. Just like Gone with the wind and Ben-Hur, the movie is just as good as the book. Probably better. The film couldn't have been made any better. It's for fans of all kind of interests. Even if you aren't a fantasy film fan, this movie will thrill you. It's for everyone who likes adventure, comedy, thrill, horror, love, hope, and of coarse fantasy.

  The film has used what would be the best example of cinematography I have ever seen. It couldn't have been made any better. Whoever set up the cast did a great job. And of coarse the musical score and sound effects couldn't have been any better. They were just right to put an audience at the edge of their seats. Liv Tyler did a great job as well as the rest of the cast. Also the movie is for audiences of all ages, though it may frighten youngsters. Cate Blanchett also did a great job, just like she did in Elizabeth.

  The movie is definitely one that has more than one theme to its plot. An adventure like this hasn't been seen since probably Jurassic Park and Independence Day. It's also for everyone who enjoyed watching the Star Wars trilogy. It is definitely the year's most thrilling fantasy adventure. Harry Potter doesn't even come close. Well I did think Harry Potter was the film of the year but now, Lord of the rings takes the title. The movie is also for all Narnia fans. I haven't seen a film this good in months. For once a movie has been made in which every penny spent on it is worth it. This Jackson flick is one that helps to recreate one's imagination. The movie is probably the best fantasy film of the century. A great way to start the new year!",1012176000,,1727,4.3312693498452015

surely, it was entertaining.  it was one of the most incredibly entertaining things i've ever seen - the first time.  the second time was much less - perhaps it was the company i was with, but for some reason it just was .. less.  however, the imagery still kept my attention.  it's definitely a very well-made and well-executed movie - as well as epic in proportion.  as star wars showed us, you can't go wrong with epic, especially not epic eye-candy.  i would recommend this movie to anyone, even those who like to think about movies, but only once.  twice is redundant, and i can't wait for the sequel and conclusion .. but i really prefer more cerebral movies.  but laud should indeed go to mr. jackson for rendering tolkien's words so beautifully in a way tolkien could not do for himself simply because his writing style is .. in my opinion .. less than stellar.  his imagination, however, knows no bounds.",1012089600,,1371,4.600823045267489

I had read the book quite a while back because my dad had recommended it to me and thought it would be great if they made a film about it. So as soon as I got a chance I dragged my boyfriend down to our local cinema and unfortunately we got seated right at the front because they were the only seats left, so we took them. As soon as the film started I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, even my boyfriend who has never read the book really enjoyed it. I was amazed at the effects and the scenery and how good all the characters were at their part especially Elijah Wood who I am a big fan of anyway, I think he portrayed the role of Frodo just how I imagined him in the book, but so did all the cast they were all absolutely brilliant.

So far I have seen it 4 times, and am going again.  The whole movie was incredible, the acting was superb and if the oscars ignore this film, then they should have their head examined.

Not to mention that the cinemas are practically overflowing with useless storylines and characters.
Thank god for Lord of the Rings! This absoloutley flawless epic will hopefully mark the beginning of a stunning new genre of film. I could go on for hours about its good points, but if i had to pick one thing that could have been done slightly better...it would have to be the animation of the cave troll. Yes, the close-ups of its face are lifelike but on the whole its movement and posture are not altogether convincing. But don't be put off! I am still giving it 5 STARS because the supurb acting, fantastic scenery and not forgetting the exellent directing  would make up for any other flaws the piece might contain (but i'm pretty sure it doesn't!).

This movie was simply amazing. First, the casting... each of the characters were casted perfectly, I think. Each did a wonderful job of bringing out the emotions of all the characters in the books... you can especially see this in Frodo, and you can see he actually looks incredibly frightened at times. The expression of the characters was fantastic, and I praise the actors for bringing this out so well.
The effects - well, what to say about them? They were amazing as well. Everything looked so real, I sometimes forgot I was watching a mere film. The CG looked all real as well, almost too realistic. You'll enjoy watching the film, since you feel like you're sort of... part of the experience.
I have to say that just a few things bothered me - one, the amount of times they used the slow motion effect on the camera, and two, the fact that just a few bits of this movie were slightly cheesy. You can't really expect it to be all perfect, though, and you soon forget the movie's flaws.
I'd say this is, quite possibly, the best movie I've ever seen. I thorougly enjoyed watching it, and I simply can't wait 'till the next two come out. I hope they're as great as the first one.",1012003200,2,1296,4.404166666666667

It is therefore not surprising that the Fellowship of The Ring movie has been well recieved by most diehard fans (including myself). Those that were initiated to, and became fans to this fantastic world of fantasy desired, dreamed, wished for something more visual to appear during their lifetime. Along came a 1978 animated version, which brought many of us to the cinemas in great expectation. Alas, although it had some appeal, the trilogy was never completed and became most of all, a teaser.
I do not wish to comment on the technical qualities of this latest movie, that will be left up to those critics deemed professionals and those that are deemed not. However, I would like to thank Mr Peter Jackson for his roll in bringing to life the visual life of the book. I have totally enjoyed watching the movie, you have done the best you can in keeping to the spirit of this wonderful story, and I commend you.

Most of the people who liked it were either  fans of the books or wanting to see something better than ""The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings cartoons"".

It follows through from beginning to end ,but leaving a very mysterious ending to the next of the Trilogy.....The two towers. PART 1 may not be better than the book ,but it carries out cause no movie I have seen has ever taken an entire book and put every detail to it, so I try to pretend it's somewhat else than what the book has to offer. There is high hopes for Part 1 cause of it's graphics that are 10 times better that the original Star Wars (including the special edition!!!) and who said Lord of the Rings cannot be made into a movie! I know some people who say Part 1 is better that Harry Potter ,but I tend to say it appeals to other audences (Harry Potter was #2 on my list). Harry Potter is the ""wizard of oz of our time!

Lord of the Rings is essentially Conan the Barbarians meets Monty Python and the Holy Grail, only it's not funny. Intentionally, leastways. (I mean, how can you say ""one ring to bind them, one ring to rule over them etc etc etc"" with a straight face? Answer - They didn't! It was in a voiceover!)
Yes, yes, yes - it's gorgeous to look at - take a bow, New Zealand's South Island - but other than that it's simply a (po-faced) chaser, isn't it? - Three hours of the little cuddly dudes onthe run from the standard-issue Peter Jackson Ugly Monster(s). Ian McKellen reprises Alec Guinness' Ben Kenobi role (only with silly hat and a better beard!), the Hobbits live in what looks suspiciously like the set from The Teletubbies, and they get chased episodically across Tubbyland, down under a mountain (with some REMARKABLY manky CGI - I thought they had spliced in a few scenes from the animated version at one stage!) and across hills and dales (though to his credit Jackson managed - for maybe the first time in his career - to resist staging any of the film in the Karori cemetary) until, after three hours and an unseemly amount of carnage ....... (wait for it) ... THEY GET TO THE BORDER OF THE COUNTRY WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO!!!
Strap yourselves in, lads there's another six hours to sit through before they even get to where they're going! Strewth and cor lumme! At least there was a climax in each of the Star Wars films! And what about a wisecracking cheeky character? Where was Han Solo in this?
And could all the villains shoot straight? No! Did it occur to them that they weren't obliged to attack the good guys in single file one at a time? No!

A lot of pompous talking, interrupted by action scenes looking as if they were lifted from a computer game.
An extremely lame and simple action scenes it were. F.ex. the scene where the elven girl races towards the river with Frodo. How does she succeed ? She just whispers a few spells to the horse and it outruns the pursuers. This may work in a novel, but in a movie you need a lot more twist and turns. Compare this horse race with the speeder chase in Return Of The Jedi. See what I mean ?

1. You don't have to read the book to enjoy the film .
2. This is the real thing : as a fellow who hasn't read both books - ""Harry Potter""(HP) and ""Lord Of The Rings"" (LOTR) - but has seen both movies - LOTR overshadows HP completely . The originality of this film shines through the  inevitable comparison of the two . I'm sorry I wasted my time on seeing HP - don't waste yours .
3. Visually stunning : you shall witness never seen before visual effects that will leave you breathless - the movie is , beyond everything else , a visual experience - after all , the leading stars of LOTR are the  special effects , that could be accomplished only in recent years thanks to advanced computer technologies .
4. Audibly striking : in addition to the visual dimension , the music , noises and voices bring the film to heights of performance few movies share .
5. It is NOT suitable for kids under the age of 11-12 : the movie is chilling , creepy , terrifying , and contains some images that are not easily digested . There were several scenes in which I was so tensed , frightened and edgy , I actually jumped in my seat , and throughout the whole experience my body was stiffed . As a rule , there are a lot of horror-movie motives in LOTR , and I wouldn't recommend any weak-hearted or pregnant women to experience them . Beware !
6. Of course , beautiful landscape shots , that make you wish you've been to New Zealand - the sooner the better - this country looks like heaven .
7. In contradiction to other reviewers , I am not sorry I will have to wait a year for the next movie . I think the producers have made a wise decision in holding the crowds anticipating for the next to come ; waiting is sometimes a good thing , especially when one knows how good it is going to be .",1011916800,3,2015,4.286089238845144

1325825,5,B00003CWT6,"I am not the biggest Tolkien fan. I'm only about halfway through the first book in the trilogy, which I read in anticipation for the movie. But, as little of it that I'd read by the time the film came out, I can at least say that anyone can easily love this film.
The camerawork is great. The scenery is breathtaking. The characters are believable and well-acted. Even the special effects don't really look like special effects! This is the kind of movie that people dream of being in or making. When you get a chance that big, you don't blow it, and you can tell that by watching how well everything is done.
However, the movie is not without its flaws. I realize that if they had included everything in the movie, it would have been 5 hours long instead of just three. Still, as a result, the finished product has very little to do with the book. You can't go see the movie and say that you've read the first book, because there's a lot of differences. One of the most important characters in the book is not in the film. I hear that that character is even more important in the second book. One cannot help wondering how the second film will be able to pull that off.
But in any case, truthful or not, this is still a darned good film that will keep you on your toes from beginning to end. Director Terry Gilliam once said that movies now can either be a fun escape or a serious example of art, and that it's very rare when a film can reflect both of these. Lord of the Rings is one of those rare films.",1011830400,3,1506,4.2145328719723185
1325826,5,B00003CWT6,"This is one of the best films I've seen.  Not perfect by a long shot, but any quibbles I have with it are just, well, quibbles.  Peter Jackson has done a magnificent job of presenting Tolkien's vision on the big screen.
My quibbles:
1)  Not enough character development for Legolas and Gimli, nor of their burgeoning friendship.
2)  Galadriel's gift giving to the Fellowship was sorely missed, in part because her gift giving brings about actual changes in perception on the part of some of the characters (most notably Gimli, who becomes enamored of her)
3)  The casting of Hugo Weaving as Elrond--having not seen The Matrix I do not associate him with the bad guy in that film, but Weaving, sorry to say, is not nearly ""beautiful"" enough or awe-inspiring enough to pass as a leader of the most beautiful, immortal race.
4)  The casting of Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn.  If anything Mortensen and Sean Bean (Boromir) should have switched roles.  Mortensen is a capable enough actor, but Bean was by far the stronger, more compelling presence.
5)  A few sloppy instances of editing and special effects.  Most notably, how the heck does Legolas always have a full quiver of arrows even though he's shooting all the time?  Perhaps Jackson figured the audience would just infer that Legolas was retrieving arrows from somewhere.  :-)  The cave troll was mostly great but for a few rather obvious ""oh look this is CGI stuff"" moments.
The good stuff:
1) But for the above mentioned moment with the Cave troll, the CGI and special effects were really top-notch, especially because they did not exist for their own sake but for the purpose of enhancing and telling the story
2) Substituting Arwen for Glorfindel.  Some gripe about this ""PC"" decision to use the female elf as a warrior princess,  but I thought it was a wise choice because it shows that Arwen is as full-blooded a character as the man she loves.  Mortensen and Liv Tyler also had a strong chemistry that worked well in their scenes.
3)  Cutting the songs, Tom Bombadil, etc.  They were not missed, although perhaps a song or two sung by the hobbits would have lightened things a bit.
4)  Ian McKellan as Gandalf and Orlando Bloom as Legolas.  Every actor did justice to their roles, filling them beautifully in both look and deed, but these two were my top picks, because they actually made me forget that wizards and elves are creatures of fiction.  McKellan was born to play Gandalf, the perfect combination of humor, gravity, power, warmth, and I loved his little forays into mischief and sarcasm.  Bloom also seems born to play Legolas.  He perfectly embodied the grace and beauty of the Elves in both movement and looks, (the guy is just gorgeous) but also the masculine elegance of his character.  His character was given short shrift, but nevertheless I could not take my eyes off him, particularly during the battle scenes.
5)  Casting in general was inspired (minus Elrond and perhaps Aragorn).  The actors all had tremendous chemistry, they worked hard without looking like they were working hard, and they really made me care about them and their journey.
In total, this film is an object lesson in what ""epic"" moviemaking should be all about.  The scenery and effects are not what make this film, it's the story, the characters, and the acting.  I have seen this film three times and I would see it again, and what's more, it gets better with every viewing.  I am anxiously awaiting a Director's Cut, either in theaters or on DVD.",1011830400,4,3499,4.746688741721854

Not only are the visual effects breath-takingly, bone- chillingly astounding, but the casting and acting are certainly Oscar worthy performances. Nothing in this film falls short of one's expectations; in fact, it goes above and beyond anything one could imagine. Many Tolkien fans were worried that the magic and authenticity of the novels would be lost in the modernity of today's  style and culture, but all these fears have been pushed aside as everyone has found them to coinside with the magical feelings that the trilogy possesses. Nothing about the movie is dissappointing  and nothing falls short of eager Tolkien fan's expectations( except maybefor the fact that I was just waiting for Elrond to say in his monotone voice,""Welcome to Rivindell, MR ANDERSON""! ). A joy ride of thrills and wonder, LOTR is sure to become an instant classic that will go down in movie history as one of the best films of all times.",1011744000,2,1061,4.824175824175824
1325828,5,B00003CWT6,"An absolute marvel to watch. I felt everything was perfect; characters, actors, special effects, cinematography, scenery, etc, etc. Looking back in retrospect, perhaps character development was lacking, but I believe the timelessness and excitement of the story made up for that. I just can't believe the people who say they were bored with the repetition of fight scene after fight scene, not to mention all of the carnage. What carnage? I mean, of course, there were many battles between good and evil and many creatures killed, but I saw none in such a graphic and horrific way. No spewing of blood, no flying of guts, no people left in pain and agony to die horrible deaths. If you want to see graphic carnage, try 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'The Thin Red Line.' Those were films with massive amounts of grotesque and violent death, not to mention an endless repetition of the same theme...(some good guys fight the bad guys, then move on, then fight the bad guys, then move on, then fight the bad guys, etc, etc.) Honestly, I do remember leaning over to my boyfriend when the Fellowship was in the Mines of Moria fighting the ancient demon and whispered, ""How many evil creatures are they going to fight?"" I didn't say it out of a sense of boredom or urge for the movie to continue forward; I merely felt sorry for the characters. I mean, wasn't it bad enough just to go to Mordor without having to worry about battling every other demonic figure on the way there? Finally, I can't stand the way people here are so narrow-minded to say that the movie sucked because there was no ending. Duh! The movie is part of a trilogy, so of course it doesn't really ""end"" yet! I admit, I was disappointed about it though (only because I have to wait a year to see the second part). All in all, it was an absolutely fabulous movie, one of the best I've ever seen! A definite DVD buy for me!",1011744000,2,1881,4.519061583577713

The acting is unforgettable, and the story is timeless.  Director Peter Jackson has created a singular masterpiece that, like CITIZEN KANE, CASABLANCA, and STAR WARS, will inspire hundreds -- if not thousands -- of creative minds to pursue interests in film and writing.  His adaptation of the book (note: not a literal translation like the boorish HARRY POTTER film) almost cries out for academic study.
Of particular note, Viggo Mortenson (sp?) is superb as Aragorn/Stryder.
Of surprising pleasure, Elijah Wood brings a subtle intelligence to the role of Frodo Baggins, the hapless Hobbit who inherits the task of bearing the ring to the dark lands of Mordor.
Of unyielding praise, Ian McKellan deserves an Oscar for his performance as Gandalf.",1011744000,3,911,5.080536912751678

Visually it was excellent but the characters and the storyline is what will keep you hooked. The Characters are awesome. The acting was amazing. It was dramatic, emotional, and action-packed. The basic plot is about a hobbit (played oh so well by Elijah Wood) that acquires a ring of dark power and he has to destroy it. A lot unfolds along the way. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is pure magic and the ending leaves you craving parts 2 and 3.",1011744000,3,800,4.298013245033113
1325831,3,B00003CWT6,"Every dime they've spent on this trilogy is on the screen. Whether it's set design, costumes, make-up or digital wizardry - even the acting - they've gotten the biggest possible bang for every buck. The movie is a continuous visual feast from beginning to end. It's just that by the time the last course comes out, you've been sitting back from the table with your hands folded across your chest for almost an hour. And, since the final installment won't be out until Christmas 2003, you know there won't be a dessert.
The creators' devotion to the events in the source material is admirable but also a limitation. Tolkien often substituted internal back-story and characterization for plot development and this is glaringly evident on film. The plot breaks down into a three hour chase sequence that feels uncomfortably repetitive.
If you don't know where the first book ends, you'll be treated to a least a half dozen false endings that utilize every visual and musical cue to indicate the credits are about to roll...then cut to more dialogue. Every third person in the theater looked at their watch when this happened. I didn't realize so many folks had day-glow watches these days.
I am not saying the movie is a waste of time. The elements that make the Rings trilogy great - Tolkien's imagination and love of detail and his depiction of the individual's potential for good and evil - are evident. But there have been so many movies inspired by his work that - unfortunately - it takes the luster off the master's story when it finally sees its moment in the sun.",1011744000,,1569,4.7299270072992705

If you have read the books, I believe you will find that the sets are just as the books describe them.  The Fellowship is played by an extremely talented group of actors and the soundtrack shakes with power.  Elijah Wood embraces his role as the small yet brave and noble hobbit Frodo who carries the fate of his company on his shoulders.  Ian McKellen is wonderful as the wise old wizard Gandalf who guides Frodo on this dangerous journey.  Cate Blanchett is haunting as the mystical queen Galadriel and newcomer Orlando Bloom brings to life his elf character, Legolas.  The graphics are absolutely breathtaking and the three hour film flies by.

Now, being that I was more familar with the hobbit and the return of the king, I looked to this movie with interest as I had never known about the first two parts of the story. Even though I knew that certain characters would survive and what would happen to them, I was very worried about Frodo and his fellow men as they began their journey. The effects of this movie are amazing. I would have rather sat through an nine hour movie rather than ending abruptly but even I was getting restless.

1325870,5,B00003CWT6,"What can I say about Lord of the Rings that hasn't already been said?  It is a beautiful movie, capturing the very essence of Tolkien's magical world in three hours that seem to fly by.  I was initially hesitant about seeing this film, feeling sure that they would deviate from the story line and couldn't possibly due justice to the books.  I had no idea what to expect - and was quite blown away!
  While some details are changed in the adaptation, the film remains true to the story.  Of course, it is easy to pick through any adaptation and say, ""This was different and that was different and I don't know why they changed THAT"" - but no film can stay perfectly true to the book, word for word, and Lord of the Rings manages to contain all the emotion and power of the story; the minor changes don't disrupt the flow at all.
  The casting is superb, particularly the two pivotal characters, Frodo and Sam.  We feel through Frodo's suffering his determination to do the right thing, and Sam's loyal devotion to Frodo. Lighthearted Merry and Pippin and stouthearted Gimli offer comic relief in some of the more nerve-racking scenes of the movie.  We are intrigued by the mysterious Aragorn, and see Legolas is the epitome of Elvish gracefulness and watchfulness.  Sean Beam plays Boromir, troubled with the evil lure of the Ring, yet a heroic member of the company to the end.  Cate Blanchett portrays a bewitching Galadriel, and Ian McKellan is a masterful Gandalf - can a person be wise, powerful, great, and lovable?
  The scenery is pure eye candy, the music appropriate without being distracting, but most of the magic lies in the pure drama of Tolkien's masterful tale of good versus evil.  Even though I read the first two books shortly before seeing the movie, and basically knew what would happen next, I found myself on the edge of my seat during the entire movie.  I became completely caught up in the enthralling adventure, and was sorry when it ended.  My verdict?  Lord of the Rings is a must see.  I am 15, and I didn't think the violence was that bad - no worse than a lot of other movies-but it is a little scary, so I wouldn't recommend it for younger children.  I also suggest reading at least the first book before seeing the movie; you can enjoy the show without trying to keep up with the plot, and the ending will make more sense.

  actors, the special effects, the locations, the
  make-up, the music, and everything else. It was
  truly fantastic. I can't wait for the next two
  movies, I would have easily sat through a 9
  hour movie, but I realize most people wouldn't.
  I have never read The Lord of The Rings
  trilogy, but I did read The Hobbit, and I am
  familiar with the LOTR story. I never read the
  books as I was never interested in reading much
  when I was younger (I preferred writing my own
  stories). I have now begun to read the books.
  The first movie, The Fellowship of the Ring, is
  true to the book. True, there are some
  characters and places left out, but lets face
  it, with all the red tape Mr. Jackson and his
  associates had to go through, and all the time
  taken to do what they did, they did an
  incredible job. For those of you that want to
  know what happen, because you think the first
  movie was too large of a cliffhanger, you can
  always pick up the second book and read it.
  Elijah Wood is the perfect Frodo Baggins, I've
  seen all of his movies, and I think he has
  always been (and always will be) and
  outstanding actor with a long and promising
  career. Sir Ian McKellan as Gandolf is
  fantastic, a true powerful wizard to be highly
  respected. Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Sean
  Astin, Sean Bean, Ian Holm, Viggo Mortensen,
  Christopher Lee, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, Cate
  Blanchett, John-Rhys Davies, and everyone esle,
  whose names escape me are outstanding, awesome,
  fantastic, brilliant.

  walking along side with the 9 members of the
  Fellowship of the Ring. To those of you who
  have seen the movie and were sadly
  dissapointed, I'm sorry you could not grasp the
  magnificence of the movie and the story. Peter
  Jackson kept as true as true could be kept
  within a 3 hour movie, he truly did J.R.R.
  Tolkein justice. If Tolkein was alive I'm sure
  he would be proud to have his book and possibly
  his visions come to life on the big screen for
  everyone to share.

  McKellan, Barrie Osborne, Fran Walsh, and thank
  you to all others who partook of this

Anyone who says that this movie is boring has got to be completely insane. There is not a boring moment in the whole of it; the actors are splendid, and so is the CGI. The soundtrack completely complements the movie; it really gets you in whatever mood it wants to. It _shows_ you the beauty of Rivendell with its music - but the soundtrack is another story.
I've already witnessed the fantastic splendor of this motion picture four times; I have plans to go more than that. This movie - Peter Jackson and his crew, and not to mention the actors - have brought one of the finest books of time to life. Tolkien would be proud.
In any case, this movie keeps you bound up in its web of beauty and suspense, never leaving you at a dull moment. You want to see MORE of the actors, MORE of the characters they portray and bring to life. You want to hear more of the Elven language. You want to learn about the Elves; you want to learn about every little nuance, but unfortunately, that would be a rather long movie. Maybe someday, another wonderful director like Mr. Jackson, or maybe even he, will take up the task of completely covering the whole of Tolkien's trilogy of Rings, and all of his other fine books.
I would recommend this movie to everyone; in fact, I already have. I have not heard a negative thing about it, unless it be from the dullest minds I have ever met. If you are a person that cannot enjoy movies because you are constantly criticizing something of them, lay down your nit-picker for three hours and enjoy the beauty of this moving performance of grandeur.",1011571200,14,1707,4.4743589743589745

1325896,5,B00003CWT6,"When I first heard about this movie, I was reluctant to go. I thought the plot was boring and me, usually a chick-flick and comedy lovers, wasn't interested. But somehow I was convinced to go. Turns out this movie was very interesting.
You must pay attention throughout the movie, at every detail or you may get confused later on in the movie. This plot is very complex, and I still notice things I never did the other times I've seen the movie (and I've seen it 8 times!)! Besides the adventure, there is some comical relief (mostly thanks to the character: Pippin), and there are some scenes that can make you very emotional (I have cried during some parts of this movie!).
Now, the plot...
For those who never read the books, I will start off by saying: pay attention to the movie! You can catch on. I personally haven't read the books (but the movie encouraged me, and I am currently reading LOTR: FOTR) and I still could pretty much understand what was going on. At the begining of the movie, there is around 15 minutes of background on how Bilbo Baggins got the ""One Ring"" that rules all the other magic rings (basically, it gives a brief background on Bilbo, in which was given in the book ""The Hobbit""). I must admit when I was watching the narrative section of the movie, I was afraid it would be like this for the entire movie, thus making it a snore-fest. But don't let the begining fool you, it isn't told by a narrator throughout the movie.
Eventually, Bilbo Baggins gives the One Ring to Frodo, his nephew (with the help of Gandalf the gray). All are oblivious at first, on what terrible things are impending. Orcs, Ring Wraiths (the Black Riders), and dark lords await them. Frodo must destroy the ring before Sauron gets hold of it or there will be Hell on Middle-Earth.
If you have read the books, you'll find that the movie ends near the begining of the Two Towers book. I don't know why they do this, but I am in a way glad they did this, because they have the best battle scene (so far) now in FOTR! And I'm 1/3 the way done with my book and have noticed many differences, but I still believe they did a pretty good job with the movie. They had to rearrange some conversations or events into different parts of the movie, but they make it work together and give all the neccessary information to understand what is going on.
I will say that some people may get bored with this, but probably most of them didn't pay attention, or else don't like movies that either make them think or has no romance. Well, there is maybe a 10-minute romance scene in the entire movie (which gives some valueable information)!
If you are a female and totally hate fantasy adventure movies, but somehow get inside the theater to see LOTR, be sure to check out the hobbit, Frodo (played by Elijah Wood), and my personal favorite, Legolas (played by Orlando Bloom), the elf archer. And this goes for any age! I'm 14 and I ""drool"" over the hot elf, but how seen women in their 30s and 40s gawking over him! The two hotties can most likely help make the movie more tolerable! ;o)
Now, I also like the character Pippin (played by Billy Boyd) who so far seems more stupid than in the book...but make no mistake, he's hilarious! Keep an eye out for him and his piffy comments! ;o)
Overall, this movie is awesome, a must see! The only downside is the ending. Since this is part of a trilogy, they leave you with a cliffhanger, but the ending isn't exciting. It doesn't end with the Fellowship surrounded by Orcs or anything like that, but it still makes you crave for more. And I personally can not wait until December to see the next one!",1011571200,2,3631,4.42089552238806
1325897,5,B00003CWT6,"**Probably some spoilers here in case you haven't seen the movie yet!**
The same thing that has plagued the books now plagues the movie.  The elitists, the ""literati"", and the truly artsy citizens of the world have found a common enemy-- the masterpiece known as The Fellowship of the Ring.  What are some of the common critiques, from people like Ebert, the Golden Globes (and undoubtedly Academy) Award selection committee, and some of our fellow reviewers on Amazon?
1.  ""The fight scenes are redundant; I feel like we go from one fight to another; there's too much violence.""  Let's count 'em-- in the three hours of this movie, there are 4 major fight scenes, 3 where someone actually dies.  The first is in the prologue, which can hardly be compared to the following fights.  The second is on Weathertop, where unfortunate Frodo takes the brunt of the Nazgul attack.  The third is in the depths of Moria, against the orcs there, and the fourth is on Amon Hen near the end of the movie, against Saruman's Uruk-Hai.  The ONLY similiarties between Moria and Amon Hen are that there are orcs, and they die (well, that and Legolas is a stud both times).  How you can get tired of this stuff amazes me.  It is filmed beautifully, and avoids the newest en vogue Hollywood fight cam that never really let's you see anything that's going on.  At the same time, they are both so fast-paced that they're over practically as soon as they begin.  The total time taken up by all of these scenes is a small, small fraction of the movie.
2.  ""3 hours was over-long; the movie loses rythm with such a long running time; this is a SLEEPER.""  Obviously this does not come from those critics who thought it too violent, since they were clutching at their armrests to keep from bursting into tears.  However, to the point at hand.  I think it's about time we get what we pay for at movies-- if I pay 7+ bucks to see a mvoie, I want quality and lots of it.  Every scene in this movie is important for the story, drives ahead the plot, and shows the evil that we are facing here.  The smallest interaction between Sam and Frodo becomes hugely important in determining the future of the Ring, the Quest, and the fate of Middle Earth.  Those who could not follow it for 3 hours would indeed be better suited at a movie like A Beautiful Mind.  There is a 2 hour movie that feels like 3 hours, and being as the main character is schizophrenic, you don't have to be overly attentive to appreciate the drama.  Personally, I can't wait for the 4.5 hour director's cut of Fellowship!
3.  ""The dialogue is cheesy; the words are overblown and pretentious.""  This is the one that gets me the most, honestly.  If there was ever a man who knew how to use language, it was Tolkien, as any reader of the books can attest to.  When he wanted it of a higher form than we are used to in daily life, he was going to put it in there.  And the great thing is, 90% of all the dialogue in the movie is right out of the books!  Often it is in a different position, or used in a slightly different way, but most of it is Tolkien's original work.  Those who would see Fellowship in modern english would ruin one of the most beautifully crafted parts of Tolkien's work.  This was a man who was sad at the changes the english language was taking, and worked hard at preserving some of the meaning behind words, and because of this often used english that is somewhat unfamiliar-- but at the same time, amazingly lyrical.
You want a critique of the movie?  Not enough of Tolkien's songs!  But I was glad to see the one that they did put in there.  All in all, a masterpiece.  Hats off to Peter Jackson & Co!",1011571200,7,3661,4.384272997032641
1325898,3,B00003CWT6,"In this Hollywood version of Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's story becomes a loud, cartoonish Hollywood action story, a cinematic heir of the Schwarzenneger and Stallone action films.  The only difference is that instead of having muscular pumped-up action heros this movie has funny-looking people dressed up as elves and hobbits.  All of these films are as subtle as an orc-axe to the head, and as loud as a lava explosion from Mount Doom. This is a film in which good and evil are helpfully color-coded: the good guys are white and appear in bright sunlight riding white steeds, and the bad guys are usually dark, ride black horses, wear ugly warrior uniforms, and appear in dark shadows.
Much of the film feels like a copy of Star Wars, with Frodo taking the Luke Skywalker role and Gandolf taking the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the ring standing in for the Dark Side, and so on. But unlike Star Wars, Shrek, and many other great high-tech films, the Fellowship of the Ring doesn't understand that characterization has to precede special effects. As a result, this Lord of the Rings is empty spectacle that is little more than noisy eye candy.
Lord of the Rings does not create a magical feeling -- too many things look like something you'd pass during a ride at Disneyworld. The special effects cannot measure up to the grand scale that the mind's eye can conjure when reading Tolkien's novels.
There's not enough human interest to make us identify with the quest that is at the center of the film.  And what's going on with that dwarf character, whose hackneyed Scottish looks (red beard, angry eyes, etc.) and accent (could he trill his Rs more without choking?) are like a bad Mike Myers ""Fat Bastard"" imitation?
Even the score to this film is unoriginal, ranging from cliched pseudo-Irish pipe music during pastoral scenes to creepy sounding gothic music blatantly stolen from the Omen for the scenes involving marauding evil creatures.
If you like your entertainment loud, cartoonish, visually assaultive, and full of mayhem, this is your movie. Otherwise, look elsewhere. By the way, this movie probably should have been rated R for its intense violence, so parents beware.",1011571200,2,2178,4.8652291105121295

1325900,5,B00003CWT6,"When I heard the official news that Tolkien's masterpiece was to be made into three films, I was both thrilled and apprehensive. I had always thought the trilogy would make wonderful films if done right, but I've seen other novels get butchered and hacked and finally only used for source material for the director's whims. So, with excitement and trepidation, I went to the opening night, and was completely enthralled. The opening is incredible, explaining the background for non-readers while not boring the faithful. Right away, one sees the scope and breadth of the setting, as well as the director's faithfullness to the source. The cinematography is top-notch, but since it was filmed in New Zealand, it couldn't help but be beautiful. The casting was truly inspired. Each actor chosen seemed born for the role he/she was chosen for. Special notice for Ian McKellan and Elijah Wood. They were sheer poetry. The special effects were award-winning quality, as there weren't many (if any) shots without effects in one way or another. The sets were top-notch, the script tight and well-thought out, and the direction was wonderful. Some parts of the book were, of course, left out, in order to move the story along better, but the film captures the spirit of the book in a way I haven't seen since Gone With The Wind. Some people have commented on how violent the film is, and how it shouldn't have been done that way. I say, read the book if you really want to see how violent it should be. Some scenes were toned down a bit, one or two others left out, while the rest stayed faithful to the same scenes in the book. Only with a strong sense of danger to the companies well-being can a veiwer feel any concern for them. If it was just a jolly holiday to Mt. Doom, what a dull story it would be! I've read the trilogy many times since high school; it's my very favorite book of all time. I was prepared to either love the movie or hate it as sacrilage. Turns out I love the film. I've recommended it to many friends since my first viewing, and I'm looking forward to the film's release on DVD, so I can return to Middle-Earth whenever I want to, which will be often.

  HELLO?!?
How this film could have gotten less than five stars is anyone's guess. All of you crazy people who didn't like the film, please get some professional help.
This is one awe-inspiring production. The sets, the costumes, the casting, and the intensity of the story took my breath away. While I was watching, I don't think I blinked once.
There are some great performances in this movie, but my favorites had to be Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, and Orlando Bloom. The only actor in the entire film who I thought was out of place was Liv Tyler. I suppose they could have chosen a worse actress, (i.e. Mariah Carey), but Tyler's performance as Arwen didn't exactly want to make me stand up and cheer. Also, I thought that Merry and Pippen needed a little more backgrounding, but aside from that, there is NOTHING that I would change. If you haven't seen it, GO.

Aragorn and Leogolas and Gimli were perfect, but the hobbits took some getting used too.
I am so excited that they did all three books/movies at once. I know the producers took a chance on the movie taking off, but now that it has, we all know how happy they are that they did it this way.

1325944,5,B00003CWT6,"The most acclaimed fantasy author in history has finally had his most famous work adapted as a live action feature film. And let the world rejoice.
Though I've never been a fan of J.R.R. Tolkein (I find him to be a poor writer), I've long been a fan of his stories and his world. He is the father of fantasy fiction, and he deserves such credit. Oh how I've longed for a better telling of Tolkein's masterpiece The Lord of the Rings, and now my prayers have finally been answered.
I had heard of the production of the Lord of the Rings trilogy to feature film a long time ago, and like many I was apprehensious at best. Hollywood seems to never, ever be able to faithfully adapt a great liscence to the big screen, and the bigger it is, the more Hollywood gets it wrong. Then there is the fact that in Hollywood, fantasy is only liked by freaks and geeks and so is not worthy of any real attention. Finally the movie was put in the hands of Peter Jackson. Peter who?? The most acclaimed fantasy epic and potentially the greatest fantasy film saga since Star Wars (IV-VI) was put in the hands of a no name?
What can I say that has not already been said? I cannot believe how great this film is. I had expected that having a cast of no-names would only make this movie turn out worse than I expected. Instead I find myself amazed at the sheer genius of the casting. Not only does each actor perfectly fit their role but they each give the best performance of their career.
The only thing I didn't like about the film [initially] was the ending. It doesn't end. But then, it isn't supposed to, and it's Jackson's faithfulness to the books that make it this way. It isn't a result of poor film making but rather my own inpatience that causes me not to like the end, and I suppose I shouldn't even have mentioned it in that case. I must say the second and third time I saw the film I liked it much better and found the ending to be more satisfactory.
I'll spare any synopsis of the film as that would be more than redundant among the other hundreds of reviews. I'll just add to the concensus that this film is not only the best film of the year but also the first part of what will likely be the greatest film saga ever made.",1011398400,8,2220,4.238207547169812

Even if it was three hours long, it was fantastic!

Anyway, i still wanted to see the movie, and i had some idea of what the story was about. So, when i finally saw it, i was blown away. It's, by far, the best movie of the year, and surely one of the best of all time. 3 hours is nothing when you're enjoying a good movie (and i have to say, it's far better than titanic). But, since the opinion of only one man isn't that much, i took my 2 best friends, which had always have different opinions about movies than me, to see what they thought about it. They loved it. They had never heard about tolkien, or had any idea of what the plot was about before they watched it, and still they loved it, sitting on the edge of the seat during the most of it.
You have to consider that this master piece has everything you could want on a movie. Action, love, drama, comedy, and some scares too. Now i'm reading ""The Two Towers"", and i can't wait to see how this amazing crew represents this chapter of the story.

Avoid it at all costs.
I read the trilogy for the first time last fall, partly in anticipation of the movie... If I had seen the movie first, I would NEVER have read the books!  Whoever screenwrote this movie obviously had no appreciation for the story.  Granted, it's a lot of plot to cram into nine hours (Are all three movies this long?), but they could have done a much better job.  The characters were believable and well-portrayed, but it ends there.  It moved far too slowly over uneventful and unimportant areas, and far too quickly at the most important and pivotal points.  Many subplots were cut out entirely, and new material was added that is NOT faithful to the novel.
I admit, the fight scenes and the CG were stunning, and very well done, but the rest of the movie was pathetic.  At any moment, I expected Celine Dion to start singing the Titanic theme song, which would have made me instantly vomit.  Actually, I saw this movie with my family, and both my parents fell asleep about 2/3 of the way through out of sheer boredom.

The young boy hero is depicted at the beginning of the show enjoying life as any one would in his home village. Then a life responsibility is thrust upon him forcing him to journey away from home into the unknown with some of his older wiser and younger more valiant friends, both of whom drop away just as in real life.
So with only one pal left, he is forced to make decisions that sometimes lead him to close brushs with Heaven and with Hell. The viewer sees this but is not told the actual analogy so must perceive how the film relates to real life. This is a five star film if the viewer has the intellectual insight to understand its true philosophical message but for the viewer who is looking for a 2 hour comedy or tragedy, this film could be meaningless. A naive child would enjoy it more for its special effects than a non visionary adult would enjoy it anecdotally.

Being a Tolkien fanatic, a New Zealander, and a huge fan of all of Peter Jackson's movies my expectations for this movie could not have been higher. I was actually very nervous about seeing this movie, as I've been let down so many times with movies that promised a lot, but delivered badly (eg. Phantom Menace, Planet of the Apes, etc.).
One word sums up my experience of this movie - ENTHRALLING! Like many reviews here, from the opening scene right through to the final credits time disappeared as I immersed myself into the world of Middle Earth.
The characterisations were perfect, particularly Ian McKellen who stole the show, and Elijah was brilliant as Frodo. I also loved Chistopher Lee as Saruman.
The scenery was awesome and immediately made me homesick for New Zealand though I'm not sure where those statues are!
I agree 100% to all the changes that Peter made to the book. You just have to accept that a book is not a movie, and in 3 hours you can only show so much. Also, the movie definitely needed an increased role for women and the scenes with Arwen were great. The problem I had with Harry Potter was that it stuck too religiously to the book which killed the overall momentum of the movie - NO such problem with LOTR.
From my perspective, it can only get better from here on out, as the Fellowship is probably the slowest part of the book, so the next 2 installments should be mindblowing (can't wait for Helms Deep!).
If you are a Tolkien Fanatic (like me), be prepared to accept that a movie just HAS TO be different from the book. If you have not ready LOTR, then I would recommend you read FOTR BEFORE you see the movie as it will substantially improve the experience.",1011312000,5,1776,4.535825545171339
1325984,5,B00003CWT6,"Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring is matched very closely by this movie. The history is given, and provides strong background, drawn from the sources in the books, including The Silmarillion and the Hobbit.
The intensity of the chase, the draw of the ring are duplicated very closely, though not identically to those in Tolkein's work. The movie proceeds more or less sequentially, which was not necessarily true of the books.
The acting was very good, and one can feel the emotions of the players. I must admit that the elves did not seem as otherworldly beautiful as the book describes, though I find that each person's definition of beauty is different. Also the character of Sam Gamgee is a bit more serious and the characters of Merry and Pippin are more humorous and have less depth, but that too can be expected due to time constraints in the movie.
I was somewhat disappointed in the escape scene across the ford, to Rivendale because of the lack of effective resistance in Frodo, but this is a personal perspective and does not detract from the story. I also wish some indication of time, the 17 years between the departure of Bilbo and the the departure of Frodo had been more evident. The scenes in which Frodo wears the ring or seems in the world of the ring wraiths were very interesting though and added a certain depth that I quite enjoyed.
Boromir's character showed the range of the character of Man, from treachery to nobility, and was well played. I look forward to the Two Towers, and further development of the characters of Legalos, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, Sam and Aragorn.
The movie did drag in some places, but so does the book.
Overall the movie was very good, and I would recommend it to all, though it may be a bit intense for younger viewers.",1011312000,,1771,4.643312101910828
1325985,5,B00003CWT6,"I have seen this movie twice, and am planning a third viewing (and I've only ever seen three movies in the theater twice before in my life).  But I feel that it's pressing to address some of the complaints people have with it.
1.) the length:  Sorry, there's nothing to do about it.  Tolkein wrote well over 1000 pages of story, leading to another thousand's worth of ""history,"" (people write encyclopediae on Middle-Earth and still barely begin to touch it) and even with huge editing it still makes for a long story.
2.) repetive shots/slow motion: these I'll grant also.  The ring-in-palm shots got a bit weary during my second viewing.  But they can still convey the necessary drama.  As for slow motion... also a bit overdone, in battles, but every time the movie starts it (except for Frod's leap onto the ferry), I'm so drawn into the battle that I don't notice or care unless I purposefully detach myself.  And as for the repetition of Frodo getting beaten up/nearly killed/whatnot, well, Tolkein wrote it that way too.
3.) Changes from the book: I vote that nearly all of them were necessary, and a lengthy debate on the merits of their placement or removal can be carried on elsewhere.  Book and Film are two entirely separate media, and I think this movie is as good an adaptation of a literary epic as can be put together.
4.) Character development: again, there's only so much you can do with what you're given.  Merry, Pippin, Legolas, and Gimli--fascinating characters, all--don't get to come into their own in the first book, and therefore neither in the first movie.  Look for drastic improvements in all four (I hope!) in the next two films.  Also for Aragorn (Strider), and Boromir, via his family.
Now, as for the merits of the film: they are beautiful and numerous, whether or not you've ever laid a hand on one of J.R.R. Tolkein's books.  Of the 5 non-me people with whom I have seen the movie so far, two had read the books, one was planning to, and two showed no interest (and, for that matter, both have very low tolerances for fantasy).  And, except for having to go to the bathroom during the third hour, and the occasional rump falling asleep, all 5 loved it and will go with me to the opening screening of ""The Two Towers"" in a year.  And knowing that you're only seeing the first third of the story, it seems to me that expecting everything to be told in this movie is a bit short-sighted.  There are, after all, six hours of story left to come.  As for me?  Yes, I had read the books before.  Twice, actually: once, several years ago, and I didn't get it, and ocne this summer, in preparation for the movie, and I still didn't get it.  I thought they were good, but not the Epic Masterpiece people made them out to be.
After I saw the movie?  I ran right home and broke them out.  I read hem all again, and now I'm heading out to buy the other Tolkein books about Middle-Earth, ""The Silmarillion"" and the ""Unfinished Tales"" among them, even though I know they're impossible to read, because suddenly I realise the story is JUST THAT GOOD, even if the telling is occasionally difficult.  I've listened to the soundtrack nearly every day since I bought it, which was December 20, the day after the movie opened.  I'm suddenly half-obsessive about something I could barely force myself to try to like before.  The telling, from book to movie, will differ, and the interpretations among viewers and readers, but no matter what, the story is one worth hearing.",1011225600,,3486,4.576489533011272

I couldn't believe when a friend refused to see it because
of a chaste kiss in the trailer! No kissing in the book, meant
NO kissing in the movie. Another friend expressed a low interest
in seeing this film because they had refused to read the books
in the 60's. I was just a stupid kid in the 60's and fell for
the books, hook - line - and sinker.
  Was 20 minutes late to my first viewing. Got right into
the journey of Frodo to Rivendell. I was struck by how closely
they nailed the scenery and the very timbre of the dialogue
amongst the characters. Still, I held the movie up to the
book each time a scene smacked as differant from the book.
I couldn't help it. Had just reread all 4 books in the past
2 months.

by myself. The first time, I screamed out loud at the
scary parts and rocked in my seat in the fetal position
much of the time. I thought I'd be uncomfortable doing
this alone. Even though I tried to control myself, I still
flinched and sqeaked when appropriate.

bad dreams and am afraid to walk the house in the dark.

as fast as my feet could carry me to the theater. And I can only
describe this spectacular performance in one word....enchanting.
The Black riders'(Nazgul) look is ever-gothic,the special effects were outstanding,the acting was good and I adore Peter Jackson's transformation from a fantasy drama to an action-packed
sword and sorcery epic yet still delivering full justice to Tolkien's classic,for if he didn't change it,audiences would be bored of it's many speeches and lectures(which most people don't find entertaining in a movie).He also changed some of the characters' personalities making them much more interesting eg. Arwen Evenstar,Lady of Rivendell. So why did I give it only four stars it's simply because the way I visualized Middle-Earth isn't how Jackson displayed it. First of all,his hobbits(halflings/perian) look
exactly like men save their hairy feet whilst Tolkien describes them as children grown old. Second,the background is supposed to look more mystical(especially Rivendell)eg.starry skies and silver moons add more magic to the movie. And last,I was disappointed that they didn't include any Blind Guardian whose songs have been dedicated to Middle-Earth. Although it's still a breath-taking movie which will awestruck you with it's enchantment.",1011225600,,1533,5.365145228215767
1326039,5,B00003CWT6,"i'm in pain and i'm dying... i'm bloody angry with peter jackson. ... why, oh why must i wait for another 339 days (approx) for the second installment? why do i have to endure this ... burden? god... that's how good the movie is.
i'm not saying that the movie is *perfect*, but i have to salute jackson for doing his best in compressing that giant of a book and actually manage to tell the events that took place in ""the fellowship of the ring"" in three hours. in all fairness, although i can't say that i truly appreciate all of the ""artistic licence"" that he took to make the story... er... more exiting, i understand why he have to do them. honestly, it makes the film more coherent for those who haven't read the book.
i was sceptical at first when they announced that elijah wood was chosen for the role of frodo baggins... i expected someone older, since frodo actually started the journey when he's 50. in some sense i feel that by having a younger frodo going on this journey makes it a bit lacking... however, i have to say that elijah wood did play the character with vigor and emotion.
i find the addition of arwen as distracting ... i know that they are angling for a romance thingie to supposedly *reel* in the female audience but i find that *very* patronizing. firstly, if somebody wants to see a romance/love story, they bloody well could do better than see LOTR! the time constraint itself should have made them think twice before putting in unnecessary scenes. in the end, the ones who thought they were gonna get something like titanic will end up feeling frustated AND those who revere the books will feel a 'lil bit disappointed by the whole thing! jackson just didn't have enough time... and i think there's a reason why tolkien didn't put in much story on arwen's and aragorn's romance: it is NOT the main plot... the most important elements in this tale is of courage, friendship and the battle between good and evil... it just happened that in the end, the ""solution"" to the long romance between aragorn and arwen happens at the end of LORT.
i've heard a lot of ppl complain about galadriel. yes, that includes me. i really, really like cate blanchett and i think she's one of the best actress around, but her protayal of the elf queen fall flat. galadriel was supposed to be very beautiful and wise (unlike arwen's youthful beauty) coz elves are supposed to grow more beautiful as they live longer... not cold and scary! she is someone that is beyond reproach, certainly not one who induces fear in people! a friend of mine even thought that she is one of the bad guys! i actually like her character more compared to arwen and it makes me sad that her character was treated with such callousness. peter jackson made galadriel out of character when compared to other elves that is on the good side.
*SPOILER*
and what's up with the waxen ghost look she sported when she showed frodo the mirror of galadriel? like, hello... she should be *beautiful* and *horrible* at the same time? that her subjects will love and despair over her? jackson got the horrible part all right... *END OF SPOILER*
another thing that i need to mention... the movie did not show how TRULY evil the ring is... in the whole movie, we see that frodo readily and willingly give away the ring. but the truth is, the moment a bearer have the ring , it ing will slowly subvert and poison the holder's mind and make itself soo precious to him that the holder will never willingly part with it. my friend said in passing that jackson makes it seem so easy for frodo, as if he is immune to the ring's power and i think that is one of the bad side of the movie in bringing forth tolkien's vision.
the good points? well... the amazing set for one. i simply, simply, *simply* love moria! what an amazing place... the nazguls are creepily realistic... the music, the battles... god, it's all perfect! and i think the character legolas is very well portrayed by orlando bloom... or that might be my hormones talking! ;-p
but honestly though, i think both gandalf and boromir are  excellent. there is absolutely nobody else that could be gandalf! i mean.. he IS gandalf!! and god, sean bean is great! i like his boromir better than in the book... when he said that he lived to long without hope, you could see his expression and... it just blew my mind. excellent, excellent work. and it's all so sad...
so... basically that is more or less some of the pros and cons of the movie.. although i have to say that there aren't many cons in it! even if you are not an avid fantasy fan, please make an exception to this movie. it's excellent, and i must say much better than the newer installments of star wars...",1011139200,,4692,4.494145199063232

1) I notice that most of these people have not read the books. Now although I feel you didn't have to read the books to love the movie, I understand that that may play a factor - I beg you to read the books, and then pass judgement again
2) Also for those who have not read the books: Do you realize how incredibly idiotic you sound saying ""Wow, I didn't like the ending, it was like a book with its ending missing"" This is not supposed to be the end, it's supposed to be a CLIFFHANGER. There are TWO MORE MOVIES. If you didn't know that walking in, did you like JUST hear about LOTR or what?!
3) For those who have read the books: I know that I, too, would have liked them to include every last little detail, but you CAN. NOT. Pick about every. single. last. little. thing. The movie would be a week long. Who cares if Frodo doesn't cross the bridge alone? Why does it matter that Arwen gets a bigger part? The only difference that makes is more cash in Liv Tyler's pocket, and less in everyone else's. Personally, I thought Frodo's faster illness under the wound of the sword made the evil seem more real, and it didn't matter that Arwen had to ride him across the river. Tom Bombadill was not the most pivital and moving character in the book, nor does he have incredible impact upon being taken out.

1326044,4,B00003CWT6,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is grandly photographed, stays as true as it reasonably can to the book, and is deliciously presented... but I was bored with some parts.
... I felt as if so many or the fight scenes were re-runs of the previous fight scene, like a video game waiting to happen. Different bad guys, different location, but same battle.
I wanted to like this more. The scenes were beautiful... sumptuous, but I had trouble getting past the fight scenses. They seemed unnecessarily violent, and didn't display the wizardry I expected from Gandalf.
However, I do recommend ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."" It brings home classic storytelling, and archetypal adventure. I plan to see the other two installments, and I'd love to see more about Bilbo Baggins'. Great character.

It would have been nice if the band with Frodo showed some intelligent planning to achieve their objective.

I didn't notice any variances to the book, all important scenes were included, and the personalities of the characters were preserved remarkably well. My only problem with the movie is having to wait two more years to see the next two parts!
I highly recommend this movie to anyone familiar with Tolkien's trilogy, ""The Lord of the Rings."" Whether you are a huge fan or simply enjoyed reading the trilogy, the movie will be worthwhile. If you are not familiar at all with the book, I would not recommend seeing the movie, since it has no conclusion (it's only the first of three installments).

I went to see it with my wife (who has not read the book) on a Monday morning and had the theatre completely to ourselves.  I'm glad I waited.  It was like watching it in my living room.  (or maybe Michael Jackson's living room.)
It's hard to describe the impact this film had on us.  It was literally breathtaking.  It took me almost all day to get the lumps out of my throat.  Not that it was a tearful movie, it was just that emotional to behold.  To see Tolkien's vision so diligently produced for the screen was well above any expectations we had.
Bare in mind that this movie is quite different that the book.  There are numerous characters dropped and scenes that were significantly modified from the original.  However, I think it's safe to say that the screenplay was written with the understanding that some things would have to left out or modified.  The thing is that they never took away from the core storyline.  As long as that is in tact, we are in good shape.
The great thing about the movie is that (I hope) it will encourage many more people to read these novels.  If just one person picks up the books after seeing the movie, then I think Peter Jackson has done the job he was tasked to do.

Frodoe should have crossed the river alone, and it was the magic of Elron the brought the water against the Black riders. The Relationship between Strider and the Lady Aeowyn does not come until much later, and I don't see how it's addition does much for the movie other than putting an actor to work.

 It is true that the action was emphasized in the film over the poetic pathos of the book; but to SPECTACULAR effect! The movie was gripping, and visually stunning! The influence of the famous artwork by the Brothers Hildebrant was prevelent throughout. This is artwork that I remember seeing and being influenced by as a teenager. There were some subplots that were not approached; but I'm sure it was done so as not to confuse or interupt the natural flow of the movies story.

While Peter Jackson wasn't quite true to the plot (which couldn't really be helped), he was in all ways true to the spirit and the themes of JRR Tolkien's masterpiece, which is what really matters.
The best Special effects I've ever seen (in that I wasn't sure I was seeing them if you get my drift!) combined with wonderful cinematography, casting, acting and soundtrack, make this an awesome movie in its own right.
The performance from Sir Ian MacKellan (Gandalf) was brilliant, he truly was Gandalf to the life. Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond) stood out in much the same way, but even the actors I haven't mentioned were perfectly cast.
Perhaps the biggest star of all though was New Zealand. If Middle Earth exists in this world, New Zealand is it!
I'd like to give special mention to the Second Age battle sequence, which blew my mind from the beginning... the feeling of butterflies in ones stomach wasn't a thing I'd expect at the movies, an effect which is lost on the small screen.
After six viewings (four in cinemas, once on VHS, once on DVD) this movie is still amongst the best I've ever seen. Peter Jackson has made history... and I feel privileged to have witnessed it.",1010880000,,1367,4.7478991596638656

We had very high expectations for Jackson's effort and we're afraid we might be disappointed.  We were not disappointed and loved every minute of it.

1326127,5,B00003CWT6,"THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was truly an amazing film. One thing that I thought the filmmakers did right was that they did not try to cram all three books into one long movie. Instead, they filmed THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, THE TWO TOWERS, and THE RETURN OF THE KING separately. Also, they did not try to release all three films at once; they spred out the release of each part.
Now, back to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I've read all three novels, and I have to say that they left out some major parts of the book in TFOTR. Of course, I knew that if they tried to film the whole book, then it would have been way too long (probably over five hours or so!), so I guess they wanted to narrow down the timing of the film. Still, TFOTR was absolutely stunning! Even if you have read the books and know what happens, it is still a pleasure to see.
There are many visual computerized special effects in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and they are all simply breathtaking! Hollywood keeps getting better and better with special effects each year, thanks to the technology of computers. If they tried to make this into a movie 20 or so years ago, it never would have turned out to be as successful or as brilliant! The entire cast so far, does incredibly well. They are all superb and flawless. Some of those acting highlights to watch for include Elijah Wood (""Frodo Baggins""), Sean Astin (""Sam Gamgee""), Ian McKellen (""Gandalf""), and Viggo Mortensen (""Strider"").
THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is not just a movie, but it's a life experience. The script is solidly written. The movie starts out a little slow, but once they go off on the journey to destroy the Ring, the film starts to pick up and it doesn't seem as slow.
I already cannot wait for THE TWO TOWERS and THE RETURN OF THE KING. I am highly anticipating the await for those films! Also, I think THE LORD OF THE RINGS will turn out to be a great DVD, when it is time for a DVD release. Think of all the special features they could add to this trilogy!

1326128,5,B00003CWT6,"In 1977 George Lucas changed the entertainment industry forever when STAR WARS became the biggest movie of all time. That film not only altered the way films are made, but it also changed how films are marketed and even altered the very way we watch movies. What many people do not know is that STAR WARS was almost never made. Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS for the big screen. He abandoned the project (partially because of legal issues) before starting STAR WARS.
Nearly 25 years later, Tolkien's masterpiece has finally been transformed into a motion picture. The mastermind behind this colossal undertaking is Peter Jackson, an almost unknown filmmaker best known for a couple of horror movies and the indie flick, HEAVENLY CREATURES. Jackson is amazing. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is filmmaking at its finest; Jackson does everything right that most action directors do wrong.
Granted he had a talented cast to assist him. Ian McKellen is perfect as Gandalf; Elijah Wood has just enough innocence and world-weariness to capture the essence of Frodo Baggins; Viggo Morensen personifies the nobility of the exiled king Aragorn; and John Rhys-Davies is a treat as Gimli the dwarf. Most of the other performances are just as moving.
THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is filled with fantastic places and wonderful creatures. But thes do not a good movie make. Other directors have had films with similar settings and characters and have failed. Jackson has succeeded because he has remained true to the heart of Tolkien. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is much more than just a tale of a motley crew traveling together to a destiny unseen. It is a tale of friendship. It is about life and how to be a better person. It is a story of how the most unlikely individuals can become heroes. It is a tale of truth defying falsity; of redemption and salvation; of good triumphing over evil. In the troubled times in which we live, we need stories like THE LORD OF THE RINGS. They remind us of the nobility in all of us. Movies don't get much better than that.",1010880000,5,2074,4.747922437673131

In my opinion, Jackson is a visionary director who can rival Cameron any day. Anyone brave enough to film three of the most read books in all time, at the same time, is not only insane, but insanely brilliant.
Of course it helps to have a magical cast to make the load bearable. Ian McKellen portrays his ""Gandalf"" with such intensity that you get goosebumps every time he opens his mouth to speak. Elijah Wood also entertains with his innocent ""Frodo"", giving it credibility with those blue eyes of his. But one of the greatest treasures is Viggo Mortensen, the dark & ruggedly handsome Aragorn. I last saw him in ""28 Days"" and with ""The Fellowship"" he once again amazed me with the intensity with which he acts.
Of course I have read the books and I can thankfully report that they followed it as closely as I have ever experienced the act. Yes, they left a few pieces out here and there, but think: the movie is nearly 3 hours all ready. If they had included everything, we might be stuck to our seats at the end. Still, Jackson and his wife did a remarkable job of adapting the books into script and the actors do Tolkien proud.
This is a definite must-see. If not, you'll never know what the whole ""Hype"" is about",1010880000,3,1410,4.426923076923077
1326200,4,B00003CWT6,"Clearly, the look and feel of Jackson's Fellowship is right on.  The faithful rendering and visual ""rightness"" of The Shire, Moria, the Company, and the Orcs was much better than I had hoped for. There were a few quibbles here and there, but they were minor. The quibbles were distractions that will probably melt away on subsequent viewings. For example, the Hobbits should have been a bit more plump and their feet should have been smaller. I was particularly appreciative of Jackson's interpretation of Frodo's transformation when he wore the Ring. The sense of mystery and power was very strong.  This is an instance where Jackson was better than Tolkien.
Unfortunately, the the filmmaker opens himself to criticism when it comes to his rendering of the tale itself. I understand that time was a reason for eliminating some events and characters (Tom Bombadil, Barrow-Downs, Barliman Butterbur, and Bill Ferny). I might be saddened by their abscense, but I understand.  I am having a harder time with the changes in substance.  A few instances - When Frodo encountered the Black Riders at Weathertop he was not a shrinking violet. In fact, his wound was the result of his courage and the defense of his kinsmen.  At the crossing of the Ford it wasn't necessary to be PC and have a female elf ride to the rescue, to me having a horse (Asfaloth) save Fordo was Tolien's choice. The connection between the charcters of Middle Earth and the animals is a central and important theme. The Council of Elrond was particularly disappointing.  If you have read the book I shouldn't need to explain.  The final scenes, when the Fellowship was broken, were disappointing as well. We didn't see that (once again) Samwise is smarter than he or anyone else gives him credit for. In the book, he uses his head to figure out Frodo's design.  It wasn't some happy accident.  Lastly, Boromir's last battle was his alone.  Strider was too late.  Boromir's courage and remorse at the last were his redemption. In the book we are able to glimpse Strider's less than super-human reality.  He doesn't always come to the rescue and he can be indecisive.
Two parting comments - Strider needs sword-play lessons!  In real life he'd have been cut to shreds if he exposed himself as he did in the film.  Voice-over during the travel scenes would have been a great way to communicate the history underlying the events and characters.",1010793600,3,2407,4.824817518248175

I have never read the book or even heard of the word hobbit, all I knew was that I would go because I'm a movie fanatic,the special effects look awsome,and my dad would probaly croak if I asked to see Harry Potter one more time. The special effects were amazing I'll never know how they made the hobbits look so small, but the cast went along great with acting along how small Frodo was suppose to be. The movie may be 3 hours long but it's worth the time. Everyone is so convincing in their roles, Gandalf acts like a real wizard, Merry and Pippin are as troublesome as can be, Sam is as loyal to Frodo as Possiable, and Frodo couldn't be played any sweeter. The movie may be a bit scary at some points and violent a bit also but that's all part of the fun. I can tell you that I even cried at some parts and I'm not one to cry. I'm telling everyone I know to go see this movie. I havn't even read any of the books yet and I'm not going to because I want a suprise when the next movie is released.

I think Peter Jackson did a superb job at making the characters real; You can really connect with them in a personal way.

1326256,5,B00003CWT6,"THE LORD OF THE RINGS: ""THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING"" is an epic struggle if you will.  Relying on 190 million dollars for all three films, with each film rounding at three hours, wouldn't it get a little tight to fit it all into the budget?  Having a lower-than-average cast, a director never even attempting a major blockbuster before, and being based on a very popular book where expectations skyrocket- wouldn't audiences share enough gratitude even if they hadn't seen the film firsthand?  ""RINGS"" is an astonishing, ground-breaking surprise.
THE LORD OF THE RINGS opens with a fearsome, monstrous battle, introducing the ring and the past behind it.  The epic lifts off immediately with sword-and-sorcery action, and obviously- magnificent special effects.  We are then introduced to the hobbit, Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, and Ian Holm.  When Frodo (Wood) accepts the ring from his Uncle Bilbo (Holm), the fearful and epic journey begins, bringing you into the most magnificent world ever visualized.  Creatures and demons await them at every turn.  The group of nine struggle to reach Mordor, where the ring must be destroyed.
This film is the best fantasy film of all time.  I have to say that.  Bigger than ""Star Wars"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"", this renown and triumphant vision of the classic story is power packed with stylized fun and adventure to rock your mind.  I literally was on the edge of my seat.  The film is honestly that good.  It is probably the best film of the year.  ""RINGS"" is obviously off to a magnificent start, and I cannot wait for THE TWO TOWERS to come out.  This film is too good.  Everything is perfect.  It is so good, you don't even realize you're in the theater for three hours.  The scenery is the best.  The action and special effects follow.  Continuing the promising film is obviously the wonderously powerful story, and the powerhouse performances that sizzle on the stove.
What created the biggest craving for my mind when watching the film, was its ending.  I completely forgot that there really can't be a conclusion because the two sequels follow.  The film just kind of ends, which kind of left me in a state of wonder.  The thirst for more is left with me.  ""RINGS"" doesn't allow you any guess into the next adventure, which builds a lot more anticipation.  The dramatic scope of its sincerity and promise of near-perfection fills the glass immediately with this first installment.  There isn't a shred of doubt in my mind that the next two pictures will rise and be as glorious as this first film.  Whatever level or scale of genre you're looking for with this film, you have it.  The film is an instant classic.  I loved every glorified minute of it.  The action and emotion is there.  I've never read the book, and I don't think I'll want to.  For the first time, my fear is that the book may undergo the film.  Fantasy takes its toll being the biggest and best ever, and THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a promising treat to being superior to its word, and absolutely (and perfectly) satisfying to the entire audience.
QUOTE: ""THE LORD OF THE RINGS is excellent, one of the best of the year.  Everything is perfect.  Nothing falls short, or sinks below expectations.  Action, adventure, visual effects, amazing performances, magnificent 'story-to-film' transformation, and emotion rule the screen.  Topping STAR WARS and THE WIZARD OF OZ, ""RINGS"" is the best fantasy film of all time.  I have no doubt that the sequels will be as disarming and powerful as this film.  Renowned, rewarded, and revolutionized, THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a brilliant adventure-drama that left me in a state of awe!  My anticipation and excitment grows, awaiting the next film to come in December.""",1010707200,3,3718,4.775510204081633
1326257,5,B00003CWT6,"Many people have already hit on the virtues of this movie, so I won't repeat them.  Instead, I'll address the few critics who have posted here.  The extreme minority that didn't like this film seemed to have three main complaints:
1.  The movie doesn't stand alone-  Okay, granted. But it was never meant to.  If this had been made for TV, it would have been a miniseries.  For the first time, a director has taken the miniseries format to the big screen.  After seeing the attempt to condense this tale into two movies during the late 70's, I can understand why he avoided going that route.
2.  The movie is violent, and is just one battle after another-  Sure, but so was Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, and a host of other great films.  The only possible reason I can think of that people have this reaction is that they had a different perception of the story before watching it.  Many seemed to think this was a kids movie, apparently because they seemed to think that fantasy=kids.  Let's be clear, this is a beautiful story of friendship and triumph, but it is not for young children.
3.  ""The characters were flat"" or ""there was no emotion""-  This I can't explain, unless people who felt this way just simply couldn't relate to characters in a fantasy setting.  I have seen this movie 3 times now, and every time the people I am with, and those all around us, are in tears by the end of the movie.  How can you not be moved by Gandalf's love for the Shire and the Hobbits? Or Boromir's anquish over the fate awaiting his people in Gondor, or his courage at the end of the movie?  Or Sam's unwavering loyalty and devotion to Frodo? Or Frodo's courage when he offers to take the ring to Mordor?  Or Bilbo's breakdown when he realizes what Frodo must face because of him?  Or Merry and Pippin's courage when they drew the Orcs away from Frodo?  I could go on forever.  The point is, there is more depth of character here than I have ever seen in a movie.  The difficulty for some, I think, is understanding that just because the characters are wizards, hobbits, and elves...they are also all very human.
My advice to anyone is:  Go see the movie. At the worst, you are out 8 bucks and 3 hours.  At the best, you will be treated to one of the most beautiful stories ever made.",1010707200,5,2280,4.386634844868735
1326258,5,B00003CWT6,"The last few years have been a dark age for motion pictures.  I like art-house and independent flicks, but I'm shallow enough to admit I love a good, old-fashioned multi-million dollar spectacle.  Hollywood has spent the money over the past few years, but without any of the quality or genius required to make a movie great.
All that changed with Fellowship of the Ring.  With a modest budget (still the GNP of a small country) Peter Jackson has made one of the most incredible, perhaps THE most incredible movie I have ever seen.  This movie is so incredible in fact, that it makes me curse all of the mediocre ones I've tolerated over the past few years and despise all the really crappy ones.
Granted, I did read the books, but I've always thought the books had some problems.  Yes I know, I speak sacrelige, but the books get bogged down in exposition and backstory and page after page of tedious poetry and songs and some of the characters seem out of place or inconsistent.  Overall it's one of the greatest works of the 20th century, but it was difficult for me to get into because of the pacing.
As if answering my prayers, Jackson has completely ommitted all of the things I considered tedious and has given us the story itself, free of warts, and with such remarkable skill and power that I sat like a little kid through all three hours, then wanted to see it again.  I can't remember loving a movie, truly LOVING it, like this one since Star Wars.  I told a friend it was the unexpected Star Wars experience of my adult life.  Jackson has captured each character flawlessly and with all the grace and respect they deserve.  His eye and attention for detail shows a true respect for the work.  All of the ommitted details and scenes shows that Jackson knows what is truly essential to the tale... and what is not.
Don't be fooled.  This is not a three hour SFX extravaganza.  It's a story of hope, courage, loyalty and honor like none that have come before.  SFX will get you the quick buck, but it's those other things that will make this movie timeless.  It's almost too much to hope that all three movies will be this incredible, but after all the crap we, the paying audience, have been shelled with over the years, we deserve something this good.",1010707200,5,2261,4.507352941176471
1326259,2,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings, though not nearly one of my personal favourites, is certainly one of the most important English language books of the twentieth century.  It was a great shame to see that Peter Jackson's film version missed the soul of the novel and failed to convey Tolkien's rich fantasy world of Middle Earth.  For anyone who has read the books, the film version comes across as a pale and bare bones translation - omitting some of the very best parts, and getting most of the book's atmosphere completely wrong.  For instance, in the scene where Frodo becomes aware that Gollum is following the fellowship we actually see Gollum.  In the book, Gollum is merely hinted at by the sound of his bare feet slapping on the cold stone floor.  The Ring Wraiths, though quite good in the film, are not nearly close to the pathetic, blind, sniffing creatures twisted by evil that they are in the novel.  To highlight all of the discrepencies between book and film would be both time consuming and pointless.  Suffice it to say, however, that in omitting or changing so much of the book, Peter Jackson has failed to capture the true atmosphere of Middle Earth.  His film seems more like any other Dungeons and Dragons world than Tolkien's fully realised one.
  The usage of CGI was far too frequent and noticeable.  The sweeping, blurred, battlescene at the start of the film hardly compares to other film's battlescenes (such as Ran, Kagemusha, Waterloo, and so on) where no computer enhanced imagery was used.  There were also some laughably inept moments of CGI (watch for the lack of orc bodies after the fellowship escape the Dwarf's tomb, and then the hilarious shot of the party running along without their upper bodies moving.  The effects standard here made me think of a Playstation game's graphics).
  On the plus side, the film was fairly well cast.  The inclusion of Sean Bean and the legendary Christopher Lee added a lot of class to the film.  Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn was also quite good, though Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett seemed to be wasted as Elrond and Galadriel.  Legalos and Gimli also had next to nothing to do other than prattle or prance on like Dwarven and Elven cliches.
  It seems a shame that Jackson's hamfisted direction, and the ever present (and thoroughly mediocre) soundtrack squandered an excellent opportunity for a classic film.  Though entertaining, the film never reached the heights that it should have.  See the Ralph Bakshi animated version instead.",1010707200,2,2494,4.8325471698113205
1326260,2,B00003CWT6,"I went and saw this movie twice. The second time was to give
this film a second chance. This is supposed to be the greatest
fantasy story ever told, but after watching this thing twice I
have come to the conclusion that J.R.R. TOLKIEN's stories are
overrated. The reviewers who have claimed this the ""Greatest
movie ever made"" were obviously ""smoking weed"" when they saw this
movie. Peter Jackson needs to go back to film school and learn
about character developement, which there was little of in this
film. Jackson also overrelied on CGI ,when old-fashioned special
effects would have looked more realistic. The music score was okay, but was too repetitive. People have been raving about how
this film is such a great fantasy adventure. I found it to be a
cross between a halloween horror flick and a computer video game.
If you really want to see an original, true fantasy film, go buy
a copy of THE DARK CRYSTAL. That movie took you into a realistic
fantasy world with an excellent story. It was made 20 years ago,

1326261,5,B00003CWT6,"'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is the greatest movie I have EVER seen! It was so unbelievably well done, that I went back to the theaters to see it a total of four times. Each time, I was equally as excited as I was the first time I saw the movie. Every about it is wonderful! All of the actors do a brilliant job, not a single one lags. The sets and locations are breathtaking to see. The plot and characters are to DIE for (cute, too!)! I just can't get enough of it! Don't let the almost three hour time limit deter you, for there isn't a single break in the flow of the story. You don't notice that so much time is passing because you become so drawn into the world of Middle-Earth. I have read the book as well and though certain things here and there are a bit different in the movie, the spirit is intact as well as the storyline. Peter Jackson and his team did a fabulous job bringing such a beloved story to the big screen. It's beautiful, intelligent, encompassing...and, well, the GREATEST movie I have EVER seen!!!",1010620800,,1047,4.24
1326262,5,B00003CWT6,"A spectacular triumph
I waited so long for this movie to come out, that getting closer to the day, I started to fear that I had built it up into something that consummation could not possibly fulfill. But when I finally saw it, my fears were allayed once and for all.
This adaptation is not quite flawless, but there are so many exquisite things about this film, they more than make up for distracting omissions. The depiction of the Shire is wonderful, and the interaction between the main characters truly heart-warming. In my opinion the best acting job (which is saying a lot in this superbly-acted film) is by Ian Holm as Bilbo. And I refuse to believe that Ian McKellen is in this film. Clearly, they somehow got Gandalf to play the role of Gandalf.
The flight from the Shire and the subsequent trek to Rivendell end up painfully abbreviated; particularly as Merry and Pippin are depicted as just bumping into Frodo and Sam quite by chance, whereas in the book it's clear that they know what he's up to and their joining of the company is premeditated. But this I can chalk up as a necessary evil; they do, after all, have to get to the good stuff. I can't believe so many people are even mentioning Tom Bombadil in their review of this film. Did you honestly feel his absence? Sure, he's a fun subplot in the book, but there's no way to make him work cinematically. There seems to be a time problem right around the escape from the Shire, too: clearly not as much time as in the book has elapsed between Gandalf's exit and the hobbits' escape, but there seems to be an internal inconsistency in the seeming simultaneity of Gandalf's and the hobbits' leave of the Shire and all the extensive traveling Gandalf obviously has to do before meeting up with them again at Rivendell. Ah, well.
I must confess I was a trifle disappointed in Aragorn; low-key is certainly apropos, but Viggo Mortensen just seems to deadpan a few too many lines. The visual creativity in portraying Frodo's visions when he puts on the ring; i.e. at the Prancing Pony and at Weathertop are fantastic; one of the things that really makes this film and gives it is haunting sense of danger and threatening evil. I believe PJ & co. couldn't have done any better than they did with the character of Arwen. In the book she scarcely appears, and it's completely logical for them to conflate her role with that of Glorfindel. A single movie can only have so many characters, after all. Since Aragorn ends up marrying her at the end of the saga (sorry for the spoiler for all you uninitiated), you obviously have to see more of her than the book has. Liv Tyler's portrayal is enchanting and lithe, and Elvish just sounds like so much sweet milk on her lips.
If you think about it, it's obvious that portraying Saruman explicitly instead of implied as the book does is cinematically absolutely necessary. From Gandalf's recounting at the Council of Elrond in the book, you find out what happened, but I think it's just as well to show it as part of the narrative instead of in flashback. I think it worked quite well. One thing that felt sorely missing was the re-forging of Narsil-they don't even mention it! It is, after all, a crucial thematic element. I wonder if they'll reveal it later down the road somehow.
Sean Bean's Boromir is excellent, as is John Rhys-Davies' Gimli. I just love Gimli. He's just happy as long as there are orc-necks to hew. The action scenes are phenomenal; like the special effects, truly unlike anything I've ever seen before. Visceral, kinetic, and with a palpable sense of peril, they speak of Peter Jackson's filmmaking talents like so many other aspects of this movie. The cave troll, wow! Then the Balrog, HOLY MACKEREL!
Like so many others have already said, the real sense of emotion and passion is one of the things that really drives this movie, maybe even *the* thing. The filmmaking techniques, acting, and overall screenplay contribute to this effect. Cate Blanchett's Galadriel is quite good; particularly in the scene where they first meet. The sense that the book gives so well that she's gazing into your soul is achieved wonderfully. The mirror scene is perhaps a bit heavy-handed, but still okay. Another thing they definitely should have shown (it would have taken only a minute of screen time) is the various gifts that Galadriel gave to the members of the Fellowship, besides the vial with the light of Earendil in it. You do see the leaf-clasps on their cloaks, but not her giving it to them. And obviously the elvish rope Sam gets figures in kinda importantly down the road. Also missing that would have been nice to see if Gimli's reaction to actually meeting Galadriel and subsequent one-eighty in his attitude towards her and elves in general. It's important for his character, and I felt the loss.
Oh man, the Argonnath on the river Anduin-totally convincing! You totally buy that those are real statues that are part of the landscape. Along with many other Oscars it deserves, it'll be a crime if this doesn't get at least nominated for cinematography. The ending, like everything else in this film, is extremely effective. Of course they had to show the very first part of the Two Towers, because, well, it's just natural that way. I expected it. All that was left wanting were the words ""Minas Tirith shall not fall!"" from Aragorn as his last words before Boromir dies. I guess they never refer to Minas Tirith by name in the movie, though.
I do believe this may indeed be better than Star Wars, and I congratulate and effusively praise PJ and crew for pulling this off so wonderfully. Now begins the long wait for The Two Towers... Lord have mercy.",1010620800,22,5681,4.659362549800797
1326263,5,B00003CWT6,"I was left speechless and in awe. I had just completed the beautiful, marvellous book by J.R.R Tolkien when I saw Lord of the Rings 1 and there are no words to describe it and give it justice. I am in love with Elijah Wood whose acting was superb. Such as was the rest of the cast. I am saying this from the point of view of someone who has rea dit and also a child. When they say it isn't fr under 8's they really mean it. There are some pertrifying parts including Black Riders and Mines of Moria. I cried several times through this fantastic film and for good reason. I am seeing it for a third time very soon and the otehr two tiems I saw it, not one bit of charm was lost. I'm gabbling because I lovd it s much. It keeps very close to the book and Sam and Frodo's bond is not lsot, if any fans are worrying. There is some beautiful, heart-breaking, mind-blowing, brain-boggling, truly amazing work here and every actor/actress slips into their role like a glove and you'd never be able to tell the difference. But don't belive me, please, go and see it for yourself and be totally amazed.
I reccomend it to people who like fantasy and for people over 10. Younger children would not find this enjoyable and may get lost in some of the plot. And, do me a favour, remember the names!

They may have changed key scenes but their wasn't much they could have done it was 3 hours long already so they don't need to leangthen it! I found the movie much funnier than the book to (though I'm not done the book) especially merry and pipen!

1326265,5,B00003CWT6,"Years in the making by people devoted to utter quality, Tolkien's beloved, multilayered epic is THE fantasy, the fantasy upon which every fantasy written since then is based! And many are recognizing that the sheer scope and quality of this movie is enough to take your breath away.
After a prologue giving us insights into how the Ring came to be and how it came into Bilbo's hands, we get to see the exquisite village of Hobbiton and glimpses of the hobbits' peaceful existance, where the angelic wizard (by angelic I mean he really is, not that he acts like one) Gandalf arrives for Bilbo Baggins' eleventy-first birthday party. Bilbo's party goes off with a few hitches -- the most major of which is when he uses his magical Ring to vanish from the party. Gandalf manages to convince Bilbo -- whose personality is being swamped by the Ring -- to leave it in young cousin Frodo's keeping.
He becomes convinced that it is the One Ring, the pure evil force of the Dark Lord Sauron. And now the Nazgul (Black Riders) arrive in the Shire, hunting for the hobbit carrying the Ring. Frodo leaves the Shire with his faithful gardener and friend Samwise Gamgee, and they also end up picking up his cousins Merry and Pippin along the way. But fun and games are not in the workings for the hobbits -- Frodo is nearly killed in a confrontation with the Black Riders, on their way to Bree. In the inn there, they encounter a mysterious stranger named Strider.
Strider takes them to the Elvish citadel of Rivendell, where it is decided that the Ring must be destroyed in the distant, hellish land of Mordor. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring -- but he has only the faintest idea of the dangers, both from the evil creatures and from within the Fellowship that accompanies, that he will have to face...
The special effects are overwhelming - an avalanche, a horde of hideously realistic orcs, the rock-faced cave troll that almost squishes Sam, the slippery tentacles of the Watcher in the Water, the ""fiery letters"" reflected on Frodo's face, Gandalf's horrific confrontation with the monstrous ""fire and darkness"" Balrog, as the bridge collapses under them. Not all the special effects show -- the hobbits are shrunken down to about four feet tall using special effects, as is Gimli the dwarf. But it's all integral to the plot. Gollum is glimpsed only briefly, but creepily. Only a few of the FX fall flat, like Gwahir the eagle; and the weird swoop-in scene to Saruman on Isengard. Also one shot of Legolas leaping from off of the cave troll.
Elijah Wood appears to just EMBODY Frodo, with his wide eyes and slenderer build than the other hobbits; his luminous face will make your heart bleed or your eyes glow, depending on what is happening to Frodo. Sean Astin looks solid and dependable, just how Sam should look; he manages to make Sam loyal and caring for Frodo without making him look dumb or servile. Pippin and Merry star as mild comic relief; by the end of the movie, they are somewhat more mature.
Ian McKellen is astoundingly good as Gandalf, mixing Gandalf's sternness and latent power with a sense of humor and a tendency to bump his head; Christopher Lee throws everything into the sinister Saruman. I groaned when I heard that Viggo Mortenson would play Aragorn and Liv Tyler would play Arwen, but they both throw their hearts into it, including the most romantic scene I have ever seen in a movie. You cannot go wrong with John Rhys-Davies, who plays the endearingly crabby Gimli. Sean Bean takes the breath away as Boromir, a man tormented with love for his city and his people, and the desire to use the Ring to save them. His final scene is one of the most touching ones ever shot on film. Orlando Bloom is in a breakout role as elven archer-prince Legolas, where he embodies the right masculine elvishness for the role mingled with some of the best fight scenes since ""Phantom Menace.""
The lighting is astounding good -- sinister and darker for scenes with evil creatures, gritty for travelling scenes, warm for scenes in the Shire, paler and luminous for scenes in Lothlorian. The costumes are great -- mudstained and worn for Aragorn, simple and comfy for the hobbits, fancier but serviceable for Boromir and Legolas (well, they ARE princes!) and more floaty-looking, gauzy gowns for Arwen and Galadriel, as well as Arwen's sleek, immaculate riding outfit. Sets are also great, from the simple earthy stuff of the Shire to the elegant sleekness of the Elves' places, to the decaying former splendor of Moria.
The script varies in places from the books, sometimes to provide humor (like Aragorn whacking Pippin in the head with an apple). But this human is often dampened with a follow-up of grimness or fear. For all the fuss about Arwen and orc sidekick Lurtz, neither is really on for long. And often an addition is made to the preexisting material: Frodo's frequent glimpses of the Eye, for example.
This is NOT a movie to take children to. Though there is one very low-key kiss and no profanity, there is plenty of violence (very little blood); also, there are some hair-raising scenes, including Galadriel and Bilbo's temptations, Frodo's brushes with the Eye of Sauron, glimpses of torture (but not what happens), and seeing the Ringwraiths both with their black cloaks -- and without. And even when the violence is mild, it can still be disturbing: We don't see Frodo stabbed by a Nazgul, but his agonized expression, choked up ""Sam..."" and the following scenes where he struggles to survive are very affecting.
Peter Jackson clearly poured heart and soul into this film. It is perhaps one of the best ever made. See it. Now.",1010534400,14,5648,4.73502538071066
1326312,5,B00003CWT6,"Picture this.  It's Christmas Eve, 1978.  A teenage Tolkien addict (who had already read the books some ten times) walked out of a movie theater (into a snowstorm) after seeing Ralph Bakshi's animated Lord of the Rings movie and said, ""Well, that wasn't quite as bad as I feared....""  Fast forward 23 years.  It's Christmas Eve, 2001.  A thirty-something Tolkien addict (who has by now read the books 25+ times) walked out of a movie theater (into a snowstorm) after seeing Peter Jackson's live-action Lord of the Rings movie and said, ""Is there another showing today?""  Yes, after three hours of sitting on my butt in a theater, I was ready (after a short bathroom break) to do it again right away.  And I had expected to be disappointed, too.
It's that good.
As Roger Ebert rightfully pointed out, as an adaptation of one of the best-loved novels of all time, Jackson's film falls woefully short in a number of ways.  As the latest attempt to bring an entertaining, exciting addition to the Swords and Sorcery genre, it succeeds brilliantly.
Last year's Dungeons and Dragons movie brought tears to my eyes.  Tears of anguish that I had wasted my hard-earned dollars.  Lord of the Rings also brought tears to my eyes (although I guess it's only fair to admit that the books do that, too).  (SPOILER ALERT)  I was only lukewarm on Elijah Wood as Frodo for 2 1/2 hours, until the scene in which he admits that -- after trying to go off without his companions -- he's glad that Sam caught him.  The on-screen devotion and magnetism between the two hobbits is very moving.  Likewise with Sean Bean's attempt to save the hobbits from the orcs. (END OF SPOILER)
So why did I title my review Minor Tolkien Heresy?  Because Peter Jackson wisely decided that even a three hour film was insufficient to do justice to Tolkien's masterpiece (rumor has it that his original cut was 4 hrs and 45 minutes long).  Instead, he lifted characters, locations, story-line, and above all, the ESSENCE of Tolkien's work out of the books and used them to make a superbly-paced, highly-entertaining piece of cinema.  The major themes of Tolkien's work come across strongly.  All of his changes and deletions make perfect cinematic sense, and a couple of them actually improve (wow, that borders on a MAJOR Tolkien heresy) the story.  (SPOILER ALERT) After all, in the books, why does Gandalf go to the Pinnacle of Orthanc?  Because Saruman is the chief of his Order?  Perhaps.  Maybe Saruman tricked or magically held him there.  But a movie audience never would have bought it (the much truer adaptation of this sequence in the 1978 animated version just doesn't work).  Jackson's interpretation is much better.  You know exactly why Gandalf ends up atop the tower.  And Tolkien doesn't say EXACTLY how it happened, so why not this way? (END of SPOILER)
It's technical merits are many:  the acting is brilliant, the cinematography breathtaking, the special effects awesome, and the costumes and sets are wonderfully imaginative (not always the way I pictured it, but it's the filmmaker who is showing me his vision, not bringing my vision to life).
I'll spare you any more rambling.  To sum up:  even if you're a Tolkien purist, see the movie.  It's so good, the differences from the book probably won't bother you (they sure didn't bother me).  If you have any interest at all in the Fantasy genre of films, SEE THIS MOVIE.  Otherwise, you'll be missing the best fantasy film ever.
One last note:  I saw the movie with my 68-year-old mother, not with my 5-year-old son.  There was a good reason for this!  Leave kids under ten at home.",1010534400,21,3613,4.744783306581059

This movie is nothing but close-ups of someone's hand that reveals the ring, shots of a persons face with their eyes bugging out and their mouths hanging open as if they can't believe what they are hearing, dialog meant to be grand but is just laughably pretentious, ham-handed action scenes with WAY too much slow motion, and wild camera shots that are either dizzying CG work that you can't even comprehend, or SLOW sweeping shots of the landscape as characters either walk, boat, or otherwise trudge their way through the countryside.

Ho-
Lee-
[Cow]....
That's all I've got to say about that.
I was so impressed by this movie that it's hard to put into words.
The sets and secenery were breathtaking. It's really amazing that they were able to convincingly re-create an imaginary world so vividly. The castles, the mountains and forests, everything was truly amazing.
Something else that bears mentioning are the visual tricks they used to make normal-sized people appear as Hobbits, who are about half the size of a man. Nowhere in the movie does it fail. I couldn't even tell what they were doing most of the time. But whatever it was, it worked flawlessly.
The costumes were unreal. The monsters looked monstrous. That seems like a little thing, but I consider myself a pretty tough guy, and some of them scared me a little bit.
The scale of the large battle scenes was unbelievable. You can tell yourself that they're created with computers, but when you see it onscreen, it doesn't look like it. ""Seamless"" is the best word for it. The computer imagery was completely integrated into the movie. If nobody wins an Oscar for this, something is seriously wrong with the Academy voters.
The smaller fight scenes were also incredibly well done. Yeah, it's hack-n-slash, but it's well-done hack-n-slash, and that's a-okay in my book. They're really violent. There will be several moments where you'll sit in your seat and go ""Whoa."" It's not for the squeamish.
All the actors did a great job. Special props go to Ian McKellan, Sean Astin, and Sean Bean.
McKellan was to Gandalf what Patrick Stewart was to Professor Xavier, namely a man who seemed born to play this role.
Astin played another Hobbit, Sam Gamgee. Forget ""the Goonies"" or ""License to Drive"" or any of the other '80s stuff he was in. He was totally convincing, and, even though I'm a huge devotee of all things '80s, I had no trouble buying him in his role.
Bean is one of my favorite actors, based on his work in the British film versions of the ""Sharpe"" novels. Going into this movie, I was afraid he was going to play another sleazeball, like he did in ""Goldeneye"" and ""Patriot Games."" But Boromir wound up being one of my favorite characters. Yes, he was flawed, but he ultimately found redemption, so Bean can hopefully avoid being typecast as a villain.
Wait until you finish reading this, then get up and go see this movie right now! But you should be prepared that this is obviously the first part of a trilogy. There's a huge cliffhanger at the end, so you'll be wishing it was Christmas 2002 already.
I know I am.",1010534400,3,2577,4.6535087719298245
1326318,5,B00003CWT6,"Phenomenal! There are films and there are movies and this is classic film.
For as much as I knew about the film before arriving, I truly was surprised by how affected I was. More than once I found myself surprised by tears. I loved the humor, the tight editing, screenwriting and the solid acting. There is such strength in this film in so many places. I loved hearing the names and places pronounced and I just bathed in the richness of Arwens' elvish. I loved that there was so much depth in the film, costuming, settings, and languages. I loved the rolling R's.
One of my few quibbles about the books (I've read them a dozen times or so) is the dearth of female characters. This film has made up for it by highlighting and developing the existing female characters. As for movie quibbles, I do have to admit that Galadriels' transformation at the mirror made me squirm a bit.
This film is absolutely not directed to children like Harry Potter was. One would think that the PG-13 rating would serve as warning but some people don't get it. I don't remember blood or gore but there is a tremendous amount of violence and implied violence.
The film adaptation is as perfect as you can hope from a book of this depth. Three hours truly felt like 1 or 2. It's truly a beautiful film and easily stands as a classic epic. It's quite possibly my favorite of all time and it is my dream come true.",1010534400,,1391,4.416342412451362

1326321,5,B00003CWT6,"First, I would like to say that it has been about two years since I read the books. Last year, when I heard the book was made into a movie and it was going to be released this year at Christmas ( 2001 ), I really did not know what to think or expect. At first, I thought that maybe I wouldn't like it, hence I have seen other books turned into movies and didn't really like them. Mind you Stephen King's books into movies were the only ones I thought were good ( of the ones, I read ). So, knowing I had fallen in love with the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, I really was quite scared about how I would feel about the movie.
To my surprise, I really did enjoy the movie. The scenery was breathtaking and I really felt like I was part of the story when I was sitting in the theatre. The characters on the most part did fairly well. There might have been a few that I felt did not fit the roles well, but it is only because I have kept up with that actor since he was young...but nonetheless, he did pretty good. I'm talking about Sean Astin as Sam Gamgee. I guess I felt it was an awkward character to play simply, because Sam ( to me ) is a complex character in the book. He is wholesome, sweet, courageable and a true friend, which Sean did. But, just seeing Sean in a different role made me feel funny. Frodo is another strange one for me. In the book, he made me feel that he was quite whiny. But, in the movie, Elijah Wood did a remarkable job on capturing the true essence of who Frodo really is and really touched me. The other characters were good too, especially Merry & Pippin's antics. Legolas stole my heart as the bowed man elf...I want to go on about the characters, but I also want to say that the plot followed pretty much of the book with a few different things, or should I say, what I can re-collect from memory.
All in all, if you are going to see the movie and whether you read the book or not, keep a level head about going into the film. You have to expect the length, and the storyline. It just is--and it is a magnificent film...Congratulations Peter Jackson and the Lord of the Rings Crew!!! You did what you had visioned!!!

  It is very action packed and I would not recomend it for young children.  ....",1010448000,2,282,3.9285714285714284
1326344,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay - it wasn't EXACTLY like the book.  How could it be?  True fans of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy would have sat through a 10 hour movie to see everything that was in the book, especially if it was done as well as the movie. And the movie was terrific. I just hope that all the scenes that were cut out to keep the movie down to the 3 hours and 15 minutes running time are put back in in the DVD and it DOES end up being 5 hours long!  There is always the pause button!
Peter Jackson and crew did a tremendous job.  The New Zealand landscape mirrored what was in the triolgy.  I think that the actors really nailed their performances, with Elijah Wood as Frodo, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Sir Ian McKellan as Gandalf just outstanding. The soundtrack is playing as I write this because the music is just beautiful.  Enya singing in Elvish isn't doesn't even stretch the imagination.  She was born to sing it.
My friend Linda and I have seen the movie 3 times and plan to go at least two more times, especially since I keep seeing things that I missed the other times since the detail is so amazing.

1326345,5,B00003CWT6,"If you want a non-Tolkien fan's response to ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" (FOTR) look no further.
If you are anything like me, you have long heard of J.R.R. Tolkien's tales of fantasy and magic, but you've never developed an interest in reading them.
As it turns out, reading the book is probably not a good idea before seeing this movie. As you can see, the other reviewers who have read the book complain about the film omitting this scene or that little tidbit found in the book. They generally give the film good marks, but these nagging omissions are ever present for them.
I was not labored with this knowledge. As most people know, film is a different medium than literature. You can take two chapters to describe the local scenery in a book, but you can't spend an  inordinate amount of screen-time on scenery or the audience gets bored. That is why it is a mistake, I think, to compare this film to the book. Treat them as individual pieces of work, respect them as such, and you will not have a problem.
As someone whose knowledge of elves, orcs, and wizards was confined to the pages of Dungeons and Dragons books (which I believe was inspired by Tolkien's novels,) I had a familiarity with the kind of world ""FOTR"" would offer. However, I was NOT prepared at all for the way this film grabbed me.
The basic story involves a Hobbit named Frodo who is entrusted with a golden ring that has the power of pure evil in it. The One Ring has corrupted many souls in it's long life, and Frodo's quest is to keep the ring safe and out of the hands of the monsterous beings seeking it out. After all, the fate of the world depends upon him protecting the ring. If the ring falls into evil hands, only death will follow.
This is no cheesy, fairy tale. This is a story with teeth: Big, nasty, sharp teeth with fangs that will strike at any moment. It is sweeping in scope, frightening in its tone, and the hours fly by like you would not believe. You will care deeply for Frodo and the other characters as they face incredible dangers, deal with hidden temptations, and struggle to fend off the powerful forces of evil.
You will feel the fourth wall melt before you as you are literally transported into Middle Earth with the characters, and with every setback, with every failure, and with every misstep, you will feel like you are taking it with them. It is a stirring film of immense grandeur and spectacle, and I recommend this film like none I have seen in quite some time. It is an epic the likes of which has never been done so successfully before, and I cannot wait for the next film to be released.",1010448000,23,2603,4.422916666666667
1326346,5,B00003CWT6,"Wow! There is so much good to say about this movie that I hardly know where to start. Earlier this season, I saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and loved it, but after having seen FOTR, it has paled into almost indifference.
Peter Jackson is a genius! The cinematography was absolutely brilliant, with light and shade playing such a formidable role is characterization and flow. The locations were inspired and filled with grandeur.
I don't know the name of the casting director, but I shall find out, because he or she chose intuitively and extremely well. Elijah Wood IS Frodo, the curious, somewhat ethereal hobbit who undertakes the impossible. Also worth mentioning are the superb efforts of Sean Bean as Boromir and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn. Great job on living the character through to the end.
Major snaps go out to Jackson, for staying true to a story I have loved since I was a girl, yet pacing it well enough to create an exciting picture, still riveting after 3 hours of viewing. I have seen this movie three times and am like a junkie - I've got to go back! It just keeps getting better.

An undoubted epic but i doubt if it will be remembered as a cinematic milestone in years to come. It's certainly a bold effort to bring Tolkiens saga to life but as to living up to the hype then i doubt if any movie could live up to the build up this movie received. So inevitably at the end of the film you're left with the impression of 'what was all the fuss about'. I haven't read Lord of the Rings for nigh on twenty years so i went into the theater with few preconceptions. the film is a fairly close adaption of Tolkiens narrative, straying from the book in a few places, omitting some characters. The plot peaks early and drags a little at other times. Anyone seeing the film should remember its the first part of a trilogy so at the end of the film there is a feeling of a lack of completeness which is only to be expected. Will parts 2 & 3 live up to part one? I doubt it, The Fellowship of the ring is the most exciting part of the trilogy anyway, parts 2 & 3 will inevitably follow the law of diminishing returns for movie sequels.

If any film from 2001 demands to be seen more than once, this is the one. Now on to the review:
Well, I have to say that FotR was the best movie I've seen so far this year and one of the best epics of the past decade. The acting across the board was pitch-perfect, with especially exceptional performances by Ian McKellen, Ian Holm, and Sean Bean... Even though Sean Astin didn't have much material to work with and as such couldn't plumb the depths of his character as much as might ideally have been the case, I nevertheless LOVED Sam! I was never all that fond of him in the books (he was too simple-minded), but the film really brings out his humanity and intense affection. I really can't wait for his increased role in The Two Towers...
As far as the technical aspects of the film are concerned, it was hands-down the most impressive film I've seen so far this year. (Only Moulin Rouge! really challenges it, in my mind.) The costuming and set design are gorgeous, lushly illustrating the richness of Tolkien's world. The visual FX are jaw-dropping and put HP to shame. (The cave troll from FotR was one of the most incredible CGI creations I've ever seen on the silver screen: the way it interacted with the environment and characters allowed me to fully suspend disbelief, even knowing that such a creature never existed.) The cinematography turned me off initially but grew on me through the course of the film till I couldn't think of Tolkien's world being captured on film in any other way. The score was perfect -- or at least as close to perfect as it could have possibly been. By turns it was riveting, poignant, and jolly without ever drawing attention to itself.
My biggest problems with the film are really trivial in the grand scheme of things but are worth mentioning anyway, since no film can achieve perfection. And in this respect FotR is no different. The first thing that bothered me was the lack of character development and interaction that was so much more present in the books. Supporting characters really didn't have much time to bond with the audience and weren't given the attention I would have liked. Leading characters were better realized, but even they weren't quite as fleshed-out as might have ideally been the case.
The second problem I have with FotR is that the latter half of the film is unneccesarily fight-heavy, without enough time being taken for ""breathers"" between the major battles. The trek through Moria especially should have taken more time so as to allow the tension and foreboding to build gradually rather than suddenly. Also, it would have been nice to see more of Lothlorien and the gifts of Galadriel.
But these problems I've cited are really nitpicks in the whole picture of this incredible film and only marginally detracted from my enjoyment of it. Also, a part of me wonders if my having read the books beforehand could have been the source of my discontent with the lack of character development and pacing. If I hadn't read the book before seeing the film, I doubt these two things would have even been problems.
In short, it is a true epic like we haven't seen in many a year and deserves all the attention it has been receiving.

1326405,5,B00003CWT6,"I found this to be the quintessential movie experience for me.  That is to say, it satisfies criteria I expect from an 'ultimate movie going experience'.
It abounds in love and/or hope -- the love of companions who have suffered and survived common hardships, comaraderie and brotherhood, love for one's people and home, and especially, eternal love of a man and a woman for each other. All this without gratuitous sex.
It is an epic saga, a grand tale, rather than a merely personal piece of fiction.  However, the personal point of view is well maintained throughout so that you care about the main characters very much even tho they are flawed (and therefore believable).
The plot is fanciful, yet it is the timlessness of the whimsy that the universal nature of this story unfolds.  With all its fantasy and magick it is the humble, every day kind of guy who must save us all -- a very poignant and timely concept.
While it has powerfully graphic imagery of evil, including violence, it makes for stimulating and fun discussions with older kids.  My family loved it and we are all still talking about it days later.
Finally, The Fellowship of the Ring is a truly beautiful movie.  I just plain like to look at it and listen to it.  We saw it twice and didn't notice the length.",1010361600,3,1281,4.5964912280701755

  When my family saw this movie we all loved it. it was a spectactular show with great actors, action, and excitement. And the cammera shots were great with special effects that it made it just like you were on the adventure with the hobbits and all of their friends.

It is the best movie I've ever seen and I think directors like James Cameron should retire after what Peter Jackson did with this movie. I think this movie should wipe out movies like Titanic from the all time best movies list.
The location is so so great, they have chosen New Zealand that has great land scapes which utters the story and atmosphere of the story.
The Music is sooooooo gooood, and was used in away that make the movie even greater. For Example, sounds associated with the Evil Kings and thier horses were so scary and on the other hand sounds associated in the chases where adventurous.
Computer generated graphics where outstanding, not even the The Matix come close.
The bottom line, this movie has it all. Love, adventure, scare, action, drama and the music, and what makes this movie so great in my opinuion is that this movie did better than any one out there in the above categories.

1326408,5,B00003CWT6,"I, like many people, have read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy numerous times -- in fact, I have a set of the BBC radio production CDs in my car right now (it's excellent, by the way)!  No movie version of the novel should be expected to capture all the subtleties and nuances of Tolkien's masterful vision.
This being said, this movie did a fantastic job of doing just that.  Yes, some shortcuts were taken, but none that dramatically changed the overall storyline.  I haven't seen a movie yet that held as closely to the book as this one.
The casting was nearly flawless.  Once again, it is impossible to match everyone's expectations of certain characters perfectly -- we all have our own version of how they are locked in our own minds.  But the choices seemed to really capture the essence of the characters as Tolkien describes them in his novel.  Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is old and wise - almost frail -- but with great underlying strength.  Strider/Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is weather-beaten and a bit sad, but strong and commanding at the same time.  Frodo (Elijah Wood) seems to feel like he's in over his head, but is determined to get the job done.  I felt that Gimili looked good, but was a little... silly?... and was not as sympathetic to the Hobbits as I thought he was in the book.  And Boromir was not what I had envisioned either (Sean Bean is great, just not as Boromir!).  But I was very happy that they casted Ian Holm as Bilbo -- he did a great job, and was actually the voice of FRODO in the BBC Radio Production!
The sets and locations couldn't be more perfect, and the special effects (like when Frodo puts on the ring) were excellent without overpowering the movie.
Well, I can't wait for two things:  (1) for the second movie (the Two Towers) to come out, and (2) all of the movies to come out on DVD so that I can enjoy them over and over at home!",1010361600,4,1874,4.415697674418604

After seeing this movie, I'd have to say that I was thouroughly impressed and definitely left begging for more. This is a wonderful film that I'm sure has sparked interest in LOTR and Tolkien in others like myself. The film is full of breathtaking scenes and backdrops, astounding action sequences, and characters who are portayed perfectly by their respective actors and actresses. The score by Howard Shore was the first thing I bought right out of the movie. It, along with the film, both deserve to win an oscar for best picture and best original score, respectively. I would definitely reccommend this film to young and old, as it is truly a spectacle which all can appreciate.",1010361600,,754,4.763358778625954
1326459,5,B00003CWT6,"I've been a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's since I first read the Lord of the Rings when I was in high school. I never thought that the books would be able to be put to film because of the complexity of the story. I am very glad to say that I was mistaken. Peter Jackson did a wonderful job with the film.
The story starts off with mostly back-story. We see how the Ring is forged and the first battle to destroy Sauron. We learn that the Ring was not destroyed and how it seems to have a mind of its own and is trying to get back to his Master. We follow it in brief snippets as it travels from Isildur to Gollum and finally to the least likely of heroes, Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit.
From there the `real' story begins. It is the 111 birthday of Bilbo and all of the Shire is turning out for the party. Gandalf the Wizard (played by Ian McKellan) comes to the shire with a cart full of fireworks for the celebration. He is met by Frodo Baggins (wonderfully played by Elijah Wood). The party commences as Bilbo plans for an escape from the Shire and a return to `adventures'. At Gandalf's insistence, he leaves the Ring behind for Frodo.
From there, the story picks up speed, with Frodo, along with Hobbit-friends, Sam Gamgee, Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck, hightailing it from the Shire for Bree, being chased by the dark servants of Sauron, who are searching for the Ring. At Bree they meet a suspicious character called Strider. He takes them under his wing and leads them finally to Rivendell, but not before Frodo almost dies at the hands of the Nazgul, the dark servants.
It is here that the one thing that bothered me about the film adaptation happened. We get a bit of a romance story between Arwen, the daughter of Elrond, and Strider, who we learn is a king in hiding, whose real name is Aragorn. We only get a brief glance of this romance in the book - here it is thrown in our face so that even the most unobservant viewer can't miss it. Tolkien wasn't big on female characters, and it shows in his books. I think that should have carried over into the film.
Other than that, though, I was very pleased with the film. At times, it seems that Mr. Jackson was doing a travel film for New Zealand and I know that by the end of the film, I was ready to go for a visit. His location shots were beautiful, especially the Shire which reminded me of an English country village. Rivendell and Lothlorien had an otherworldliness that I expected for Elvish cities/homes. Even Isengard and Mordor were chillingly done and exactly as I pictured them when I read and re-read the books.
Parents with young children should be aware that this is a sword wielding culture and the swords and arrows do draw blood, although it is done in such a way that it isn't graphic. We see characters kill with bow and sword. Characters are wounded, and the wounding is treated realistically - in other words, it HURTS! Also, the final scenes show one of the main characters (Boromir, played by Sean Bean) killed by being struck with multiple arrows as he defends two of the Hobbits (Merry and Pippin) from orc/goblins. I think most children could handle it and I did see children in the theater as young as about 7-8 who had no problems. If the child is sensitive to this type of thing, I would recommend that the child be a little older, at the parents discretion.
The biggest disappointment for me was the end. The three-hour running time went by too quickly. As I watched Frodo and Sam walk off toward Mordor alone, I was all set to watch the next movie to start after the credits had finished rolling. This was a sentiment that I heard from many people as we left the theater. Mr. Jackson has himself a hit, and two more to follow in 2002 and 2003.",1010361600,2,3727,4.364028776978417

I only feel sorrow for having to wait one year to watch THe Two Towers.. I would gadly spent nine hours sitting in the theater to watch the three movies in a row, no trouble at all!! Then I would buy the DVD with the three movies and all the extra scenes tha must exist!!!

1326463,5,B00003CWT6,"Those film-makers responsible for 'Fellowship of the Ring' have cast down the gauntlet of integrity to all their peers in the cinematic world, and it's about time. Forget George Lucas and his embarrassing indifference to a mass audience that DOES crave a powerful story as much as it craves grandeur in special effects. 'Fellowship' is a transcendent film because it is infused with soul and spirit, and it utilizes the best tools that technical creativity in modern film can provide. But here, the effects serve the story and its human performances, not vice versa. 'Fellowship' grips the heart, the mind, the eyes, and the being. It is a universal tale of the highest moral and visual order. It is the tale of diverse peoples gathering, not to wage war upon each other, but upon Evil itself. Every performance is stellar and each role is cast to perfection. I challenge anyone not to be moved by the first laughing glimpse of chemistry and camaraderie between Elijah Wood's Frodo and Ian McKellan's Gandalf as the old wizard wheels his rickety way into the Shire. I challenge anyone not to be terrified in the pit of their soul at the mere thought of the simple, unimaginably evil ring, and likewise by the Nazgul Black Riders as they close in on their prey like devils in a dream. I challenge anyone not to hold their breath during the battle between Saruman and Gandalf, and involuntarily exhale that same breath to marvel at its spiraling result. I challenge anyone not to feel their own spirits rise as the Fellowship makes its stand against the orcs and their troll in the chamber at Moria. I challenge anyone not to feel the triumph of Gandalf's quaking power against the Balrog turn in the next instant to utter heartbreak. I challenge anyone with a soul not to be affected by the doubt and fear and final perseverance of the unlikely Frodo and Sam. This is a film, my friends. This is a tale to remember and to cherish as long as we are human.

1326464,5,B00003CWT6,"I rated this movie 4 stars initially (I was also #208) but after seeing it 5 more times (10 times total)I want to re-rate this movie to 5 stars.  It clearly raises the bar on what kind of movies I wish Hollywood to make & show in the future.  As a movie goer in my 40's, I've seen way too many junky movies to ever want to go another one.  Consequently, I was prepared for the worst with LOTRs and was presented with the best.
So in the hopes there is someone reading our reviews and passing this on to the ""powers that be"", I'd like to submit the things that over the course of 10 viewings have me still planning to return for an 11th.
First off, the good stuff:
1. The close bond the cast developed over the long filming of this project is clearly evident in their performance together.  The fellowship is not just a word for the 9 who acted out their characters.  Indeed, the tattoos they received at the close of the filming shows their commitment to each other as friends.
2. Casting: EXCELLENT!  Frodo, Gandalf, the Hobbits, the noble Legolas...all suburb!  During my next reading of the trilogy, their faces will be there!
3. Makeup & costume: loved those ears and feet.  And the Hobbit's hair and all the flowing capes and Gandalf's rustic robe and all that great long hair...just like I imagined it.  The hobbits were kinda skinny, though, for how often they are supposed to be eating!
4. Soundtrack: WONDERFUL!!!  As a music major and teacher, I always pay close attention to how the music helps tell the story.  My favorite part was how the theme music for the fellowhip played throughout in it's various motifs, from sounding majestic and noble in the slo-mo closeup of the fellowship crossing over the hills, to Frodo's and Aragon's ride across the chasm caused by the collapsing bridge.  Thrilling!  Then there were the savage drums played in the scenes with Saruman and the Uruk-hai to the heartbreaking song softly sung as the Fellowship runs from the mines leaving Gandalf's fate unknown.  Truly the stuff that makes a story more thrilling to the listener!
5. Favorite warrior in the Fellowship: no contest - Legolas Greenleaf.  That elf is some archer!  I'm not one for the gore of Aragorn's beheadings, but how about the way Legolas rapid fires his never empty quiver of bows into the Uruk-hai never missing, and once taking out 2 with a single arrow.  Not in the book but Whoooo-hoo!  Still exciting!!!
6. Length of movie: Well, it's 3 hours long and I've seen it 10 times already...so I've already invested 30 hours into this movie!  Not to mention the tickets, popcorn and sodas.  Hey, I'm one of those people who could watch this one until the Two Towers comes out in December 2002!
The bad stuff:  Alas there is a tad...
1. TOO VIOLENT FOR IT'S RATING!!!  Way too many young kids were there without parents!!  I've watched kids hide under the seats and sometimes even screaming out not in surprise but in sheer terror.  Rethink TT and RotK.  Young children watching other young-looking ""kids"" (aka the Hobbits) being chased by screeching, black horsemen while the grandfather figure has abandoned them...ooo. Too much!
2. TOOOOOOOO LOOOOOUD!!!  I have to wear earplugs so I can hear when I leave the theatre.  And epecially those Ringwraiths...Man!  Have you guys ever put a dB meter on those guys?
3. Consider an intermission for a bathroom break.  Some of the movie I have only seen 9 times!
4. Casting - only one I couldn't get used to was Hugo Weaving as Elrond.  I always envisoned him as noble and strong, though jaded by what he has seen.  But I can't get bad guy Agent Smith out of my head...but more important still, his speech to the council was over done and quite ""Shatner-esque"", if you get my meaning.
5. The not-so-special special effects...really guys...some of the CG overlays, well, YOU KNOW what I mean.  The Hobbits keep changing size, lips (or beards) don't move in sync with the dialog, the glow around Frodo or the Hobbits when they are being injected into the scene, cuts between scenes that don't match up, and Hobbits that are often child extras.  Messes with the mind!  If Gary Sinese had no legs in Forrest Gump, I know you can work this out!
6. Did I mention the movie is too violent for young children?  WAY, WAY too violent!  If they really want to see it, wait for the DVD...you can monitor content better and also protect their hearing!!!
All in all, this is a monumental film.  I was there for the premire of Star Wars in the Summer of 76.  Indeed, the first SW trilogy was awesome for it's day.  Not since then have I been so entertained at such a high level.  Long after the dust settles from the final movie we'll be talking about how it changed the film industry, and every person who Tolkein had never reached through the written word.",1010275200,11,4798,4.5660818713450295

1326466,5,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of Peter Jackson's trilogy based on the Lord of the Rings, THE classic epic novel by JRR Tolkien, considered father of the fantasy genre.
The film tells the story of Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit, or half-sized human with hairy feet, who lives in the Shire, in Middle-Earth. Frodo's uncle Bilbo, on his one-hundred-and-eleventh birthday, leaves everything to his nephew, among which a ring that has the power to make its bearer invisible. The ring turns out to be The One Ring of Power, forged by the evil Lord Sauron. The mythological and historical background is well summarized at the beginning of the film, and we learn that Sauron was defeated long ago and the ring somewhat lost and found several times before falling into Bilbo's hands. However at the same time, in the land of Mordor, Sauron is stirring again and wants his Ring, source of the power he needs to dominate all the people of Middle-Earth. And so he sends forth nine Nazgl, to find the Ring. Frodo has but one solution: he has to destroy the ring by casting it into the very fire in which it was forged, in Mount Doom. He sets off with some companions, on a perilous quest to the heart of Mordor.
It must have been hard to squeeze over one thousand pages into three three-hour-long films, but I think Peter Jackson managed to cut at the right places, and since I have read the books, I was able to fill in. Even though it might sometimes be a little bit confusing to people who are new to the story, the fast fighting scenes, the terrifying Nazgl and evil orcs that contrast with the stunning, breathtaking beauty of the scenery and the great special effects, all this backed up by a wonderful cast, make the Fellowship of the Ring definitely worth seeing by anyone. Personally, I most enjoyed the visual rendering of Sauron's blurry dark world Frodo falls into when he puts on the ring.
These must have been among the most awaited films in history, and even though no film will ever be as majestic and magical as a masterpiece of such scope, I think Peter Jackson really managed to capture its enchanting, wonderful spirit and to pay a superb homage to JJR Tolkien's genius. It made me want to read the books again, and I hope it will make everyone want to read them as well.",1010275200,2,2292,4.525301204819277

As an avid (but not rabid) Tolkien fan, Jackson's insight into the tensions between the characters, the Journey,  and the irresistable pull of the evil forces controlled by the Ring is parlayed into a believable saga that leaves me eager for more.  The 70's animated rendition of the same tale left a sour taste and distrust for any attempt at putting Tolkien's tale into celluloid, but Jackson has managed to squash all doubts by creating a masterful picture of Fantasy as Reality.  The casting and imagery are superb.  Well done, lad!",1010275200,,593,4.94949494949495

Tolkien defined the modern fantasy genre in literature. FOTR defines the fantasy genre in cinema.

1326502,5,B00003CWT6,"Oh! Wow!
As a life-long Tolkien fan, I went prepared to be disappointed.  How could this movie ever measure up to the book?  The answer is that it can't possibly, but this movie bends the rules.  It's not less than the novel, it's different from the novel while preserving its spirit.  Sure, some of every Tolkien freak's favorite bits got cut, but the important parts got the royal treatment.
The Nazgul still scare the fertilizer out of me, and I get perilously close to soiling my knickers when the Balrog appears, even though I've read the book half a dozen times, and seen the movie three times.
Bravo!",1010275200,,607,4.592592592592593
1326503,5,B00003CWT6,"At last, a massive epic/action/fantasy film that doesn't rest on special effects alone.  The most inspired aspect of this film is not the locations, digital effects or cinematogaphy...it's actually the CASTING. A truly INSPIRED element that, for me, has elevated the film into the hall of ""greatest adventure films of all time"".
Well done Peter Jackson for choosing actors none of us would have ever considered for the roles, and directing them in such a way where 'timing' of dialogue and movement makes the film come 'alive' with intensely 'human' effects.
In fact, the casting is such a perfect match in every case, I cannot even imagine anyone else playing these marvellous characters.  Thankfully these films are all shot back to back so we're guaranteed the same cast throughout the trilogy.
Especially Aragorn, Legolas, Boromir and Gandalf, who bring these roles to life in such passionate detail.  Each actor realizes the story is not just about good and evil, it is more about the sweet and righteous corruption of power.  The quality of these actors (most of whom come from the stage), allows them to illuminate this dark side of the rings (so omnipresent throughout the books), yet still maintain our sympathy and interest.  Especially those actors who play Boromir and Aragon: inspiring! Oops, now I'm repeating myself so I'll finish.

Peter Jackson has successfully captured the essence of Middle Earth. As with all readers of the books, I had created mental images of the landscape and the inhabitants of Middle Earth. Although the film is not always what I had pictured in my mind, what is seen on the screen is right. As a reader of the books there are characters and events I miss seeing in the film, but the essence is there.....and for those who have not read the books, perhaps this film will inspire them to take a lingering visit to Middle Earth. It will be a long year waiting for the next installment.......",1010188800,,724,4.41044776119403

Orlando Bloom was born to play the part of Legolas and Liv Uhlman was an elf to perfection. Not a movie for young persons (say under 10) the movie is beyond wonderful for adults. Being visual, I have only seen a movie the second time maybe three times in all my movie-going years. Tomorrow I will see Rings for the fourth time. A couple of my friends did not get as much out of it as I did. But they didn't dislike it either. I can honestly say this movie impacted my life in a major way.",1010188800,,614,4.203389830508475

1326518,5,B00003CWT6,"I'm a big fan of Peter Jackson. Not only is he from the country I live in, but he has a knack for bringing the most unlikely stories to the screen and making them big and brilliant. How the sudden anticipation for The Lord of the Rings trilogy suddenly came to be I do not know, but I know that I was sucked in by the fabulous trailers for this movie and the fact that it was filmed in my home town. So, when I gathered up a big bucket of popcorn and set out to see the first New Zealand public screening, I was very worried the movie might be not worth all the hype. Well, I have something to tell all Lord of the Rings fans - this is not disappointing! The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring already has the highest audience average on IMDb, and critics have raved about it. I'm just another one of those little critics, sharing my bit, but I'm prepared to rave about just how much of a great achievement this is. What really sets The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring apart from the other movies this year is the whole premise. It is really amazing how the storyline that most movie viewers would consider ridiculous seem brilliant and believable. I felt like I was actually there, meeting the monsters and experiencing the adventure as Frodo and his lot embarks on a noble quest. The performances also really helped this movie. Now, don't be fooled if you don't see enough of Liv Tyler or Cate Blanchett - their real place in the story will come in the upcoming next two films. In this movie those two actresses are no more than cameos, but they have big parts in the next few movies, so that is not a flaw at all. Elijah Wood couldn't have been better cast as Frodo the Hobbit. Elijah plays Frodo warmly and accurately as a hobbit struggling with evil powers beyond his belief. While Elijah Wood's great portrayal of this character is good, I felt that the character itself was not really heroic enough. Right at the end he decides to stop being a woss and then it's all over! Due to this flaw, I felt the heart and soul of the movie really belonged to Gandalf the Grey, played excellently by Sir Ian McKellen. The anti-climatic ending (which, before the final frame, includes some laughably cheesy lines) also made me feel a little disappointed, but it leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat for the next movie. The whole atmosphere of the film just really got me revved up and sitting there breathing incredibly loudly. The scariness of the dark riders and the fact that you never know where this movie is going to take its next turn is really entertaining. Overall, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has not only proved itself the most anticipated film of all time, but also has the highest audience average ever on IMDb, and this film truly deserves a place on my top 10 of the year 2001.

1326519,5,B00003CWT6,"This movie is-in one word-SPECTACULAR.  The cast is excellent.  For those of you who have read the books I'd say that they did a pretty good job potraying the charachters as in the book, especially the hobbits!  The scenery is beautiful and looks as if it's out of this world, the soundtrack is catchy and worth purchasing, and you'll find that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen even for a bathroom or snack break.  Everyone I know has loved this movie and I for one have seen it twice in the theaters and plan to see it again next Sunday.  No questions asked- you have to see this movie.  You won't be disappointed whether you have read the books or not.  In fact, after you have seen the movie you might even find yourself at the library checking the book out to see what happens next.

It alters slightly from the book but the movie in itself is so good that you have to forgive it the small details. You also have to remember that the movie is almost three hours long already, so they had to leave some parts out or watching it would be a day-long event. Anyway, besides the breath-taking landscape of New Zealand it has some of the best special effects I have seen in a while and includes very good acting by Elijah Wood. If you pick one movie to see soon, see this one. You won't regret it. It is easily the best movie of this year! (ha ha)",1010188800,,637,4.104
1326521,5,B00003CWT6,"Before I start, let me just say that I haven't read the books.
Acting: No cheesy lines or unnecessary melodrama (the Chess scene in Harry Potter, for instance). The fact that none of these are megasuperstars works for the movie, in that I see them onscreen as people, and not just actors playing characters.
10 out of 10
Effects: Where do I begin?? Middle Earth is simply gorgeous. The cave troll and the orcs are ugly and frightening, like their supposed to be. Sauron and the Wraiths are menacing, and the battle scenes all hold their own against the rest in modern cinema.
10 out of 10
Story: A few little things that detracted from the movie, like a bug bite. It's not big, but it's still kind of annoying. Some character introductions were rushed, or not even there. Therefore, I sometimes was forced to refer to characters as the Badass Elf with the bow and arrow, or the dwarf with the ax. Some things didn't seem properly explained, like why Elrond was still alive and kicking after the few thousand years since the war against Sauron. And the end of the cave troll fight when we see that someone really ISN'T dead (those who've seen the movie know what I'm talking about). But other than that, the story is gold and I couldn't wait to see what happened next.
9 out of 10
Sound/Music: The sounds are spot-on and the score is fantastic, if somewhat forgetable. There aren't really any stand-out tunes.
9 out of 10
Overall: This movie simply SCREAMS epic. Everything, from the story, to the sweeping camera angles, to the running time. And speaking of that, even at almost 3 hours, FOTR is too short! You never want it to end, and when it does, it ends quite suddenly. This just makes the year's wait for the next film even harder. But anyway, see the movie. Tell everyone to see this movie. I've only seen it once, but plan on seeing it as many times as possible when it comes to my town.

1326522,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay Tolkien Fans... this is it. I must admit that I was hesitant to see this movie - afraid that Peter Jackson and company would ruin the story, and even more, the morals behind it. Well, I saw it on opening day and was pleased beyond belief at this production. The cast is VERY well done..most actors fit perfectly into the character that I believe Tolkien describes; especially Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Frodo - MY personal favorites. =D
 If you're into intense movies, full of action and adventure, then don't miss out on this one. Although it has a very good plot there are some very graphic images that most likely you wouldn't want your young children to see - such as the Orcs, Balrog, Urak Hai, etc. Not to mention Sauron himself..=)
 Anyway, I was very satisfied with this movie, and hope that it'll take attention away from the demonic movie, ""Harry Potter"". Though Tolkien has created some very evil characters, they're not portrayed as innocent and harmless - quite the contrary from the Sorcerer's Stone where the witchcraft involved is made to look like ""fun stuff"". ""The Lord of The Rings"" is definitley full of symbolisms to the Christian faith, though it certainly isn't an allegory. Very cool.
  This production is full of breath taking scenery, and wonderful, grasping music. An incredible movie... I just can't describe it well enough. So go see it yourself and you'll know what I mean. You'll come home wanting to defeat all the evils of the world.

1326523,5,B00003CWT6,"Now, some 24 hours after watching this movie for the first time,  regained my breath and I think I can reasonably analyse the merits or flaws of this movie. Because, while I was there, ther was only joy, emotion: I was watching Middle Earth in front of my eyes. I was watching Aragorn, Gandalf , Frodo and others played by convinceable actors who clearly gave their best. I was watching a movie clearly made by a director tht respected and loved Tolkien's work, and also was wise enough that he must cut some parts to not kill the project commercially.
The point, as I see is: it doesn't matter at all if some things wer left out; if the movie is better for who read or for whom not read the books. The great quality here is the SPIRIT, THE PACE, THE TONE of the movie. They are perfect. The special effects has substance and serve the history. The cinematography is beyond comments, an OSCAR for sure here. The history, if you consider this is FANTASY, is perfect.
JACKSON, you had a difficult task in your hands and you handled it with skill beyond limits. I SALUTE YOU!!!
P.S. FOr me, the movie was too short!! I would stand in that chair for six hours with pleasure!! Thinking better, I would watch the three movies in a row without problems!! I can hardly wait for the DVD's that surely will be released after 2003!!",1010188800,3,1321,4.413934426229508
1326584,5,B00003CWT6,"I'm out of words!! This is simply the best adventure / fantasy / action movie I've ever watched. Yes, I've read the books. Yes, I know the producers / director / screenwriters changed a lot of stuff, some you can understand or reason why they did it, some you have not the slightest idea why they were changed. But that's always the same in translating books to screen... But, in this case, we clearly sense that every frame was shot thinking it was THE BETTER THING TO DO; it is clear they could not avoid cutting some stuff, because, after all, the trilogy is a product that must generate profits, and you could not possibly make a movie more than 3 hours long (a movie that does not end!). If TOm Bombadil sequence were put on it, for example, many viewers could possibly think the movie is ""slow"" or something like that. I think they did the best handling the artistic / commercial interests, without one damaging the other. The introductory sequence tries brief to explain to Ring history, and it was a good idea.
The cast is marvellous. The special effects are marvellous. I think that those who not read the book can sense the slow transition for the hobbits, from an idihlic existence in the SHire to a quest that raises and raises in desperation and urgency from second to second!!
Viggo Mortensen no doubt had the role of his life, and he grabbed it with both hands, making Aragorn the perfect hero, the perfect warrior.  All the cast is marvellous, simply put. They really put life into the characters.
Well, I'll stop here. I'll only say that at some points along the movie I felt tears coming to my eyes, and I must make it clear that this not happens very often..",1010188800,2,1677,4.498360655737705

I've already seen it 3 times and plan on seeing it 3 more times.  I just loved everything about it.  It may be 3 hours long, but it feels more like 1 hour because it is filled with so much story.  I read and listened to the stories when I was just a little girl and they always filled me with such fascination.  Upon hearing that the movie was due out, I was thrilled yet wary.  I assumed they could never get close to the imagination and fantasy in those books, but I was WRONG!  Words just can't express how much I loved this movie.  I will definitely be first in line when it comes out on DVD.  And until the next installment comes out next Christmas, I'll be in a state of anticipation mixed with depression.  I CAN NOT wait till later this year.  Guess I'll just have to see this one over and over and over and over!  Anyway, if you have any doubts whatsoever about seeing it, don't hesitate.

1326586,5,B00003CWT6,"First off, I've never read any of Tolkien's books,  so this will be a totally unbiased review of the movie, free of any preconceptions on how the story should be adapted for the screen. I'm also not a fan of big-budget fantasy movies. I can honestly say that I stood in line and waited for this movie all because of marketing hype and nothing else.
And I am so glad that I let myself be taken by the hype because this movie more than delivers.
IT'S A MASTERPIECE!!
I'll have to apologize right away because I'll be using numerous superlatives to praise this movie.
I think this might be the first movie I've seen where all aspects of film-making are excellent.  Casting-wise, the actors were all tailor-made for their roles.  You simply cannot imagine other people in their place.  Ian McKellen brings authority and humanity to his Gandolf.  The only actor I know who equals his performance is that of Alec Guinness  as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the first Star Wars movie.  Elijah Wood is spot-on, the perfect Frodo. He deftly portrays the gradual changes in Frodo's character.  From innocent, frolicking young hobbit, to a confused character, fearful, yet at the same time brave in facing the enormity of his task, Wood never misses a step.  The supporting characters also shine.  Aragon's valor is  convincing in Viggo Mortensen's hands, while Sean Bean flawlessly portrays the conflicted character of Gorgon. Sean Astin and the two other actors who play Merry and Pippin are excellent buddies to Frodo.  These three stand out as unique characters instead of being the usual flat, dumb-dumb side-kicks seen in movies.  Liv Tyler and the always amazing Cate Blanchett are both regal and breathtaking as important otherworldly elves. I can't remember all of their names or their characters, but suffice it to say that this an ensemble cast that works perfectly together, yet all of them individually stand out.  Performance and a tight script contribute to this success.
As for the story, it is a well-developed and exciting journey which lets us sympathize with the characters while giving us the thrill of a lifetime.  Other reviewers have given thorough summaries so I will no longer attempt to do that here.  The story fuses all kinds of thought: mythic, philosophical, theological all into one meaty material.  In short...it's NEVER boring.  Even if you haven't read the book, you won't get lost.  The first five-minutes of the film is spent with a voice-over by the fantabulous Cate Blanchett relating the background and premise of the story.
NOw, onto the best part...the production.  I fear that I have no words to describe the grandeur and beauty of this movie.  Peter Jackson and his production team have created worlds that simply dazzle the eyes and take your breath away.  The sheer enormity of this movie makes you wonder how much work and imagination went into this film.  My poor jaw spent a good portion of this movie hitting the floor. There are so many ""oooooh"", ""aaaah"" and scary moments that your senses are in for a treat.  The music, before I forget, is also fab!  Its operatic sound is the perfect background for a grand epic like Lord Of The Rings.
The camera also moves rapidly in order to keep up with the raging battles.  But unlike in Baz Luhrmanns trashy Moulin Rouge, the frenetic camera movemets in LOTR are effective in increasing the tension and excitement.  In Moulin Rouge, it was excessive and unnecessary, bordering on pretentious (You can almost hear Baz Luhrmann saying ""Ooooh, look, I'm making ART!""). Totally shameless and annoying.  In LOTR, it enhances the movie because it is only used in appropriate moments.  I can't believe Time magazine called Moulin Rouge the second best picture of the year when LOTR is OBVIOUSLY FAR SUPERIOR.  Heck, LOTR has a story and is sublimely free of Nicole Kidman's wooden acting.
But I digress.
The best quality of this film is that, first and foremost, it gives importance to the story and the characters.  The CGI and other special effects, no matter how amazing, are only there as backdrops to the intricate plot.  You never feel as if you're being manipulated with a light show.  Instead, you feel as if you've been sumptously drawn into a world which you don't ever want to leave.  Despite its length of three hours, you leave the theater craving for more, while at the same time, feeling extremely satisfied.  It's hard to explain.  You'll just have to watch it.
In this age of DVD's, home theater systems and Pirated videos, it's becoming more difficult for filmmakers to convince the viewing public to stand in-line and wait outside theaters to watch a movie.  With LOTR, we are reminded once more how the medium of cinema can be so powerful and inspiring.
To Mr. Peter Jackson and his team....a big thanks! I'll definitely be the first in line for the Two Towers this December.",1010102400,3,4857,4.822463768115942
1326587,5,B00003CWT6,"Having never read the J.R.R. Tolkien books, or seeing the animated 1978 Ralph Bakshi film, I really did not know fully of what to expect before seeing THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. What I saw in the Lakewood Mall Theater tonight was amazing: Peter Jackson has created a whole world of fantasy, and so much more, with this film. Always somewhat of a mad genius, he first got attention (some would say notoriety) in, and eventually outside of, his native New Zealand by directing the ultra-gory and aptly titled horror-comedies BAD TASTE and DEAD ALIVE in the early 90's.  Then, he began to branch out with HEAVENLY CREATURES in 1994, which was a harrowing real-life murder drama. I'm not sure what else he did after that, but obviously, a lot of his time was spent in adapting his madcap genius to the epic, compelling vision of Tolkien.
This film has everything a great adventure/fantasy should have: A sense of wonder, a sense of danger, and a brand new world that we are watching for the very first time which totally sweeps the viewer away. Plus, it has wonderful cinematography, sound & sound effects, and visual effects.  The score is mesmerizing; it should win the Oscar in this category. Also, the acting is brilliant: Sir Ian McKellen (as the hulking Gandolf), Elijah Wood (as Frodo the Hobbit), Viggo Mortensen, and Cate Blanchett (in a small but spellbinding role) are all brilliant, and each has a shot at an Oscar nomination this year. The supporting players are likewise excellent.
Unfortunately, my experience in watching this cinematic triumph was marred by the family who sat right behind me who actually brought their 4- or 5-year-old to see it! Naturally (babies being babies), this kid made a lot of noise a lot of the time. (The adults, unfortunately, weren't much better!) I mean, really, this is *not* a film to take a young child to see. Under 10 is not recommended, let alone under 6! This film is rated PG-13, and it has some strong violence and genuinely scary moments. In fact, for what this film contains, it would've easily gotten an R-rating 10 years ago.
But enough of that: I loved this film. I think that it is a definite must-see on the big screen, and I will definitely buy it on DVD--and I might just get around to reading the books, too! :)",1010102400,2,2298,4.657635467980295
1326588,1,B00003CWT6,"Having read the books by J.R.Tolkein I came to the theatre with teeth clenched but hoping for the best. I expected some compacting, cutting, etc. but was totally unprepared for the hacking, sacking, and total corruption of the original story as seen in the screen play.  This looked more like a creature thriller than anything else and missed major story lines which leave many characters without understandable motivation. The distressing part of this is that I could see no reason for the change in the story line, i.e. it would have been as easy to keep to the true story line as wander off as the screen play did.
What is most frightening I suppose is that as disappointed and disillusioned as I am with the first movie I don't see myself going to see any of the rest.
Yes the scenery was wonderful and the special effects dazzling, but the story was greatly diminished and the orc battles perhaps a bit over the top. My 11 year old son put it best when he said that had the movie been made without the book it would have been exciting and enjoyable, but no one who appreciates Tolkein's books can find the film anything more than disappointing.
Having read the press about none of the actors knowing anything of the books before the movie was made, I now wonder about the screen writers and director as well.",1010102400,24,1313,4.540084388185654

I have not seen such a strong reaction since viewing Schindler's List.  The movie is approximately 3 hours long, and people were complaining that it wasn't enough...they wanted MORE.  Excellent acting and wonderful effects which simply enhance, but do not overpower this production.  PLEASE see this movie!",1010102400,,618,4.951456310679611
1326590,4,B00003CWT6,"After reading all the reviews & listening to movie critics, I decided to make my trip to the theater to check it out.  I wasn't really disappointed but I had really expected a little better.  Keep in mind that I go to the theater very seldom since I have a theater in my home.  I go for the LARGE screen cinema effect that the theater provides.  The copy that this theater had was defective in the respect that it had dust or something flicking on the left side of the screen, it was very distracting.  But on to the film, it was beautifully shot, the acting was flawless, as far as I could tell.  The movie was generally on the ""dark side"" and I would not recommend it for any child under the age of 10, and even then it would depend on the child (parents should know their children well enough to know weither very scary people (?) will keep them awake at night).  The first 1 1/2 hours goes by pretty quickly, but then it has spots that seem to drag.  There are definite spots that the music overpowers the dialog and you are straining to hear what it being said...(this seems to occur a lot lately, what is it with filmakers, the music is supposed to enhance the film, not define it.  Is it their way of getting you to come back to try once again to hear what is being said??)  The special effects are superb.  The storyline is good, but again spots that have you starting to look at your watch.  Of course, since this is a ""trilogy"" the ending keeps you hanging, not knowing for certain exactly what happens. This movie isn't ""perfect"" like I was led to believe, but when I left the theater, I didn't feel  like I had wasted my $7.50 either.  It's a movie worth seeing but not without flaws.",1010102400,,1696,4.259375

I saw the first couple of trailers, and thought... okay, it looks good, but don't get your hopes up.  It's going to be disappointing and it may even [stink]... (much like, say, ""Episode 1"".... sigh).  So, when the movie was finally released, I went to see it with fairly low expectations.
I was completely blown away!!  I felt like I was twelve years old again and watching ""Star Wars"" for the very first time.  This movie is fantastic.  I loved the story, I loved the visuals, the characters were perfect for the story (okay, so maybe Arwen was a little more zesty than she was in the book, get over it).  I have now seen it three times, and will more than likely see it again a couple more times before it leaves the theatres.  I dragged my Mom to see it when she came to town for the holidays.  My husband and I dragged my father-in-law and brother-in-law to see it when we went to see them after Christmas.  I love this movie.  It has easily earned a place in my top five favorite movies of all time, and I think it's the best movie I have seen in at least five years.

1326634,3,B00003CWT6,"Unlike most people, my adolescence and schooling did not include a reading of J.R.R. Tolkein's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which has garnered endless fans and followers since its publication began in 1954. And now, almost half a century later, New Line Cinema has released ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" which boasts some of the most sophisticated and dazzling special effects to date in creating a world of fantasy and gothic evil. In fact, much of the movie is composed primarily of special effects, which might also explain why the story, at 178 minutes, feels empty and devoid of entertainment.
Now mind you, books transfer to the screen with successful results all the time, from Hollywood's very beginning films to today's biggest blockbusters. ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" are two striking examples of adaptations done right, due much in part to their ability to make the movie entertaining for those who have read the novels on which they are based, and those who have not. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" fails to achieve this, and in effect, becomes long and drawn out.
The story casts Elijah Wood as Frodo, a hobbit who is left in possession of a gold ring long withheld by his town's eldest citizen, Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), whose age of 111 does not seem proportionate to his younger appearance. Frodo's mentor, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), informs him of the ring's history, reaching back to the annuls of a time when the evil Sauron sought world domination with his brutal armies, only to lose the ring in battle and disappear from the earth. Strange occurrences and a search party of faceless riders known as Ringwraiths can only mean the return of Sauron, who steadily regains his power, leaving Frodo only once choice: to return the ring to its place of origin, Mount Doom, located in the dark recesses of Mordor.
And so, after gathering a band of companions including friend Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin), Frodo sets out to complete his journey, unaware of the dangers that await him. Along the way, they meet Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), a strider with a knack for the sword, and various other characters ranging from all shapes and sizes and personalities. Some of these people provide some comic relief, while others maintain sinister intentions arising from the power of greed that the ring seems to emanate over them.
The cast does well with all of this, though I imagine much of their time was spent in front of a blue screen imagining the evils that surrounded their characters. Wood shows a sufficient mix of heroic courage and primal fear that keeps us in tune to Frodo's instincts and thoughts, while McKellan, with his gentle voice and learned appearance, was an ideal choice for Gandalf. Mortensen is not as ideal a hero as he could be, but his performance is serviceable enough; actresses Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett also make appearances, but they're hardly worth mentioning, as they grace the screen for less than ten minutes apiece. Other actors in the famed Fellowship of the Ring are given comical lines here and there, but that's the extent of the attention devoted to their characters.
The real star of the film is the stunning array of special effects, which give the notion that the movie is constantly trying to one-up itself through each new interpretation of the vast worlds and settings of Tolkein's fantasy yarn. The film has been quoted as ""a movie only modern technology could create,"" and for the most part, this statement rings true. Each new twist of the plot brings us a newly-fashioned and breathtaking visual effect: from the high-arched ceilings of the Mines of Moria, to the vast armies that storm the lands of Mordor in the opening sequence of the film, the movie is an eye-popping, sumptuous visual feast that audiences will surely eat up.
But, like the effects-vamped summer movie ""Pearl Harbor,"" there is no soul to its story, nothing with which to garner any interest in the characters or the events and twists. There is only a minor amount of suspense supplied in the action sequences, never really reaching the high-level intensity it so richly deserves. Characters come and go, some in the blink of an eye, some from beginning to end, though they're not very interesting, nor do they have much presence in the story. For a book that has been touted as ""the greatest fantasy epic of our time"" by many readers, the film should have had the ability to make the source material accessible to readers and non-readers of Tolkein.
The previews for ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" are not to blame entirely; the story is only vaguely presented, while the film's final hour is never revealed. Still, it managed to raise my expectations higher than normal, which is why I'm sitting here, discussing my thoughts on a movie that I didn't completely despise, but did not embrace wholeheartedly. To be sure, the movie will leaves its mark on history, as will its already-filmed sequels. This is serviceable entertainment at best, but I can't look at it as anything more than a lackluster blockbuster for the masses.",1010102400,3,5119,4.838084378563284

This movie is 3 hours long and, in my opinion, not nearly long enough. I didn't want it to end. Yes, things were cut out from the book but the balance between content and length was nicely carried out.
The movie is violent but not as violent as the books. Anyone who had a problem with sword fighting should probably not be seeing a fantasy movie. The movie is rated PG-13 for a reason so please stop complaining that it was too violent for your 9 year old.
The movie ends abruptly. It is the first book in a trilogy. If you read the books you'll find that the first book ends much more abruptly than the movie. Just realize that there are two more parts coming out, so don't freak out at the cliffhanger ending.
I felt that the movie was cast brilliantly with stars who are known not for their popularity, but for their acting talent. The special effects are the best that any movie in this genre has ever pulled off. The adaptation from the books is done with care and reverence, although some people will miss Tom Bombadil, the barrow-downs, and some other minor plot enrichments.
Definitely a must-see...  and a must-read.",1010102400,,1304,4.3884297520661155

Before I saw the movie I thought that Gwynth Paltrow would have made an excellant Galadriel but Cate Blanchett was the perfect choice. And Gollum! Geeze, he looked awsomely freeky!

Bagend, Rivendell, Lothlorien -perfect.  He has captured the heart and spirit of the work but has not lost sight of the fact that, at its core, it is simply a ripping, gripping tale. Sean Bean turns in a heart-wrenching performance as Boromir, a character that has always eluded my understanding until this film.  The film is a revelation.  Even my friends who have not read the books have come away from the movie with a sense of awe.

1326639,3,B00003CWT6,"Before you read my review, let first say that i'm not against watching this movie; in fact, giving it a watch is a good idea -- But when people start calling this movie ""great,"" well that's where I disagree.  So with that, here's my review:
  ~*~
Review written by: justmarvn@hotmail.com
Whether or not Jackson's movie was improperly structured (following the paradigm three-act structures most movies use), I personally found it painful to sit through. I agree with this person when she stated that ""the first hour or so was charming - I loved the visuals and Ian McKellen. But then it seemed to become the same old thing - chase after chase, swordfight after swordfight -I was hoping the evil empire (or whatever it was!) would get the darn ring and kill all those annoying midgets. At the end the audience looked numb and a bit bewildered at what all the fuss was about. It was three hours and it felt even longer!"" (PB, Austria)
""I felt that the movie changed the artistic simplicity and subtlety of Tolkien's work into a Hollywood hack and slash, 'magical' adventure. Yes, I know I'm just another Tolkien purist but we're entitled to our opinions too."" (Faith, USA)
""Let's not kid ourselves. I was so pumped for this movie, and so let down. I can only imagine that those who enjoyed it were rationalizing or really don't have anything better to do for three-plus hours."" (Robert Rimaviscus, USA)
""The film is just a tad too fast - a four-hour film would have done me fine. I don't know how someone who is unfamilair with the story would feel, but, I suppose, a little lost. We hurtle from big scene to big scene before we can feel something. There is little chance for character development, and that is a huge part of the books."" (Stephen, Malaysia)
""I thought LOTR was torture - far too long to sit through all in one go. I could have done with a 15-minute break halfway through. The first five minutes were superb, then it went downhill....you get some really annoying dwarves who I really couldn't care about. I wished they all could have been wiped out early on. There were quite a few people who left the hall and didn't return - I couldn't blame them. I may be in the minority, but I won't be returning to the cinema to see the next two parts..."" (Massimo Stefani, Paisley, Scotland)
""I have been a Tolkien reader since 1958 and had to rebind my books about 10 years ago owing to the wear from re-reading. The books are magic. The film is not. I got bored after the first hour."" (Ernie Smart, UK)
""But the film lacked any real depth of character, lurched around like an MTV music video, and had no cohesion at all. ...I can't really believe the accolades this film has received and honestly think that regardless of the similarities with the book (or lack of), this film will be judged much harder in the course of time on low cinematic merit alone."" (Jo, Canada)
Ok, ok... I bet you had enough quotes about now. I'll stop there. So you're wondering what's my problem right? Well for those who simply want goo-goo-ga-ga cinematic special effects accompanied by hack-and-slashes and trinkets of cool looking heroes ~ then fine, this film is for you. But call me a nut, when I see a film I want to be totally involved ~ I want all my senses to be drawn out by the film ~ I want the film to play with my emotions and actually make me feel and leave the theatre still feeling. Oh,well I guess you could say I did feel something watching lotr ~ it was my butt cramping up while sitting through that film for three hours.
The big drawback in any movie I believe is characterization. I'm no expert, and probably have a long way to go before I could even develop a movie especially one with great characters ~ but it doesn't take a genius to distinguish the hack-and-slash from the soul-filled.
I wasn't drawn to the movie Lotr Fotr for alot of reasons--it was boring. First of all I felt that they lacked alot of the elements of a visual moving story such as suspense--instead, you are constantly bombarded with all these different events that seem to be something like a compilation of some kinda tv miniseries. As PB from Austria said, ""...it seemed to become the same old thing - chase after chase, swordfight after swordfight -I was hoping the evil empire (or whatever it was!) would get the darn ring and kill all those annoying midgets.""
Second of all, the characterizations are so perfuntory that I never cared whether any of the characters lived or died. Gandolf plummets to his doom *snore*. I think the characters better justifies themselves imprinted on the front side of the taco-bell and burger king cups then on the wide-screen.
Third of all, in part because the characters were like cardboard cut-outs, I found no soul in anything the movie had to offer. Really, the whole thing with the fellowship group was so superficial and their motivation was either poorly conveyed or it was alltogether just plain trite and lame.
I expected more from a movie based on a story authored by ""the father of fantasy"" tolkien. The movie was mainly plot-oriented, but c'mon the plot itself was so mundane. Where were the twists? The irony? The surprise? Anyways, from what i've come to know, plot-oriented movies tend to fall a long ways back. You see, great movies are developed by great characters. Movies need great characters to be great, period.
I could go on and on, but to conclude, a person in the movie-biz said, ""There are really only two kinds of movies in the world: the kind where your butt burns and the kind where your butt doesn't burn. That's it."" You'll have to excuse the language, but this movie burned my butt. I squirmed around to and fro wondering when the movie would end, and when it did end--Oh, don't even get me started on how a movie should end.
If you want to see a good fantasy film i found ""The Mists of Avalon"" (though it may contain some objectionable content ~ viewer discretion advised) to be worth the watch (like lotr, it's also based on a novel; this one by Marion Zimmer Bradley). Though a lowbudget film that most likely did not have a fraction of the amount LotR spent in the making, it had an extroardinary plot (oh i loved the twists and the surprises) accompanied with exquisite characters.

Or perhaps you can get a hold of my favorite classic film--Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet starring 17 year old Leonard Whiting and 15 year old Olivia Hussey. The cast is superb and the theme song will leave you enchanted for days.
Just my two cents :)",1010102400,,6514,4.564957264957265
1326640,5,B00003CWT6,"The film was wonderful.  I loved every minute.  It was incredible seeing the book which means so much to me come to life before my eyes.  I feel Peter Jackson did a wonderful job at capturing the spirit of the greatest epic ever written.  Although I missed some of Tolkien's unmatched dialouge,  the film honored the integrity of the book.  Aside from everything, the unbelievable beauty of the film was incredible.  Simply outstanding.",1010102400,,436,4.890410958904109
1326641,5,B00003CWT6,"Briefly...
I must admit that I was totally skeptical about the movie since I have read the books three times over a twenty-year time span.  Each time I read the books, I appreciated them even more than the last.
So it was with heavy heart as I made my way to see the movie, as I was sure to be disappointed.  How could the movie possibly capture the spirit of the book(s)?
Well, it did; it was absolutely magnificent!
Of course, it wasn't perfect either, but what can you expect from a movie that tries to capture a book of this magnitude in less than three hours?
My favorite aspect?  It's a tough decision, but if you twist my arm and make me cry `uncle' (..where did that saying come from?), I would have to choose the characters and how they looked from Gandalf to all the Mordor-creatures; stupendous!  For example, the Orcs were much more gruesome/fearsome than I imagined, and they were so realistic...
To sum it up: WOW!",1010102400,,928,4.4411764705882355
1326671,5,B00003CWT6,"At first I wasn't sure what to expect,but by the time I reached the point where Gandalf and Frodo greeted each other with a hug. It had me hook,line,and sinker. I was extremely curious about everything,it was thought provoking. It had me on the edge of my seat waiting for what was going to happen next. The bad thing was that it repeated things a little too often. Besides that it was awesome. I can't wait to see the rest of them. Thank you for taking time out to read this. If you haven't seen it,GO see it. No matter what reviews you may have read before. The effects will amaze you,and the fighting scenes will too. The rest is wonderful too. Those are the things I like most about the movie.",1010102400,,697,4.287878787878788
1326672,5,B00003CWT6,"The film was magnificent.
I appreciated the areas in which Mr. Jackson slightly deviated from the book, in particular with regard to Arwen.
I don't recall a ""Supreme Being"" in Middle Earth, but in the flight to Rivendell, it was as if Arwen ""prayed"" to Something for herself, and for Frodo's life. She imparted to Frodo whatever power and ""grace"" she possessed.  She demonstrated courage and showed compassion for the wounded Hobbit.  Mr. Wood perfectly conveyed the humility with which he carried the hope of all free peoples in Middle Earth.  Arwen's ""prayers"" were heard and answered.
The amplification of Arwen's character was was a great idea, and Liv Tyler's interpretation was moving.  This will come in handy in Part Three, ""The Return of the King.""  The stage has now been set for a possible marriage between Aragorn and Arwen.  By then, we'll love and admire Aragorn for his heroism and nobility.  We'll want his bride to be worthy of his love.  Thanks to Ms. Tyler's brave and compassionate Arwen, we'll want any groom to be worthy of HER love as well.
Finally, it was great to see and hear from Sauron in the movie.  In my first reading of the trilogy, I kept hoping Sauron would make an appearance in one form or another.  In my view, his ""no show"" was one of the few disappointments in the book.  I wanted to hear from this Bad Guy who was wreaking so much havoc in Middle Earth.  Maybe Professor Tolkien wanted to leave him to the imagination of the reader, but it would have been fun to read some dialogue from such a pivotal character.  I'm hoping Mr. Jackson and crew will give us more of Sauron.  I have a hunch they'd do a superb job.
Yep, this is a movie I'll see over and over again, and it will be difficult to wait for the next two installments.",1010016000,,1769,4.504702194357367

Visually this is movie is perfect, and the adaptation of Tolkien's classic story is wonderful. I just cannot wait until the second installment of the trilogy comes out (DECEMBER 18TH!!!). Don't think that you're a dork if you like this movie. Just think that you have good taste. Afterall, that's what would be true!",1010016000,,449,4.69620253164557
1326674,5,B00003CWT6,"I liked this movie, although it was nearly 3 hours the time is well spent.  you walk in the theater, sit down, and then you begin a unending journey into the lives of hobbits, elves, dwarves, men, and wizards.  Although everything isn't exact I think crunch time prevented every little detail being added.  I think that descent work was done.  The music is wonderful...the book brought to life is very wonderful.
The Cinematography is awesome.  Watching the movie you can actually see certain things so vivid you feel like you are there.  Looking up at Orthnac I felt like I was there...everything felt very real.  I think that Peter Jackson did a wonderful job and the actors that were chosen very well chosen as well.  Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, orlando Bloom (first picture of his I have seen...but still good as Legolas)  Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKeallan, and Chirstopher Lee make for a very good line up of actors with a Classic tale of good and evil.  Well planned I give it five stars and I think that nothing can compare to it...unless of course there's harry potter...(LOL)  *just kidding*  But it's cool too....lol
I think anyone who likes Tolkien should see it for nostagias sake even if they don't like it.  It's the experience that counts.",1010016000,,1248,4.722222222222222
1326675,5,B00003CWT6,"The film was extraordinary. It completely filled my expectationes. The story: Frodo recieves a mysterious ring from his uncle Bilbo. Soon Frodo discovers the true nature of the ring, it was made by the Dark Lord Sauron, and now Suaron is seeking it to renew his power and enslave the world. Frodo goes on in a journey with nine MOSTLY faithful companions set from Rivendell to destroy the ring. The acting was terrific, and so were the special effects. Jackson pays both attention to the acting and the special effects, and succeeds without doubt. Viggo Mortensen is also terrific as Aragorn, Sean Bean also great as Boromir. Wood I think also did an awesome job of potraying Frodo. Ian M. probably was the best choice for Gandalf.
The action scenes are terrific and fast, Legolas is probably the one who outstands in the battle scenes with his fast bow. Many parts of the book were left out. I really didn't care that Tom Bombadil wasn't in the movie, it was kind of a smart move since Tom really didn't fit in the story. Sections from Lothorien were also left out. But I mean, the movie was still 3 hours long, if you include every detail you would get a 5 hour movie.
Those who haven't read the books will also find if awesome, since at the beginning of the movie a prologue explains everything you need to know to understand the movie.
The most excited anticipation I have for the next two movies, are to see the vile creature Gollum for the first time, since he is shown very seldom and we really coudn't have a clear glimpse of him here in FOTR. I hope he is as scary and pittyful as he is in the book.
Well, I've told you all you need to know. You must see the movie definitely by all means.

From that point on the plot goes meet one bad guy, vanquish the bad guy, meet the next bad guy, vanquish that bad guy. It seemed endless. No plot twists. No surprises. The villains are all conventional looking monsters. The orchs look like they were cobbled together from a half dozen horror movies.

This is typical Hollywood. Gorgeous set design, powerful vistas, wonderful costuming and an absolute hack-job of a story! True to form, the screenwriter boiled all of the nuance out of the story and left only the A to B to C nature of the plot. Tom Bombadil is completely left out, as is Gildor and Glorfindel. Elrond is portrayed as a haughty and vengeful elf, a far cry from Tolkien's venerable loremaster. But worst of all, Aragorn, shown in the movie as a would be king hiding from his own destiny. HIDING!!! Aaaaaaarrrgh! They didn't even reforge the ""sword that was broken!!!"" Peter Jackson needs to be slapped all the way back to New Zealand.

1326679,4,B00003CWT6,"I've never read The Lord of the Rings. My wife and I read its prequel, The Hobbit, a few years ago, so I imagined the film of the first book of the Rings trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring) would be something like that -- a kids' adventure story, full of strange places and creatures, bold deeds, and maybe a few somewhat scary monsters.
But Rings is not, at heart, an adventure story, nor a kids' story, nor an ""action"" story, nor a fantasy of the sort those of us who have grown up only on its reputation have come to expect. It is a war story, and a tale of horror. It is full of fear and violence and death, hacking and stabbing, soot and muck and cauterizing fire, destruction, monsters, and bleakness. Major characters die unexpectedly and terribly. While interspersed with green oases of peace and tranquillity, it is tale of a relentless march into deep dismay. And at the end, the worst is yet to come.
My wife hated it, and it's hard to say I enjoyed it. Can you enjoy a war movie like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, or Full Metal Jacket? (Or even Aliens?) That's the kind of film Lord of the Rings is. Sure, there is bravery and goodness, but under a constant barrage of sickness and evil. The war fought by the Fellowship is necessary, but far from noble. It is desperate, tragic, and soaked in blood as the world turns into a desolate wasteland.
That makes sense, since J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the books during wartime. There are obvious parallels between the enemies of the Rings tales and the Nazis, and between the dark power of the Ring and the corrupting lures of fascism and communism in Tolkien's time. But of course, the story resonates now too, as it did for those in the time of the Vietnam War thirty years ago.
The film is a spectacular technical and storytelling achievement. It includes some of the most frightening monsters ever filmed, battle scenes of both shocking immediacy and massive scale, and interludes of lushness and greenery as bucolic as anything in Babe (which had the same cinematographer). There's a lot going on at many levels -- not least the idea that the small and the meek may be the strongest in times of great trial. Light and darkness represent good and evil, but sometimes the tables are turned -- darkness may be a safe hiding place, while a distant light could be the worst thing in the world.
Don't take your young kids: they'll have nightmares. If you're looking for a good-time escape at the movies, well, try Harry Potter (with the kids) or Ocean's Eleven (without). I think that's what we'll see next time we get a babysitter. I am certainly glad I saw The Fellowship of the Ring, exhausting as it was, and I'll see its two sequels when they arrive. I'll need the twelve-month break before the next one, though.",1010016000,4,2768,4.538
1326710,5,B00003CWT6,"I have been an avid Tolkien reader since I was twelve years old. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable, regarding the Middle Earth. So in saying that, I have also followed the bringing of the story to the Theaters. I had high expectations, but had great confidence in the making of it, more from the sense of felling then actual facts about it. Needless to say I saw the movie (3 time in one week - and will continue to see it again and again), I loved every bit as much of the movie as I did of the book. They compliment each other, the movie has awesome visuals of what Middle Earth could be, as well as candy to the eyes, and the book has all the detailed information to satisfy the imagination, and the mind. I think the Major Cinemas should come out with a information booklet for the viewers to guide them with a map and character information and bios (for non- Tolkien fans), my sister had never read the book before, so even after her second trip to the movies, she still got confused with names and locations.",1010016000,,1019,4.340314136125654
1326711,3,B00003CWT6,"There's no way FOTR could've fit into 3 hours, so I don't blame Jackson for the shortness of the movie.  I enjoyed the vistas, the loyalty in the fellowship, and the humor (""What about second breakfast?""). But I did feel somewhat cheated by the movie for these reasons:
1. Storytelling. The events are pretty much straight, but that's not what makes a good adaptation. The movie revealed too much, too soon, because it told the story from 3rd person, and told the events in chronological order. The book keeps us guessing and only reveals as much as Frodo and the fellowship knows. The narrated scene at the beginning need not have been told if Gandalf told it later (while the screen fades to a flashback scene). That would be much more convincing.
2. Hobbits are made out to be bumbling and unskilled. Frodo drops his sword on at least 2 occasions. Pippin knocks the skeleton into the well (yes, it kinda happened in the book, but it was NOT the catalyst for the coming of the Orcs). Merry and Pippin are carried away by the Orcs without a fight at the end.
3. Important scenes were changed or omitted. What happened to Frodo's elaborate plan to leave on his birthday? The book was more organized and relaxed; plus Merry and Pippin did NOT just bump into Frodo and Sam by chance. Didn't Frodo have the ring on a chain while Gandalf was off researching? He didn't keep it in the envelope! Where was the growing friendship between Legolas and Gimli?
4. Skewed concept of time. Wasn't it about 20 years between the departures of Bilbo and Frodo? Where's the sense of the journey? The movie went from danger to danger, with intermissions of walking. The book was more balanced between rest and danger. And yes, the book had many happy times and songs to show for it.
I came into the theater after hearing that this could be among the top 10 movies of 2001. To me, it wasn't mediocre, just not nearly as captivating as the book.",1010016000,,1925,4.531609195402299

ANYWAY..........
I am 12 years old and I have never read the books, but i wasn't confused OR bored by this movie.  It had everything a good adventure, action movie movie should,
ROMANCE,ACTION,ADVENTURE,SCARY MOMENTS and even COMEDY.
I saw the movie on the 1st and on the 2nd I bought all the books.
As a matter of fact i have one next to me right now as i am writing this.
Oh ya another thing, that guy who wrote that there is a bunch of things in the movie on drugs and sex, THAT IS A LIE.  When the hobbits picked the mushrooms it NEVER crossed my mind that they were going to use the as heroine or anything.  and their is NOTHING about sex in the movie, thats for SURE.
I would recomend this movie for people ages ~*~12 and up~*~  since some moments are kind of scary.

The Lord of the Rings movie was, to me, tied with Harry Potter as the best movies I saw in the year 2001.

I have very much enjoyed the books. they are the classic of fanasy books. i have seen the animated movies which are good, with some exeptions. when i saw the trailer to this movie i knew i would like it. i was right. from begining to end this was a great movie. it had a nice texture with its look and feel to it. dirty finger nails, dirty tables, and so on that gave it a lived in look. the movie has the basics of the story. it does cut out some parts but that is to be expectied. i mean it is three hours long! it looked close to the way i imagined it when i read the book. the nazgul looked good. the balrog was exilent! saruon's eye was good. ian mcellen was good as gandalf. elisah was ok as frodo. even lee was good as the evil wizard (he is not good in some movies). the orc looked good as well and also the urak ahai. there are some visual let downs. the shadow realm when frodo puts on the ring does not look good ( expept the nazgul pale kings look good). when gladrial is temted by the ring and turns dark that looked hooky. however it was a very good movie preserving the sprit of tolkine. i cant wait for the sequils. i hope they do a live action version of the hobbit.",1010016000,,1289,3.9806949806949805

What I really loved about it is that at the end of the movie it had me beggen for more. In some parts it made me want to laugh, cry, and also with the cave troll it made me want to jump out of my seat. My favorit actors were Elijah Wood, and Orlando Bloom.

Certainly a labor of love for all involved, it shows what can be done when a filmization of a novel is given to a great director (Jackson, of Heavenly Creatures fame) and an excellent cast. Sean Bean (as the honorable, but corrupted Boromir) and Ian Mckellan (as the always dependable Gandalf) stand out in a cast of great performances.
This is a film that takes you completely to another place and time and does it with complete believability and instills everything with what a fantasy film needs most: conviction.

I enjoyed the movie it has great special effects and great story line.
Tho the theater i saw it at was a little out of focus.
I know its one hell of a story to fit into 3 hours.
I went into the movie hoping to find out a bit more about Tom Bombardil but was very dissapointed that they left it out. I was hoping they would shed some light on who he might be.
Tom is for me any way one of the big misteries of all the 3 books.
The whole Barrow Whites thing would have fitted in perfectly.
Hopefully its a deleted scene on the DVD.
Still if you haven't read the book this movie is as good as they come but what movie maker could live up to a good imagination.
Listening to the people as they came out of the movie some were disapointed some loved it. It was about 50 50.
Bottom line is its stil a great flick with a great story so go see it. Probably the best fantasy film every made.",1009929600,,885,3.868131868131868

I cried, I think I actually screamed aloud, and I walked out begging the skies for the second movie to come out sooner! For all of the movie's 3 hour length, you will quite possibly feel it's just not enough. This movie is no ordinary movie. Its power transports you to the land of Middle-Earth, where all of J.R.R Tolkien's magic comes to life. The movie follows the journey of the hobbit Frodo who lives in a sleepy village in the Shire. He inherits a magic ring from his cousin Bilbo. This is no ordinary ring, my friend. it holds the power of invisibility, and was made by the Dark Lord Sauron as a tool to enslave the peoples of Middle-Earth: 'One Ring to rule them all' says the language inscribed in fire on the Ring. Sauron wants the Ring again, but he was destroyed in a battle thousands of years back. Frodo learns of this from the Wizard Gandalf, and he must leave the Shire. His destination is Mount Doom in Mordor, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. He aqquires companions on his way, called 'The Fellowship of the Ring' a group comprised of the free-peoples of the wondrous Middle-Earth who have set out to destroy this Ring together.

The only, slight dissapointment is the absence of Tom Bombadil, but that's not big enough to nudge my ratings.  I recommend this for tolkien fans.

1326745,5,B00003CWT6,"This was a brilliant rendition of Tolkin's Fellowship of the Ring. It was amazing how Jackson was able to keep so much of the origional book in the movie. Many times, in other movies based on books, important parts get cut out and silly irrelvant parts get put in, not in this movie. They changed very little and added very little. Arwen, added for gender equality, was just fine, she didn't distroy the story or make it sappy. I have to admit the romance scene with Aragorn just didn't seem to go with the flow of the story and plot, but it showed Aragorn's charcter and I guess they needed it to get romance lovers to the movie. But that part was small and it was just a miniture discomfort to me.
  The choice of Elijah Wood as Frodo was a excellent one. Viggo Mortenson also was brilliant was Aragorn. I can't believe that they could get such perfect people to play the parts. Excelent casting! All the characters were just as I imagined and as Tolkin described.
  Jackson didn't focus on the special effects, it was the acting that made the movie, not the effects. And because of it, the movie seemed more real and more about the feelings and reactions of the characters than about impressing the audiance with special effects.
So, if you haven't already, GO SEE THIS MOVIE! And also, if you haven't already, READ THE BOOKS! I can't wait for the other movies!",1009929600,,1364,4.487903225806452

 Fellowship of the Rings was absolutely amazing. The acting, the directing, the camera work, the effects . . . everything was just pure awe. This movie basically sets up the series, introducing the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" which will be the ones who will save mankind, fairykind, elfkind, and all the other kind who are good. The Fellowship consisted of a group of 9 who all have their own backstory.  The actors (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, and more) portray their characters heartfelt. You begin to care for every one. I've got to note Liv Tyler in her short role. She was beautiful and did very well with it. I've read her role will be expanded in the second movie, and I'm glad of it. Cate Blanchett was also mesmerizing as the Elfen Galadriel. Peter Jackson, the director, did a very good thing with this movie. He's made a classical epic.
 After seeing the movie, I'm very tempted to read the book. I'm sure to become a big fan of The Lord of the Rings.",1009929600,,1134,4.411483253588517

  For the first few chapters of the lord of the rings, you might as well be reading the script for the movie,they folowed it so closely, but from then on things are Quite different. The director did leave a few things out and twisted things around but I think the minor ajustments were perfect!
  For small children this movie is very scary! It's very intense! (The little girl beside me was crying) So use your own judgment about weather or not your children are mature enough or not!
  For being based on a book I think the writers did a very good job but keep in mind that no movie can completly match your own ideas or views of this book. Don't go to this movie if you're going to be that critical of the movie, go to enjoy it for what it is!!! In conclusion my only complaint is that this movie was way too short!

1326749,5,B00003CWT6,"What Peter Jackson accomplished in FOTR was more than simply adapting Tolkien's epic saga to the Big Screen. Jackson has brightened the future in the area of Fantasy movie-making.  Without movies like LOTR and Harry Potter, could fantasy lovers ever dream of seeing more than the average disappointment in this genre.

  Peter Jackson's brilliant infusion of enriched storytelling, multidimensional characters, and breathtaking cinematography was an accomplishment that has not received enough credit from both close minded critics and fantasy buffs. It was extant throughout the film that he loved the book far better than the money he was making.
  It always amazes me how such clever planning and artful screenplay adaptation can be robbed of all their glory by the shortsighted critic.  Some reviews (the New Yorker's for example) seemed to criticize the book more than the movie. It was clear in that review that the columnist hadn't even bothered to read the books, for he claimed that Jackson made a sexist movie by not giving greater roles to the females. Tolkien's books had even less female parts than the movie.
  The exclusion of Tom Bombadil angered so many fans because it enriched the description of Tolkien's envisioned countryside and also because it provided arguably the greatest enigma of the whole trilogy. Yet who is to know how it would have affected the film? Those scenes with Tom Bombadil in the book are some of my greatest loved, but as far as movies go, FOTR was not created solely for the enjoyment of the well-read fan. It coincided with Tolkien's intentions to touch people everywhere and of every age.
  As to the extended action scenes, both arguments are valid concerning their length and graphicness. Tolkien was certainly not out to create a second rate action story, but neither was Jackson. Without continual reminders of the terror that encompassed the quest, those who hadn't read the books would perceive the movie as drifting into superficiality.
  Costumes and set design were perhaps the most risky area of planning. However, this is where Jackson's articulate direction emerged throughout the film, adding to the praise he has not fully receive yet. The constant pipe-smoking was an excellent example of the rustic, carefree lifestyle that both hobbits and humans enjoyed.",1009929600,,2318,5.149333333333334
1326800,4,B00003CWT6,"I think that this movie can be a great experiance for anyone. My friend and I have just seen the movie and he has never read the book, yet he understood everything that happened. The effects where wonderful, and the landscape was absolutly amazing! The movie also followed the book with great presision.

It seems to me that there where no flaws or mistakes in the movie, and that nothing was overlooked. The only problem I could spot was that the elven archer Legolas ""whom of which many of the battle scenes focus on"" would fire one million arrows a minute, but at the end of the battle he would still have a full quiver.
It makes me angry when I hear people saying that the movie was slow or boring. Or that it didn't have enough good parts. These are people who don't have enough brains to follow a simple plot, or only like to see action and not actually have to understand the movie. These types of people should stick to Jackie Chan movies if all they want is fighting. The lord of the rings however, DID have LOTS of GOOD battle scenes.
I recommend this move to anyone who is mature enough to handle some excitment and a good time.",1009929600,,1139,4.347417840375587
1326801,4,B00003CWT6,"I thought they did an nearly perfect job of puting it on the screen. The only complaint that I had with any of the special affects was is consistency. They used CGI to make the actors playing hobbits shorter. Most of the time they are about the size of an 11 year old, then they will do a father away shot and you will see little people the size of 5 year olds running across the screen. It takes you a moment to realize that those are supposed to be the hobbits from the previous shot. Also, the orcs are not consistent in the way they look. Sometimes they are sort of scrawny with droplet shaped heads. Other times they are big and heavy with squarish, totem shaped heads.
I don't really care for Elijah Wood, but he does an adequate job. Gandalf, Strider, and Bilbo are all played to perfection.
The sets are phenominal with the huge, crumbling statues in nearly every scene. The shire is perfect with its squat little hobbit houses. The dark riders ver well done, mysterious and terrifying. The Moria scenes are the very best part of the show, with the Balog chase being utterly breath taking.
The biggest problem with the movie is the story itself. I always thought the book that it is based on had problems. The fantasy setting is excellent, the overall backdrop of a dark warlord seeking an artifact to control the world is good too. The scene to scene story, however, is long littany of the characters run here, the characters run there, and it gets very tiresome. It is a long meandering tale, most of which bears no relevance to the rest of the book. You could cut out large sections of it without losing any story.
Since this is a very faithful adaptation, nearly all of those long trivial parts are duplicated in the movie. After the Balrog scene is over, I sat there for another hour wishing the movie would hurry up and wrap up.
I think it is definitely worth a trip to the movie house, and I will go to see the next two, but I will enjoy them better on DVD when I can watch the good stuff and jump past the boring, long winded parts.",1009929600,,2048,4.349869451697128

Sure there were some dead guys chasing the Hobbit trying to steal a ring (sounds real exciting doesnt it), but I think I laughed at parts not intended for laughing...  The movie is 3 hours long on top of that, at the end of the film I proclaimed that I would very much want to be thrown into that volcano with that stupid ring than sit through the other 2 sequels. So save yourself the cash and the rear sore from sitting so long, and buy yourself the book instead. Unless that isn't worth reading, I wouldnt know because I never read it, I wasted enough of my time watching the movie. That is why this movie gets 2 stars, for my 2 chuckles I had during the movie.",1009929600,2,784,4.157894736842105
1326803,5,B00003CWT6,"Fanboys and girls of the anal-retentive sort need not apply.  Really, I'm serious here.  Don't go if you're going to whine about how this word got changed or that character is no longer in the story, because you'll drive yourself and everyone around you mad within about ten minutes.  I also say this because I want to make a point about the difference between a novel and a film, a difference that a lot of people never seem to grasp.  While some folks might want to see a twelve or fifteen hour mini-series in which we watch every step out of the Shire, every meal and listen to every talking head at the council of Elrond, the audience, even among true fans would be very limited.  What reads well does not always film well and vice versa.  Decisions were made and for the most part I think they were made well.  Cutting Tom Bombadil was very sensible, IMO, since there's almost no way to film him without turning him (at best) into one of those quaint, goofy characters you find in so many monster movies of the thirties and early forties.  At worst...well there wouldn't be a dry seat in the house.  Replacing Glorfindel with Arwen on the flight to Rivendell was an excellent choice because it lets us see an Arwen who is not only her father's daughter but a worthy mate for Aragorn.  And Glorfindel never appears again so what's really lost?  These choices make good dramatic sense, and for better or worse, a filmmaker has to think along dramatic lines not literary ones.  It's true that I wish more time could have been given to some things, but I also believe that it's possible that many of these issues will be used to good dramatic advantage in the second and third films.
As to the film that is, as opposed to the one that might have been, I have a tremendous amount of admiration for Peter Jackson and his crew for having pulled off what I thought would be an almost impossible task.  They've made a film which, while it remains true to the spirit of the book, is very accessible.  The hard work shows here in every scene, though never intrusively.  The sets just look right, they have an air of reality, of age and even decay.  The casting is spot-on in most cases, and the casting of Elijah Wood as Frodo was masterful.  I've never been a fan of his but I have nothing but admiration for the way he's played a very difficult role so far.
The camera work can be a bit intense, I admit, rushing from sharp close-up to vast vista and back.  It can be dizzying, especially if you're sitting towards the front of the theater.  And some of the extreme close-ups (the ones which let you count the pores in people's noses) are overwhelming.  But the lighting of the film is superb, with each choice having a meaning and setting the mood perfectly.
One of the biggest stumbling blocks to any fantasy that includes non-human creatures, is how those creatures come across.  I found the choices pretty consistently good.  The Orcs are almost a textbook illustration of the word ""abomination"" so when Sauruman recounts the story of how they were orginally created from captive Elves, you see the resemblance, and it becomes all that much more awful.  The Balrog, which could have been merely laughable, was genuinely fearsome.  (Here comes something the Orcs are afraid of; we are in deep trouble!)
Frankly, it would take a much longer review to do justice to this film.  The best I can say to you is this:  If you're not a rigid purist, then go.  Enjoy it.  Don't feel even remotely guilty for liking what's up there on the screen.  It's a good film and that's the best we could have hoped for.  If you're new to the story, you may find yourself a bit lost from time to time, but it shouldn't be a bar to enjoying the film.  And perhaps you'll decide to read the book afterwards.  Either way, think of the film and the book as complimentary entities, the one informing the other.  You can enjoy either or both if you can set aside expectations and concentrate on what is there on the screen for us.
Highly recommended.",1009929600,,4022,4.480769230769231
1326804,4,B00003CWT6,"The first installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy is fantastically realized, lushly shot, and as intense as a three hour movie can get. Elijah Wood is convincing as Frodo Baggins,the good-natured and stout-hearted hobbit who unwillingly comes into the possession of the ring tht can rule the world.  Ian McKellan portrays a wise and kindly Gandalf with so much humanity that the viewer needs him as much as Frodo does.  The other actors likewise inhabit their roles with confidence, although none quite as distinctively.
The scenery, both manufactured and real (shot in New Zealand), serves as a convincing Middle Earth.  Even the music contributes powerfully to the overall effect (save a ""Titanic""-like flute piece to accompany a water scene near the end.)
So why only four stars?  Because this utterly accomplished film fails to deliver any kind of resolution.  I understand this is but one of three movies already shot; still, I strongly believe each should be able to stand on its own as a separate work.  Otherwise, it's a nine hour movie to be released over three years.  Even though the action itself could not be resolved, there should have been some kind of emotional resolution to give the viewer a firm sense of why it ended where it did.  Instead, the credits start rolling after perhaps one of the most banal lines of the entire three hours. I wasn't the only person in the theater to say, ""Is that ALL?""
Even so, this is a movie not to be missed.  Once all three films are available, you will be glad to have seen the first installment.  People have compared this to ""Harry Potter"", also released this season, but ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" aims for, and achieves, a much higher level of film making.
(Parents note:  This movie is not for elementary school children, even those accustomed to violent fare. The intensity of evil and fear can be nearly overwhelming.)",1009929600,,1887,4.79320987654321
1326805,2,B00003CWT6,"I went to this movie expecting that the movie makers would take liberties with the plot and character's personalities.  They always try to ""improve"" the original.  I had heard of the changes made to Arwen's character, but I was totally unprepared for the corruption of the other personalities as well.  For anyone who is an ardent fan of the Lord of the Ring trilogy, I would think they would be very unhappy with how this interpretation was handled.  The only positive comments I can make are that 1) the film locations were very good; 2) that the special effects were also very good; and 3) the ""nationalites"" of the characters were accurate.  At least they didn't make Gandalf an elf or Bilbo a dwarf.  Other than that, I feel that the screenwriters must have only read the crib notes for The Lord of the Rings, or they read it with one eye closed!  No one could have read this magnificent creation and so badly missed the meanings and character's relationships!  Gandalf was depicted as almost senile; Aragorn was a confused, unfocused wimp; Elrond was cast as a mean-spirited and bitter host not inclined to be of any help; Frodo a gutless wonder; Galedriel as a sinister ""witch""; and poor Bilbo was a witless old hobbit.  The roles of Merry and Pippin were also badly presented.  Granted, they are young hobbits, but they didn't deserve to be made into thieves who ""accidentally"" got involved in the Fellowship.  The film missed so much of the internal workings of minds and hearts that Tolkein bestowed on his characters.  I realize that the book had too much to be put in a reasonably-timed film, but to go so completely away from the ""heart"" of the story is sad and very disappointing.  Don't go to this film thinking it represents an accurate telling of the original story.",1009929600,4,1783,4.676282051282051
1326806,5,B00003CWT6,"Being a huge fan of the LOTR book(s) and having now seen the ""Fellowship Of The Ring"" several times, I thought I'd make some personal comments on the movie.  For starters, I think it's absolutely great and that Peter Jackson deserves high praise for accomplishing such a difficult job of bringing this classic book to film.  Here are some of the best (and worst) features of the movie:
THE BEST
- Any and all parts with Bilbo Baggins:  Iam Holm puts in a very strong performance as Bilbo.  I found both his scenes - in Hobbiton and Rivendell to, unexpectedly, be among the most moving in the film.  Whether it's due to Holm's superb acting skills or Bilbo's small but critical importance in the whole story, the ""Bilbo"" scenes are among my favorites.  Alot also probably has to do with the fact that Bilbo's scenes are very true to the book with much actual Tolkien dialog which incidentally, proves to make all parts of the film better.
- Race Relations:  Not socially, but PHYSICALLY.  The most subtle but perhaps best special effect in the whole movie was in keeping the relative physical sizes between humans, elves, hobbits and dwarves right.  It made the casting choices (all excellent, without exception) for all the characters based on their abilities and not on their real life sizes and shapes.  Truly remarkable and best of breed effects.
- Hobbiton:  An incredibly beautiful place done perfectly to the book.  The ""long expected party"" scenes had all the wonderful book references including: fireworks, Bilbo's going away comments, Gandalf's discussions with Bilbo and Frodo, whimsical moments smoking pipeweed, fire runes on the ring and much more.  These early and quickly forgotten scenes eventually become (as in the book) something that you start to nostalgically think back about and miss.
- The Council Of Elrond:  I always wondered how such a critical part of the story where most of the fellowship members (and their personal stories) are introduced and where the fate of the ring is decided, could possibly be done in less than 45 minutes and without being boring.  Jackson unbelievably pulled it off in 5 minutes.  Gandalf's story was unneeded having already been seen as it occured.  Boramir, appropriately got the most of the discussion time.  Elrond handled the whole thing well and Frodo had his moment too.  Unfortunately, Legolas and Gimli were given short shrift in the scene but, who knows - it may all work out in the end.  Even Sam got his comical moment, just as in the book.
- Calhaderas And Saruman:  The snow scenes on Calhaderas, while short were very dramatic and Saruman's conjouring of the storm against the fellowship was spine-tinglingly awesome.
- Moria:  Such a critical point in the story.  All the key points were hit: the watcher's destruction of the west gate, Balin's tomb, the countless orcs, the cave troll and the discovery of Frodo's mithril coat, the discovery of gollum's persuit, the bridge of Kazad Dum, the balrog, Gandalf's fall and the extremely moving affect it had on the fellowship.  All done to perfection.
- Boramir:  While some complain of the lack of character development of the fellowship members, the absolute minumum has seemingly been sucessfully accomplished with so many characters.  Especially critical is Boromir.  His story arc - altho abbreviated - played exactly as the story should: a warrior from Gondor looking to aquire the ring in Rivendell and his early competition with Aragorn, to his betrayal of Frodo and then his profound regret and heroic defense of Merry and Pippin followed by his ""departure"" after confessing to Aragorn.  Very tragic and very sad.  The memories of his scenes will carry thru to the next movies, as they properly should.
IMPERFECTIONS
- Black Riders Too Loud:  Some of the scenes with the black riders were just too screechingly loud.  While such moments might make you want to cover your ears ( to save them) they didn't really strike you with fear.  I would have prefered stronger visual frights.  In general, the background sounds and music did frequently drown out character dialog.  Gandalf and Aragorn in particular, had their sometimes mumbly voices get stepped on.
- Whiplash Hobbiton to Rivendell:  Alot was skipped much of it appropriately.  The Bombadil and Barrow Downs and even Buckleberry scenes are, begrudgingly not all that critical.  Severely narrowing down the Farmer Maggot scenes was actually quite well done altho I did miss the terror of The hobbit's hiding in the back of the farmer's wagon in the nite on the way to the bridge scene which was truncated to a simple hobbit-hop onto a raft.  Oh well.  Bree went by pretty quick and the black rider attack on empty hobbit beds scene was a bit overdone but I suppose the whole thing worked.  I had always envisioned Weathertop to be a high, towering peak rather than the little dumpy mound of the movie but the rider attack worked well.  Using Arwen a the method of getting Frodo to Rivendell, while very different from the book, actually worked and didn't bother this LOTR fanatic much at all.
Battle Scene Confusion:  Some of the battle scenes, while well choreographed and sprinkled with fine moments (like the Uruk Hi guy getting a knife jabbed in the leg by Aragorn to then pull it out and throw it at him and get deflected by Aragorn's sword) did get confusing at times.  The camera seemed too close to the action making it hard to follow.  This could have been done better.
All in all - excellent.  I figure we will have gotten the deep character development we're all looking for by the end of the second movie - which I figure will be the best of the 3.  Can't wait.",1009843200,,5657,4.821576763485477
1326807,1,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings was a waste of 3 hours!  The violent scenes with all sorts of monsters, grotesque figures, sword fights, dead creatures, and hard to follow dialogues gave me a headache.  I thought that the movie would never end.  As soon as you thought it was over, another terrible, loud, violent episode ensued. The entire story (which was ok) could have been told in an hour.  It took almost that long for the drawn out, confusing introduction.  If you came in late, there is no way you would even know what was happening.
Many scenes, like the 111th birthday party, were a waste of film. There were too many inconsistencies and the scenes seemed to be just thrown together.  One scene did not flow into another.  The actors were good; but the dialogue was tedious, boring and at times, difficult to hear and understand.  The background music was too loud and distracting.  The special effects were good; but why put every one of them in the same movie? It was almost like viewing a film school picture where they are trying everything they learned in the semester.
I cannot imagine taking kids to see this horror.  They would have nightmares for weeks! I will definitely not see the next two episodes.  ... wait for it to come out on video where you can fast-forward through the horror scenes that do not lend to the story.",1009843200,5,1329,4.565400843881856

1326809,5,B00003CWT6,"An experience that has equaled in satisfaction, as much as in its anticipation. The depiction of characters and world was refreshing and surprisingly justifying to the world and characters that J.R.T. created on printed ink.
I feared that this movie would never do the written version justice. Phantom Menace, which played like a video game rather than an epic story - disappointed me on all fronts (in terms of creating a new epic tale). But the careful and well thoughout casting and dialogue in Lord of the Rings, for the numerous characters, has left me with a sweet taste, leaving behind Lucas' soured trilogy.
Gandalf, Frodo and the Gondor heir are passionate and evoking in each of their focused scenes. The battles are amazing, and should be appreciated, both in their detail, gore and climatic nature. To criticise them would be narrow minded. The movie entertains while unfolding a clasic tale.
(Bilbo was exactly what I imagined when my eyes would run over the text.)
The Director has nailed it down. The most important part of retelling a story that in itself is already enjoyable, is CASTING, ACTING and CASTING and ACTING. And ACTING.
The right people for the appropiate roles, is the product of a great line up of actors. This was what made the movie most enjoyable. Its not just about looks, but its also about delivery. And these bunch of Hollywood entertainers delivery in a big way.
People who have not read the book, have told me that the story is great, aside from the characters and action. Thats a success in itself.
Book to movie & movie to book depictions will always leave something desired. Lets just say that Lord of the Rings keeps these to a bare minimum. Those that criticise are sad and senile, unable to appreciate the purpose of the movie. The purpose to entertain while doing justice to JR.T's epic tale.
I just hope they keep it up for the next two epsiodes. Focusing on the cast and acting, rather than the special effects or visual stims. George Lucas take note.",1009843200,7,2000,4.73352435530086
1326829,2,B00003CWT6,"(Okay, I realize that Tolkien fans are vicious and do not take kindly to dissenting opinions, but hear me out....)
Do not go see this movie without having prior knowledge of the books and the Third Earth world created by Tolkien. This film's storytelling does not stand on its own to the ""brillance"" others have deemed it to be.
The cinematography is breathtaking, the sound editting is wonderful, the acting is mostly decent.....but I kept looking at my watch for most of the movie. There are a few wonderful and intriguing scenes, but they come too far apart and elements of suspense, intrigue, and adventure are not pursued as much as they should be.
Sure, Third Earth may have been the basis and forefather of Fantasy since; but like there wouldnt be a Star Wars without a 2001....doesnt mean that 2001 is more enjoyable to the majority of todays' audiences.
Also, do NOT take children to see this film...its also not necessary a fun ""date movie"" either unless you are both role playing gamers into this world. If you want a magical world easy to enjoy that captures wonder...go see a nice fun movie that stands on its own like Harry Potter.  LOTR requires repeat viewings and/or seeing the entire trilogy of films (aha! brilliant marketing strategy!) for it to really mean anything.",1009843200,2,1287,4.771300448430493
1326830,5,B00003CWT6,"Surely if Tolkien were alive today he would have argued against the making of this film, fearing that something would be lost in the translation. But Tolkien is dead, the films have been made, and the verdict is out: The Fellowship of the Ring is a GREAT movie. This is what fantasy fans have been waiting for: A good storyline, believable characters, wonderful scenery, and god-grand battle scenes. For the uninitiated in fantasy, there is no need to fear, as the beginning of the movie does give a brief but accurate synopsis as to what has gone on before and how the Ring came to be.
Approximately three hours in length, the movie is admittedly long, but one has to be able to appreciate how Peter Jackson was able to tell a 400+ page story in that amount of time, and tell it WELL, at that. The movie does have its slow parts, but this is not so much Jackson's fault as it was Tolkien's. I, personally, found the book The Fellowship of the Ring to be a little slow and boring. In fact, if I rated the book right now, I'd probably give it only 3.5 to 4 stars (out of 5). If there are any slow or boring parts in this movie, it's because Jackson was trying to stick as true to Tolkien's vision as reasonably possible. If you look on the internet, you'll see lots of artwork that is very similar to the movie. For example, doesn't the cover art on the paperback version of The Lays of Beleriand look like the inspiration for Sauron's costume at the beginning of the movie?
 ""To translate is to betray"", the Italian Proverb goes, but with this movie, Peter Jackson has joined the ranks of the few that have proved that proverb wrong.",1009843200,10,1633,4.3894389438943895
1326831,4,B00003CWT6,"First of all, let me say that I am a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, so many of my remarks here may not be of that much interest to those of you who aren't.
There's a lot that director Peter Jackson got right in his adaptation of Tolkien's classic novel. The thing that strikes the viewer right away is how absolutely stunning the film is visually: in visual effects, art direction, set design, even in little details like the way the hobbits' hair is done, Jackson and his colleagues are right on the money.
The casting, pretty much to a man and a woman, is spot on. Elijah Wood, as Frodo, is a particularly inspired choice, hitting just the right balance between innocence and wisdom that I think Tolkien had in mind for the character.
Most importantly, Jackson gets the tone right. Tone, as anyone who has ever tried to create any kind of narrative work will tell you, is a tricky thing, and Lord Of The Rings' balance between humor and darkness is particularly hard to catch. However, in everything from little narrative details (for example, when Bilbo (Ian Holm) addresses ""Proudfoots"" at his birthday party, and a hobbit in the audience shoots back ""ProudFEET!"", just like in the book) to the big, bittersweet ending, Jackson is right on the mark.
Now then, the kvetches.
The film's big failing, in my mind, is its lack of suspense in the first half - that is to say, its failure to take advantage of opportunities to build suspense. In the book, as those of you who've read it will recall, we don't know what's happened to Gandalf from the time Frodo and company leave Hobbiton until they reach Rivendell. The tension is ratcheted up as the reader wonders, ""Where's Gandalf? What could possibly be detaining such a powerful being?"" In the film, however, Jackson blows his wad by depicting the events of Gandalf's journey simultaneously with the events of Frodo & Co.'s journey to Rivendell. Big mistake.
Another issue is (you knew this was coming, didn't you?) Jackson's use of the Arwen character(Liv Tyler). I didn't have as much of a problem with this as some did, but his usage of her as uber-elf-chick/gratuitous hottie is somewhat annoying. Perhaps Jackson thought Fellowship was a bit testosterone-heavy and needed a strong female character for balance: if so, he is directed to read the work of Conan creator Robert E. Howard posthaste.
In sum: Despite its failings, FOTR is still pretty great. If you're interested in it enough to have read this far, you should definitely see it (in a theater, if possible - I can't think of another film since Mel Gibson's Braveheart that benefited as much from big-screen viewing). But please, please, PLEASE read the books first: Tolkien was possibly, with the exception of Joyce, the most insanely brilliant English-language writer of the 20th century, and needs to be read. No cinematic depiction of his work will ever match movies he makes in the reader's mind.",1009843200,3,2914,4.772277227722772

Considering how many ways a live action version of this story could go wrong, director Peter Jackson and his cast do an excellent job.  It covers the first book of the trilogy quite well and the visuals/special effects are often stunning.  Even at three hours, there are plenty of details and subplots that fall by the wayside (Cate Blanchett has very little to do and Tom Bombadil is missing in action).  All in all the film is beautiful to watch and you get a very good idea of the main thrust of the Tolkien novel.  I especially enjoyed Sir Ian McKellan as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo.  They do a great job in a very tricky roles, and they add an emotional core to this film that is missing in far too many fantasy films.

Three hours seems long for a movie , however this one went by very quickly( too quickly for me). I had seen the animated Hobbit but had not read any of the books until recently. Just started reading the Hobbit and haven't gotten very far but it was enough to understand the movie I think.
The effects were great and the characters were very good, I think the Elve was the best, very calm and exact. I really want to read the books now and eagerly await the release on video, not to mention the next movie. I will probably see it again...I definately recommend this movie!",1009756800,,676,4.2890625
1326836,5,B00003CWT6,"To an avid Tolkein fan, the whole idea of a Lord of the Rings movie is a little scary--what if they ruin it (like the 1978 animated disaster)? I was literally in tears for much of this movie, thinking, ""This is really it--I never thought I'd actually SEE middle earth!"" From the shire to the mines of Moria, the sets and landscapes are beyond stunning. The actors also did a fantastic job, especially with Gandalf and Frodo (the main characters). Whether you are already a Lord of the Rings fan or not, if you love movies that sweep you into a world of epic proportions and grand adventure, this film is sure to please.
A warning, though: this is not for anyone under 13 in my opinion. The movie is MORE violent than the book (though I don't think the most graphic parts, such as the gratuitous beheading of a bad guy, add anything at all to the plot or movie experience, and I'm not sure why the director added them). Several violent scenes that are ""off-screen"" in the book are shown explicitly in the film.
Okay, now my complaints: There were two points where important plot points were missed. First, the broken sword is never reforged but appears whole later. Guess we'll see that in the ""deleted scenes"" portion of the DVD! Second, at the very end (tiny spoiler here) it's not very credible that the company SEES Frodo & Sam slip away and doesn't follow them. In the book, the pretense is that finding Frodo & Sam would be difficult, which would have made perfect sense in the movie if it had been edited differently. As it is, Aragorn just sort of shrugs and says that the whole fellowship thing doesn't matter any more, which just seems out of character and makes no sense at all (unless you've read the book and know more of his reasoning).
The whole ending, in fact, was a bit lame, from the poorly timed and unrealistic battle scene (not in the book) to the overly melodramatic and hyperextended shots of teary, glaze-eyed faces. But you can't blame the filmmakers too much, really; it IS a trilogy, and the first book doesn't have much of an ending, either.

The only downside to the movie is that I personally feel the rating is a little overlooked. This movie, in my mind should have been rated R.

I've read part of the books and listened to the radio dramatization and watched the three cartoon movies.  The one thing I haven't seen anyone else mention is that the movie is a little darker than the book.  The book has alot of pick-me-up scenes and great songs that lift the mood between the serious parts.  I thought some of the characters (the dwarf for example) were played a little darker.  I also thought the ""Prancing Pony"" scene was MUCH to short and to gloomy.  I mean, this is the inn renowned for its excellent service to travelers.  Another point is that the orcs are a little too gruesome, the book doesn't describe them exactly that way.  On the up side, Gandalf is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL and so is Boromir (the last scene were he.....well, don't want to spoil it, HE'S JUST GREAT!).  Any fan will love the action scenes and just watch in sweet bliss at what you never thought you'd ever get to see come to life.

1326884,5,B00003CWT6,"Considered both as fantasy adventure and as an adaptation of a beloved literary classic, Peter Jackson's film of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" sets new standards for cinematic excellence. Everything about this film feels exactly right, from the casting to the screenplay to the special effects. The last are amazing, putting to shame anything George Lucas has come up with, and yet they always serve to advance the story; unlike Lucas, there's never any hint that Jackson is merely playing with his toys. Jackson shows great respect for Tolkien's text, but not slavish devotion. Certain characters--such as the lovable Tom Bombadil and Frodo's poisonous Aunt Lobelia--are missing, and Tolkien would be chagrined to find that the little poems and songs he loved to write are nowhere quoted. But if Jackson gives short shrift to Tolkien's whimsy, he more than makes up for that by giving us Tolkien's intensity, pathos and moral vision absolutely undiluted. Above all, Jackson never forgets that Tolkien's chief emphasis was always on the characters he created. Jackson casts wonderful actors to play those characters and--again unlike Lucas--he actually allows them to give performances. How wonderful to find the great Sir Ian McKellen, a uniquely commanding and charismatic actor, as Gandalf, or the charming and touching Elijah Wood as Frodo. You can go straight down the list--Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn,  Sean Astin as Sam, Ian Holm as Bilbo, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel--and find nothing but perfection. This is one of the very few big-budget blockbusters that unqualifiedly deserves its success, and all we can do now is look forward with excitement to the release of ""The Two Towers"" in 2002 and ""The Return of the King"" in 2003.

1326885,4,B00003CWT6,"For those of you wondering if this movie is true to the book, it is...sorta. While some scenes seem to come straight off the pages, others have been deleted. I assume due to time constraints. (I mean the thing is already 3 hrs long!) But the addition of one scene early one didn't sit well with me. The idea of hobbits who have just left home for the first time in their lives attacking a Dark Rider makes me wonder why the h*** it is there in the first place. It doesn't move along the plot, describe the setting or the characters!
Other things to look out for are little inconsistencies with the text. Gandalf's sword not glowing, Aragorn fighting where he didn't, Aragorn not having his broken sword, the letter at Bree is missing, etc. Saruman is brought in early and the mistery of Gandalf's disappearance is resolved early on. Which I don't mind too much. Movie goers are more impatient than book readers.
Some key lines are taken out. Especially the poetry and songs. I think that without them the story becomes much darker, almost nightmarish. Yes, the whole ""all that is gold does not glitter"" is gone. As it has in the movie. In the Mines of Moria, the saddness over the loss of a civilization is hardly felt.
May I say that I LOVED the movie despite it's faults. The movie has gotten me to reread the trilogy something I've been meaning to do for a long time. I think this is the best movie redition of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings ever and that is the best fantasy film I have seen in a long time. It is a good primer for someone interested in Tolkien's world who does not want to spent a long time reading.

To those who count on these reviews to determine whether or not you`ll see this film, take my word on it, it has everything a wonderful movie should have - comedy, action, romance, adventure, drama...I mean it`s nominated for 4 Golden Globes, I think that says something about how much it is being well received.  If you won`t take my word on it...see the reviews...they are almost (99%) in favor of the film.  The fim is three hours long (then again Titanic ran at 3:15) but it seems like an hour, as long as you don`t have to go to the bathroom, I would have sat through all three of them at once!  I still can`t get enough...I`m going to see it again!!!!  I suggest you do the same.  And those would don`t like the film...well you probably don`t know a good film when it bites you on the ...!  Thank you.",1009756800,3,1366,4.28125
1326887,5,B00003CWT6,"Not only does this movie provide action but it has a very strong and great story to back it. I've read all of the lord of the Ring books and I can honestly say that this would have to be one of the best movies that follows along with a book.
That was one of the things I liked best about this movie, it didn't stray too far from the book. Granted, there were events that were missing and the timeline seemed much shorter in the movie, but it always stayed faithful to the book. I remember seeing Legolas walking on top of the snow instead of trudging through it, in the book it mentions this. The fact that minor details were shown adds so much more to the film. I especially like Peter Jackson's interpretation of the making of Saruman's Uruk-hai. Tolkein never wrote about their creation but in the film, the creation to the setting forth of the Uruk-hai is shown. That in my opinion is brilliant.
The costumes of this movie were amazing! Tolkein wrote about the black riders being terrible and frightening creatures and in the movie this was represented very accuratly. Each time the black riders were present their costumes alone gave you goose-bumps. The creatures in the movie were frightening beyond belief especially the orcs and Uruk-hai. Even though they were scary to many people, the outfits and make-up were brilliant! The Elves really gave off a sense of nobility just from their demeanor.
Overall I'd have to say that this was an excellant movie and I recommend that everyone should go see it. But be careful, this is a frightening movie which could be too much for kids under 10.",1009670400,3,1595,4.560975609756097

If you want to see a movie full of suspense this is the movie to see. Elijah Wood is brillant in this film. He does an amazing job of making you believe he is really Frodo. This movie is good for everyone to see. It is one that you will never get tired of watching. I went with great expectations and came out totally satisfied.,1009670400,,464,4.284090909090909

1326910,5,B00003CWT6,"I have just started reading the LOTR trilogy, and my hubby has read them all a few times. We both really enjoyed the movie. We knew things would be left out, and accepted that as part of the movie making process - especially in books this size. After hashing it over, we came to these conclusions. Most of what was left out is not neccessary anyway - ie. Tom Bombadil - yes he's fun, but does not really progress the whole story. Unfortunately, we had issues with two things, mostly in the beginning. I felt leaving out the part of Gandalf leaving the letter at the Prancing Pony, especially with it's confirmation to trust Strider/Aragorn - was vitally important, and missing. Frodo was so suspicious of everyone, I had a hard time believing he'd just allow Strider in w/o confirmation of who he was. Also, I was extremely disappointed in how Merry and Pippin join the journey. I felt it was more compelling to show that it really was a conspiracy between the two and Samwise to not let Frodo go alone, but that they were determined from the beginning to join him. Instead of just bumping into each other raiding a field and then following along. All in all though - the movie was great, exciting and kept us interested the whole time. Oh, and the orcs, they were disgusting!",1009670400,,1276,4.528138528138528
1326911,4,B00003CWT6,"On the surface, it was all done ""right""..the acting..scenery..special effect etc..but overall, that special magic in Tolkiens story was missing. Instead of focusing so much on Orcs (who were made to look like Freddy Kruger) many beautiful/powerful subtle moments were cut short/lost. Even the ominous roving eye of Sauron, which in the book, was scanning and searching for Frodo, was always presented as a full blown piece of special effects. So in short, Tolkiens moving epic saga was rushed though and lost much in this translation. For instance, Braveheart, which Peter Jackson said he used in some ways as a template...was more moving in the psychological arena and the characters evoked more awe and empathy than in LOTR. Even in Starwars, the dynamic between Vader and Luke was stonger than in this movie...which it should not have been. In spite of all of this, I gave it 4 stars because so much was good..but, over the top and one of the best movies in the last few years, it sadly is not.",1009670400,,997,4.8023255813953485

This movie being only the first of three to show, I was shocked at the attention to detail all through out the movie. Myself, being a fan of the Hobbit book series, could find no fault at this plot or recreation of a book. I was speechless after the first 10 minutes of this movie and that stayed with me until I saw the credits at the end of this magnificant masterpiece. My hats are off to all that had a hand in this brilliant movie.

  Concerning the elements of the movie, the special effects and set designs were very good; the plot was straight forward; the acting was very good--a very fine ensemble cast.  I was pleased to find out that it was story about courage, faith, friedship, about how Frodo, basically a regular fellow type, gets assistance from different beings in different ways in the quest to destroy the evil ring.",1009670400,,659,4.695652173913044

Who cares about the acting (great) and the makeup (wonderful) and the soundtrack (lots of fun). Anyone and everyone should see this movie... why? It's just beautiful. It is three hours long, but I did not notice it when I sat in the movie theatre last night. I followed the story okay, which is very close to the book (I just read the book a few weeks ago). The actors were great... the hobbits were adorable, the elves perfect, the wizard admirable, the orcs scary, the dwarf strong and silly and the villians evil. But what I couldn't dismiss was how beautiful the movie was. The world in Tolkien's book was beautifully translated to the big screen. I kept asking myself, ""how did they get this world to look so beautiful?"" The special effects were fantastic, and all the lands were amazing. Rivendell and Lothlorian looked like paradise, the Shire seemed like the perfect vacation home, and Mordor was freaky. It was all done so well that not only did I gain a new appreciation for the books, but I am eagerly awaiting The Two Towers.",1009670400,,1140,4.5931372549019605

The Fellowship of the Ring succeeds on  every level and I refuse to attempt to find fault in this movie. I recently read the book, and do not hold the view that the movie should have included every line, word for word. The only question I found asking myself was pertaining to the gifts that all the hobbits were to receive. I actually welcomed the faster pacing and elimination of the songs. If anything was to be eliminated for time constraints, the easy choice was Tom Bambadil. If your a purist, the book is always there. This is definately one of the greatest movies ever made, if not the greatest. Due to the fact that all three movies were filmed at the same time, I feel that fans can expect the same, outstanding quality in all  three. This is unlike most trilogies where there is a drop off in quality after the first. And, there is less than a year wait until the next movie.

1326916,5,B00003CWT6,"When I went to see this movie, I expected the worse. I have read the books and have my own personal vision of what the film should look like. This film not only coincides with my vision, it takes me beyond the limits of my own imagination.
The Fellowship of the Ring manages to take a sometimes rambling book and direct it in a proper path without detracting from the essence of JRRT's literary legacy. The direction has momentum without being hurried. The editing of this film is amazing. While there are crucial battle sequences to be dealt with, through careful editing the gore that seems to go with violence these days has been wisely edited out. Just as Hitchcock hinted at the violence in the shower scene in Psycho, the editor of this movie did not feel that blood and guts equate a good battle sequence.
The visual style of the film is in keeping with the descriptions in the books. Again, respect to the books was given. Yet, there is a style here evident of very creative people. They did not just copy the books.
Two things amazed me about this adaptation. First off is the moral aspects of the story. There is no side stepping of the moral implications of the ring, the power it has, and how that power corrupts. Frodo questions why he has been chosen for the task and the answer Gandalf gives him is on target. And, at the end of the film there is an exchange between Sam and Frodo concerning duty and honor that is emotionally powerful. The characters in the books were little more than well written fantasy figures. In the film, these characters take on a humanity that I did not find in the books. Hats off to the director and the script writer(s).
See this movie with an open mind. Disregard the commercially driven reason behind the Star Wars movies and view this fantasy film as a movie with more than a purpose of selling tie-in products. And, remember: this is not really a children's film. It will scare them.",1009670400,,1932,4.4914772727272725
1326945,5,B00003CWT6,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is every bit a grand epic. From the movie's spectacular opening battle to the Mines of Moria and the mystical eaves of Lothlorien, Fellowship is a visual stunner and a blockbuster of the pedigree of ""Star Wars."" Moreover, Fellowship whets the appetite for the next two movies in the trilogy. Of course, the story was spun decades before from the mind of author J.R.R. Tolkien. But taking Tolkien's words and translating their magic to the big-screen is a formidable task, and Director Peter Jackson does a job worthy of Rivendell's praise. His vision of Middle-earth is darker than mine, but not by much. Most importantly, Jackson captures that feeling of impending doom that so pervaded the books and gave the story its juice. Hobbit Frodo Baggins, played by the magnetic Elijah Wood, is bestowed with the impossible task of saving Middle-earth: he must trek to the evil Land of Mordor and cast the omnipotent One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. The movie is chock-full of dazzling action sequences and visual effects, but the movie never strays too far from the roots of Tolkien's tale. Ian McKellen sparkles in his role as Gandalf the wizard, while other cast members deliver their lines with an earnestness missing from most budget-busting movies these days. As a fan of Tolkien, the movie shattered my expectations. As a movie-goer, Fellowship, I can assure you, is well worth the price of admission.",1009670400,,1460,4.891129032258065
1326946,4,B00003CWT6,"I wish I was a kid again, and I could just gloss over the weak points of a particular work and get lost in a world, to really believe in a world the way you do when you are in your teens, the way I did when I last read LOTR about 15 years ago.
I was looking forward to this movie more than any I can remember, hoping intensely that it would transform me back to my hopeful, believing youth, to that land of magic when you first hear Strider speak...
Sometimes, you buy too much into the hype, and it ruins a movie for you. That *almost* happened to me with LOTR/FOTR. The movie is a heck of a movie, and you would do yourself a major disservice not to see it. But I felt I just knew too damn much about what was going to happen every step of the way, even though it has been 15 years since I last read the books. The suspense and the palpable sense of evil that others have described did not grab me as viscerally as I had hoped, and despite the three-hour running time, I felt that there needed to be more character development, and perhaps a truncation of the Urak-Hai racing through the woods scenes (poorly done makeup there, compared to the masterly makeup on Gandalf et al).
You see, the thing about LOTR, the books, is that I believed in them, almost religiously, so that I came to tears at certain points. There are tear-jerking moments in this movie, but they didn't quite jerk hard enough. Ultimately, I wanted to be a little kid again, to believe, and I didn't quite get there.
I don't know if it's my fault or Peter Jackson's, but you have to give the crew and the actors a hand for what was obviously one of the most difficult and sweeping movie shoots in history.
Other comments: The acting is well done, as was the casting (with the exception of Hugo Weaving as Elrond; what were they thinking? Instead of an elf who is supposedly beautiful and kindly they choose the creepy evil bad guy from the Matrix?). I especially liked Sean Bean as Boromir, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn (the guy most likely to come out of this like Harrison Ford from Star Wars), and of course, Ian McKellen's Gandalf.
One thing that Peter Jackson got, totally dead on, were the Black Riders. They practically stole the show, they were so perfect.
The cave troll, by the way, is a marvel, as are the other scenes in Moria. But, hey, for a four-day journey, we (as moviegoers) never really learn why Moria was important, why it matters. How about a fireside chat with Gimli exclaiming for 20-30 seconds about the riches that could once be found here?
Maybe that will be one of the things we get in the director's cut? In fact, here's hoping they RELEASE a DIRECTOR's CUT in APRIL. They would easily make another $50-100M from the die-hards at almost no cost! Then release both on the special edition DVD in August...

There is the chase, the nine of the fellowship are surrounded, they fight, and somehow manage to vanquish the evil forces.  Tokiein never intended this kind of film.  There is very little of the life of the hobbits, the mistic qualities of Middle Earth.  In the book, setting was definetly a character.  Not in the film.  The monsters are too monstery, and the evil is shouted (shown in neon and blasted in surround sound).  This is not to say that there were not some good moments in the film.

Peter Jackson's riveting adventure soars with delight and fun.  The book comes alive perfectly.  The additional scenes only add more to this electric velocity film that will lift you from your seat and let you take the ride yourself!
Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen and Liv Tyler star in this brilliant masterpiece.  I can honestly say that this film goes beyond the book.  I know it takes all three hours, but it is well worth the time, because it never slows down.  The adventure never lets up.  This is one of the top five films of the year.  Harry Potter- take a hike, The Lord of the Rings is taking the throne.
What draws me to this film most is how it has a rather less super-star cast and a director who's never even jumped at trying to make a blockbuster before.  This film kicks with a spear edged boot.  It can't be stopped.  You either take the ride, leave it crying, or don't take it at all.  The loss goes to the ignorants who purposely stay away from the film adaption, simply because no movie is ever better than the book.  People, get over it.  -The Green Mile, Pearl Harbor, The Lost World- all better than the books.  Have a little more faith in Hollywood these days.  Lord of the Rings has it all.  Go for it.
QUOTE: ""The first film is unexpectedly perfect and lives up to the hype.  This is simply one of the year's best films.  It's this generation's Star Wars.

1326995,5,B00003CWT6,"""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a great movie all in all and I don't see how one can not like it, or better yet, love it!  The whole imagery and setting is beautiful in every way.  As for the special effects, you can't criticize it because the visual images are all very convincing and I was very impressed by how they made the Hobbitts look the right size.  Although I have read only the first few pages of the book, I was a little worried that the normal sized actors would be too big.  The special affects, however, made the hobbitts look as small as they are supposed to.  It looks very real.  Of course what matters in this movie is not necessarily the images, but really the whole mood, feeling, and excitement of the movie.  Even one who hasn't read the books can sense the evil of the One Ring and how it influences the characters and heroes.  Any person who possesses or wears the Ring is driven mad by its powers and even the good are corrupted by the tempting powers of invisibility and to control others.  Elijah Wood deserves a great deal of credit for how well he plays the hero Frodo, who is given the burden of the Ring and experiences the dark images of the Ring's evil powers.  It is very dark and dramatic the way it is all done.  The subtleness and tensity is all too great and never been exceeded in any other movie I've seen(although ""Princess Mononoke"" comes close).  All of the actors do deserve praise for how well they've done with Tolkien's characters.  Some favorite scenes of mine include the flight to the ford to escape the dark rider, the fight on the tower where Frodo gets stabbed, the setting of Lothlorien with the mystical Queen Galadrial, the meeting of Arogorn and Arwnen, and the ending scenes known as the Breaking of the Fellowship.  The music itself is very grand as Howard Shore's score helps add to the enchantment and magic of the movie; not to mention the Celtic ""goddess"", Enya, whose music has enchanted many around the world(she's my all-time favorite singer!).
For some reason I have felt like comparing this movie to the Harry Potter film, probably because of the cruel critics who have.  Well, I do find both ""Fellowship"" and ""Harry Potter"" to be both magical in every way, with setting, story, characters, and mood.  To all complainers who complained about ""Harry Potter"" being too scary, ""Fellowship"" is mega-scary and many times more scary than ""Harry Potter"".  My nine year old brother handled this movie very well, but I don't think my five year old sister would have been able to handle it.  ""Fellowship"" is also much long, as ""Harry Potter"" quickly moves from scene to scene, but ""Fellowship"" stays longer with certain scenes.  At first I couldn't decide which I liked more, ""Harry Potter"" or ""Fellowship"", but I did find ""Fellowship"" to be more lively and enchanting.  For that reason, I like ""Fellowship"" a bit more, but even so, there is still plenty of room for ""Harry Potter"".  I will, on the other hand, have to read the whole book to see how well the movie follows along.  I  do expect both ""Harry Potter"" and ""Fellowship"" to recieve many Oscar nominations and surely some winners.  If not, there will be great outrage.  Anyway, in the end, I highly recommend going out and seeing this movie.  You'll miss out on a lot of magic if you don't.",1009584000,,3308,4.564406779661017
1326996,5,B00003CWT6,"Superlatives fail me.  It took J.R.R. Tolkien fifteen years to write his opus `The Lord of the Rings (LotR)', of which this particular film covers the first third, `The Fellowship of the Ring (FotR)'.  It took Peter Jackson, a New Zealand native, five years to bring Tolkien's work from ink and paper to the visual feast of film, condensing LotR's 300,000 words to three movies.  Now, finally, FotR has arrived in the theaters for the Christmas season of 2001.  Anticipation is huge - LotR is one of the most widely read books worldwide - as is expectation: Tolkien purists are an exacting, demanding lot, and while casting decisions and early imagery releases seemed to conform to that of the text, several interesting (and disturbing) revisions/changes also arose, leaving some sighing with relief and others gnashing their teeth at the prospect of a deleted Tom Bombidil or a beefed-up love story between Arwen and Aragorn.
As someone who has read the book four times, I have to say that my expectations were probably as high as any, especially after watching the marvelous trailers for FotR.  Thus, I joined an eager audience on Dec. 19th to witness this long awaited event, excited and extremely nervous - and luckily, I left my expectations at the door.  The tone and dialogue of the prologue gripped me immediately, and though my inner purist had a couple gripes - where was Gil-Galad? - the emergence of Sauron, mace in hand, dashed my hopes and doubts with a brutal swing; and upon entering the Shire, all reservation was lost.  The vibrant colors and earthy textures of Hobbiton; the stunning design; the deft characterizations --; all pulled me in, and for three short hours I was lost, completely and utterly lost, in this marvelous film.
Afterward I reeled out of the theater with a dozen scenes fighting for dominance in my memory; through it all, I realized that this was near enough to the perfect adaptation for Tolkien's work.  And having watched the movie a second time, I've come to the conclusion that Peter Jackson has not only faithfully reproduced all that *essential* to FotR, he has also improved on the book in several important ways.  I do have a few nitpicks as well, but they stem more from the suits at New Line than the man behind the camera.
What works:
Pacing: Purists may disagree, but the pacing of the original book was rather flawed: conflict/tension is minimal and the hobbits seem more content to eat and sing than take the Ring seriously.  Anyone who has read Christopher Tolkien's `The History of Middle Earth' will discover that Tolkien himself had no strong idea of where LotR should go, thus the long wanderings in both story and prose before the other elements of the story come together.  Heck, in the first couple drafts the ringwraiths didn't exist, Frodo was named Bingo (!), and Strider was a hobbit with wooden legs named Trotter (!!). -Given the enormous amount of exposition at the start of the film, Jackson's decision to excise Tom B, the Old Woods, the Barrow Wights and the dawdling therein, was a necessary one: film and writing are two different mediums, one must remember, and what works for one might not for the other, and vice versa.  That said, Jackson did an excellent job of balancing the relevant information, character introduction/exploration, and action, all the while tossing in the odd tidbit for the hardcore Tolkien fans (""ProudFEET!"").  Expanding the Moria and Amon Hen sequences helped raise the overall tension tremendously, another improvement on the source material: Tolkien was never much one for sweat-and-sinew action.  Only the Lothlorian segment and a few of the traveling scenes are cut too close to the bone.
Script: It took two years and three participating individuals to properly condense Tolkien's epic into a script format; the end result is a marvel, capturing the key dialogue of the book while making important and seamless improvisions on the material, mostly for the sake of humor and character development.
Character Development: A massive improvement on the source material.  Tolkien didn't so much write characters as he did archetypes.  The movie gives them depth, emotion, conflict and nobility above and beyond the text.  The entire cast of the movie is superb, yet even better is how each actor inhabits his or her character.  Through speech and facial expressions, Sean Bean expresses the pathos of Boromir's inner turmoil; Viggo Mortenson manages, through subtle gestures, to show Aragorn's doubt, strength, and resolve; Ian Holm is Bilbo, pure and simple-in fact, all of the hobbits are well cast and seem to be true comrades, not actors pulling together for a paycheck.  And the twin forces of Ian McKellen and Chris Lee as warring Istari blaze through the 16mm: Gandalf and Saruman, in character and conflict, are flat-out fantastic.
The Score:  I'll be brief here, as I plan on reviewing the score separate: suffice to say it is an elegant, subtle piece, highlighting the tensions and echoing the imagery without ever really calling attention to itself - it mirrors the peaks and valleys of the movie without exception - the true mark of a successful score.  Well done, Howard Shore.
The nits: Not many.  Apparently New Line told Jackson to bring FotR to three hours, so as to guarantee a return profit and not scare away the uninitiated with an extreme viewing length.  Thirty minutes were cut from the final director's cut.  The sum and whole of my nits extend from these forced cuts.  The film does feel `rushed' in certain places, and the butchering of the gift-giving scene in Lothlorian is almost unforgivable - but hope is to be found in the upcoming DVD, where those 30 minutes will (MUST!) be restored.
In conclusion, FotR was one of the most satisfying film experiences I've ever had, a rich, majestic interpretation that compliments and adds flavor to the original work.  And this is only the beginning, folks! The fact that Jackson handled FotR, arguably the most difficult and slowest book of the three, this well shows that `The Two Towers' and `Return of the King' should really be something.  A mere year will tell...but anyone who loves epic film and/or Tolkien should not be disappointed.  Less than five stars would be an injustice.",1009584000,8,6261,4.92022792022792
1326997,5,B00003CWT6,"There is something to be said about turning a book into a film.  No matter how you go about it, somethings will have to be left out and almost everything will have to be condensed.  Trying to condense one of the most popular books of the modern era, makes it that much harder because you will never make everyone happy.  I say this to start because, although, I enjoyed this film like no other I've ever seen, and I have read Tolkien's books several times each, there are those in opposition to my opinion which is fine.  I do believe, however, that the only way that one cannot enjoy this film, is to go into the theatre with that idea firmly entrenched in your mind.  While the film is not a visual recreation of the book, which it seems others seemed to have wanted, although the prospect of sitting for ten hours to accomplish this feat hardly seems to enter the mind of those who combat the film.
With that being said, this is not your silly, tongue in cheek fantasy film...ala Dungeons and Dragons or the dreadful Xena.  Once you settle yourself into your hopefully comfortable seat, be prepared to be wisked away to the land of Middle Earth for the next three hours, which still go by, I think you will find, way too quickly, and have you longing for the next installment which is a(insert favorite adjective here) year away.  The story is your good characters set out to destroy an item of infinite evil.  A story that has obvious implications nowadays.  A story that rings forth with the virtues of true friendship and doing what one can ""with the time one is given.""(Direct Quote)
Prepare to honestly care about the characters and the turmoil that they are presented with.  Having seen this movie twice the acting of this film is equal to the story they are trying to present.  Elijah Wood is phenominal as Frodo.  His eyes and expressions match the emotion he is trying to convey.  You can literally feel his joy coming off the screen when he sees Gandalf at the beginning of the film.  The rest of the cast does an equally well in protraying their respective roles, though clearly Wood steals the film...and I am not by any stretch of the imagination an Elijah Wood fan.
The story does seem a bit rushed, although that is to be expected when trying to condense a book the size of the Fellowship down to three hours.  The dialogue is outstanding, most of it coming directly from the books, though not all of it, and the lush scenery will make you want to book a trip to New Zealand at your earliest convience.
In closing, I encourage those of you who have not seen the film yet, not to be intimidated by the book, which you have not read, after you see the first film, I believe you will be encouraged to read the book merely to find out what happens to the characters rather than wait the year for the next film, or two for the end, go out and see it...actually see it twice or three times.  The important thing, though, is to definitely see it.  You will not be sorry, and for a purely logistical standpoint, at 7-10 dollars to see a film, it is the most cost efficient movie of the year, between 2-3 dollars an hour.  Seriously though, see it, and you, like myself, will be encouraging all you know to see it, and probably volunteering to go with them, just to make sure that they actually see it...(Right?)",1009584000,,3321,4.425287356321839
1326998,5,B00003CWT6,"I just saw the movie last night(December 28)and I think that in order to be perfectly fair I would have to say that the movie was AMAZING! Anything short of that word would be a falicy. I have never read the books myself, always meaning to but never having the motivation to buy them. I know I could just go to a library but you just can't reason with me. So last night when I walked into the theatre I was expecting to be dazzled. You know, to have surface feelings of how neat it was and how great the characters were portrayed and so on. I never expected to be pulled into the story line the way I was and find myself moving with the characters and relating to them.
There was never a chance to catch a breath either. It kept moving from one wonderful adventure to the next, all the time leaving your mind racing as they tend to do when you know more then the characters inside the movie and you are wondering what will happen.
The characters were spectacular. Each person filled their role so well that to say I didn't enjoy any of them, even the obvious ""bad guys"" would be unfair. I cried at least three times that I recall throughout that movie because you become so attached to the people on the screen you can't help but be moved when something bad strikes.
For anyone who likes action, this is definitely your movie because the action never stops. For anyone who likes adventure, once again this is the movie that will leave you speechless. For anyone who likes fantasy, mystery or for anyone who just likes movies...go see this one in theatre while you still have the chance. You won't regret it. And if it happens that you never get the chance to see it on the big screen, then take a chance, and buy the dvd. It is WELL worth the money.",1009584000,,1749,4.287009063444109
1326999,5,B00003CWT6,"...P>I'm a filmmaker, so I know what it's like to try and condense a book into a medium like film, because what our brain reads of the written word is different than what our minds comprehend of a succession of images.  What some people don't understand is that Tolkien's writing is very detailed and poetic, and looking at The Fellowship Of The Ring, I think Peter Jackson has nailed it!
On the subject of why Tom Bambaldi was eliminated, he simply does not comply to the story as significantly as the other characters on screen, meaning that on film his character would only drag viewers AWAY from the main plot.  Some people might find this as a rude comment, but it's true.  When crafting a film, you have to realize what is essential, and what is expendable.  You're making a piece of moving images, and you have to be able to work the story through what the audience will accept and care for.  Because of the level of the action and task that has been brought upon Frodo and the others in the fellowship, the audience has to care for them before they believe what they will eventually embark on.
Given the performances which are top notch, and the direction which is amazingly self-assured, I have to hand it to the group of thousands that came together for this film trilogy.
Not only do I think personally that this film is the best fantasy of all time, I think it's the best film to come out of Hollywood this year!",1009497600,,1424,4.461538461538462
1327000,5,B00003CWT6,"I'm reading the book for the first time along side seeing the movies, so I'm neither a Tolkien ""fanatic"" nor a complete newbie.
While things were unavoidably cut in the transition from book to film, I do believe that the most important parts did make it into the film. Yes they left out some things: most of the scene showing Magot (only a couple lines indicating that the hobbits made their way through his garden), the whole Tom Bombadil scene and the giving of gifts from the elves. All things considered though, they did a good job getting the important parts. Many book to movies that come out of Hollywood that I've seen aren't nearly so faithful.
I don't see how people can complain about the cut scenes, however, and then turn right around and complain about the movie running so long. Personally, for a 3-hour movie, the time seemed to fly by for me. I've sat through 3-hour movie's that were much worse. I was actually sad to see the end of it.
There was plenty of violence, granted, but it's a violent book, so I don't really understand the complaints there. I don't remember anyone promising a nice, gentle story.
If I were to have a complaint about this movie, it would be that they introduced Saruman and the Orthanc-stone much too early. In the book, Saruman was merely spoken about, adding mystery to the whole character. Much of that mystery just isn't there in the movie. Even that's understandable, however. Having a movie where the villain isn't shown the entire movie just wouldn't fly in todays world.
Over all, this is a lovely film. It keeps faithfull to the source material, it has the important parts and you don't need to have read the books in order to enjoy it. I can't wait to see it again.",1009497600,,1720,4.551612903225807

It is certainly a classic. What a terrific job!!! This movie will be around when Harry Potter is in the dust. Can't wait for the next one. Will buy the DVD as soon as it is available.

GOOD!!! , I read ALL of the four books, I don't want to go to a movie and see exactly what Iv all ready read. The ""Lord of the rings"" was a great book, but there was MANY of time I fell asleep reading it, becouse of the slow dialog.
 My point is, it gave me a completely new perspective of the story, Like ""ANY"" story told, somone ALLWAYS tells it a little bit differnt. Its even kinda fun to point them out, if you can do that. Then be glad you are seeing somthing differnt for a change.
Other then my tought on other reviews, This movie is one of the ONLY movies that I thought was so well done. That Id see it more then once at the movies (it beeing 3 hours long). I know for a fact, the critics that say such things about it, would think the movie was great if they never read the book or if the book never was, and they just made a new movie.

1327043,5,B00003CWT6,"Has the cycle been broken? With the release of 'The Fellowship of the Rings' the first film in the 'Lord of the Rings' Trilogy, it looks like Hollywood may finally have gotten it right. More specifically, Peter Jackson and Co. have created, not only a faithful screen adaptation to the most beloved epic fantasy of all time, but a sure fire contender for the 2002 Oscars, and an instant film classic.
Provided you've read Tolkien's classic 'Rings' books, then there's much to love about this film. Jackson's first-rate direction, the scenic backdrops of New Zealand, an incredible ensembile cast, and very powerful perfomances from all facets of the production recreate Middle-Earth in sweeping camera shots and intricately designed sets. And of course, there's enough computer-generated effects to pacify just about anybody.
Aside from all the glitzy Hollywood effects, etc. 'Lord of the Rings' is the movie that audiences, even those with discerning tastes in film have been waiting a long time for. All the action, adventure, romance, all the emotional depth of character, plot, and script will sooth the most savage of movie buff's soul. 'Rings' will no doubt become a cinematic treasure.
I can't wait for next year when 'The Two Towers' will be released. 'Rings' raises the prospects and standards that Hollywood has been failing to reach by recent accounts. This film is truly something very special.  Even if you have haven't read the books, (which I would encourage anyone to do) 'Rings' is an entertaining holiday treat, wrapped in a history-making bow that audiences will be in absolute awe while unwrapping.
And I'll be a hobbit's right foot if 'Fellowship' isn't atleast nominated or doesn't take 'Best Picture'.
What more critical jargon can I dish out? YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!",1009497600,,1790,5.08843537414966
1327044,5,B00003CWT6,"I was completely enthralled by this movie. I had heard from some people that it was too long, but I didn't agree at all--I was sad when it ended. It's been a while since I read Lord of the Rings trilogy, but the movie brought it all back to me in living color. From the very beginning, it was exactly as I had imagined it--Bilbo's little round door, the Shire, young Hobbits playing, the furry little Hobbit feet. The world I created in my head while reading the books was right there on the screen in from of me.
Visually, this was an incredibly beautiful, vivid, detailed, complex movie. I found myself trying to take absolutely everything in at once--the perfect scenery, the subtle differences between the races of Middle Earth, the varied and intricate faces of the characters. The battle scenes were a little disorienting and chaotic, but certainly got across the fierceness with which the characters were fighting. The Orcs and Uruk-hai were terrible and frightening, with grotesque textures and features that made me shrink back in my seat. The different landscapes of Middle-Earth were amazingly varied and complex. Each had it's own look and feel. Lothlorien was my favorite--so ethereal and magical, full otherworldly beauty. Galadriel embodied this with her luminescent glow and deep sense of mystery. Hobbitown was rustic and comfortable, with it's round doors, green hills, and good-hearted inhabitants. Bree was bustling and strange, and Moria was truly dark but also a little sad. Rivendell was beautiful and secluded, with deep roots in myth and legend.
The plot was well played out, and the subtleties of Tolkien's epic story are left in tact. I was amazed in leaving the theater by how much I knew of the characters and the relationships between them. This was established in an unobtrusive manner, through dialog and small interactions, and I was surprised by how much was established so quickly. I felt strongly about each character, and the groundwork was laid for the parts that each would play in the continuing story. Elijah Wood was perfect for the part of Frodo. His large, innocent blue eyes were transformed through the course of the movie, becoming resolved and reluctantly brave. I was impressed by Sean Astin's Samwise--Astin did a good job of portraying the Hobbit's simple-minded loyalty. Sir Ian McKellen was wonderful as Gandalf--his great power was balanced by his good heart and softness for Hobbits. Also noteworthy was Orlando Bloom as Legolas--his elegance and reserved manner are quietly powerful, and served as a contrast to the chaos and darkness around him.
Overall, I felt greatly relieved and happy that this movie lived up to my expectations and to the long history of Tolkien's epic tale. It may not have followed the letter of the book, but the spirit was most certainly honored. I am grateful to Peter Jackson for making this movie (and making it well).
One more note: I found this movie to be at times quite frightening and violent, and I would really not recommend bringing small children.",1009497600,,3042,4.954990215264188

While I love the books and would thoroughly enjoy a full visual version of them, I realize that this is impossible.  Even Tolkien leaves a good deal of information out of the Lord of the Rings (partially provided in Tolkien's other works).  Given the medium that's being worked with and the time alotted, I think that this movie did a great job of presenting the storyline, portraying the intensity of the quest, and, in general, sucking you into the adventure.
Being a fan of the books, I'm puzzled by some of the omissions and some of the changes in the flow of the story, but I think that the movie, as a separate work is still very good.
My suggestion would be to read the books and see the movies.  You'll most likely enjoy them both.",1009497600,,928,4.409356725146199

Being an avid reader anyway, I took to the trilogy and its whole world in no time flat!!!  As I sat in the movie theater Saturday afternoon before this Christmas, I was astounded by this awesome motion picture version of Tolkien's masterpiece.  Peter Jackson has simply done a superb job of bringing this complex world and as many of its characters as were necessary to tell the story to vivid life.  What a movie!!!!

There were several points during the film where I was brought to near tears either by the beauty of the work and/or by the actors.

1327072,5,B00003CWT6,"'The Fellowship of the Ring' just plain took my breath away!  It far exceeded my expectations--especially with the crop of books-to-movies that have made it to the big screen in the past 10 years.  Considering that a theatrical release is first and foremost expected to earn back the cost of production and marketing, I fully expected most of the storyline to be
lost in bringing this incredible tale to the big screen.  You can just imagine my complete surprise at how truly faithful this screen adaptation ended up being.  As I re-read this story again I see the wisdom in why certain portions of the novel had to be selectively left out.  As one reviewer also noted, leaving out Tom Bombadil did nothing to diminish the story, and yet some liberties with the story were of course inevitable...and although I didn't agree with some of them, they were ultimately (in my opinion) excusable chiefly because of the sheer scope and how truly magificent this epic turned out.
Choosing New Zealand was an absolute stroke of genius.  Nowhere on earth (today anyway) can you find scenery that could compete with the imaginative brilliance that Tolkien brought to life in his description of Middle Earth.  If this country indeed looks like what I saw on the big screen, this is a place I need to visit.
I simply cannot say enough about how well this epic was made.  From the totally believable image of the Hobbits being so much smaller than most other races to the entrance to Moria which is
virtually a clone of the depiction found within the pages of the book, and on rare moments when I could hear conversations between characters that I recalled are word-for-word the same in the novel (I went back and checked just for the fun-of-it).  Hands down the best film I have seen this year (if not several) and recommend it highly to any and all fans of these masterful works of fiction.  As in all things, there will be those die hard fans who would rather see nothing if not an EXACT replica of the stories (which is impossible for so many reasons that cannot be written here), but for those who can appreciate what
Tolkien wrote, and how a task of placing this image on the big screen is really one major difficult job, will end up not just loving this movie, but also look forward to 'The Two Towers' which comes out December 2002.  Kudos to those responsible for
this visual treat.  I am thrilled that it was done so well, and
ultimately so faithful.  That alone is tribute enough to the memory of Tolkien's fantastic adventures.",1009497600,,2525,4.621923937360179

1327075,5,B00003CWT6,"As a teacher, I know that one of my responsibilities is to ensure that children's sense of ""Awe and Wonder"" is allowed to flourish. The modern child seems so cynical and sophisticated that he can be very difficult to impress. When I was eight years old, a student teacher had tried to read The Hobbit to my class. I hated it. But seeing the BBC's 1968 radio adaptation of the story in Waterstone's when looking for something to listen to on my journey to work, (one which lasts an hour and a half, There and Back Again) I felt sure that I could overcome my prejudice. I did. I loved it. I was hooked. I wanted more. I bought the BBC's radio Lord of the Rings (1980) and was now a confirmed Tolkienite. Fascinated by the mythology, I visited the ""official"" Tolkien website and discovered that a film was being made.  However, having seen Peter Jackson's hand held close-up-to-the-nostril style in ""Braindead"" and ""The Frighteners"", I was somewhat fearful of what he might do to the Frodo, Gollum and Aragorn imagined in my head. When I downloaded the first trailer, my fears were allayed more than somewhat. The hairs prickled on the back of my neck. Alas, I knew that I was going to have to wait another eighteen months to see a film about a book that I hadn't read; that if I read it I might be turned by the Power of The One Book into a Tolkien geek (too late already) and then be disappointed by the changes I knew Jackson would have to make.
I gave in of course, completing the trilogy last summer and rereading the Fellowship of the Ring this summer. Despite my enjoyment, Tolkien's writing leaves much to be desired and I became hopeful that a director who captured the spirit of the book rather than every dry detail would be doing us all a service.
When last night, the hour finally arrived, I was not disappointed. No, it was not like the BBC's version which I have now listened to countless times. No, the book has not been translated directly to the screen without any changes. Jackson has taken a number of liberties with the book, but has in the process, produced a film that in many ways is superior in vision to that achieved by Tolkien himself.
There is a theory that artists are not originators of their work, merely imperfect vessels for the expressions of universal truths. Whatever Tolkien may have intended by his book, there is a story, not necessarily his, to be imagined and reimagined by the readers, some of whom will baulk at seeing their version significantly altered. Perhaps the most obvious element missing in this film is the story and song, the literature and lore of Middle-Earth. But what is not only preserved, but magnified and rightly so, is the sense of a universe where the powers of good and evil, of nature and the landscape, are vastly greater than man can understand. Jackson's triumph is to have sewn this thread of truth into every frame, and, according to my wife, by no means a fan, ""made it all look so real"". The essence of the book for me is epitomised by Gollum, a pathetic character so twisted by the lust for power that he has no control over his own destiny. We have yet to see his role fully revealed, but it is clear that Frodo, Aragorn and even Sam too are controlled by their fates. What Jackson has achieved is a realisation of the scale of the hidden forces which direct man in love, in battle, throughout life. It is the sweep and power of the opening battle which sets the tone for the whole movie, not just the narrative detail. The detail is almost irrelevant. It matters not that we do not see properly the individual thrust and parry of a fight, because this film is not about the mechanics of war. It is about the forces which drive man to wage war and which are beyond his understanding - the same force which drives man to fall in love, to lust for power, to procreate.
It is a marvellous achievement. This film scores over almost every other that tries to grapple with the same themes. Star Wars, often quoted by those of short memory as the top movie of all time, does not come close in projecting the real, hidden powers of the universe. For all its talk of ""The Force"", it fails to convey half the passion and fear to be found in Fellowship. Star Wars is of course a different film - clever, knowing, a technical marvel, paying due allegiance to many other films and books, most notably Lord of the Rings. But Fellowship is not about special effects, or baddies and goodies in the simplistic sense, or buddy-buddies, or soap-opera moments (""I am your father Luke!""). If it lacks intimacy it is because it tries to get beyond the individuals that make up the story and instead visualise the unknowable meanings of life. A risky strategy, but one which works.
Jackson delivers a hugely spiritual film; not the kind of spiritual experience that dopeheads declared Kubrick's 2001 to be, but with the same sense of awe which I must arouse in my schoolchildren; the same sense of the ""terrible"" (reach for your dictionaries folks) which filmmakers generally shy away from. ""Awe and wonder"" is a rather embarrassing and much underrated theme for filmakers in a post-modern world, which heaps endless praise on self-referential Tarantino movies. The grand and meaningful can seem so absurd that such films can only be made full of wise-cracks to make them accessible to the closed-minded. This epic is therefore only for the open-minded, the innocent, even the nave, who are willing to allow ""awe and wonder"" to take over their lives for three hours. Like a six-year-old child, I can't wait for next Christmas.",1009411200,5,5576,4.576
1327076,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson has found the right mix of being true to the book and being watchable for those who haven't yet read the book.  Yes, he could have made it line-for-line from the text (I would have loved it).  But the ""average"" viewer would be bored to sleep.  A book and a movie are two different media and cannot be compared directly.  I loved every second of it.  I have read the book four times and am currently reading it again.  Say what you will, but to me it is worth it simply to see some (most) of the scenes I know so well in my mind come to ""life"" on the big screen.",1009411200,,575,4.0

The casting of Ian McKellen as Gandalf was ingenious!  He has the voice to carry the role. Elijah Wood put forth a remarkable (and surprisingly good) performance as Frodo Baggins. Not to knock Mr. Wood, however, I first had my doubts when I learned he was playing the role.
They put the emphasis on the areas that needed to make the book-to-screen transition. The effects were were done perfectly to make Hobbits seem smaller than everyone else...",1009411200,,476,4.804878048780488

1327080,5,B00003CWT6,"I always look forward to a Peter Jackson movie, ever since I discovered Bad Taste back in high school.  A movie that didn't even have a female actress, but had me rolling on the floor laughing.  Since then, i've rushed to every one of his films:  Meet the Feebles, Dead Alive, the Frighteners, Heavenly Creatures...
I can't usually say the same for Lord of the Ring movies.  I tried so hard to like those animated ones, but the Lord of the Rings one especially, with a choppy story and the ever-changing animation styles, only made me disappointed.
So, hearing that Peter Jackson was directing LoTR, I gave a woop of joy.  One of my fav directors doing one of my fav book series!  And I was not disappointed.  In fact, I wonder if he's been taking lessons from Terry Gillian.
The movies is pretty to watch, and despite the effects needed in a picture of this sort, they do not overpower or attempt to compensate for anything else.  In fact, they looked natural.
The acting is good, the dialog was well done, the directing, the cinematography, the score... the movie has a good stable balance of everything.  the only complaint is that it moves fast at some points, but that was only a *small* editing point.
So there you go. My recommendation is:  SEE IT!!!!!!",1009411200,,1260,4.56

In the Harry Potter movie, one of the biggest scenes is the troll scene in the girls bathroom, but in ""The Lord of the Rings"" there are hundreds of troll-like creatures called ""Orks"".  I am 11 and have only read half of ""The Hobbit"", and I want to now read the whole Triligy, I recomend it, even though it is violent!!  Thank You",1009411200,,440,4.329268292682927
1327141,2,B00003CWT6,"The hype currently surrounding these films is laughable to me now, even though a few weeks ago I was excited to see this first installment.  Peter Jackson and crew have succeeded in destroying my memory of Tolkien's finely crafted, SUBTLE work.  Subtle this film is not.  More like mind-numbing, poorly conceived, inappropriately violent.  Just another action movie, albeit a three-hour action movie.  There is NO characterization, NO good dialogue, NO charm, NO enchantment, NO humor, NOTHING to enjoy.  There is only a ring that needs to get from Point A to Point B.  Blah blah blah...
Big, loud, stupid, ugly.  Poor special effects.  Gratuitous battle scenes.  Poor pacing.  No emotion.  I am so disappointed in this film.  I really believe any one out there who is excited about this film is either a teen who has never read the books (but seen The Matrix a hundred times), an adult with a real soft spot for DIE HARD, or a geek who is in denial - who realizes there was a lot wrong with the film, but didn't quite find it ""bad enough"" to criticize so therefore falls head over heels in his/her praise for ""the magnificient hobbit effects!!!""  Hey guy...they're just filming actors at different angles, using a lot of close-ups, and substituting kids for adults in behind-the-back shots.  This ain't ILM, folks...
Twenty years from now, my kids will not be watching this film over and over.  No one will.  This isn't the new Star Wars, it's the new TITANIC, the new PEARL HARBOR - a film that is initially greeted with praise but soon forgotten as an overhyped mess.  And the next 2 are already in the can, so drink up!!!  I look forward to two more years of listening to geeks decieve themselves so they can jock Elijah Wood and Peter Jackson.
Two stars for the cast....all good sports, especially Wood and Ian McKellen.  Jackson led them like lambs to the slaughter, but at least they gave it their all on the way down.",1009411200,7,1925,4.655786350148368
1327142,5,B00003CWT6,"I just had a total blast watching this movie, and on so many different levels.  It was great, simply great, to be able to compare Peter Jackson's sincere vision with my own: in my mind, he hit it dead-on with each and every member of the Fellowship - even to the point of making it easy to confuse Aragorn and Boromir; I had always visualized goblins, orcs, and the Uruk-Hai in exactly the same way they are depicted in the film (before the Brothers Hildebrandt - and their annual calendars in the late'70's and '80's - slightly altered my visualization of these hideous creatures);  the landscapes were a joy and somehow, in all substantial ways, amazingly close to the way I visualized them as well; Rivendell looked a bit too much like a Swiss chalet though, and Elrond needed to be MUCH taller, but these are minor quibbles.  Jackson really succeeds in recreating the FEEL of the Fellowship of the Ring. The comaraderie, Gandalf's love of Bilbo and Frodo, and them for each other, Sam's simple-minded, determined loyalty, Frodo's crushing burden, and the chemistry among the nine (perhaps excepting the competition between Gimli and Legolas), are all presented ably and with care.  What we have here, with this movie, is clearly a labor of love.  The filmakers truly wanted to do it RIGHT.  For the most part, they succeeded.
My one problem might lie with the film's breakneck pacing in the second half.  It did occur to me, though, that this movie will completely blow away anyone who has never read the LOTR.  The ominous portentous prologue, featuring an awesome confrontation of armies, the hideous, gripping visions when Frodo puts on the dreaded ring, the intense violence, and the hanging cut-it-with-a-knife tension place this film almost in the horror genre.
The book, however, is more leisurely paced, filled with exposition, descriptions, songs and ancient tales, in both  elven and dwarvish tounges.  I suppose that a film bringing all such elements to bear might bore some and turn others off with the sheer length that would be required.  I, for one, would love every minute of it.  Hopefully, there is a director's cut in its embryonic stage, containing some of the key missing elements: Bombadil, Galadriel's gifts, a more developed Gimli and Legolas, etc.
Given his audience, and economic expectations, Mr. Jackson has really done it right.  Tolkien fans everywhere can be grateful while they wait for their next chance to see it again.  Those not familiar with the books can count on a truly awe-inspiring, and memorable, theatrical experience.",1009411200,,2566,4.951048951048951
1327143,5,B00003CWT6,"I have never before (well I have but I was a child watching the original Star Wars) been so transfixed by a movie.  I've watched fantasy movies, and fantasy books turned into movies, and well, I was transfixed.  Enthralled.  Drawn in.  I went back and saw it again.  Then I thought about seeing it a third time.
My life is so gray compared to the world of Middle Earth presented in this version of the books.  While I would never espouse watching the movie without reading the books, there is no way to put what frodo is thinking, or what sam is thinking, or what quite simply could not fit, into the movie (for example, tom bombadil and the mounds).
I was so afraid when I was on Weathertop.  I was so upset when our leader died.  I was so frightened when one of my friends turned on me.  I was so sad when he came to himself and then died.  I wasn't watching the movie, either time i saw it.  I was living it.  I was the fifth hobbit, the third human, the second wizard.  I was on the council at Rivendell....
My friends will tell you this is not something that happens to me often (they might say ever).
I've never written a Review before.  But this movie is to Harry Potter, what Star Wars was to Star Trek.  I felt you should know my experience. We have entered a new age of fantasy.  I hope we stay here, because I liked it here.",1009411200,,1335,4.15625

I was not disappointed.  I saw it 2 days after it came out and immediately wanted to see it again,  the next day I went, and wanted to see it again.  Last night, I was satisfied once more, but still want to see it again.  Maybe this sounds fanatical, but I know that I am not alone.  I went with some friends that saw it for the first time last night and the first thing that they said was, ""it was amazing, lets go again!""  I, like everyone else am anxious for the next one to be released, I wish I did not have to wait a year.  I think that they did justice to the characters such as the hobbits and the elves, they were as described in the book.

Perfect: casting, script, location, effects, directing, lighting, Moria.
Merely Good: costuming (Aragorn and the hobbits looked great, but I think Gimli's helm was made of plastic), battle scenes (Moria and the island on the Great River were fantastic, but the Weathertop battle was too easy a win for Aragorn), acting (Agent Smith is Elrond?)
Bad: Galadrial's cheesy ""demon voice"" was straight out of Evil Dead, lack of back story and motivation for Gimli and Legolas (if you haven't read the books, you'll wonder who these guys are and why they're going with Frodo), film is too short.",1009411200,,718,5.145299145299146
1327146,5,B00003CWT6,"Having been a fan of Jackson's superb 'Heavenly Creatures' I came to this movie with high expectations, just like those fans of Tolkien's books that went.  Basically, it live up to them.  Firstly I'll deal with those fans that seemed to expect a text-to-script translation.  Yes there are some characters that are omitted but this is necessary for all movies of the book.  The general public wouldn't be prepared to sit through a fantasy film of much over 3 hours (sad though this is).  People who went to see this wanting an exact replica of the book will be disappointed.
The movie succeeds on so many levels that it's countless to name them.  Obviously a great deal of care has gone into the replication of all of the creatures from the books, with many being genuinely scary to the extent that I was surprised that the movie didn't get a higher certificate.  As for the performances - they are perfectly paced, especially Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood.  Characterisation is also impressive for a movie that effectively has the whole fellowship and essential characters that they meet on the way to get to grips with.  The audience is made to actually care for the hobbits, elves and humans that grace the screen in front of us.
The special effects are completely mind-blowing and a landmark in that field.  We get treated to a variety of kingdoms, a fiersome demon and countless works of magic.  Unlike such movies as 'Titanic' for example, the hobbits never appear superimposed over their fantastical background.  All of this completely immerses the viewer in the movie.
In fact, the only problem that I had with the movie at all was the somewhat perfunctory forbidden love subplot which, if it wasn't going to be included properly, should have been left out entirely.  It's hard not to get the feeling that this was forced upon Jackson to appeal to a wider audience base.
Yet 'The Fellowship of the Rings' is most successful in that it does appeal to both readers of the book and to those that haven't.  In this it is a true success, not just a classic in fantasy film but a classic of film full stop.",1009411200,,2106,4.6567567567567565
1327147,2,B00003CWT6,"Back in the 60s or 70s, the Harvard Lampoon (which is where the ""National"" one came from) published a hilarious spoof of J.R.R. Tolkein's ""Lord of the Rings"" titles ""Bored of the Rings"" which included such notable characters as Frito and Dildo. That book title occurred to me several times during my viewing of the new movie.
I have to say up front, that I was never able to get more than a few chapters into the original book. It just never grabbed me. But I thought, perhaps the movie would inspire me to pick it up again.  HAH! To say I was disappointed is a huge understatement. The movie was pretentious. It seemed to be some sort of pathetic Sword and Sorcery clich. If it weren't for the fact that the original story was written, like, a million years ago, I'd say that it was just a clichd rip-off of every other film in the genre for the past 30 years. The one exception to this is the size difference in the characters. As the Hobbits are supposed to be pretty small, and the humans big, a good job was done in making us believe the size difference in the actors was real. Well... it was good at first. Then it got to be pretty obvious for it's use of blue-screens and children shot from the back.
The graphics were so obviously computer generated that it was laughable. In fact, they reminded me in some scenes of the old ""Sinbad the Sailor"" movies I watched as a kid. I don't know. Maybe I've become jaded by pioneering effects like those in ""Forrest Gump"", ""Titanic"", or ""Star Wars: Episode 1"". Maybe it's like how once you know how a magician does his tricks, they don't seem very magical anymore - you can spot the trick.
I've always been a fan of Elijah Woods. Well, when he was a kid anyway. Now he seems pathetic. For this movie, it appears the make-up wizards glued his eyelids wide open. Then it appears they couldn't unglue them because his eyes stay this way in every scene. I think that prior to every scene they made him drink a couple of gallons of iced-tea and then told him he couldn't pee until the scene was shot. I say this because in every scene he looks like he can't wait to get the hell out of there to take a leak. EVERY scene. There is no change of expression at all.
Ian McKellan as Gandalf was also quite weird. I have the feeling I know what was in that pipe he was always smoking (As intimated in the movie as well). He seemed to be unaware of what scene it was or what his lines were.
As I said, I never read the book all the way through, and maybe if I had the movie would have made more sense. But as far as I could tell, there was no real story. For a three-hour movie, nothing much really happened. The character development was, for the most, part weak. I kept forgetting that this was taken from a much-loved book - it seemed they were making it up as they went. I half-expected them to whip out a pair of twelve-sided dice to decide what would happen next. To those who claim this is Oscar-caliber, I sneer with derision.
D&D fans will probably like this movie. As for me, I kept thinking of a scene in an episode of Friends, where Chandler and Ross can't believe Joey never read ""Lord of the Rings"" in high school. To which Joey replies ""Dude, I was busy having sex in high school."" For this reviewer, that would have been time better spent. By the time I was an hour into this movie, I was, indeed, ""Bored of the Rings.""

1327148,5,B00003CWT6,"This was an excellent movie, and probably one of the best book to movie relationships.  Having read the trilogy at least 10 times, it was great to see the scenes and actors portrayed in real life.
For the most part, the acting was very well done, and the scenes were spectacular.  The best parts for me were the part at the Ford at Rivendell and the Bridge of Moria.  These two must have been the absolute best.
My only bone of contention was the very different timeline at the begining of the film.  Having Frodo leave immediately after receiving the Ring was not good screenplay, and made the movie feel somewhat rushed.  Gandalf's imprisonment didn't seem to fit in and the giving away of Bag End was missed.  Though the movie was three hours long, another 25-30 minutes would have been well used.
Elrond, played by Hugo Weaving was not a bad player for the part, however he simply didn't seem to be the wise and understanding elf that Elrond portrays.  I kept waiting for Elrond to lean over Frodo and say ""Mr. Baggins, we've had our eye on you for some time now."" in that Agent Smith of the Matrix way.

1327199,5,B00003CWT6,"With filmakers becoming more and more talented it is little surprise that Tolkien's is first rate.  I viewed this film twice after reading the book some twenty years ago.  Speaking with excited college students around me before the viewing, I was amazed at what a cult following the book still has; indeed the entire audience was college or graduate aged young people with a smattering of greybeards thrown in for balance.
The film not only captured the beauty of all the associated art from the last 40 years, but left the audience with a good sense of sadness and desperation.  As I finally came to know the characters again, the film ended, leaving me famished for more.

1327200,5,B00003CWT6,"I have to admit, I was REALLY worried about this movie.  I've read the trilogy innumerable times since I first discovered it in 1981, and I suffered through both the Ralph Baskhi adaptation and the Rankin-Bass version of Return of the King.  After these two travesties, I was starting to think that no one could bring Tolkein to the screen without butchering it.  But, I went to see it at a midnight movie on the day it premiered.
I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the movie!  Peter Jackson has done what I thought was impossible.  After seeing it, I had only one worry - would people who had never read the books, or who hadn't read them for a long time, be able to understand what was going on?  But, my fears have been put to rest.  My brother-in-law, who has never read the books at all, was able to follow and understand the film with no problem.  The first ten minutes or so of the film are devoted to explaining the ""backstory"" behind the Ring, and why it is so dangerous.
Elijah Wood is well cast as Frodo Baggins, the ""young"" hobbit who must bear the Ring from his home in the Shire all the way across Middle-Earth to Mount Doom, in the very heart of the realm of the evil Dark Lord Sauron.  This is the only place where the Ring can be destroyed, by casting it into the flame in which it was originally made.  Sean Astin is his fellow hobbit and loyal companion, Sam Gamgee, another piece of brilliant casting.  Ian McKellen is destined to be known forever as Gandalf the Grey, much as Alec Guiness will forever be Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Christopher Lee is also great as the fallen wizard Saruman the White, in a role significantly expanded from the book (and very well done, I might add).  But, the single best casting job, in my opinion, has to be Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins.  He turns in a dark, creepy, almost sinister performance as the old hobbit who was in posession of the evil Ring for 60 years.  Even though he manages to leave the Ring to Frodo early in the film, his craving for it and its evil power is VERY evident.  Just an absolutely stunning performance from a truly great actor.
The special effects are unbelivable.  New Zealand was the perfect place to film.  The shots of Rivendell, Lothlorien, and Moria are all excellent.  The Shire is well done, and Bag End looks every bit as luxurious as the book makes it out to be.  I loved Jackson's interpretation of Isengard and Orthanc, and I also liked the intruiging hints of Minas Tirith, Barad-Dur, and Mount Doom, all of which I look forward to seeing in more detail.
The action and battle scenes are excellent, especially the shots of Sauron taking swings against human and Elven warriors with his great mace early in the film.  The evil Orcs are suitable revolting and disgusting, and the few glimpses we get of Gollum are chilling.  The Balrog must be seen to be believed.
There are some parts of the book that are not in the film, mainly the sequence in the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil, and the Barrow-Downs.  It's a good bit, but in the final analysis, nonessential.  I had no problem with the expansion of the roles of Arwen and Saruman.  Arwen simply fills in for a minor character for a few extra minutes of screen time, and Saruman's role really isn't anything new.  It is simply that we actually SEE Saruman doing things that are only talked about in the book.
It's impossible to take a 500+ page novel and make a movie, even one three hours long, that includes everything faithfully.  It's just not possible, nor is it good movie-making.  Print and film are two different mediums, and things that work well in one do not always do so in another.  Peter Jackson has done a fantastic job.  Filming Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and Return of the King was absolutely the right thing to do.  The books all take place immediately after each other, and this way, the movies are assured of visual continuity.  Just as Tolkein considered the LOTR ""trilogy"" to be one novel, so too will these movies form three parts of one long film that can be watched back-to-back with no continuity gaps.  When these films have all been released, I think Peter Jackson will deserve to be placed in the first rank of modern cinema.  Steven Spielberg or George Lucas couldn't have done any better, and that is high praise indeed.",1009411200,,4292,4.48840206185567
1327201,5,B00003CWT6,"I was so thrilled with this movie! I am a fan of the books, and I have to say I wasn't really expecting the movie to be nearly as good. But it was!!!! I've seen it once and can't wait to watch it again.
  There were a few details left out that I wished hadn't been, (no, I don't mean Tom Bombadil) but not enough to ruin the movie in any way. For example, they didn't have enough of Merry & Pippen, which is a shame since they could have added some comic relief. Otherwise there was marvelous attention to detail.  I especially like the way they kept some of the actual lines used in the books.
  The actors were cast with real genius. They did such a great job. I didn't think anyone could portray Tolkien's characters in a believable way,...but was I wrong!! Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and Viggo Mortenson (Aragorn), definitely stand out-they were awesome. They really became the characters. So does Elijah Wood(Frodo), ""Elrond"",  Sean Astin (Sam),...and Legolas, Gimli, Pippen....they were ALL good!! The only exception possibly being the Lady Galadriel...she's not shown as the good, loving queen she is in the book.
  The sound effects are rather deafening, and the orcs are some of the most hideous looking creatures I've ever seen. They really did a job making them! All in all, a great movie, and probably the best adaption possible of Tolkien's work!!! A classic ""good vs. evil"" story. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie again, ...and then I want the other two!!!!",1009411200,,1474,4.664092664092664
1327202,4,B00003CWT6,"Let's cut to the chase: this was a good movie as well as a satisfying re-telling of Tolkien's tale.  The cinematography was fantastic: the Shire, Rivendale, and Moria (espeically) all came alive.  The acting ranged from decent to excellent (particularly Aragorn and Gandolf).  Even Liv Tyler actually acted!  The battles were great and there were some truly scary parts (my wife was clutching me during the Nazgul scenes).

So why not 5 stars?  Well, there are some issues.  Not the ""it wasn't faithful to the book"" issues. Those complainers are just plain foolish.  It's a movie.  They HAD to make changes.  While I missed some characters, I found a lot of the choices the filmmakers made to be quite interesting, and some of them worked quite well.  But I do think the movie dragged a trifle in places; a lot of exposition and traveling and a little too much worshipful music tended to make thing seem a little tedious at times.  Don't shoot me, just a little, and only a times.  I also think, pardoxically, the battle scenes were a little too frenetic.  Edits were so fast I often had a hard time figuring what exactly was happening (although the fast edits did keep me tense in my seat).  These pacing issues keep the movie from being 5 stars for me, but it's still darn good.  Some of the scenes, well, I don't want to spoil anything, but there are some killer scenes.  Sauron vs. Gandalf: awesome.  Nuff said.",1009411200,,1415,4.614457831325301
1327203,4,B00003CWT6,"Lord of the Rings was good, but not great.  It did keep me entertained through the unusually long movie and I only had to quiet my stomach grumbling twice.  The visual effects were at just the right level so as to add to the movie, but not be so huge that they become the action - it deserves 5 stars for that.  The acting was mediocre, but I preferred to have the relatively unknown actors as opposed to Hollywood stars.  This movie, however, did not make me want to run out and read the books again.  Tolkien set the stage for the modern medieval sci-fi adventure, and I wish he could have taken part in this film.  I know I will go to see the sequels, but only because I enjoy the plotline.  If I hadn't already read the books I would not have been interested in even finishing the 2 1/2 hour movie.
Why 4 stars?:
While everything seems to be in place, it just felt as though it was missing something.  Perhaps it is only suffering from being overhyped and cannot live up to it, but I was hoping for something more.  Still, it is not a waste of your money.  This movie is entertaining and you will be get wrapped up in the characters, though the ending certainly does leave it wide open for the sequel.",1009324800,,1205,4.222707423580786
1327204,5,B00003CWT6,"Well, that's about all I can say if you haven't seen this movie yet.  If you have, you must agree with me.  Visually stunnning (thats what $300 does), superbly acted, fueled by an epic soundtrack, and of course, the greatest fantasy story ever told, Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Ring's"" is nearly perfect.  Its only flaw: it ended.  It'll be an awfully long year before we get to see Jackson's masterful rendition of Middle Earth in ""The Two Towers.""",1009324800,,450,4.658227848101266
1327205,5,B00003CWT6,"I know that a lot of people criticized this movie for alterations.  A movie should be faithful to it's source, but the point of making a good movie is to make a good movie.  If the movie had given the same proportion to the story that the book did, we would have found ourselves watching nearly two hours of Frodo and company just getting out of the Shire.  Some things (like the songs and poems) would have not translated very well.  Other things were omitted simply for length's sake.  And while I missed Tom Bombadil, I realize that his segment of the story was a likely candidate for exclusion because his character could be removed without harming the structure of the plot.  (His character has been omitted in every film and radio adaptation, by the way).  I will repeat the statement from my original review: No film or television endeavor of this magnitude will be complete.  They will, by nature, have their shortcomings.  Like the ""Dune"" series, we must appreciate the best efforts of the interpreters.

This movie has everything I could have asked for.  The plot is intact, even if some of the elements are altered (and a surprising number of details that are, in fact, well attended to).  The visuals are stunning, the cinematography is gorgeous, the music is effective, the action is tremendous, and the characters are well portrayed by the cast.
This is a movie that could have been easily done very poorly.  Indeed, those of us who are sci-fi / fantasy enthusiasts are so often disappointed.  However, it is obvious that this is no effort that calls for an apology.  It is a gem of a work, and deserves the accolades that it has been receiving.  I look forward to the remaining movies with anticipation.",1009324800,,1718,4.676666666666667
1327206,2,B00003CWT6,"Okay, for starters, NO, I HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK!  So I'm sure those of you who are devoted to the book will think I am nuts when I say that ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship..."" is way, way, way too long at 3-plus hours.  Is it interesting?  Yes.  Does it have fantastic acting?  Yes, especially by Sir Ian McKellan, who brings sparks of excitement to the movie every time he's in a scene (Viggo Mortensen runs a close second).  Is it an epic story?  Yes.  But this film would have much better (and I bet would get more repeat business) if at least 45 minutes had been cut.  The scenes with Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are unnecessary (at least for this installment; I'm guessing their characters pop up again in the trilogy.  Otherwise, what was the point of putting them in the film at all?!), and the Fellowship's trek (while at times exciting) goes on for way too long.  I kept waiting for the end credits to roll, only to discover that, no, the fellowship is forging on to yet another place.  By the end of the movie, I was a bit jealous of the Fellowship lads because, with all the treking they did, their butts - unlike mine - were not asleep!  It's not a bad movie, but wait for it to come out on video when you can watch it in the comforts of your own home.",1009324800,,1265,4.199170124481328
1327223,5,B00003CWT6,"To start of with, this is one of the best films of the year, hands down. Being an avid fan of The lord of the Rings trilogy, and having read all of the books and the books that come after i think it is a great film. I saw it the day it came out, and I do not regret seeing it at all. It is true that Peter Jackson, the director, did take out some major parts from the book, he still made an extremly good movie.
The characters where true to the book also, and the casting....they did a perfect job at casting the characters. It was this or the acting that was the best part of the movie. The computer graphics are almost seamless with the actuall film. one of the best parts of the movie are the battles. Just wait till you see this.
All together this is hands down the best movie I have ever seen and I think it is generating hype not seen since Titanic and  is truly a trilogy to rival Star Wars.
Some fans think that is is not a good movie. This is not true. These are usually mad fans who are so set in there ways that they cannot see that Peter Jackson was not making this film for only the fans but is making a movie for all people to enjoy.
JUST GET THIS MOVIE and read the book.....",1009324800,,1190,3.9377593360995853
1327224,5,B00003CWT6,"Somewhere over the last 20+ years I lost count of the number of times I have read LOTR (and The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, etc.). I have been waiting for this film for over 3 years, so to say that I had high expectations would be an understatement! I am happy to say that the film lives up to all the hype, being a truly passionate and very faithful rendering of the books into film.  Not only did the movie faithfully capture the emotional depth and beauty of Tolkien's creation, the movie *interprets* LOTR in a way that is thematically faithful while offering a fresh perspective on the story.
To the Tolkien fans who freak out over every little change from Tolkien's original text, remember that books and film are very different story-telling media.  The problem with the Harry Potter movie, IMHO, is that it offered *nothing* new to justify its existence as a film.  It was simply the film-of-the-book; i.e., if you've read the book, there's little reason to see the movie. Happily, Peter Jackson had made the film of the *story* of LOTR, rather than the film-of-the-book.
Yes, there were one or two points where the film interpretation didn't work for me, especially Lothlorien and Galadriel, but these quibbles are minor against the grand scope of this achievement.  Bravo to Peter Jackson and company for the passion and faith to bring the ""unfilmable"" LOTR to the screen--FINALLY!",1009324800,,1395,4.848739495798319
1327225,4,B00003CWT6,"That said this is a truly great film. As any film will it does have it's flaws. The editing and cuts were sometimes to fast to follow properly, Legolas was unfortunatly underdeveloped, and Gimli was almost non-existent. The scene in which Arwen rescues Frodo really peeved me and was the main reason I deducted a star. That scene should have been great. Imagine poor Frodo, wounded perhaps mortally, facing the ringwraiths on his own. Attempting to flee on a massive horse he crosses the ford and pulls his sword weakly challenging the hissing demonic black riders. To bad it wasn't like that. But still that said everyone MUST SEE this flick. The way this film transitions from the epic to the personal is remarkable. It truly does rival Lawrence of Arabia and Seven Samuri. There are many moments that made me quake, cry, jump, stare in awe, and basically escape into middle-earth. The acting is top-notch in all circumstances. At times the script is painfully cheesy, but on a whole it is filled with a flood of subtle and emotional moments. Just keep your eyes open and you will find them. I don't want to give anything away. The effects are supremely intergrated in such a way that many of them rival Harryhausen with the exception of some of the vistas and locations. Now I am serious. If Peter Jackson does a even more skillful job fleshing out some of the characters in the next two installments I do believe we may have one of the greatest if not the greatest achievment in motion picture history. Just you wait and see. And finally to those few who gave this movie a severe trashing, did you see the same film I did? Go see it again and really take it in. Look for the small details. They are there even if they are hidden in a fantasy landscape.",1009324800,,1756,4.542586750788644
1327226,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson's Fellowship is up there with the best fantasy films of all time and is as accurate as can be given three hours (to do Fellowship to the letter would probably take about 10 hours). Those who carp about inaccuracies in the representation of certain characters (the anthropomorphic Sauron for example) really need to bone up on their Tolkien (and I'm talking Silmarillion here) since their complaints are unwarranted. No film can replace the images given by a book and this is certainly not a substitute for the books, but it's great to see the book rendered with such admiration and understanding. The only problem is the year-long wait between films.",1009324800,,664,4.9375

The film is very faithful to the original - which I deeply appreciate as I'd expected Hollywood to reduce Tolkien's classic to flamboyant trash.  The special effects are great (of course!), the cast is appropriately chosen, and the landscape background is simply breathtaking.  The film was long but you wouldn't feel it.  I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone (except very young children as they may be scared by some of the scenes).",1009324800,,578,4.86734693877551

Well casted and incredably acted! Yes there were large amounts of material left out, but come on the movie would have been 6 hours long if they included everything,I thought they compressed the story well without sacrificing the major story line.

'Why is Saruman working for Sauron?'
'Whats up with Galadriel?'
But I've watched it again and it was WAY better.
All the changes done were necessary or how do you explain something like 'Why doesnt Gimli want to go Moria (as in the book)' to someone who hasn't read the book? It is not possible.
The special effects are just great! The beginning of the movie is just breathtaking!
The logic in releasing the next movie at X-Mas 2002 is as followed (I think). Till April the people will watch FOTR in Cinema and then ITS Star Wars time till August. In September there is the DVD/Video release. And in December the next (and from my point of view the BEST movie).

1327289,1,B00003CWT6,"Another huge and hugely disappointing film of 2001. My expectations were very great after seeing so many beautiful still images on the web, but most of them were cut out of the final release, obviously to leave more room for stupid sword fighting, in order to appeal more to teenage boys.
Acting ranges from very decent(Gandalf, Saruman) to poor (Elrond, why is he so angry all the time?), and so does photography and CGI (the Shire, Argonath, and Orthanc are very convincing, Moria, the initial battle, and some ruins are laughable at best).
This film is totally superficial and bears only token resemblance to the book. The changes (for the worse) are too numerous to list here, but it is a fact that Tolkien's great story, stripped of its details, its depth and its history underneath is rather simplistic, and that is exactly what this film is. Safe for a few short scenes, this film left me completely unmoved, quite unlike the book.
If you want to see what Tolkien meant by the ""valour of old"", get Braveheart and John Boorman's Excalibur. Both feature great drama and acting and very good DVD transfers.",1009324800,15,1110,4.756476683937824

I don't think anybody would walk out of the theatre being a fan of Aragorn, while in the book, ... he's one of the greatest heros.
Most of the people were really impressed with Legolas... that elf really stole the show.

1327293,5,B00003CWT6,"First off, I should mention that I have always been a big fan of Tolkien, as much for his influence as his works.
A few weeks prior to the movie, I purchased and reread the trilogy (including The Hobbit).  So the exact details of the books were very fresh in my mind when I first sat down to watch the movie.  I'd imagine that for those who are bigger fans than I the details in the books are just as fresh in their minds, even though their last readings may be more distant.
Throughout the entire viewing, I found myself comparing it to the books.  I lamented the huge portions of the trip from the Shire to Rivendell that were cut out; I was midly peeved at the role played by Arwen, and I gasped at the butchery of the meeting with Galadriel.  When the movie was over, I was profoundly disappointed; I had been so concerned finding the flaws in the movie (where it differed from the book) that I was unable to enjoy it.
Not wanting to pass hasty judgement, I waited a few days and then saw it again.  This was a wonderful decision.
The second time around, I found that I no longer compared the movie to the book.  Instead, I was able to enjoy it for what it was: a fantastic movie, rather than an above-average adaptation of a novel.  And this is what you must keep in mind while watching.  If you are looking for a perfectly faithful reproduction of the novel, seek elsewhere.  The movie is three hours long, far too short to perfectly mimic a novel like The Fellowship.  Furthermore, there is a lot of the background material in the book that simply cannot be conveyed well in movie format.
On the other hand, judged as a movie, LOTR succeeds spectacularly on all levels.  The landscapes and special effects are superb; the acting and casting are wonderful; the cinematography, although a bit rough in places (like the battles), is generally very well-done.  Most importantly, the movie succeeds at being both epic and sentimental, humorous and frightening.  The ability of LOTR to elicit such a wide range of emotions is testament to the fantastic interplay between the all the elements that make up the film.
LOTR must be judged on its merits as a film, not as a screenplay adaptation.  If you are a big fan of the books, it may take more than one viewing before you are able to do this.  Once you've put aside your preconceived notions, however, you can scarcely be disappointed.  LOTR is a truly epic film, and a few minor flaws should not prevent anyone from being wholly entertained and moved by it.",1009238400,,2510,4.4714912280701755
1327294,5,B00003CWT6,"I've never seen a film like this. Forget fantasy films in the past(that I've enjoyed, mind you) that tried to be like this film. Legend, Willow, The Neverending Story. Forget adventure drama epics in recent years that aren't even as good as this. Gladiator, Braveheart, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
Not only was I skeptical of this movie( I've been skeptical of every sure-blockbuster film since Episode I), but I was ready to hate it. Oh, was I mistaken.
Acting: Superb. Elijah Wood wasn't buggy. That's a feat in itself! (My personal favorite: Orlando Bloom as Legolas. And that's not just because he's easy on the eyes...) Story and Flow: Excellent. Never bored. Always intrested. Action: Oh my lord...amazing.
I've never read the books, and I don't intend to. I do intend, however,to wait until next December to see the rest of the story unfold wonderfully before my eyes. This is cinematic artistry.

1327297,5,B00003CWT6,"Director Peter Jackson has, with the collaboration of his cast and crew, achieved a spectacular success with ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" the first installment in a promised trilogy of films based on the classic fantasy adventure novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. ""Fellowship"" takes place in Middle Earth, a fantastic realm peopled by wizards, dwarves, elves, and other beings. All of Middle Earth faces an apocalyptic threat in the reemergence of legendary dark lord Sauron. As evil forces gather, a critical task is entrusted to Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), of the race of beings known as Hobbits.
""Fellowship"" is a sweeping epic that features awe-inspiring vistas, journeys, and battles. But despite the tremendous scope of Jackson's canvas, he never loses touch with the lives of his characters. And although these characters are beings from the world of fantasy, the emotional core of the film is absolutely real: the film movingly explores such universal concerns as fear, love, friendship, shame, and loyalty.
An outstanding cast delivers superb performances. Ian McKellan, who lately has had a string of amazing larger-than-life roles (""Gods and Monsters,"" ""X-Men""), is amazing as the wizard Gandalf: he brings not only power and regal bearing, but also a merry earthiness to his role. Elijah Wood is equally outstanding as Frodo; he brings depth and likability to his role as a sort of ""everyman"" (or ""everyhobbit""?) who rises to, and is ennobled by, the epic quest that is thrust upon him. I won't mention each of the other cast members, but will just say that they also meet this level of excellence, creating a rich and moving tapestry of relationships among their characters.
Every element of the film comes together superbly: art direction, cinematography, makeup, visual effects, etc.; I was particularly impressed by Howard Shore's musical score. And one of the film's key themes -- that an unlikely or unexpected person can be a hero -- is compelling. One word of caution, however: ""Fellowship"" is very much an adult film. Its combination of graphic, ""Saving Private Ryan""-style battlefield carnage and ""Omen""-style demonic horror may be way too intense for much of the ""Harry Potter"" fan base. But for adults and mature children, this fantasy epic is an awe-inspiring, emotionally rich journey that you may want to take more than once.",1009238400,2,2369,5.1558441558441555

As a huge Tolkien fan (I have read the books countless times; I own both the American and British dramatazations; and I have watched all the crummy cartoons) I demanded perfection. Okay, the movie wasn't PERFECT (in the last scene, when Aragorn chops the head off of the last orc and runs to Boromir, a ""dead"" orc turns over and begins to stand up) but I can honestly say that it is the best movie I have ever seen. It beats Star Wars, Godfather, Matrix, and all those greats. I cannot wait for the next two.
It was not exactly like the book, which is good. It kept to the SPIRIT of the book, which is great. Anyone who appreciates movies realizes that you absolutely CANNOT recreate a book word for word into a movie and have every detail exactly like every reader imagines. It is impossible.
Some changes: Glorfindel's brief and somewhat pointless role is given to Arwen, thus giving an earlier view of the elf and Aragorn and their relationship. Tom Bombadil and the entire Old Forrest bit are gone. I hated that part of the books, but even if you enjoyed it, lets face facts: the movie is already three hours long. The introduction of Pippin and Merry and the flight from the Shire is rushed. But once again, 50 years pass between the party and Frodo's leaving, and it is already a LONG movie. You have to cut corners. Here are the only changes I thought they shouln't have changed: The sword that was broken is not reforged. Sam never gets the Elvish rope. The only gift we see Galadriel give is the vial to Frodo. Moria was rearranged and I felt an important part of Gimli's character was left out. Gimli never becomes obsessed with Galadriel's beauty. Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli's reasons for coming to Rivendell are left out. That seems like a lot, but the film is so good, I was easily able to forgive them these artistic liberties. Some things they changed for the better: No Tom bombadil! Arwen and Saruman's roles were extended. Aragorn is shown to be more human because in the movie is afraid of succumbing to the same fate as Isildur. Elrond, who witnessed Isildur's failure, has lost faith in men and Aragorn. Sam and Boromir's characters are heightened by a marvellous script and great acting.
Go watch this movie. You will love it. I guarantee it!
(PS
In the extended DVD, it has some scenes that I complained about being left out like Gimli and Galadriel. And according to the Two Towers previews, the sword WILL be reforged. Go Peter Jackson!)",1009238400,,3042,4.492779783393502

for every second of those three hours (And it is very seldom indeed I can say that about a movie,even one of my favourites)
Indeed it was as close as anyone could ever come to reproducing Lord of the Rings on the Big Screen . Ive been a Tolkien fan since the age of 13 in 1985 when I was first spellbound by The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings
and now seeing Middle Earth actually come to life on the screen is amazing. The essence of the movie was so close to that of The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's World that I could only think after everything I saw 'So this is Middle Earth' , 'So this is The Shire' , 'So this is Moria' , 'So this is Isengard' , 'So this is Lothlorien etc
The scene at the beginning describing the history of The Rings was a masterstroke going straight by contrast to the peaceful Shire

While Harry Potter movie retraced the book faithfully, LOTR movie has to pack the vast LOTR universe into... well three installments of three hour movies, and the creators did a pretty good job with it.  The movie brought the LOTR world to the real life just as I imagined it would be.  While the movie omits certain stories and characters here and there, let's not be too picky about it.  After all, a movie is a movie, and a book is a book.  I am turning the pages of LOTR again after more than 20 years.",1009152000,2,654,4.2682926829268295
1327344,5,B00003CWT6,"The purpose of the movie was not to take every line from the book (a masterpiece) and put it on screen. It is to translate it into a story that can be well received by an audience who has not read the books. When people write screenplays for movies they ALWAYS consider that everyone watching is starting off with 0 knowledge of the story, so there are no holes in the plot.
Lord of the Rings was an all around great movie. The nerds throwing themselves at these boards about how 'the bow elrond uses was green!' and crap like that need to review it as a movie, not a recreation of the book for you to read and say 'nahh the original was SOO much better'.
The truth is, there has never been a movie better than a book, ever. It just doesn't happen. Those who are such fascinated twits about a certain book always walk into the movie with such high expectations that of course they are going to be dissapointed. They need to take it for what it is: an interpretation.
This movie will have you entertained the whole way through. Many years ago I read all of the books, and everything in the movie re-activated my memories from how good the books were. I have seen it twice I liked it so much. Elrond was my favorite character by far, as he was in the books also. For those of you who like archers, near the end you see how great an elf can be in battle, when he uses his bow so quickly and accurately that you are left salivating saying 'soooo freaking sweeeet.'
I loved the movie, most people will. As with Episode 1, you will have the guys with no lives who actually try to live vicariously  through the books and movies and have nothing to do but complain, as if the brilliant minds who create these movies are morons and ye who sit in your rooms getting fatter and dumber could create such more masterful pieces of art. Shut up, and write movie reviews, nothing else. Stupid nerds; everyone hates them, eh? HEHE
Anyways, the movie is great, I loved it, everyone I was with loved it, everyone I have spoken to has loved it. Anyone who doesnt like it because the books were 'better' need to state some actual MOVIE gripes if they want to do review it.",1009152000,10,2151,4.285012285012285

Good Acting, a little romance, fight scenes, strong friendships, maybe a bit of comedy here and there, and morals. True, it isn't the best movie of all time but it is certainly very good. Before the movie came out, I had already read the LotR books twice. I am not a fanatic, but I thought that they were really good. I was very happy with the way that the movie was done. I have to admit that I was a bit upset about how they made Galadriel out to be. In the book she was supposed to be the one person who was loved by all and was the symbol of goodness. Even Gimli stood up for her when they left. However, in the movie they made her become some evil witch like thing for a minute. I also did not really like Viggo Mortensen for Aragorn. However, he did the character well. The rest  of the characters had actors that fit the rolls perfectly. Especially Legolas, Saruman, Elrond, and Gandalf. True, they compacted lots of the scenes from the book to make them shorter in the movie- but that was expected. It is already a 3 hour movie any way, it would be hard for people to sit through anything longer with greater detail. I think that you should read the books before you see the movie because it may be a little confusing with all of the names of different people and places. However, I recommend that you do not compare every part of the movie to the book- there are some things that had to be left out or added to make the movie more interesting. The special effects of this movie are awesome, the music is great, and the actors are superb (Legolas is exactly what I pictured an elf to be- creatures that are beautiful yet sad because they know the troubles of the world).I definitely think that you should see this movie... it should be at least nominated for best motion picture.",1009152000,2,1859,4.296296296296297

Some days I envisioned actually directing it myself, yet I knew that this was an even farther stretch of the imagination and it would take a great deal more than just dreaming to make it come true.  When I heard they would be comming out with the Lord of the Rings to the theatres I groaned and thought to myself that the one thing in the world that Hollywood had better pay great respect to it would be these set of books.
Well done Peter Jackson, well done.  The casting is astounding.  I could not have thought of a better person for any of the characters.  I wept when Beoromur died.  I cringed when Galadriel transformed into that thing.  I rejoiced and whooped, I clapped when the Orc was killed, I wanted to hide and close my ears when the Ring Wraiths appeared... it was perhaps the best movie that I have seen in years.

The only mistakes I could see was that ShadowFax, Gandalf's steed was not grey or at least silver and that the woods where Galadriel lives didn't have a golden color, they were tinted blue. Another mistake that actually made the story better was that Arwen appeared in the 1st movie and saved Frodo. It makes Arwen seem more heroic... Tolkein must not have liked women. He really didn't give them any good parts in his books except for the Silmirilian (I appologize if I spelled it wrong).
Our whole family had different points of view when we saw it on the 21st. My mom thought it was too loud and should be reated R, my 10-year old brother sat on the edge on his seat with his eyes wide, and my dad and I couldn't believe how well Jackson had done it.

1327373,5,B00003CWT6,"Get ready to be jolted in your seats! Be prepared to be entertained like you've never been before! It is raw candy for the brain, eyes and ears!
I read the LOTR 3 times in my life. I am no disciple, studying family trees and such, although it is such a richly complicated story that many take on such hobbies. It is those individuals and only those individuals, who would not be impressed beyond belief with this initial taste, volume one of a 3 movie epic.
Over the years I have seen epic novels brought to film and every time, borne witness to the decimation and defilement due to the plain inability to compress the vast wealth of imagination into a single movie. Example, the first attempt to capture DUNE to film, the one that Sting played in. Charges should have been filed! But in their defense, what can you do in only 2 hours? LOTR should take a full 9 hours of film before they are done. Dune is 1/2 the physical pages and words that LOTR is and only 1/4 as rich in environmental complexity. To those that make LOTR a hobby, pastime or quasi-religion it would require maybe 30-40 hours of film to capture every little detail in its pure form to make these folks happy.
But if you are a 'normal' intelligent person with a taste for fantasy, and fond memories of your experience reading the LOTR, then you will simply be blown away!
The technical as well as directorial and not to forget the acting, is frankly nothing less than breathtaking! I could see from my memories, how they could come up with each location and the depth of the characters, including the nuances of nobility in the characters, was not lost or simply forgotten.
Remember how Aragorn closed back the ring into Frodo's hand? Remember the last wave of the Lady of the Wood? She carried an elven ring of power on her hand as well! Unless you have read the novel, granted, many of these enormous things is not appreciated by the audience.
This is, and should not be, PG-13 though. NC-17 would be proper. The level of violence is way extreme. Should they continue with their attempt to stay true to the novel, then movies 2 and 3 will prove to be exceedingly violent as well. But let me make it clear, it is not gratuitous violence, but rather, it is well measured with the seriousness of the story line and novel itself. The violence is crucial to the story. This is not for the kiddies at all.
Just because we have cute little hobbits, don't forget, this is still a grand epic of the attempt of pure Evil to destroy the world. There is no valor or bravery if you are not afraid. There is not strength of conviction or inner nobility, if the characters do not sally forth, even though they tremble inside and push temptation away. We see love and devotion to our fellow man, or hobbit, without it being tainted by sexual inuendo.
LOTR is a work that seriously demonstates the hidden strength and power true goodness has in its struggle against unadulterated evil. Given our current state of global events, there are subtle lessons you can take away with you.
The Fellowship, is part 1 of a 3 part novel, not a trilogy. A trilogy is 3 separate novels connected via commonality. LOTR is a single story, so large by itself, it required 3 'volumes' to capture it. The movie ends with what appears an abrupt cut off. But this is how the 'volumes' flow. They have simply done the most justice that I have seen Hollywood generate to an epic literary work in my life. Haven't you wondered why it has taken 30 years for the movie establishment to make LOTR? Because they knew that they'd never get it close and be boo'd out of town.
Technology of FX and capital risk taking executives took on this mountain of a novel. They have done it very, very, verrrry well. This and the remaining two movies will become a cornerstone of modern cinematic history. Watershed works. Don't miss out on it!",1009152000,3,3857,4.480113636363637

It is one of those rare films that brings tears to one's eyes even while it makes one want to cheer (which the audience did in several places, including the end.) My only problem with the film is that I was led to believe that Peter Jackson shot it in New Zeeland. Clearly Jackson found some way to get a camera crew to Middle Earth and somehow get some of the original participants in the War of the Ring to recreate the events they actually lived. I do not believe that, for example, we see Ian McLellan playing Gandalf. I will wager that Gandalf is playing himself.

1327430,5,B00003CWT6,"One critique of that other movie (which I nevertheless quite enjoyed!) was that it was faithful to its source material to a degree that eliminated the opening for a director's touch; in so doing, some asserted, the real potential was missed for bold creativity and a stirringly beautiful film.
The Lord of the Rings is different perhaps because here we see someone who was faithful...but also creative. Doubtless this will cost him something with some constituents.  He does take license; but he does so atop a faithful and loving recreation of the whole world and story of The Lord of the Rings.  Mr. Jackson's reported habit of re-reading each chapter just before shooting it was a microcosm of his whole approach to the film: othe film was  telling a bit of human history, not a some wild fantasy.  This history was, perhaps, a bit more fantastical than the usual.  As such the story is told much like Homer might tell it, and the audience is left to sort between historical fact, legend, and pure mythologies.
There are facets of the way the story was either interpreted or altered to accomodate film that will displease you.  Some did me.  Nevertheless, I think it more important to say that the film was beautiful, faithful to the heart of the story and nearly all of its facts.  Every once in a while it is worth giving something our unrestrained and enthusiastic praise.  I believe many will feel in viewing it as I did: that  we are lucky to be drawn into such a story, one told so stirringly.  We are given feasts for the senses, the heart, and the mind.  Part of the film's beauty is in just how bad the bad folks are, just how good some of the good creatures are - and just how conflicted many of the characters are.  Beauty is also in the sincerity of the performances, without which the entire thing falls to shreds.  Beauty also flows from the images themselves - their qualities and their natures.  The faces were extraordinary, the land was near-magical, and the special effects were dazzling, without intruding into the story hardly at all.
In this film the depth of character, relationship, story, and exploration of archetypal themes are combined with an amazing breadth of scope, scale, and theatre.

1327454,5,B00003CWT6,"In a word: wow.
In more than one word...
As a person who has seen many book-to-movie adaptations and been underwhelmed by most of them, this one is one for the ages. The effects, the story, the complexity, and the characters are all there. The power of the Ring and its sway over those who desire it is intensely felt, all the way down to the subtle whispering of the ""one ring to rule them all..."" quote in the Mordor tongue when someone focuses on it. The CG effects, and the beautful recreated New Zealand scenery never get in the way of the story, but yet amaze us with their spectacular faithfulness to the imaginations of the audience (the gates of Gondor, the Shire, and Moria are especially incredible). Most importantly, the most powerful moments in ths first book are keenly felt, as a Fellowship is made and broken, and a hobbit takes up a burden that will ultimately change not only him but also control the fate of an entire realm.
Casting for this film has shown Director Peter Jackson's wisdom, picking what is a near dead-on Gandalf in Ian McKellen (""X-Men""'s Magneto), Elijah Wood as the reluctant, angst-ridden, yet stoic hero Frodo Baggins, and Sean Astin (last seen as a ""Goonie"" leader) as the bumbling, yet faithful Samwise Gamgee, among many others.
Some critics lament the altering and cuts, especially of Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel (replaced by Liv Tyler as elven maiden/warrior Arwen). Others purport that the non-faithfulness to the book makes the script weak and covered by ""flashy CG"". To those people (whose opinion I respect) I must say, firstly, that in a book-to-movie adaptation, some sacrifices must be made. In an encapsulation of a large work as Tolkien's ""Fellowship"", an exact recreation is simply not an option. Secondly, to dismiss the excellent acting and palpable feeling the actors convey when playing their parts as ""weak"" and covered by ""flashy CG"", simply because some small things were added or cobbled together, is to hold the movie to higher standards than the medium can provide.
This is not the disaster that was ""Final Fantasy"". This is Tolkien, and Jackson and his associates have done incredibly well (as well as one can in making a movie based on a book) in paying homage to one of the most well-respected fantasy epics of the 20th century.
For those of you who like sword and sorcery or like Tolkien - go see it! I recommend you go not being all hyped up with what we're saying or anyone else is saying. Set your expectations at your level and not at the level of everyone else's, and watch the movie for what it is. You'll be pleasantly surprised.",1009065600,,2606,4.717105263157895

My brother, who hadn't read the books, and I saw the film on opening day and we both LOVED it and have been talking about it for the past five days since. So don't worry if you aren't familiar with the books. And for those who have read the books, the film stays very close to the books, except for a few minor changes, that would have been nice to see, but weren't vital to the story and would have lengthened the movie to at least another hour(and possibly bogged the pace of the film for some viewers.)
If you haven't seen the movie, go see it as soon as possible.
If you hate fantasy movies, give this one a chance to change your mind.

1327456,5,B00003CWT6,"Unlike alot of the reviewers of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" I have not read any of the books by J. R. Tolkein. So, when I saw the movie I had an open mind about the plot and characters. However, I will most likely read the books now that I have seen the movie.
PROS:
~GRAPHICS/ CINEMATOGRAPHY: The graphics and cinematography are the best I have ever seen! Usually I hate computer generated graphics due to their fake appearance. However, in ""Fellowship of the Rings"" there were times when I could not tell what was computer generated and what wasn't. (I only hope the ogre was a computer graphic!!!) The shots of New Zealand were incredible as well. The jagged mountains, lush foliage, and beautiful waters all combine to create a memoriable cinematographic movie.
~ACTORS/ ACTRESSES: Since I have not read any of the books I cannot write about the integrity of the characters in the movie compared to the characters from the book. With that said, the characters are wonderful. The actors and actresses portrayed the amazing personalities of the dwarfs, hobbits, wizards, etc... very well.
~PLOT: For the most part the plot kept the audience on the edge of their seats. A few parts of the movie slowed down a bit, but over all the plot was well thought out. (For detailed info see other people's reviews)
~BATTLE SCENES: Sword fights, wizardry, and devilish opponents... need I say more?
CONS:
~PARTS OF THE SCRIPT: As other reviewers stated, a few parts of the script were rather cheesy. I suppose Hollywood felt as though they needed to place their standard ""feel good"" message in ""Fellowship of the Ring"". An example: ""Even the small can do alot"" or somthing along those lines... With this said, most of the script was acceptable.
Go see the movie. Leave the kids under age 8-9 at home unless you want them crying out in the middle of the night, ""Mom! An ogre is under my bed!""
I look forward to the next two movies with much anticipation!",1009065600,2,1940,4.675438596491228
1327457,5,B00003CWT6,"I must say I was very impressed with this movie.  The imagery was astoundingly faithful to the books.  I felt almost like I had seen it all before.  I think it gives testament, not only to the director, but to J.R.R. Tolkien as well, for creating a literary epic with such vividness and texture.  The complexity of the books was transferred astoundingly well to the screen.  Although obviously simplified, very little of the feel was lost.  The only criticism, which is small, is that it felt like the story was rushed, taking leaps forward instead of a steady flow.  That, however is to be expected, considering the sheer literary volume of the text.  I suppose that Tolkien zealots might be disappointed with the required omissions and modifications to fit it into screen time,  At the other end, Tolkien remedials may not fully appreciate the scale of the story.  However, for the large portion of us, who know Tolkien and his wonderful world, this movie is close to as good as it gets.  A finlal word of warning to mainstream movie hounds...the movie ends very blatantly as the first book does...""to be continued"".",1009065600,,1118,4.770833333333333
1327458,5,B00003CWT6,"I have read the Trilogy at least 25 times and have waited 35 years for this movie to arrive!  The film delivers in every way - casting is superb, even Agent Smith of the Matrix playing Elrond works!  Acting is full of heart and emotional intensity, and Elijah Wood embodies the innate goodness and purity of Frodo.  Peter Jackson's pacing is flawless, keeps the audience riveted to the the screen for three hours.  The sets are lush and perfectly rendered, with astonishing attention to detail.  For those who have read the book, subtleties and allusions abound - just one example is when the Council of Elrond is heatedly arguing about the Ring.  Their images are reflected in the gold surface of the Ring, fire sweeps around it, and a muted voice chants in the Black Speech ""One Ring to Rule them All...""  Don't see how its possible to wait an entire year for the Two Towers!",1009065600,,877,4.583333333333333
1327459,4,B00003CWT6,"If Peter Jackson's spectacular take on the first installment of The Lord Of The Rings just about stops short of being overwhelming, its still a noble and for the most part highly successful attempt to bring celluloid life to Tolkien's mythology.  As such it should leave all but the most hardcore Tolkienites satisfied.
Jackson has breathed remarkable life in to Middle-Earth and Tolkien's potentially rather holky mythology.  The film wants to make us believe - and generally succeeds.  This is a truly fantastic land, populated by all manner of weird and wonderful creatures.  Infact, so large is the canvas on which he is working,  it is to Jackson's credit that his character's are not simply subsumed by it.  Both Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen and Ian Holm manage their roles nobly and convincingly.  None are really aloud to blossom since the plethora of exposition required at this stage in the story means that virtually every scene requires dialogue to basically lay down the rules of the land and its mythology - little time is left for characteristion which may have given it more resonance.  As it stands, the actors occasionally come across more as authorial mouth-pieces than actual characters.
Shot on location in Jackson's native New Zealand, the film features some of the most indelible visuals to be brought to the screen in a long time - both real and computer generated.  And this is the film's most resouding success - it really does take you to another world and make you want to explore it further.  This is no mean-feat to be sure, but there's something rather frantic about the cramming of exposition and in to every corner of the movie - it seems to lack respite - which is neccessary in a three hour picture.  One hopes that the next film will gives itself a little more breathing room.  As for this one, I guess the best you can say is that Tolkien would have been pleased.",1009065600,2,1897,4.75

1327512,5,B00003CWT6,"There are movie adaptations of novels that become so definitive, whose imagery becomes so ingrained in our national consciousness that to remake it would be idiotic.  Examples of these movies include Gone with the Wind, Wizard of Oz, Godfather, Jaws, and Psycho.  Then there are other books which can inspire many wonderful different cinematic interpretations, like Tarzan, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Three Musketeers and Wuthering Heights.
Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings I believe falls into this latter category.  As wonderful as the movie was, when I walked out of the theater I wanted more.  And not just to see the next two installments ASAP, but also to see how Tim Burton or Terry Gilliam or Ron Howard would interpret these books.
Peter Jackson has emphasised the action and suspense elements of the books over the humor and whimsy which, in Tolkien's novels, was equally prevalent.  This is probably a wise commercial move.  Today's audience responds more enthusiasticly to action than to poetry, but it left me missing some scenes that was in the book, even as I delighted at what they kept in, and noted the changes -- a beefed up role for Saruman, a more elaborate chase through the caves.
On the other hand, it also prevents lazy students assigned to Tolkien's works from cheating by watching the movie.
I remember in college reading The Lord of the Rings for the 4th time thinking about how I'd adapt the books (a total of 5 Hobbit movies, The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, Return of the King, & The Scouring of the Shire)playing up the humor a bit more than Peter Jackson chose to do & keeping the action scenes more faithfully rendered to the novel.
Still, Peter Jackson has presented us with a movie filled with wonders to behold, showing us more thrills, creating a new character, Lurtz, who  seems to fit easily into this interpretation of the Tolkien universe, even if his character is really just a variation on Darth Maul.  He emphasises the horrific elements of the story, not surprising considering his prior films have primarily been horrors of some form or other.
This is quite probably the first truly great cinematic epic of the 21st century, even if it should not be regarded as the definitive vision of Tolkien's work.  That can only be found in your own imagination.",1008979200,,2322,4.828715365239295
1327513,5,B00003CWT6,"I thought this movie was absolutly wonderful.  I have read all three books and I was rather dissapointed they did not make The Hobbit in to a movie.

This is one of the few movies that I was very happy with the transition from book to movie, the effects weren't corny and they agreed well with the book.  I would definitly go see this movie again.  I can't wait for the second.",1008979200,,464,4.122222222222222
1327514,5,B00003CWT6,"I love the books by Tolkien, and all I can say is finally somebody did it right! After waiting years for this, I was worried that something in the treatment of the movie would bother me. Instead, all I've been able to do since seeing it is listen to the sound track, and try to figure out when I can see it again.
When it was over, I didn't want to leave the theatre. I could have gladly sat through 12 hours of this quality of movie. While that only speaks of myself, I can say that nobody...and I mean NOBODY in the theatre left their seats at any time during the course of the movie and previews.
This movie is absolutely true to Tolkien's vision of the Lord of the Rings! Everything that is important to the story happens. All the great lines are in there. And some things are improved upon in a logical manner in keeping with the universe created by Tolkien. For example, the expansions of the Arwen character were entirely appropriate, given that Tolkien's use of this character was rather anemic.",1008979200,,1003,4.397849462365591

The scenery was beautiful and the costumes amazing.  The ringwraiths costumes were outstanding.  It's amazing just to watch them move as they ride.  This was a great story.  Peter Jackson did a fantastic job.  I'll be waiting in anticipation for next year when the next installment of the Lord Of the Rings trilogy is released.",1008979200,,494,4.597701149425287
1327516,4,B00003CWT6,"The scenery is fantastic - both the real and created places! What really captured me, though, is the appropriateness of the actors for their roles. Each seemed very much at home with their character and that made it easy to accept and believe in them. The struggles they face, both externally and internally, are ones we can all relate to. I also liked the focus on friendship and bonding. Sam's devotion to Frodo is especially powerful and moving.
I don't remember the books well. I read them years ago and didn't really care for them. There are likely major characters, places and events missing that may bother die-hard fans of the books, but I believe that the film does a very good, if not excellent, job of bringing life to Middle Earth.
So why only 4 stars? Well, if you haven't read the books, the story is rather hard to follow. I think the movie is assuming that you will have at least a basic familiarity with the characters and story. I know that if they tried to spell everything out for newcomers the movie would run much longer than the 3 hrs it already is, but it's easy to lose track of what's going on if you don't focus on it.
Still, I liked it and will probably see it again. I may even re-read the books. If nothing else, the film gets an A+ for effort.",1008979200,,1274,4.357142857142857
1327517,5,B00003CWT6,"I would like to start with a quote by C.S. Lewis:  ""Here are beauties that will pierce like a sword or burn like cold iron.  Here is a story that will break your heart.""
I saw this movie on opening day, and I have not been able to write about it until now because I was so shocked.  This film picked me up in the first few minutes and carried me along with it.  I  experienced everything the characters went through; my whole system went on overload.  Before I start nitpicking, however, I would like to state two facts.
1.  If you go expecting to see the movie be just like the book, you're going to hate it.  A movie CANNOT be a book, and a book CANNOT be a movie.  It is perfectly impossible, unless you can make an apple an orange and vice versa.
2.  This is only act 1 of a three act drama.
Good.  That said, we can continue.
This is a wonderful movie, period.  Since a film consists of three elements:  background, characters, and effects, I shall cover all 3, including complaints I have seen.
The first is background, and I'll put the script into this topic.  New Zealnd is Middle Earth.  I was simply awed by the closesness of the two.  The Shire is beautiful; it has that lush, green, homey sense Tolkien has in his books.  Rivendell was also neat.  It demonstrated nicely the collision of two cultures, Elven and Man, for Elrond was both.  It is mostly Elvish, for example everthing is outdoors.  However, there are very human elements as well, like warm beds and rich indoor decorations.  Moria is suitably grand, yet morbid.  Lorien is beautiful with lots of trees, and I liked the way there were so many lamps lit everywhere at night.  Isengard is cold and impersonal, and the mining is one of the best parts of the film.
  I don't see why everyone says this movie has a bad script.  It is not Tolkien, but Tolkien's dialogue works much better to the page than the reel.  However, statements are taken right from the book, like ""shortcut to mushrooms,"" ""...if by my life and death I can protect you, I will.""  ""Fool of a Took,"" etc.  Some of it is missing, true.  I would have liked to hear the part about looking fair and feeling foul.  But, all in all, it works.
Next, and most importantly, are the characters.  Don't forget that there are many, many characters in this story, and not all will be fleshed out in the first act.  Frodo is done admirably well by Elijah Wood.  The scene after the balrog brings tears to my eyes, as when he is trying to slip away from the fellowship.  Sam is of the same caliber.  He is not dog-like, yet the message is clear.  He will do anything, even suffer through a journey worse than death for Frodo.  Merry and Pippen are simply hilarious.  I admired the script a lot for this, for in such a dark movie humor is almost impossible.  However, it is done and done gracefully and successfully.  Trust me, these two will steal your heart.
Aragorn is a tough and silent ranger, and I know we'll see his character grow throughout the story.  I was dissapointed with Legolas and Gimli's lack of time, but I think that Aragorn and Boromir needed center stage for obvious reasons.  I would bet money that the Elf and Dwarf will be main characters in the next film.  For all of you fans, Legolas does walk on snow!  It is a sight to see.
I have heard people say that Boromir was freaky.  I disagree.  For me, he was one of the most well-developed characters in the first film.  He is a brave and courageous soldier who is tempted through his good intentions.  We see his kindness when he teaches the little hobbits to fight, but we see his pride when he tries to seize the Ring from Frodo.  In the end, in one of the best scenes, he redeems himself.  He fights like a man possessed to save his friends (and his soul?), and in one of the most heart-rending scenes in the film, the fighting Uruk-Hai finally get the better of him.  (It's not easy, trust me!)
Gandalf, too, was amazing.  Among the Hobbits he is a nice grandfatherly old man, but watch out!  He will show his ferocity when faced with Saruman or a balrog.  Saruman is also very neat, a very hateful villain who goes power-hungry.
Some people say that Elrond is too mean, but I found him only stern and a little fierce.  Elrond was these, for he was not in an easy position throughout the whole book.  Galadriel was interesting, to say the least.  I am not sure if I liked her interpretation all in all, but I think that the mirror scene where she morphs into that thing is a perfectly valid interpretation, for all of you who are complaining.  It might not be yours, but the book does say that she grows terrible in the books.  I rather liked that aspect, even though I am not quite sure if I agree it was that drastic.  Arwen's role is small, so don't worry about any Xenarwen.  She is onscreen for about 10 minutes total.
The orcs are disgusting, the hobbits are beautifully simple, and the Black Riders are terrifying.
Lastly, there are effects.  I will be the first to tell you I am no computer guru, but, as the average Elf on the street, I can honestly say that I didn't think ""oh, effects"" when I saw them.  Indeed, I didn't even notice!  (Big relief after Star Wars E. I, I can assure you.)  The cave troll was an ugly troll, and the balrog is awesome, even if it does not agree with your own personal interpreation.  The size differences are seamless.  Not once did I get jarred back to reality.  Frodo really looked 3'6.  Gollum, though we only see his face, outline, or hands, looks like a flesh and blood creep.  If I didn't know through common sense that one cannot do a balrog any other way, I would not have known that CGI exists in this story.  Also, I liked the zoomy cameras.  Battles are hectic and confused things, and that technique helped to further the feeling that you are there.  I suppose we could have seen the conventional overhead shots, but is that what, say, Aragorn saw as he was fighting for his life?
Concerning Gandalf and Saruman's duel:  I think it is a valid interpretation.  We don't know all that happened, and I'm sure that the two wizards didn't simply talk over coffee.  The scene doesn't last very long anyways.  I found it a good way to show how powerful Saruman was.  He overpowered Gandalf pretty quick.  Keep in mind, that in The Two Towers, the tables will turn, and I think the contrast will help understanding.
I know this film moved faster than the books.  There is a reason for that, I think.  The book was, with the exceptions of the Shire, Rivendell, and Lorien, a continuous battle or chase.  The events in the film were tightened up to ooze that very feeling.  My only complaint is Lorien is hardly a place of rest.  Oh well.  I know that parts did have to be sped up, even though more time there would have been nice.
Yes, this movie has its faults.  They are very small ones, thank goodness.  However, I don't think I can single any out until I see at least ""The Two Towers,"" because until then I cannot say for sure what was lacking.  One cannot honestly critique Les Miserables, for example, after only the first act.  The story has just begun!
My only big complaint is that I have to wait a whole year to see the next film.",1008979200,96,7189,4.3584905660377355
1327518,5,B00003CWT6,"From Frodo and the other hobbits, to Aragorn, and including Boromir, Gimli, and Legolas, each character finds their heroism.  One of the masterful touches in this movie is the subtlety - Jackson doesn't bang you over the head with Aragorn's reluctant acceptance of ""his people.""  If you aren't attentive, you miss it, as well as a whole other bunch of things like Bilbo's trolls.
I saw it on Thursday and again on Saturday.  It exceeded expectations, as I went in wondering how anyone could film The Fellowship of the Rings in a way that didn't confuse the entire audience.  The casting is nearly perfect (I didn't care for Elrond).  The one disappointment is Galadriel, which other reviewers have mentioned.  For those reviewers claiming the Gandalf character imitates Obi-Wan, bear in mind this was written decades before George Lucas dreamed up his elderly mentor.  Better to say that Obi-Wan imitates Gandalf.",1008979200,,913,5.046666666666667
1327519,5,B00003CWT6,"A cinematic version of Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS ranks up with the hope that Lucas will indeed make another Star Wars Trilogy, and, I think I can safely say, this is one of the most anticipated films in the movie industry's long and checkered history.  You would think it's movie paradise, considering Lucas has been in the midst of another Star Wars trilogy and LORD OF THE RINGS has finally got a cinema deal (live action!), but PHANTOM MENACE proved something of a disappointment (Mesa Jar Jar Binks!), and I think quite a few people will enter into the theatre with a certain amount of trepidation.
There's a reason for that.  Three animated Tolkien films have been released with very problematic results.  The 1978 Bakshi release is just embarrassing; the film is both incoherent and confusing.
Rankin & Bass's two movies are fine for little kids; those two films are Tolkien for Saturday Morning cartoons. They proved my introduction to Tolkien and for that I am thankful, but the movies still fail to capture the grandeur of Tolkien's imagination.
There are two things to consider here about a work of literature.  Although all good literature has a polarization effect on its readers, this work has a gigantic legion of followers which are extremely dedicated to Tolkien's vision (I count myself a member of this camp).  The other camp cannot figure out what the big fuss is about and why they should care about the novel.
Now, there's a reason why all this is relevant to the film: had Peter Jackson gone to far either way the film would have fallen apart.  Appeal to much to the fan-base and you loose the general movie-goer.  Appeal to much to the movie-goer, and you'll lose the fan-base.
So when the fan base learned of Peter Jackson's decision to film all three films at once, an unprecedented move in movie history, most of us really wanted it to be good but were just simply afraid.  We've already been burnt.  Would it be so bad that it would alienate both fan base and those who are just looking for a good movie?
Not only does Peter Jackson's film work, it's glorious, beautiful, has all the myth and grandeur of the book.  Jackson, a Tolkien fanatic, could have gotten so involved with bringing out the extremely detailed world Tolkien gave us that the pacing would suffer or we'd lose patience with all these obscure details which would alienate the regular movie goer.  Not only does he not alienate the general movie goer, but he entices the fan base so much they can't help but fall in love with his vision of Tolkien's world.
The only real flaw is how rushed first section of the movie is.  Although I can understand cutting the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil, the way they handled getting the hobbits out of the Shire was unacceptable.  There is not that sense of camaraderie between the Hobbits that there is in the book, there is no ""conspiracy,"" and Merry and Pippin just join without any questioning from Sam and Frodo.  While Jackson does a good job at building the Hobbits' characters and establishing their personalities, I couldn't come up with a good reason why Frodo and Sam would just let Merry and Pippin join them.
The Prancing Pony is worst.  There is no questioning from the Hobbits about Aragorn proving himself, there is no scene about him asking them to trust him, and the whole sequence feels much too rushed.  Sam only questions Aragorn while they're actually out of the inn and traveling.
Thankfully, however, that is the only real flaw.  The rest of the things the script changed (tightening Elrond's council, the expansion of Arwen, cutting Sam from the Galadriel mirror sequence, tempting Aragorn with the ring, etc) I can see why they did it for dramatic tension.  I also liked the way they handled Elrond's council, because that could have ruined the movie like it did with Bakshi's.  They had established and covered much of the material in that chapter elsewhere by means of voice-over prologue and actually showing the viewer what is happening (especially with the Isengard sequences), and as a result lessened the screentime of that scene and helping with the dramatics of it.
As for the controversial expansion of Arwen, I tend to agree with the film makers in their decision to enlarge her role.  By making her part of the Ford sequence it introduces the character and establishes her in the viewer's mind, and the relationship between Arwen and Aragorn is more fully explored.  As for their romantic interlude in Rivendell, not only do I agree with that but think it should have been done in the book.  Tolkien did not know who Strider was when he was first writing FELLOWSHIP, and did not go back and change the scenes to further explain the romance between Arwen and Aragorn, and by not including a scene in Rivendell to establish their love for one another lessens by far the impact of their union in Part III, and (for once) this romantic scene is actually an improvement on the book.  As for her role in the Flight at the Ford, for the movie they made the right choice though the book is still preferable.
In achieving the balance between fan base and the more causal fan, this film is a spectacular success.  Making a movie out of a book the size of Fellowship, the fact is you will have to condense, tighten, rearrange, and make changes for dramatic tensions.  The mediums are different, and you cannot have a direct translation from a book to a film.  Despite of what they cut, the movie still clocks in at three hours, which is very generous.  The real problem with this film, as others noted, is it's going to be a full two years before we finally get to watch THE RETURN OF THE KING.
In the end, we get a movie that stays true to the SPIRIT of the book.  This is what we Tolkien fans have long been waiting for.  Thank you so much Peter Jackson and your cast and crew.",1008979200,735,5841,4.62729912875121
1327520,5,B00003CWT6,"Maybe, if you are one of those people that likes to read the book before the movie comes out, just maybe, you may be disappointed.  But I couldn't be more happy, because I learned my lesson a long time ago.. ok... a month, and am not one of those people so, what do I think of the movie:
Even if it came with the smells of the places it shows, it couldn't have been more ""real"". Peter Jackson and the special effects team that worked with him... Ok, EVERYONE!!!! They where all amazing.  Trully magnificent.
But, warning... The movie might be a little slow and may lack a some character development.  But that always happens when fans make the movies. They already know them, so they don't notice when something is missing. If you feel like something's missing buy the book after the movie, read it, and go watch the movie again, and again, and again, and again....
Notice the scenary, simply breathtaking.  Even the ""ugly"" places are fantastic.  And the special effects... Well, if I start I'll never end.  I think that only two or three times you can  actually say you remember being at a movie theater or notice something doesn't look ""real"" enough. And that my friends its not easy to do in movies this days.
Anyway, go watch the movie.  You will not regret it. And remember it's a trilogy... that means there's more to come. I noticed some people at the theater saying, ""That's it!?""  Well, it's not.  Although, I think there is no point in waiting a year to see the next one if it's already been made.
Well, do not listen to the bad reviews. They might know what they're talking about, but Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is just too good a movie to miss.  And believe me, if you wait 'til this movie gets to your favorite video store to see it, you will regret it. Theater vs. Video... IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!",1008979200,,1833,4.393491124260355

1327562,5,B00003CWT6,"I read the trilogy when i was around 12 or 13, and digged the fantasy fiction scene at that time.  But it's been a long time - at least 12 years - since I've much thought about this book & the trilogy.  Reading it was, in itself, a seeming lifetime of experience.  Now i'm thirty-something and I didn't even know this movie was coming out until a week or two ago!  I've just returned from seeing the movie, and oh my goodness, it was really amazing.  It brought back deep-rooted memories of the emotions I had when I was reading the book all those years ago.  The emotions about ringwraiths, elves, orcs, men, and hobbits, (the result of Mr. T's tireless descriptions of each race) and the time in the caves and when the fellowship broke up, and the ring's psychological effect on people.  And always the sense of Frodo and Gandalf (separately) getting into, and out of, one impossible situation after another.  I was deeply stirred by the movie, as if i'd remembered a forgotton part of my childhood...
Sure, there will be those fanatics out there who think they would be able to direct a better, more accurate movie and that this wasn't the same or that wasn't the same blah blah blah.  But in the film's three hours, the plot was more or less intact and the spirit of the film was the same as the spirit of the book.
There's something for everyone in this movie.  For the people who have read the book, there's a lot they can pick up on that are glossed over and not well-explained (on purpose?) in the movie.  For the average movie-goer, there's decent action and a plot that can be understood - destroy the ring before the big bad guy gets a hold of it. For the complete [novice], there's some incredible scenery and unbelievable aerial shots of it.  And for the fanatic, there's enough to complain about to satisfy his superior and well-developed ego.
Is this the greatest movie ever made?  No.  Is it the best escapism entertainment around lately?  Yes.  Go see it and live another life for a few hours.  It was SO...MUCH...FUN!!!!",1008979200,,2038,4.509536784741145
1327563,5,B00003CWT6,"Solid five for this one! The ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is definately one of the best films in history. The special effects, lush settings, dark imagery, and epic story put other sci-fi and fantasy flicks to shame. Luke Skywalker, watch out for Frodo Baggins.
The plot remains almost exactly to the book: Frodo the hobbit is given the quest to destroy the evil ring of the dark lord Sauron, and is joined by a motley bunch of adventurers to form the Fellowship of the Ring. Gandalf, the ancient wizard, gives guidance and wisdom. Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf, warriors among their kind, are well acted. Boromir the human is the heroic guy with a dark side to him. Aragorn, a.k.a. Strider, is so *HOT*. Sam, Pippin, and Merry, the three bumbling hobbits, provide comic relief as happy-go-lucky fish out of the water in a dangerous quest. The bad guys were convincingly evil and freaky, not like the stupid disco-chanting orcs in the 1970s cartoon, ""Return of the King."" The orcs were marvelously gross and ugly as they were meant to be. Saruman is excellent as Gandalf's rival. The ringwraiths are all good and spooky. The Eye of Sauron watches the viewers in their seats, and Balrog is great as a genuinely dark, evil spirit. The special effects themselves don't dominate the whole film. This movie brings the Tolkein characters and their Middle Earth world to stunning and breathtaking life. The characters become people one can relate to and it is easy to get into the story. (When Frodo was crying I just wanted to go up to the screen and hug him!!!)
There is some controversy over the character of Arwen and her getting a bigger role in the movie than in the books. This was basically necessary, since she is the girlfriend of one of the lead male characters and the movie somehow has to establish her character. She IS a warrior woman, but not a fake Lara Croft or Xena take-off. A few other characters from the book are completely left out, but only for time reasons. With a whopping three hours already, it would be impossible to have the book down word for word.
""Fellowship of the Ring"" is sure to satisfy die-hard Tolkein fans without confusing newcomers. The movie goes into great detail and explanation without getting too slow. The chase sequences and epic battle scenes, especially in the second half of the film, take the viewer on a wild, heart-thumping, suspenseful roller coaster ride. Definately a must-see!",1008979200,,2431,4.735849056603773
1327564,5,B00003CWT6,"I've never been a big Tolkien fan.  I read the Fellowship of the Ring -- or part of it -- years ago and wasn't all that impressed. I wasn't inspired to read the other books in the trilogy.
  All that being said, this was a fabulous movie.  To be sure, it dragged a bit in places. The beginning was slow and Hobbittville -- whatever it's called -- bored me.  But the action scenes were intense and frightening.  I could feel my skin crawl when the ringwraiths were on the screen  The settings -- especially the various castles and underground cities -- were incredible. There are visions of heaven and hell, and they're as convincing as any I've ever seen. This is no movie for children.  The violence was graphic and frightening.  Somehow it was all very believable and serious.  The heroes were really heroes and the villians were really evil and it seemed important that the good guys won.
  This is one of the best action flics I've ever seen.  Right up there with Crouching Tiger and Terminator and Last of the Mohicans.  I'm surprised that an eccentric fantasy like LOTR could be turned into such a good movie.  Or maybe it's a great movie.

This film is loads better than Harry Potter because Harry Potter is mainly a kids film as this one is for kids and adults.

1327566,5,B00003CWT6,"I have been a Lord of the Rings fan since I was 6 years old; that's when The Hobbit appeared on CBS, and Ralph Bakshi's animated Lord of the Rings hit theaters. It wasn't long before I was nagging my mom to buy me the books, so I could see if they were as good. (They were better.) Tolkien's imaginative and groundbreaking books opened my young mind up to a new world; one filled with mythical quests, brave heroes, strange creatures, and vile villains. I tried to keep my expectations for Director Peter Jackson's film low, so I wouldn't be disappointed, but enthusiasm got the better of me, and I was ripe for a letdown.....one mis-step and Jackson could ruin the whole thing.....and he hits it out of the park!!! WOW!!!!
 From the opening moments, it's easy to see Jackson's love for the books. Attention is paid to even the most minute detail, and book-purists will be glad to hear that he has crafted maybe the most faithful page-to-screen adaptation ever, bar none. I'm sure there were things in the book that were left out, but other than Tom Bombadil, I can't remember anything.
 For the uninitiated, LOTR follows Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit, on his quest to throw the evil ""One Ring"" into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged, thus freeing Middle-Earth from an age of darkness. He is accompanied on this quest by a fellowship of Hobbits, an Elf, a Dwarf, 2 Men, and a Wizard. They are pursued by various and sundry servants of the Dark Lord Sauron, who forged the Ring, and his underling, the traitor Saruman (Perfectly played by the Legendary Christopher Lee).
 The performances are all strong, especially Sean Bean as the Warrior Boromir, Viggo Mortensen as Strider, and Ian McKellen as Gandalf. I thought Hugo Weaving made a great Elrond. The effects are mindblowing! I was totally taken in by the way they made full-sized actors into Hobbits, and seeing the large John Rhyes-Davies as Gimli the Dwarf was incredible. The HUGE battle scene in the beginning, and the hordes of Orcs in the Mines of Moria show that, if used properly, CGI can look totally realistic.
 I've been a Peter Jackson fan since The Frighteners and Dead/Alive, but when I heard that he was going to be directing the Rings movies, I wasn't sure.....
 Well, I am now. If The Two Towers were playing now, I would have gone as soon as LOTR let out. He did that good a job.
Bravo, Mr. Jackson, for crafting one of the most entertaining and visually stunning pictures I have ever seen.

My concern was simple - there's no way Jackson could create a film that would include the entire story - therefore what was to be written out? However as the film unfolded, I found myself concentrating on his version of the story without being overly concerned about the missing details. Jackson actually did a great job of continuity in the time (too short IMHO) alloted. No ""Two Towers"" preview was disapointing.",1008979200,,483,4.694117647058824

1327570,5,B00003CWT6,"I should confess at the beginning that as a child of nine I read The Lord of the Rings. My aunt  read The Hobbit to me when I was six or so, and then introduced me to Tolkien's longer work some years later. I loved the book as a child, and as an adult have returned from time to time to this bit of ""comfort literature"" in which a grown-up can certainly find new things.
I had expected to be disappointed with Peter Jackson's film, not because I am some sort of Tolkien purist, but because as I get older and know more of the world, it seems harder to find real wonder in film. The first Star Wars movies created the contemporary notion of the ""blockbuster,"" spawning summer after summer of over-hyped junkfood cinema. For every Raiders of the Lost Ark there are dozens of films like Independence Day, Tomb Raider, and Armageddon that promise the world and deliver an empty experience.
During the five minute prologue, which explains the history of the Ring, I feared endless esoteric exposition and tedium. My concerns were misplaced. The opening scenes with Ian McKellen and Ian Holm are touching and immersive; one feels one is seeing old friends reunited in some fantastic world.  Rings only got better after that, revealing itself to be one of the most impressive bits of movie-making I have ever seen. The film reminds me of some of the great epics and adventure movies of the past, flicks like Star Wars, King Kong, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Lawrence of Arabia. Virtually everything about the film works very well: acting, cinematography, special effects, and editing all serve the story and the development of the characters. Nothing is wasted, and one cannot help but be impressed with Jackson's work on Rings.
Jackson has gone to extraordinary lengths to faithfully adapt the book while creating an excellent film, and all the major themes from the novel are there. He should be applauded for this, not picked to pieces. I am annoyed by Tolkien fundamentalists who seem to think that every word written in Rings is somehow sacred; they should be very thankful that Jackson has made the changes that he did, changes that are faithful to the complexities of the story yet create a very effective movie. I suggest that Tolkien purists not see the film if the changes will bother them.",1008979200,14,2294,4.689826302729529

1327631,5,B00003CWT6,"Peter Jackson captures both your heart and your imagination with the film version of ""Lord of the Rings"" - the first in a series of three films which promises to bring the J.R. Tolkien classic to life, on the screen.
LOTR was the foundation for me in a lifetime of love affairs with books - first read in 1967 at the age of 12, it changed my tastes from childhood readings to adult fare; it swept me up in the powerful imagery of Tolkien's vivid vision of an alternate world.
I fretted all year at the thought of the film, and was pleased at the choice of director, and that no stars with names that are household words were to be featured in the roles. I could not resist seeing the film on Day 1, and in all 3+ hours, I was captivated by the screen. I attended with a friend who had never read LOTR, and was able to realize how well Jackson has succeeded in helping the film exceed expectations of lifelong Tolkien fans, as well as introducing the epic to those who are unfamiliar with the story.
The cinematography and special effects are quietly brilliant, the use of the unspoiled territory of New Zealand was a marvelous choice - the Shire is particularly well captured in the film, as is the lair of Saruman, who is chilling in his role of a brilliant genius turned evil. Possibly his best techniques, of the many used in the film, was the way he conveyed the evil lust that overcomes those who are tempted by the power that possession of the ring entails. Seeing Bilbo, Baromir and Galadriel all succumb to the NEED for the ring through the eyes of Gandalf and Frodo was chilling, and better conveyed visually here than in the book. Jackson does not let the special effects overwhelm your sense of story, much as Lucas did in the first Star Wars trilogy. The music is perfectly adapted to both story and cinematography, and was a highlight of the film for me.

Jackson captured the spirit of the story - the teamwork and love that grows between comrades faced with insurmountable odds; in particular, he makes the odd-looking Frodo (Elijah Wood) very slowly into the character that many noble men and women will place their trust in. Frodo and Samwise' (Sean Astin, excellent in his role) friendship is real and transcends the screen. The larger than life roles of Gandalf and Aragon/Strider (Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen) were well cast and memorable - both actors became their roles, and both captured the sense of honor that those who protect the endangered hobbits on their noble quest, must have.  McKellan particularly, although nominated for a supporting actor role, made Gandalf his own.  Here's a role that could not be recast successfully again; McKellan is the ultimate Gandalf.  Jackson has succeeded in directing successful characterization on the screen, and sacrificing some bit players from the book to the texture of the main plot.
There is no question that this film succeeds on the level of epics, and we are fortunate in this decade, to be able to keep it alongside ""Crouching Tiger""...while waiting for the saga to continue to unfold.

1327632,5,B00003CWT6,"You know, for the LOTR purists who thought this movie was (...) and would have been satisfied with nothing less than a 25 hour movie that contained every single word of narrative and dialogue from the Tolken book, get over yourselves. I'm sorry that Arwen rode a horse. I'm sorry that a character was left out entirely. I'm sorry that the movie didn't match your imaginations. I really am. But you have to remember; this is a movie. Though it's adapted from a very well known novel, it's meant to stand by itself, and not simply to please those who like the book.

If you're a fantatical Tolken fan, and will only be satisfied with a rock solid adaptation of the 500 page book, then please God, don't come to this movie so you can merely complain about how different it is. I've known fans of LOTR that have come out of this film going , ""that was awesome"", because they were ready to like a movie, and didn't just go in to pick out every single way the book was different from it, because, let's face it, pointing out the differences between a 500 page book and a 3 hour movie is like shooting fish in a barrel.
Anyway, as far as movies go, this one, I think, is great. At worst, you'll think it's good, and a fantastic technical achievement, and at best you'll think it's the best movie of all time, and walk out of the theater (...) that it's over.
For those people who went into the movie and brought a pencil to bash the ways the movie lost the book, forget it. I mean, just forget it.

Needless to say, that didn't help.  So I gave up on it.
Mr. Jackson and his team of scissor-wielding editors did a good job of botching a movie that could have made him the most famous director of all time.  How?  By leaving out details that should have been there, by creating a sappy love-story when there should have never been such, and by re-arranging key plot elements to where I felt like if I hadn't read the novels, overall the story wouldn't make much sense.
The story didn't seem to ""flow"", per se.  The hobbits were nicely done for the most part, but many of the other characters were mighty flakey.  Gollum's history became nothing but just Gollum.  Boromir was nothing but a greedy slimeball.  Gandalf didn't do much in the form of magic. (I'm still sad that they skipped the scene of him battling the riders at Weathertop). Bree lost a lot of substance.  The scissor-wielders cut out much-needed explanation in lieu for buttering up the battle scenes.
Did I mention that when anyone spoke elvish, they suddenly looked like they turned into translation drones?  Scary.
I don't have enough room to finish my 800-page long synopsis, so here's my summary: I gave it two stars... one for the camera sweeps of Barad-Dur and Orthanc and one for the guy who sat behind me that yelled ""Mister Anderson!"" on the first close-up of Elrond.  I don't think the crowd (most of whom left half-way through muttering about disappointment) laughed harder at anything else the rest of the movie.",1008979200,6,1700,4.614617940199335
1327635,1,B00003CWT6,"After seeing Harry Potter, I thought that Lord Of The Rings would rivel it in all of the aspects. But alas, it (...).
First of all, it was so boring. All they seemed to do was walk around and fight things the whole movie. Gandolf, that atheletic wizard that seems to give Carl Lewis a run for his money even though he is like 80, is way too intense. Frodo, that funny little midget, is also very intense. Plus, alot of odd characters just popped up. The hot elf Arwen came and went in about 5 minutes. A brute of a hero Strider somehow had the words Frodo and Ring in every sentence that he said. That other hot elf seemed to have an intutition of somebody who has read the script. Plus, I could not distinguish the names of all those magical people.
But one good thing came out of that. The midgets running. I just got a crack up out of that. I thought that they should have stood on their hands and juggled with their feet. What are with those feet anyway? Why didn't they just wear shoes in the first place?
So, if you are into character development, a comprible plot, and good acting, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!! If you are a mindless drone of the Hobbit series, by all means, waste ($$$).",1008892800,11,1190,4.223684210526316
1327636,5,B00003CWT6,"This film is true, hardcore fantasy.  No cyberpunk or technology.  Just good old fashioned hack, slash & wizardry!
I caught this movie the first day it was released and am so glad I did.  Yes, it is 3 hours long, but any epic is going to be lengthy.  This film does the book justice.  The one thing I was impressed with was the fact that it wasn't ""watered down"" for the kiddies.  It is rated PG-13 and there are some violent fight scenes that don't apologize when people (or orcs) get killed.  I was thoroughly impressed with the way they were able to digitally manipulate the hobbits so that they were able to use average sized actors, yet they were still about 3 feet tall!  And you couldn't tell there was any manipulation!  Clever!
I totally agree with another reviewer who said this movie beats Star Wars.  I am a Star Wars fan and also say that this film does so much more for me than George Lucas ever did.  (Of course I'm a Dungeons & Dragons fan, so that sways my vote a little.)
I was pleased with the casting also.  I thought some roles would be compromised with the likes of Liv Tyler.  But none of the big names became pre-madonnas.  I was pleased to see Ian Holm as Bilbo and an openly gay Ian McKellan as Gandalf.
It just brought back so many memories.  If you're remotely interested in the fantasy genre, you owe it to yourself to see this film and the next two chapters in the trilogy once they're released.",1008892800,,1425,4.324528301886793
1327637,5,B00003CWT6,"I went as a thirtysomething pragmatic yuppie cynic, hoping for entertainment value and that the CG wasn't going to be too laughable. I returned from the theatre shocked.  Overwhelmed. Blown away. Stunned.  I don't think there are enough superlatives in the language.
I felt that the changes made were appropriate, especially for the benefit of all those who never read the book and/or aren't  JRRT geeks. There has also been a lot of discussion that material necessarily left on the cutting room floor for sake of brevity will resurface in a ""non-rated"" Director's Cut DVD version, and I eagerly await that interpretation as well.
I'm a Tolkien nut who's read all his works repeatedly.  They are phenomenal stories from an inspired imagination.  However, I will admit (probably going to get burned at the stake here) that the LOTR trilogy are incredibly convoluted, wordy and difficult reads, and are at times mind-numbingly trivial in detail. The changes made to the movie for sake of plot logic and pacing were carefully thought out and well executed. The incredibly controversial interpretation of Arwen (I felt) was a brilliant adaptation done to consolidate roles with a secondary and somewhat pointless ""loose end"" character.  This in turn provided motivation and immediacy to Arwen's character, who in the books was rendered so incredibly remote and idealized that one wonders how she could possibly achieve something as earthy as falling in love with a mortal man.  Story line, scenes, dialogue and characters essential to drive the plot were faithfully rendered in loving detail. When Frodo puts on the ring, the wraith world he sees is vividly hallucinatory.  The interpretation of wizards battling is as a force of Nature, no cliche firebolts thrown here!
I think folks should cast aside the hype, preconceived notions, and the opinions of both professionals and armchair critics like myself. Go with an open mind and take your sense of wonder. Everyone who has read JRRT has their own, ""treasured"" view of how the story should look.  The movie adaptation may or may not correspond in every sense, but as a film and screenplay it was (IMO) the most moving media experience I've ever witnessed.",1008892800,15,2204,5.066298342541437

Yes, this movie is that good.  I am something of a movie freak and have watched pretty much everything that can be found in you local blockbusters...normally this causes me to be a bit harsher with mainstream movies..ie I hated Harry Potter although i loved the books..since I tend to thing about how a scene may have been edited better or whether something causes the story to flow or whether the director was able to get the viewer to sympathize with the characters etc.  The storytelling in this movie is in itself breathtaking and astounding.  The natural feel Jackson has for conveying what he wants on film is mindbogling..I havnt seen a film this well directed in a long time.  Put that together with source material which is considered a modern literary classic and a cast that was put together for its acting ability and not their box office draw and you have one of the best movies ever filmed.  There are other things about this movie besides the movie itself that have me bewildered..like the fact that this huge investment which would have broken the studio was launched without proven box office draw in its cast to assure a big opening day..I guess the confidence in the quality of the film was always there.  Look for this movie to stay at the top for a long time..even though its having a great opening box office, this is a word of mouth film and its real money will come around over the course of months.  I am also surprised at the number of positive female responses to this movie which is based books with an overwhelmingly male following.",1008892800,,1748,4.562300319488818
1327639,5,B00003CWT6,"The thing is, there's so much I want to say about this movie. I've seen it twice, and I and my brother have babbled about it for hours since. But my review probably won't be that great because I'm only a moviegoer, not a critic, and feel the immediate need to jump to the point and say that the movie was awesome.
This is important: as far as fantasy goes, this is utterly perfect. The acting is perfect, the characters are developed as well as they could be in three hours (""only"" three hours), the action is  amazing, and the story - originally penned by some guy named Tolken - is, well, the fantasy prototype. And it's surprisingly dramatic. Frodo (Elijah Wood) is, unlike most actors in the new Star Wars films, where characters run around with plastic emotions and say ridiculously unbelievable lines like, ""Just being around her is...intoxicating"" (uhhh, I might like women, and intoxicating is a good way to describe the effect of some of them on me, but would I ever in my right mind say that out loud?), a very, very surprisingly complex character for a big budget hollywood film (usually most of the money in films of this sort go to production aspects, and not to overly big name actors). The reason the acting in the movie works so well is that, while none of these actors are A-list chamelion-like actors like Kevin Spacey or Tom Hanks, they seem made to fit these specific roles. Yes, there are some moments where you want to roll your eyes just a little bit (when Liv Tyler mutters her first incantation... you kind of have to think to yourself, ""okay, this is absolutely necessary""), but by the end, it all seems to fit into the movie.
 As I said, the movie is perfect, for the type of film it is. However, fantasy movies might just not be your cup of tea, which is fine, and in which case, the worst you'll think of this movie is that it's ""good"". But the Lord of the Rings - with it's perfectly integrated special effects, actual drama depth, and enough battle scenes to keep any teenager smiling with satisfaction for all three hours (well, maybe the last two and a half) - was designed to reach a wider audience than those who just like fantasy novels, so, unless stories that stray into the fantastical make you vomit, there's no reason for you not to give LOTR a shot. .
I know I haven't spoken of the actual plot of the movie, because I always find that it's best to go into a movie knowing as little about it as possible. I'm sure that's going to be hard, given the omnipresence of advertizing, but, trust me, you don't want me to give any of it away. What you should know you've seen in the previews, and if you haven't seem previews, that's all the better.
I was ridiculously (upset) when it ended though. In retrospect, and on second viewing, it made perfect sense to end when it did. I'm just irked that I have to wait another twelve months to find out what happens next.
Or do I? I think it's time I read those books.",1008892800,,2947,4.4055045871559635
1327689,5,B00003CWT6,"As a (almost) lifelong Tolkien fan, I have been anticipating this film for about 2 years. I went to see it the day it was released, and to be honest, I have virtually nothing to complain about. I don't want to sound like one of those people who loves everything; because believe me, I can be picky. But Peter Jackson did such a good job on 'The Lord of the Rings' that I am completely satisfied.
First of all, there definitely were a lot of changes made that didn't correspond with the books. Whole chapters were left out (Old Man Willow and Tom Bombadil to name a couple), different things were put in, and yet the movie seemed to flow perfectly. Rabid Tolkien fanatics will always find something to gripe about, but the rest of us will most likely appreciate a movie well done. I think that the changes that were made were done with great care, and after a day or two of thinking about it, I can understand why Peter Jackson did what he did. It's better to think of the movie as a companion piece to the book, rather than an actual carbon copy of the book put on screen. I see the book as Tolkien's work, and the movie as Peter Jackson's vision and interpretation of the book. Two completely separate things.
And then there is the acting. I thought it was done superbly, especially Gandalf. If someone had told me during the movie that an actor was actually portraying Gandalf, I wouldn't have believed them. Ian McKellen could not have done better. I also appreciated how Galadriel is depicted as beautiful yet dangerous and frightening at the same time. Boromir was done extremely well, as was Aragorn.
The scenery was breathtaking; New Zealand is a beautiful place, and perfect for 'The Lord of the Rings.' The mountains, valleys, forests and rivers really brought Middle Earth to life.
I would recommend this film to anyone, young or old, Tolkien fan or not. However, if you are one of those 'Tolkien purists', then be prepared for disappointment, because there are a lot of changes. But in my opinion, they were all for the good. (Except for the fact that Frodo didn't sing in Bree, but that's trivial.)

1327690,5,B00003CWT6,"Easily the best book to movie translation ever made. The film is long (almost 3 hours) and leaves you wanting more of the same! Even though some parts had to be cut, the main story is unaffected and even those few people who have not read the books can easily follow the story. Visually the film is dead on to the descriptions given in the book. Peter Jackson has done an outstanding job with all aspects from casting to settings to production.  Once you have seen it, you will be counting the days to the release of the Two Towers.",1008892800,,532,4.32
1327691,4,B00003CWT6,"No, really. After seeing this movie I changed my opinion about Peter Jackson. First of all, Arwen IS actually good. She does not ruin the movie (as many people thought she would) - she appears only a few times in the movie, and adds a little something to it. Bilbo is VERY good, and so is Frodo. Boromir is also excellent. On the other hand, Gimli and Legolas are expressed poorly. Gandalf is not very good, especially in the part where he visits Frodo in the Shire in private. Aragorn is not very good either, and I do not see anything in him that shows me that he's actually a King, and that's perfectly clear in the book.
Sam, imo, is not very good either. Yes, he's still a very loyal servant, but Bill is only showed once in the movie, and Sam is not that kind of a busy house-guy. Many scenes with him that are so good in the book have been taken out.
Many other scenes are also taken out, while many bad scenes are inserted. Lurtz is a very bad addition to the story, imo. He's just an evil guy! All the children in the auditoruim clapped as his head got taken off! Galadriel is very awful, too. She IS a kind of a sorceress, and she's definitely not beautiful. Liv Tyler is much prettier than her. I've seen that actress's pictures, and she's very beautiful in life. I have no clue why the changed her that way.
Battles are not very good, and the scene with Saruman and Gandalf stinks to high heaven. But I do not want to say that the movie is bad. No, it's good. It's just that bad things get stuck in the head much easier than the good parts. You take the good ones for granted, and it required a lot of skill to make. But my advice to you all, READ THE BOOK FIRST. Read it, because if u read it afterwards, you will be dissapointed. Don't let the action world of the movie take you over. Read the book.",1008892800,,1813,4.168091168091168
1327692,5,B00003CWT6,"Finally a 3 hour long epic that is worth sitting through. I read the book recently and although their is just a speck of stuff missing, Peter Jackson has still done a wonderful job of bringing everything to life. Although it's missing stuff like the hobbits almost getting swallowed alive by a giant tree and one or 2 characters. It makes up for it with Strider getting a lot more action both romance wise and fighting wise, just as I wished while reading the book. Has a really cool sword fight towards the end with an orc and it's just awesome. Believe me if there's a fantasy so good that it has me saying ""Willow ?, what Willow ?""  it has to be good and this is that movie. The cast is fantastic and everyone of them are believeable in their roles, especially Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortenson as Gandalf and Strider. The film's only problems are that it's too long and that Howard Shore score at times can be lame. Other than that you got a  great movie with great visuals, great action, great perfomances like I said and very cool creatures. Don't waste your time go see it but don't fall asleep you just might miss a good part which with this movie is very possible.",1008892800,,1172,4.371559633027523

1327694,5,B00003CWT6,"I never cry at movies.  Ever.  Ask anyone who knows me.  But there were two near misses and a total breakdown for me in this one.  A scene between Frodo and his friend Sam just had me a'blubberin'. That is my way of saying this movie had some truly moving moments in it. What it comes down to is, yes, while the special effects are spectacular, the strength of the movie is in its relationships, and how it deals with such grand issues as trust, betrayal, loyalty, love, temptation and sacrifice.  And there were some genuinely edge-of-your-seat moments when the audience breathed a sigh of relief after a series of continuous nail-biting sequences. I never read the book, but this is one of those movies that makes you want to do so after you're done watching it.  Since I didn't know what happened in the book, I was always wondering which hero might be sacrificed at any time.  The only thing I didn't like was the rather abrupt ending, necessitated of course by the fact that two more movies are planned, and there is a whole lot more story to tell.  Just a warning, don't get up to go to the bathroom after the final scene by the river (my husband did, thinking it was a perfect lag time to go, and two minutes later the film ended. SURPRISE!)

Have you ever seen a movie that totally captivates you? That leaves you breathless until you leave the theater? One that absolutely blows you away? Let the Ring shine in.
  I went into this movie without any knowledge of what LotR was all about, exceptin the fact that it was about a ring and someone with the word ""bag"" in his name. I came out talking about Hobbits and scenes from the movie which I almost spazzed over. I went out and bought the second book. I'm glad that I finally know what LotR is about. I'm sad that I have to wait a year for the next one.

The music score by Howard Shore and Enya give the movie the magic and imagination that is simply JRR Tolkien.  This movie will be a hit and is great for movie patrons young and old.  The special effects are fantastic and the set and costumes are superb and extremely detailed.  I have seen movies like Gladiator and Braveheart and think they are simply awesome.  This movie ranks right up there with them as one of the best of the past decade.  It is epic, magical and a great representation of what JRR Tolkien would have wanted his books to portray on the big screen.  If you have not seen it.... Go today.

Nothing has been lost that might affect one's journey to Middle Earth and the long awaited adaptation by Peter Jackson and company will not disappoint; when you see it, you know you have arrived.
The nearly three hours it takes to pass through to the third age seems but a trifle, and when it's over you are left breathless.  Visually stunning, the New Zealand scenerey alone would merit this film, and the Sfx are used as an artform rather than merely as gimmicks.  The beauty and the terror are preserved through out, as is Tolkien's biblical based ethos he had so subtley woven through out his story.
All the words that have been used in reference to lesser works to the point of banality, saga, epic, masterpiece, have been restored to their former luster throughout this film.
While no film is perfect, and no work made by human hands can remain without flaw because of our own inherent inequities, this film,this thing of wonder and awe comes very close to the emaculate.",1008892800,,1155,4.707920792079208
1327698,3,B00003CWT6,"Like many, I have also read the books and was aware of the story and characters going into the film.  While the visuals, especially that stunning battle scene at the start of the film, were done to near perfection - it did miss the mark in a more fundamental way.
Too much screen time was spent drawing out and languishing over several dramatic events of the film.  I found myself thinking, ""Okay we know this guy is going to die, let's move the story along"".  For example, we see a character get hit with an arrow, muster strength to fight some more, then almost die, then get hit with another arrow, again muster more strength and fight again, then almost die, then get hit with yet another arrow, and tries to muster his strength again...  And to top it off this long drawn out scene is full of added elements that were not in the book.  The film was littered with examples like this (the character that almost drowns at the end of the film - also painfully drawn out.  Any time Frodo puts on the ring - painfully drawn out)
Yes film is a medium different that that of a novel, but if Jackson wanted to make a three hour movie, he should have spend more screen time developing character and plot motivations.  This would keep the audience from getting lost and from asking, ""why are our characters going to this place?"", and ""who is this guy?"".  Once characters and key plot point is properly setup with their motivations explained, then the drama will naturally come out, and it won't need the added drama effects, heavy sound and score to force the audience to feel a certain way.
Jackson simply lets the characters and story get buried with the overuse of dramatic effects.  Very little time was spent developing Frodo and Sam, as likeable real characters.  They just appeared as cardboard cutouts borrowed from the Phantom Menace, with no real motivation and human connection to anyone else in the film.

Now that special place inside my imaginative heart has been sufficiently re-filled, and re-fueled, by Jackson's Lord of the Rings.  A better movie does not exist.  I would have gladly paid fifteen dollars to see it, and probably will, as I return to the movie theater over and over again.  I can't stop thinking about it, or stop re-playing the richness of the landscapes in my mind.  This film really captured the essence of J.R.R. Tolkien's first book of his Lord of the Rings triolgy.  It is going to be a long year waiting for the next installment, The Two Towers.  If this doesn't get the Best Picture Oscar, I have given up all hope in the Motion Picture Academy.",1008892800,,798,4.577464788732394
1327749,4,B00003CWT6,"This movie is great fun. Like many people, I've adored these books since childhood.
However, I have several nagging criticisms.
First, the film opens with an unnecessarily long exposition in which the ancient history of Middle Earth is told, and a little too bluntly. The necessary background could have been explained more briefly by Gandalf in his Bag End discussion with Frodo, as in the book.
Strangely, as if the movie was inexpertly planned from the start, there are points in the film in which it is obvious that significant moments (even whole battles) have been edited out of the film due to its unwieldy length. This throws off the flow of the movie, leaving some moments pregnant with the expectation of events that never occur. And yet, other moments and sentiments that are *not* in the book are inserted. For example, there is a contrived scene on a staircase in Moria, complete with uncomfortably contemporary dwarf-tossing humor. The wizard battle in Sauroman's tower, which is not described in the book, would have been better left to the imagination with a quick cut away to other action. As it stands in this scene, the effects are old, hackneyed and inconsistent with Gandalf's capabilities elsewhere in the story.
On the technical side, this film is remarkable in so many ways. The scenery is unbelievable. The attention to detail in the sets and props is, as we have all read, fantastic. The orchestral score is rich and emotive. The only weak spots were a few of the special effects mentioned above and the disappointingly heavy-handed sound design. Frequently, to emphasize powerful moments of magic, voices and dialog became harshly distorted with various effects, to such an extent that the text was sometimes indecipherable.
Finally, Jackson tosses in a bit of traditional Hollywood schmaltz that feels disappointingly un-Tolkien. The sugary ""empowerment of the little guy"" sentiment, the love interest between Arwen and Aragorn, etc.
Overall, the movie is gorgeous and powerful, but has the mark of an almost-but-not-quite-at-the-top-of-his-game director whose love of the story exceeds his storytelling craft.",1008892800,,2138,5.2
1327750,5,B00003CWT6,"I'm forced to give this film a 5-star rating, despite some problems I had with it, because anything less just isn't a fair rating.
A devout lover of the novels by Tolkien, I felt some apprehension about the story being turned into a film... it is an *extremely* long and detatiled story with lots of twists and turns, a myriad of characters, and a plot that, to say the least, is a bit complicated. I felt that much of the story would be ""glossed-over"" in an attempt to make it more endearing to the audiences of today. But, I headed to the theater and after three hours, I found that I was pleasantly surprised.
Some parts were left out, but I am aware that not everything in the book could be put into a movie. There were some things added that, actually I did like, and after getting over the ""Arwen deal"" (as I so lovingly call it now) I found myself in love with this movie. I still must say that taking out characters like Glorfindel and shrinking Elrond's part a bit in an attempt to give a female more screen time does not settle well with me. (Arwen is in the novel's story, but she has a much smaller part than seen on film... I would rather have had that be much closer to the book than it was). Also, one of the better parts of the book (I won't say any more than Frodo and the Sword... readers will know what I speak of) was not given as much time as I would have liked, and much of the danger we felt as readers was not accurately transferred to film. Still, very minor problems when one takes in the wondrous scope of the film. Settings are beautiful, believable and 100% true to Tolkien's descriptions. Characters are portrayed with depth and emotion. Also, one does not have to be familar with the novels... an introduction to the movie helps introduce newbies to Middle-earth and the story of the One Ring.
A superb job all around... acting, plot pacing, visual effects, and an awesome film score... everything is great. Especially McKellen's stellar performance as Gandalf. Go and see this movie, even if you have never heard of this story before, nor read the novels. You *will* want to see it again, I guarantee it.",1008892800,,2136,4.410126582278481
1327751,2,B00003CWT6,"Jackson movie about some place called Middle Earth which has a giant squid (where's Kirk Douglas when you need him, eh?) Star Wars was criticised in it's day for it's bad dialogue but in retrospect it was witty and you liked the characters for it.  The colourless characters and earnest, incomprehensible dialogue offers little for the kiddies here.  It's a hoot for us wrinklies, though.
Jackson's directorial style consists of an establishing shot followed by a pan into someone's face until they fill the screen and then staying there for minutes at a time.  Cut to another character and then slowly pan in again until you see their blackheads.  One of them mentions the ring; show ring on table and pan in until it's a very big ring indeed. It's uncomfortable and annoying, not to mention psychologically unwise as it's considered an invasion of personal space if someone puts their face up close to yours.  After the 180th close up of Messrs Lee and McKellen, don't be surprised if your eyes turn back to front inside their sockets, drop down your throat and a red sign with a hundred pops out your head.
The plot consists of a chap called Frodo getting chased by men on horseback, putting on the ring, falling flat on his back, getting up again, gets chased by the horsemen, puts on the ring, falls over, gets up again, gets chased again. I don't know why they didn't just tie him to a stretcher and drag him around, it would save everyone yelling 'FRODO!"" All the time.  Some wag in the audience picked up on this and yelled out ""FRODO"" At least three times.  He totally cracked me up and from then on I was gone.  Everything made me laugh.  Gandalf's hat.  The Elve's hairy feet.  That Robbie Coltrane look-alike with the braided beard crying and banging his head on the altar.  That neon door in the mountain that looked like one of those boutiques down the UK's King's Road.  Those sea horses straight out of that bear commercial.  There's something killingly funny about the word 'Mordar' for some reason, too.  I've never had a giggle attack like this before during a film and It's painful trying to hold it in so as not to disturb your neighbours. I tried hurting my hand to distract myself like Micheal Caine in 'The Ipcress File' only to be confronted by a hysterical conference of Elves and Hobbits in a village over who should destroy the ring.  They gurn, they snarl, they get a camera up their nostrils.  Someone delivers the immortal line: ""Never trust an elf!"" Someone help me, I'm dying.  There's also a chap called Legola.  Well, he does look a bit plastic.  Does Legola get his leg over?  Is there a shire of wenches?  Sadly, women don't get much of a look in during the film.
The plot staggers on and more gut busting dialogue insues.  ""Yonder, see Iceguard!"" ""We shall go forth to Loftylorry!"" I regain my composure after a bit of aggro in a mine.  Later, Brit actor Sean Bean falls over in some leaves and begins sobbing ""FRODO! FRODO!"" Please no, not that name again.  I'm off.  This time some of the audience Joins me.  Believe me, if your bereaved, in the middle of a divorce or depressed, this film will save you, it's a laugh riot.
Suddenly Rawhead Rex turns up.  Once relegated to straight to video, he has finally made it to the big screen.  You can't keep a good bad guy down, I guess.  Rawhead Rex's appearance leads to a really funny death scene in which a character falls down mortally wounded, gets up again and fights, falls down mortally wounded again, gets up and fights, falls down again, gets up and fights.  Is he secretly related to Frodo?  The audience is really cracking up now, it's the comedy of the year.  Another chap called Sam has a swim, but is saved.  ""I'm glad you're with me, Sam"" Frodo tells the dripping Hobbit, but we're far from glad as he's the one whose been yelling ""FRODO!"" The entire film.
Boy, three down, six hours to go.  I recover on the way home, open the bathroom cabinet when I get there and see a box of 'Frador'.  I'm off again.",1008892800,10,4004,4.520166898470097
1327752,5,B00003CWT6,"I am a big Tolkien fan, and I consider myself to know a lot about the books.  I have listed here several aspects of the movie that the true and DIE HARD Tolien fans need to realize before jumping to conclusions...
1)Tom Bombadil and Farmer Maggot were great but unless you read the book you would have no idea what the significance of these characters are.  The telling of these side-stories would have taken another hour or so
2)Glorfindel wasn't THAT important, but ultiamtely Arwen was.  She was the internal conflict that was going on within Aragorn, and deserved the right as Elrond's daughter to have a larger role.
3)The lines of Legolas in the book were merely limited to the history of the elves, and non-tolkien fans seeing this epic for the first time, wouldn't understand them without another long drawn out part about them.
4)A movie has to do exactly what it is called, it was to move.  People that have read the books and understand the story wouldn't be bored by the long drawn out scenes of the Fellowship admiring the countryside, and walking along the mountains.  The wolf scene in the book posed nothing more than a simple encounter, and wouldn't have made sense because people (non-Tolkien knowing) don't understand the way Tolkien portrayed animals as having there own minds and societys.
5)I thought the Moria scene was great and just as long as it needed to be, the Balrog was just as I pictured it in my mind, and Gimli discovering the tomb and his reaction was much more suitable for people that don't understand.
6 and last)  Bottom-line, this movie wasn't made to please the Die-Hard Tolkien fan, and thats not a flaw at all.  Peter Jackson did an excellent job translating this book into a modern format that people that in live in a society where ""Dude Where's My Car"" and ""Not Another Teen Movie(good god)"" (THESE MOVIES *** BAD, WHY DID THEY EVEN COME OUT) are 'good movies.'  If you look passed its mishaps and look at the part of the story that was discovered, I think you can see what I mean.
Oh and another thing, the person that said Gollum wasn't in the movie enough is stupid, hes actually in the book one time, and in the movie 3 times.  I understood his position in the books better after I saw the movie.

While I did enjoy the animated version that came out several years ago , I felt that it did not do the story justice.  It was too child-like in its adaptation.  I do not believe that Tolkien was writing a children's story.
I saw the Lord of the Rings movie yesterday. Simply put, I was awestruck.  It was one of the best movies that I have seen in my 33 years.  It was just so powerful and well done.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.

1327755,2,B00003CWT6,"The Fellowship of the Ring, is a well made film that deviates from the book in unthoughtful ways. Despite visually rich cinematography the film lacks cohesion and character development. Gandalf is is suberbly acted, but needless changes have been made to make him more falible. An example would be Elrond telling him the ring can't stay in Rivendell. Of course it can't, Gandalf discovered the ring, is imprisioned over the ring, tells Frodo numerous times the ring must be destroyed, and yet he has the vain notion that it can stay forever in Rivendell? Come on, this is PC Hollywood trying to make a character ""more human"", it makes no sense. There are several other troubling points in the film, that feel more like the Super Friends or some dopey action film like Face-Off. For instance, when the company of nine have been decided, Elrond says ""and you shall be called the Fellowship of the Ring."" I half expected Superman to fly into the frame and say ""The Justice League will support you too!"" Get real, the nine are on what they feel is a hopeless and solemn quest, the don't need a dopey label to know what they are.
There are several such lamentable changes to the film, both in storyline and dialogue. The worst probably being in the end of the film when Aragorn says ""Let's hunt some Orc!"" Good Lord, did Peter Jackson put on his Arnord-tinted glasses when he approved that line, or is he just more concerned about making a ""movie"" than he is about telling a story. Muses have been around for a long time, pesonally I think it is because men need inspiration to create, and little inspires man more than women. Unfortunately in this case, I think the muse that hit Peter Jackson was the typical Hollywood muse for over the top profit. Anyone who has read the books will be disappointed by the lack of character development, and the disjointed and rushed storyline.
The main culprit, may be the medium itself. To make a truly Grand epic, where characters grow, suspense builds, and subtle tension reigns, ""The Lord of the Rings"" should be a Television mini-series akin to Lonesome Dove or Centennial, both of which are excellent and much more detailed and faithful adaptations of the books that inspired them. Spend you 8.50 on a copy of ""The fellowship of the Ring"", buy a good pair of slippers while you're out, and curl up in a chair and read.

1327756,3,B00003CWT6,"Being a lifelong fan of the book, and having re-read
it just weeks prior to the viewing, it is completely
impossible for me to give Peter Jackson's FOTR an
reasonable evaluation from an artistic standpoint. I
couldn't help but dissect the film scene-by-scene as
opposed to percieving it as one cinematic whole. At
times it felt like a protracted illustration and
little else. Perhaps a second or third viewing will
correct that. For now, on first impression, I can only
say that the film was uneven, at times frustrating.
Frustrating because some of its aspects worked
beautifully; and some were pulling it into quite the
opposite direction. Frustrating because Jackson does
have a strong personal vision, yet he did make some
grave and obvious concessions to Hollywood. Here's the
breakdown:
THE GOOD:
1) Visuals: Landscapes, Architecture and Interiors.
Flawless. Majestic. Alan Lee, as design consultant
worked miracles. And furthermore, it made New Zealand
a lucrative travel destination for me.
2) Certain Actors.
Specifically portraying Gandalf, Bilbo, Sam, a few
others... mostly dead-on, much like I always imagined.
3) The ""creative license"" scenes.
Surprisingly enough, most of them did not detract from
the movie, and even enlivened it a bit. Arwen's
involvement did not seem out of place, and her ""flight
to the ford"" scene is easily one of the finest
setpieces of the whole 3 hours. In fact, I would have
liked to see even more of her. The allusions to
various chapter titles were in good spirit, and the
comic relief for the most part worked decently,
although it was somewhat upsetting to see Merry and
Pippin reserved strictly for that purpose. The
subtitled Elvish was a nice touch, in part because it
eliminated the prospect of listening to Aragorn's and
Arwen's romantic dialogue in English (!)
4) Action Scenes.
Nicely staged, esp. the entire Moria sequence.
THE MEDIOCRE:
1) Heavy Cuts.
It's true that the film is rushed. The only clues to
how much time elapses between various scenes are
periodic edits to the transformation of Isengard, and
that is insufficient. Many scenes feel shortened in
order to meet the 3 hour obligation, especially those
of Lorien and I would hope the more complete version
makes it to DVD.
2) At times, overdramatic.
Some of the players' approach is not very authentic,
overly self-aware, Elrond most of all. Aragorn and
Boromir overact on occasion, but sparingly. Saruman
and Gandalf, bellowing spells at each other across
mountain passes come off as a pair of grand opera
singers.
3) Derivative Effects.
While impressive in their own right, the Wizard duel
scene, Cave Troll, and Balrog seem to be inspired by
latter-day videogames rather than by Tolkien's
descriptions.
THE BAD:
1) Frodo's cleanliness.
While Elijah Wood's undoubtedly put his heart and soul
into the role, his physical appearance was just a tad
bit overpolished. He resembled a computer generated
model rather than a living, breathing hobbit. And
throughout the film, not a speck of dirt seemed to
have touched him - does being the ringbearer
automatically merit a daily bath in wartime
conditions?
2) Prologue.
Cheezy and unnessesary. Much of it is repeated through
subsequent flashbacks anyway. Could have done without
it and went on straight to the original storyline. The
initial shot of Sauron holding up the ring is
laughable, straight out of a grade-Z flick. He is
better left unseen.
3)The Soundtrack.
Atrocious, absolutely atrocious. The single element of
LOTR that tipped the scale toward the negative for me.
If it was used half as much, the movie would have been
greatly eleveated in my mind. But this generic
tripe...too closely reminiscent of Titanic for
comfort. Remeber that secne in South Park when a character was tortured to death by Enya's music? Well, that's precisely how I felt...",1008892800,3,3822,5.077901430842608
1327787,5,B00003CWT6,"I have waited nearly all my life for someone to translate Tolkien's masterpiece to th big screen.  I watched the cartoon versions annually as a child, dressed up like Eowyn, and just longed for the big screen version.  I began to hear rumors about 3 years ago and have been anxiously awaiting the release.  Sometimes I thought the movie would never live up to my dreams since I have had them for so long.  Oh how happily wrong I was!  The movie is absolutely brilliant!  The casting is brilliant!  The Shire, Rivendell, and Lothlorien are absolutely breathtaking.  The special effects are wonderful. I cannot hardly stand it that I have to wait a whole year to see the next installment and then another year afterr that to see the final chapter!  The Fellowship of the Rings definately beats Harry Potter.  Harry was good, but lacks the depth and beauty of Middle Earth!  I sat in awe during the entire movie and when it was over, I could not believe that three hours had gone by!
The work that everyone put into the movie must be applauded because it was absolutely breathtaking and brilliant!  I can't wait to see it again!",1008892800,,1125,4.57
1327788,5,B00003CWT6,"The formula of a great book = a great movie is almost never true. The Fellowship of the Ring is a wonderful movie because it has sucessfully brought the book to the screen.  There are wonderful special effects and exciting action scenes, but they are all in support of the fanstastic story created by Tolkein -- rather than being created for their own sake.  I applaud everyone involved with this movie for achieving this seemingly impossible task.
Liked it so much I went home at 1AM and got out my copy of the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" for a fresh re-reading.",1008892800,,560,4.534653465346534
1327789,5,B00003CWT6,"This film has an excellent mixture of real footage and special effects. It is freaquently difficult to tell the difference between the real and computer generated. From the previews and trailers it was hard to tell that they had digitally shortened the Hobit characters, but in the movie it is amazing how they accomplished this. I can't wait to see the making of the movie that I am sure will be on the DVD when it comes out. This movie deserves five stars, no question in my mind.
As many people have, I am sure, I read these stories when I was in high school, and I can't remember the finer points of the novels. From what I remember however, I think that the movie did ample justice to the book. Many things in the movie happened differently than I had imagined -- bigger and better!
One caution though, don't take the PG-13 rating for granted. This is a violent and dark/evil film at times. I saw several children in the theater that were under 10; this is far more violent and scary than Harry Potter. At times the battles reminded me of Braveheart's, but condensed.
In all, for adults and older teens, this is a great film about the classic battle between good and evil, in a fairy tale setting.",1008892800,,1202,4.4434389140271495
1327790,5,B00003CWT6,"As a long-time fan of Tolkien's classic works, I couldn't have been happier with the first film adaptation of his benchmark series.  Obviously the film-makers are not only top-notch in their field, but also true fans of Tolkien's work.
The adaptation of the original ""Fellowship of the Ring"" to this movie was flawless.  In fact, this is the best book-to-movie adaptation I've ever seen.  Although I could act like a fan-boy and complain about the parts I like that they skipped, I have to admit that the changes they made for time were well-chosen, and that the things that were cut that were not for length were mostly for the purpose of maintaining the mood and feel that the filmmakers were trying to get across with the film.
As for changes, I cannot imagine the few alterations in the plot that they made as being more well-crafted than they were.  Often the changes were simply for the purpose of setting up various parts of the plot that will come out in parts 2 and 3.  In fact, I thought that some of the changes actually improved on Tolkien's original!  Which considering how classic and well-written the books are is quite a statement.
Overall I haven't been this awestruck by a movie since I watched ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" for the first time as an 8-year-old.  The only complaint I have about the movie is that I can't wait to see the next chapter!",1008892800,,1362,4.557377049180328
1327791,5,B00003CWT6,"There were ten thousand ways it could have gone wrong, but it was right -- beautifully, lovingly right.
First, the characterizations were exactly correct.  Ian McKellan simply was Gandalf.  Ian Holm was a perfect Bilbo.  The minor changes in Aragorn, Arwen, Pippin and Merry were acceptable and reasonable, given that a lot of scenes had to be cut, and therefore some motivations had to be changed.  (For instance, with no time for a conspiracy in the Shire, Merry and Pippin needed a new way to join the party.)  Sean Bean's Boromir, Sean Astin's Sam and Elijah Wood's Frodo worked well.  I won't say much more about the characterization, because I never thought about actors or characterizations during the film.  I just watched Frodo's journey.
But the strength of The Lord of the Rings is more than the characters.  The major character in any trip through Fairy-land is Fairy-land itself, and the books contain brilliant and emotional descriptions of the various places in Middle-Earth.  They succeeded.

I could recognize every place immediately.  Bag End, Bree, Rivendell, Moria, Caras Galadhon, the Argonath, Barad-Dur, the Cracks of Doom, Caradhras and Orthanc were clearly and obviously Bag End, Bree, Rivendell, Moria, Caras Galadhon, the Argonath, Barad-Dur, the Cracks of Doom, Caradhras and Orthanc.  With one exception, I can't name *any* way in which these places don't match Tolkien's descriptions.
C. S. Lewis was once asked why he liked Shakespeare so much, and he replied, ""Because he takes me somewhere I've never been before.""  By contrast, this movie took me back to a place I *have* been before -- the end of the Third Age of Middle-Earth.  It felt much like going back to my old college, or the house I grew up in (which, in a very real sense, it was).
Peter Jackson's direction impressed me with both how true he was to the original, and with how and when he chose to deviate from it.  Tolkien spends much more time describing things that Jackson shows in a single shot.  Jackson spends more time on movement and combat and other things that take time to show.  He was equally concerned with being true to Tolkien's vision and with making the best movie possible (which is not the same thing as filming the best book).  He did not balance the two goals - he aimed at both.
Examples: many things that are discussed in the Council of Elrond are actually shown in the movie -- dialog about action is not as cinematic as action.  The council itself takes a different course, which gets all the essential information in quickly.  (Consider thirty minutes to an hour of a bunch of people sitting around and talking.  As much as I'd like to see that scene, imagine the effect it would have on non-Tolkien fanatics.)
Some events were moved because of the necessary time compression.  Since the long discussion in Bag End about Gollum's origins was cut, the lines about Pity were moved to the first time we see Gollum.  That kept an essential plot point, while reducing the amount of exposition.
Some changes were dictated by the medium.  The thoughts that went through Frodo's mind near the end turned into dialog so that they could be shown on screen, so he had to tell it to somebody.  It seemed a reasonably elegant solution.
There are several things that are put in for the fans but are unremarked on and will be ignored by the others.  The sign on the gate, Legolas walking on the snow, some chapter titles turned into dialog, Bilbo's book and maps done in Tolkien's hand, etc.
Mostly, the effects were wonderful -- both technically and artistically satisfying.  There was one special effect that left me cold.  (No, I won't identify it.)  But, oh the Balrog!  And the Fords of Bruinen.  And the Eye of Sauron.  And the pits at Orthanc.  And,... but enough.  The effects made the fantasy real.
One comment about the fighting -- Gimli fought like a dwarf, Legolas fought like an elf, Boromir fought like a warrior, Aragorn fought like a loner, the troll fought like a troll, the Uruk-Hai fought like a group of people who weren't good at cooperation.  I thought Bob Anderson put a lot of attention into individual styles.
I don't agree with all the choices made.  But it is a worthy and delightful vision of Middle-Earth.  It was clearly a labor of love, by people who loved Tolkien and loved films.",1008892800,5,4320,4.742627345844504
1327792,5,B00003CWT6,"I read this book and the trilogy in the late sixties when I was nine or ten. I still can vividly remember how I imagined the charactors.  I never thought anyone could make a movie which depicted the saga or ""Epic"" if you will.  When the animated version came out, yes, I was disappointed, but also pleased that someone had any type of imagination to try to reproduce the intensity of this masterpiece.  I have not yet seen this movie.  I am taking my family to see it as a Christmas present.  All of my children LOVED the animated version, and my 18 year old daughter has read the books at least three times.  How dare anyone say that TLOR is silly.  ""1984"" (George Orwell) came and went. A scary thought.  ""2001: A Space Oddessy"" came and went.  ""Star Wars"", ""E.T."", ""Never-ending Story"", ETC., have all came and went. All of these are awesome classics in their own right.  I am sure that there will be a couple of disappointments, but what an ""awesome"" undertaking; to attempt to indulge our imaginations.  I will write again after seeing the movie, but, I for one, will enjoy entering into someone elses imagination for the ""Adventure of a Lifetime"".  Never mind the ""racist, sexist, childish, silly"" comments.  GO SEE IT. At the very least, it will entertain you and you might even enjoy it. I myself, CAN'T wait!",1008892800,,1317,4.553191489361702
1327793,5,B00003CWT6,"The Triliogy of the Rings were the first books I can remember reading that made me really think about what I was reading. They were the first books that made me feel something, they stirred something deep inside of me.
To prepare to watch this movie I did everything in my power to isolate myself from the hype of the movie and refused to re-read the books before seeing it so I either ""wouldn't be disappointed"" or ""wouldn't wind up mentally spouting dialog along the characters as I did with Harry Potter"". I refused to watch trailers, I ignored comericals dealing with the movie, and even didn't read any of the reviews posted on other websites, blogs and journals. I can't even tell you how much it grossed on opening night.
I wanted the experience to be new, and different. I wanted to be totaly ""naive"" going into the movie.
What I didn't expect was to be moved like I was.
The movie started off slowly, but you could tell the director was taking the time to pay attention to every detail. The Shire was incredibly well done, and as a result the acting was better than some of other parts of the movie where the characters were obviously trying to interact with CGI generated scenery.
Disclaimer here...the characters interacted fine with the CGI animated characters, but not with the generated scenery there is a difference.
Despite that I found the beginning of the movie to be slow and ponderous, but that may have been because I was trying to force myself to enjoy the movie. I wanted to enjoy it...but it seemed the harder I tried to enjoy it the further I distanced myself from the movie.
Until the flight to the ford...
Racing through the tree's Frodo clasped in the elf princesses arms on a white horse while the Shadow Wraiths chased them. That's when it hit me.
The scene was exactly like I pictured it while I had been reading so many years ago. The panting of the horses breath, the frantic dodges, the sounds the texture, all of it. Only in the movie it was shorter.
At that point I let myself go and enjoyed the show.
Then came a scene that brought about some unexpected feeling, emotion that changed the movie from just a movie into something else.
The Fellowship stands separated on a broken stairway, a stairway that is crumbling slowly tilting its way into the abyss that it spans. And suddenly the only thing I could think of was the WTC. I don't know why, and I don't know how, but for some reason the images of the twin towers collapsing leapt strongly into my mind.
Of course the Frodo and Strider make the leap as the stairs finish their tumbling, and the Fellowship is rejoined. But I still couldn't shake that feeling, that odd emotion that welled up inside me.
Just a few moments later it happened again.
Gandolf stands at the edge of the broken bridge facing the demon and he says something along the lines of ""It stops here, you will not pass. Return to the fires of evil that spawned you."" And all I could think of were the passengers on United Flight 93, the plane upon which the passengers stood up to the terrorists. The plane that crashed in the Pennsylvania country side, and part of me wondered if their last moments were like that. Giving all they had in defense of themselves and their own. Knowing hope as they almost succeed in overpowering their captors completely only to feel the despair well up again as they feel the demonic claws drag them down into the abyss.
The movie ends with a quote that I'm going to need to look up and see if its in the book or not. Frodo is standing alone on the beach preparing to strike out on his own, the ""One Ring"" clenched in his hand, and you hear him thinking (paraphrased) ""I wish the ring had never come to me"" and then you hear Gandolf say ""Everyone born in times like this make that wish, but it is up to you to choose how you will live in these moments"".
I also feel compelled to make one warning before recommending this movie. It is as graphic and at times as scary as the books were. It doesn't shrink from showing death and destruction in all its cruelty (though it avoids gore) and as such you might want to think carefully before taking your nine-year old daughter I as did.
Let me stress this point. This is not the action/adventure comic strip violence so common on tv and movies. This is bone chilling trample the gatekeeper behead the mayor in dark shadows violence.
With that said, let me encourage each of you to go see this movie...and most importantly let yourself enjoy it.",1008892800,,4478,4.462195121951219
1327794,5,B00003CWT6,"This film was stellar and I am so thrilled to know that the makers were wise enough to do all three films at the same time because this cast and director, these incredible sets and locations are perfect!  I've read the Trilogy three times ( a relative few times, I realize.)  I have loved it for nearly four decades and I consider it the best book ever written and so I was worried that the film would not measure up.  It did!
  Any nitpicking about the plot changes and the development of the Lady Arwen's character are just that...nitpicking.  This is an ADAPTATION and so editing it down to a convenient size without losing the power and flow of the story was a difficult task, I am sure.  No, we do not see Old Man Willow or Tom Bombadil and Goldberry.  If the Barrow Downs scene would have been included and done well it would have taken another 1/2 hour alone.  We don't visit with Farmer Maggot either, but remember this is an adaptation and we cannot be literal minded if we hope to enjoy this film.  What we are given is fabulous! The Lady Arwen is placed in the scene at the Ford of Bruinen rather than Glorfindel but it works as well and gives Arwen a much more rounded character that will later be important to our understanding of Aragorn and Elves in general. It works and her newly enlarged character is breath-taking and so beautifully played by Liv Tyler.  The casting was, all in all, magnificent and the make-up and hair and costumes were brilliant.  These characters meshed well with the perceptions I had in my head as a result of reading the books. My one fault with casting was in the character of Elrond played by Hugo Weaving.  Weaving does a good job and his fine bone structure is very Elvish in appearance and the strength in his voice is appropriate, but unfortunately at least for this part, Weaving's previous role in ""The Matrix"" tainted him too much to make him acceptable. The vibration of malignancy from ""The Matrix"" role spilled over into this role and Elrond should not have a whiff of malignancy about him however faint.  I am easily willing to accept that tiny flaw because of the excellence of all the rest of the cast. My favorites are Orlando Bloom as Legolas, Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took, Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. These three manage to stand out in a brilliant cast and their acting is just a dead-ringer for their literary counterparts. I thought I might object to the pointed ears that were given to the Elvish folk in this film because the books never describe Elves as having pointy ears, but it works well, actually, and gives just the right flavor of the Fey to these people without making them in the least like Santa's helpers as I had feared.
  The Shire IS the Shire in this film. Isengard and the tower of Orthanc are right on and the depiction of Khazad-dum was deep and heavy with doom and magnificence. Satisfying.
  This movie flowed swiftly and was totally engrossing at every  moment. The characters drew you in and made you believe in them. The bits that were spoken in the Elvish tongue with subtitles added to the film rather than detracting as some subtitles can do. The film succeeded in being great in its own right and able to stand alone as a film even for people who have not read the books.  I expect it will draw legions of new fans to the books.
I am thoroughly pleased with the results of all this movie magic and I bow to the creators of ""Lord of the Rings"". I offer them my sword. Let no one pass who would naysay their Majesties.",1008892800,,3511,4.4477379095163805

Having been a past FRPG gamer that cut his teeth on Middle Earth and spent countless hours playing the PBM version of it too, all I can say is it was wonderful to see the world come alive in front of my eyes.  When the Shire came into view it was like I had been there before, which I had in my many adventures of the imagination in Middle Earth.  As the adventure unfolded, more and more places I was familar with popped onto the screen.  It was just a wonderful film.

1327796,5,B00003CWT6,"I've never read the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I must confess, I've tried a couple of times to read The Fellowship of the Ring, but I just couldn't get into it.  Going into the movie, I was worried that I'd be confused and unsure of the plot.  This worry grew when the theatre did a trivia game before the movie--and everyone in the audience seemed to know EVERYTHING about the books.
My worries were completely unfounded.  The film opens with an outstanding introduction, a kind of prologue.  (A friend told me that this discusses the details of ""The Hobbit,"" the book that comes before The Fellowship of the Ring.)  The prologue was wonderful--it told me everything I needed to know, but also took my breath away.  In three minutes, I understood everything I needed to know to get into the story.
The rest of the movie was unbelievably beautiful, sad, suspenseful, and action-packed.  I couldn't believe how easily the film switched tones--one minute exciting, the next sad, and the next introspective.  In fact, one aspect of the film that I wasn't expecting was the amount of suspense.  I actually jumped a couple of times in my seat.  The acting was awesome, something somewhat rare for a fantasy film.  (""Willow"", anyone?)  And the special effects were seamless--it was hard to tell what was computer generated and what was real.
The ending left me wanting more, even after 3 hours, and I can't wait for the next film.  The last five minutes seemed so simple, yet they almost brought me to tears.  I must congratulate Peter Jackson for creating such a vivid world in my mind.  The scenery, the characters, the story, they have all come to life for me much more than they could on paper.
NOT the best movie of all time, and possibly not even the best movie of the year, but still a 10 out of 10.  Highly recommended (for ages 13 and up due to the frightening scenes).",1008892800,,1873,4.593373493975903

For booklovers, you'll find this movie left out some elements that we all liked from the book, but they have done a great job describing in great detail the key elements of the Followship of the Ring.  Tolkien's seemly random stories (and songs) might have been left out, but the detail remains.  Each character is described, and acts, just like I always imagined they would.  If you've read it, then you know the ending :)  For those seeing this for the first time, you'll be learning about the greatest fantasy story of all time! And in the end...  All I can say is, it makes you wish it was Dec. 2002!

1327836,5,B00003CWT6,"Well,to begin this review I will tell my expectations.
When I first heard that the former sick comedy director Peter Jackson would direct a live-action version of J.R.R.Tolkien`s Lord of the Rings trilogy,I was quite worried. First,I thought he would be kicked because of sick humour ideas and replaced by a quality director like Spielberg or someone.
Then,I was also worried because of it`s 250 million dollar budget - more expensive than Titanic itself! If this movie would be a flop,not just Peter Jackson would loose a lot of money - the entire company of New Line Cinema (and may be also Warner Bros.)would have to go in concourse. And the animated LOTR movie of 1978 became a huge flop,which made it even more unbelievable that this one would succeed at the box office - I and many other love the books and I don`t want them to be destroyed.
And there was also not many well-known actors in this film,which made me even more doubtfull about it.
Well,when I came into the theatre in the opening day,I forgot all of that stuff.
It was definitly NO humour  la Monty Python or bad acting here.
This movie runs on for almost three hours,but it is never getting boring or anything like that. In fact,it is so magic and well done that you want it to never stop!
The dramatic landscapes of New Zealand fits perfectly to Tolkien`s description of the environment in the books.
Something which probably makes the movie soo good is that they have planned all in detail,and the detail is almost as big as in the book. All cultures are planned. When watching this movie,it is not just a fairytail world. Everything is so cast that you can believe this world really exists,although there are orchs,ringwraiths and wizards!
Some of my favorite sequences are the introduction when the history of the ring is told,the battle with Balrog,one of my favorite LOTR villains from the book,and the mountain wandering,which looks so beautifull that I got inspired every second of that moment.
And the sad moments of the film really has a feel - I shall not tell you what happens,but when it happend,my eyes were almost filled with tears!
In fact,it is just good that it does not have many well-known actors. It is nice to let Orlando Bloom and Sean Astin become mega stars instead of Keanu Reeves or Danny DeVito for example.
Ian McKellen looks exactly like Gandalf from the books. Elijah Wood is perfect as the little hobbit Frodo,who is the hero of the story,and Viggo Mortensen plays Aragorn as no other man can!
It is also nice to see the horror veteran Christopher Lee as Saruman,the evil wizard who pretends he`s Gandalfs friend.
One more noteworthy thing is the sound quality - all the sounds could be heard very clearly,and the music was enormously powerfull at several moments.
Everything about LOTR was enormous - they worked on it for seven years! Here are some unnecessary stuff about it but it`s may be fun to know: 90,000 still photographs were taken,the recording theme consisted of 2400 people,100 locations were used,274 days of recording,20602 background actors were in the movie,and 180 persons created the effects! And a lot more were done as well!
All three films were recorded at the same time,so there would not be the problem of the older one,which was never finished!
Well,let's hope it succeeds at the box office. Now I have told my thoughts,and to end this review,I`m gonna say that the moment when I watched this movie december 19th will be the last cinema visit I`ll ever forget!
If it does not get an Academy Award (at least for best sound),I will be surprised!",1008892800,,3572,4.7243589743589745

the sceenes and costumes are well made and creates the idea that the Shire is a real place. the charicters are well choosen and actors/actresses play their roles well.
the comedy is well balaced with the tradgedy and sorrow, but the language does prove to be more for older teens and adults rather than young children and they will proberly get tierd and bored very soon although the effect will intrest them. this is a deinate must see and words cannot decribe the talant and wonder in this movie.",1008892800,,583,4.615384615384615
1327838,5,B00003CWT6,"That was the first question that rose to my mind, as I saw the different sizes of hobbit, dwarf, elf and human. Yet in real life the actors are the same size.... Astonishing...
As a fan of the novels (read it more than 10 times) I went to see the movie as soon as possible. And was not dissappointed. Although the story was slightly different (Arwen was never on that white horse, in the novel it was Glorfindel), the story was well displayed. A large portion was also cut out. As the novels tells, after the ferry they ventured in the old wood, were captured in the Great Old Willow and rescued by Tom Bombadil. After that they were again in trouble at the Barrow Downs, and again saved by Bombadil. After that they came in Bree. But I guess Jackson had to cut out some things, as it would be too long. I never liked the Bombadil chapter anyway. The movie is already 3 hours long. Yet that 3 hours went so fast by, indicates it was a well made movie and I was never bored.
The scenery is great, good actors (I like Saruman), creatures are great (Balrog!). But the best effort for me is the way they scaled the different races to the right size. I know Rhys-Davis who plays Gimli is in fact a large man, but in the movie he is ""digitaly"" shrinked to a dwarf. You can't see the difference.

1327839,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay. Now, there are two ways to look at this movie. This is the Fellowship of the Ring, part of a trilogy of movies based on a trilogy of books by one of the most famous authors ever. This is the Fellowship of the Ring, a movie about some outrageous yet still believable characters in a fantasy world, demonstrating that power can be inside even the smallest things. This is the Fellowship of the Ring, a work of cinematic masterpiece in all aspects.
I avoided viewing any trailers or sneak peeks at this movie and simply saw it opening night with my friends. I've read the Lord of the Rings series several times in my life, so I'm very familiar with the story (everyone else ""just read it a long time ago""). I knew what was happening at all times, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I knew that this was the perfect vision of Tolkein's work. While watching it, I felt as though I'd seen it before, even though I clearly hadn't.
Peter Jackson and New Line have done a beautiful job; the movie is breathtaking and stunning at every turn. I am unable to describe the idyllic beauty and the lushness of the landscapes, the painstaking care which shines through in combat sequences, nor the utter emotions felt during the two most pivotal scenes of the film. I am at a loss for words to describe anything in this movie because I am in total awe of how well it was done. I could not have asked for a more perfect live-action realization of the Fellowship of the Ring, period.
As a movie, the Fellowship of the Ring excells in all the same ways, plus some more. I cannot recall having seen better directing than was on display in this film. The acting of the not-so-big names like Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean is wondrous, in addition to the stellar performances by Sir Ian and Cate Blanchett. Set design and location sites were chosen perfectly. The vivid colors and attention to detail are fabulous and rival those of Akira Kurosawa's. Need I go on?
See this movie, for something like this will not come along again for a very long time. Not only is it a fantastic movie if you are a fan of the series (or interested in finding out what all this fuss is about), but it is also a work of art - a thing of beauty witnessed very rarely. I would give this ten stars if I could.

It exceeded all of my expectations by leaps and bounds. Direction, effects, acting, and story are all amazing. I have read the books, and the translation from book to screen is incredible. Peter Jackson and his team capture the essence of the LOTR characters beautifully. In addition to the brilliant story translation from book to movie, Tolkien's wit and humor has also been carried over wonderfully. (Which never happened in the Harry Potter movie).

Thankfully, I was wrong.
The movie IS the Lord of the Rings.  The plot follows the book amazingly well, and the deviations are well thought out.  The setting is seamlessly placed, and fits all that I had thought.  You feel like you are visiting the Shire, Moria, etc. Everyone fits their role well.  As another review mentioned, ""they ARE their characters.  The dialog is true to the spirit, and quite often the words, of the book.  The three hours go by quickly due to the excellent pacing of the scenes.  I have only one minor complaint, which will probably be rectified by the DVD's deleted scenes section.

1327843,5,B00003CWT6,"I entered the theater to see ""Fellowship of the Ring"" with mixed emotions.  On one hand, I was very afraid that one of the most beloved tales of my childhood was about to be turned into tasteles, vulgar, Hollywood pap (a feeling that was reinforced by the relentless marketing).  On the other hand, I was excited that many of my most blissful moments of day-dreaming in school (to the eternal detriment of my grades) were about to become big screen realities.
It brings me great pleasure, utter joy and some surprise to report that my first feeling was completely unfounded.
Put simply, ""Fellowship of the Rings"" is simply wonderful.  I sat for three hours, mezmorized by what was happening on the screen, many times thinking, ""this was exactly how I imagined it"", or, ""that is better than how I imagined it (particularly with regards to the orcs)"", or, ""they could not have gotten anyone better to play that role"".
I want to express my gratitude towards director Peter Jackson for taking an immensely difficult story and rendering it with such love and care.  It is quite obvious that, unlike so many directors of movies inspired by books, he absolutely loves the material and wishes to remain faithful to the intentions of the author.
At the same time, however, he displayed the wisdom to recognize that not all of Tolkien's prose, nor plot devices, would translate well to film, and the courage to alter his own work accordingly.
Jackson's courageous decision to take some liberties, adding here or cutting there, with Tolkien's masterwork was critical in making the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" soar.  For example, as much as I love ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I was very happy to see that Jackson completely dispensed with all the pages devoted to Frodo and the hobbits' stay with Tom Bombadil.  As a young child, my first attempt to read ""The Lord of the Rings"" foundered mightily in Tom's house.  Had Jackson decided to linger at Bombdadil's house himself, I suspect that the film may have foundered a bit as well, as Bombadil contributes very little to the overall plot.
Inevitably, some of Jacksons' decisions on what to add or cut will not sit well with some of Tolkien's more ardent fans.  They will inevitably generate some hate mail.  But the lack of this artistic courage is something much more frightening to contemplate.  The unwillingess to cross an author for the sake of one's film is what, in my view, rendered ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" sterile and humorless.
I could go on for hours about how great this film is, but I  recommend that you see it for yourself.  I think the vast majority of people, whether Tolkien afficionados or not, will recognize its greatness, and will come to think of it as a classic and a true film achievement.",1008806400,,2768,4.755741127348643

1327889,5,B00003CWT6,"Having just seen the film, I can highly recommend this movie to all fans of Tolkien and fantasy films alike. The film remained highly true to both the books and illustrations of Tolkien, while taking some artistic license for the sake of viewability (but not much). Visually, almost all of the film is stunning, majestic, and highly memorable. It also helps bring certain elements of the books to life that I personally had overlooked or forgotten (for example, the transformation of Saruman's tower from majestic to horrific through the destruction of the terrain and smelting).
Casting for Lord of the Rings was excellent. Christopher Lee as Saruman was a brilliant selection, as were those cast for other major parts including the Hobbits (especially Frodo), Gandalf, Gimli, and Legolas.
There were some elements missing from the books that probably should have been in the movie. One of which is the exchange between Strider and the Innkeeper (who only remembers his name because people shout it at him all day long). Another element that seems to be missing is the change in attitudes between Gimli and Legolas as they go from being natural enemies to the most unusual of friends through the trials they face in the fellowship of the Ringbearer. This element seems sadly overlooked. Other elements that were written out were probably due to time constraints and are wholly understandable (after all, the film is three hours).
Families may be intimidated to take small children, as this is a rather long story. Some of the gore is unsuitable for younger viewers (including, but not limited to, intense scenes, violent swordfights including decapitations, and horrific elements that could give children nightmares). Older children will enjoy this film, and the depiction of a struggle of good against evil is not marred by the use of adult language or sexual scenes, making this film relatively tame, considering its PG-13 rating.
Visually, this film is more in the classification of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" as opposed to ""Star Wars: Phantom Menace"" (which is what everyone apparently wants to compare it to). It lacks the speed and pace of a Star Wars movie and is much more in keeping with the feel of epic, sweeping fantasy (like ""Crouching Tiger""). One nice comment is that the film does NOT use either Bullet Time photography or martial arts (something that has become quite popular since the advent of The Matrix); the movie is true to the period depicted.
Definitely recommended.",1008806400,6,2499,5.053268765133172
1327890,4,B00003CWT6,"Staying true to it's origin, the first film of the first third of the Lord of the Rings is a powerful and visually inventive film. The battle scenes have all grit and gore that one would have come to expect. A huge improvement on Ralph Bakshi's animated travesty of the 70's, Peter Jackson manages to walk the fine line of being true to its source without pandering to the lowest common demoninator.
Jackson's film manages to combine the best elements of previous fantasy films (which have borrowed liberally from Tolkien to begin with)and the source material to create a stunning, kinetic vision. Here's hoping that he can be as faithful with the second installment and manage not to lose his audience. Oh, and that's 4 1/2 stars for the film.",1008806400,,744,4.730769230769231

I have to admit I was a little dissapointed at finding out that the part of Crickhollow and meeting Farmer Maggot was cut from the film, but then again, I, like all you other obsessed fans, have to realise that there had to be alterations to this film in order to please all audiences (and also not to make it over 6 hours long, haha).  So, keeping that in mind, this movie is as close to justifying the novel as humanly possible.  This movie sucks you into the story more than any movie I've ever watched.  When I watched it for the first time, people in the audience (I included) were sobbing aloud at times and at one point we actually applauded and cheered!

1327893,5,B00003CWT6,"I went to The Lord of the Rings with GREAT expectations. I had been waiting for months and months, and had been torturing everyone in my family and school with all the new info I got on it. I was a little afraid, though, having read so many reviews and seeing so many specials that I would know every scene to the movie. I expected to a see a masterpiece, an epic movie, awesome on all levels.
I still don't know what I got. It was anything but what I expected. It was . . . better? I don't know how, but it was so different than I imagined - sometimes I (unfortunately) pick out all the lines an actor said wrong or all the scenes the director could have done better. Too, in a case like this, I look forward to scenes in the book, and when they are edited I am dissapointed. In many of my favorite movies I have that feeling ""I LOVE this incredible movie!"" But I didn't.
After seeing the actors talk and all the reviews, nothing prepared me for this. It was more natural than I thought it would be. Something funny happened when it came on screen. I forgot about the book (yikes!), I forgot about crucial scences that actually caught me by surprise in the movie. I never thought an actor did a bad or even a good job, I just watched the realistic fantasy unfold with all the people (not characters) of Middle-Earth. It did not seem like a movie at all.
I am sure you know what the basic plot is, but let me just sum it up. Frodo, a hobbit, inherits a ring from his odd cousin Bilbo. Bilbo's old friend and advisor, Gandalf the wizard, discovers that the ring is THE one and only ruler of Middle-Earth. It holds powers too horrible to wield. So, Frodo must embark on a journey first to Rivendell where he is joined by a fellowship of 9 (including him) and then to the only place where the ring can be destroyed, in the fires of Mount Doom.
The scenery, obviously is incredible, I was SO sucked into it all. The movie is also wicked funny - It rips me apart when they put a hilarious line in a terrifying/sad scene (in a good way).
For crying out loud, this movie is SCARY! At one point I jumped 10 feet into the air screaming, and my heart didn't stop thumping furiously for another 5 minutes.
Another amazing element was the emotion. It was horribly sad on some parts (I actually cried in a fantasy movie!), and scenes like when Frodo gets stabbed tear up your heart with pity.
As for the acting, it wasn't there. The flesh and blood, the PEOPLE in it were. Elijah Wood (Frodo) was so cute and perfect. Every line he said was thought out, true, and you could identify with him in even the smallest things. Ian McKellen (Gandalf) - I loved him! He could be such a funny wizard, with quaint friendships mixed with immense power. Viggo Mortenson (Aragorn) was such a subtle and hardened character. He does not let his pride get in his way, and his sharp eyes melt to softness when he speaks to Arwen. Speaking of Arwen, Liv Tyler was so good. She was gorgeous, a vision of light, who wasn't in the movie as much as everyone feared. In fact, she was so good, I kind of missed her! Cate Blanchette (Galadriel) was even more beautiful than when I had scene her in specials and pictures. Also, she was FREAKY! First she was scary, then terrifying, then kind and wise. Wow! Since we're speaking of elves, Hugo Weaving (Elrond) was wonderful. In his younger years he looked great, and it was so interesting seeing his distrust of men, considering he was half human.
The hobbits. Ian Holm was a perfectly friendly and frightening Bilbo, and Sean Austin (Sam) was so wonderful. He was not especially bright, but he just had this love and loyalty for Frodo that no one could ever shake off. I really liked Merry, played by Dominic Monaghan. He was fun loving, but a fairly wise hobbit. And Billy Boid (Pippin) was great! He was suitably foolish and sometimes just watching his face made you laugh.
As for the others, I'll begin with Sean Bean's portrayal of Boromir. And I'll end it there - he was so touching, proud, and pitiable I don't even want to think about it. Christopher Lee (Saruman) had THE voice and personality of Saruman. John Rhys-Davis was a rather funny and feisty dwarf. And finally, Orlando Bloom (HOT HOT HOT - Legolas) did a remarkable job. This ""young"" elf was so amazing. He was deadly in battle, he is so brave in the sight of most danger, and yet when the Balrog comes, the expression on his face is extremely alarming. He is the most scared of all of them (save Gandalf, who is preparing himself), for he knows well what a Balrog is. Orlando Bloom expresses his emotions through subtle and tender expressions.
I don't know. See it yourself.",1008806400,3,4656,4.377598152424942
1327894,5,B00003CWT6,"I caught the late night showing on opening day.  Being one who has read the books dozens of times, I'd expected to be a little more critical of it than most people, but I was blown away.  There were a few minor quibbles over minor changes, like the somewhat silly fight between Gandalf and Saruman, but there were NO complaints about casting or visual effects.  I have never seen a more powerful representation of pure evil than this film's interpretations of Sauron, the Nazgul, and the Balrog.  I would be FAR more terrified to meet one of those beings than of any villain in a traditional horror film!
Kudos to Ian McKellan, Elijah Wood, and Cate Blanchett for bringing their characters to life so powerfully.  If they don't get at least Oscar Nominations, then I'll know once and for all that the Oscars aren't worth watching.",1008806400,,830,4.657534246575342
1327895,5,B00003CWT6,This was a very good movie. It has alot of action at the begining. It is pretty violent. It is not gory. It is not scary. See this movie! It Rules!,1008806400,,147,3.774193548387097
1327896,5,B00003CWT6,"I found myself going to see it the first day, drawn almost against my will - I intended to wait until later. Overall, it was a fantastic and very scary experience, with explosive special effects and fine acting to boot. My favorites include Virgo Mortensen, practically an embodiment of true nobility as Aragorn, and Sean Bean as Boromir - exactly as headstrong and temptation-wracked as I imagined him. McKellen is a perfect Gandalf, powerful and mysterious at once, yet also with a distinct sense of humor (""a wizard is never late, he always arrives when he means to""). Elijah Wood as Frodo is sensitive and expressive with those now-famous eyes, but doesn't get to do much; then again, Frodo's personal epic really begins with ""Two Towers"". Gimli (the unrecognizable John Rhys-Davies) is mostly comic relief, as are Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan), with some exceptions closer to the end.
Since I couldn't care less about Bombadil and was relieved to see Arwen as a strong female character (so what she wasn't like that in the book, this is better - you can actually see Middle-Earth with your own eyes), I didn't have problems with Jackson's necessary editing of the source material. Besides, with the exception of the prologue, which, by the way, is spectacular, Arwen is the movie's first elf. Seeing her in a white halo, coming to Frodo's rescue, was a revelation for me.
Legolas (Orlando Bloom) is amazing in combat, e.g. impaling an uruk-hai with a thrust of an arrow, then immediately firing it from his bow, and really puts the panache back into being an elf, which is very welcome after the long reign of miserable [attempts] such as AD&D. Jackson made sure he has every bit of elven grace and balance, as well. For example, just as in the book, Legolas treads easily over Caradhras snowdrifts without sinking. Generally, the fight scenes are well-done, my favorite being the skirmish with the cave troll in the depths of Moria, although close-ups are a little abused, so that sometimes it's hard to make out what is what. There aren't any episodes of fine fencing, but a lot of very realistic and inspiring, no-nonsense slashing, albeit almost entirely bloodless. Still, battles are abundant (sometimes even too much so, in my opinion) and impressive. To me, the most memorable moment came when whole broods of orcs began streaming down Moria's walls and pillars, chasing after the Fellowship like a stream of filthy grey roaches. Camera work is unobtrusive, but sure, throughout, and digitally enhanced.
I only have two significant problems with the movie, and the second one is not Jackson's fault. The flaw I do blame him for is the Lorien episode: quite so-so, practically bare of any sense of atmosphere beyond the opening sequence when a glimse of the city is given, as though thrown in to fill in the gaps. Worse, I found Jackson's represenation of Galadriel lacking. She appears cloaked in light, which is repetitive, since Arewen has benefitted from the same effect, and she is never quite coherent, the idea being, apparently, a woman of mystery. Fine by me, but she intones a few too many riddles to be met with anything but annoyance. I imagined her majestic, not addled. The Mirror part had been completely ruined: too fast, leaving out important visions - in certain cases, to avoid revealing too much about the sequels, in others, for reasons unknown: where is Minas Tirith, opposed by Minas Morgul? Would it be so hard to give us a glimpse? Also, by this point we've been introduced to so many special effects that the vision of Galadriel as Dark Queen which follows fails to summon up any thrills.
Which is the general complaint: the movie is rather hard to take. Even knowing the source material, I recommend you leaf through ""The Fellowship"" before seeing it. While never obscure, the film does refer to places which are not, or barely, shown. Gondor, for instance: at most a second of it is given, but the place is mentioned once in a while, likely to non-fans' confusion. The same goes for Elvish: subtitles are given in all the important cases, which incidentally serves to ""authenticate"" them, but little tidbits here and there escape understanding, leaving one with a ""Damn I should have learned Quenya"" feeling.
By the same token, and it's generally a good thing, the picture is crammed with events. There is hardly any breathing space between cliffhangers, all of which are so brilliant and sparkle with special effects as to leave you stupefied and bedazzled by the end of the second hour. By the time Saruman's uruk-hai attack, you've seen the balrog, the Caradhras blizzard and the battle on Weathertop, and it's hard to bring yourself to care. There's just too much of excitement and information to absorb in one sitting. Jackson cannot be blamed for this, though: intensity is a consequence of LOTR's length, and he has translated it from one medium to another better than anyone could hope. The movie is sizzling with beauty and power, hence the difficulty: it's almost too blinding in its brilliance.

1327897,5,B00003CWT6,"The Lord of Rings is one of two huge, expensive, fantasy book adaptations coming out this year.  The other being Harry Potter.  I saw Harry Potter and loved and went into The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) with decent expectations, never expecting it to match Harry Potter.  For the record, it runs circles around Harry Potter, trips him, and rubs his lighting-scarred face in the mud... twice.  This film exceeded my expectations by such an astounding degree.  Seeing the film was like reading the book again.  The images on screen directly reflected the images in my head from the book.  This is attributed mainly to Peter Jackson and his entire production crew at New Line.  It was, for the most part, perfect.  The visuals in Harry Potter look like Gameboy when placed next to LOTR's breathtaking effects.  The acting is superb (even Liv Tyler and Sean Bean are incredible!), Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen being the high points.  Easily besting Harry Potter and possibly the best fantasy film since Star Wars.  In fact, I'll go as far as to call it the next Star Wars.  Go see it at all costs.",1008806400,,1090,4.643979057591623
1327898,5,B00003CWT6,"So now we finally have Lord of the Rings the film as well as the book. Which is better?
The book. It is THE BIBLE of fantasy, Tolkien was not the greatest writer of the 20th Century, but Lord of the Rings is possibly the finest fantasy book in history, it inspired a whole new genre of literary, cinematic and gaming fantasy and has given pleasure to millions.
So what of the film? Well, firstly to make a carbon copy of the book would have been an unwise move, it just wouldn't translate, Tolkien had no intention of the book being realised on the big screen, in fact he hated the idea.
The film is simply stunning, the star of the film, as with the book is the landscape and geography. It must be remembered that Lord of the Rings is a single tale, (all beit an epic one), set in Middle Earth, a place rich in cultures, languages, art and racial differences. Unlike other fantasies, (and I include Star Wars in this), no other fantasy world contains as much background and support material. In one sense this will have helped all those involved in ""researching"" for the film, in another sense it is a hinderance, avid fans can recite many passages of the book as a mantra, so when changes have been made to the text this has been the cause of much critisism. However, if you are a fan and think of the film as an adaptation rather than a verbatim clone of Tolkien's book then there isn't much to complain about, critisism has been mixed; too long, too short, too heavy, too lightweight...I think those people miss the point, this film is for both the fan and the newcomer and on both accounts it satisfies.
Can I be cruel and attempt to find fault? not really, but here are my unfair critisisms, Lothlorien was too dark in lighting and atmosphere and the scaling of the hobbits and dwarves sometimes wasn't entirely convincing.
Is that my critisism? Well, yeah, picky or what! Tiny details that I really struggled to find, from the start of the film part of me wanted to find fault but it was so dammned difficult.
Yes bits were cut, but three films of eight hours each is a non-starter, not to mention an extra 100 million to add those sequences, maybe a slightly longer editors cut might appear on the DVD version, that would be the icing on the cake.
But, at the end of the day, if you want a clone of the book then just read the damn book and forget the film, but if you are someone who enjoys first rate fantasy, and are willing to sacrifice some sub-plots then go see it, personally I think the book meandered in some parts and the film benefits from most of the ""prunining"".
If you've never read the book, go see the film. If you do read any book after watching it, one of the first you'll buy will be The Lord of the Rings.
Both are masterpieces.",1008806400,,2756,4.353398058252427
1327929,2,B00003CWT6,"Disapointment?  Nobody really expected an epic of such power and scope to be faithfully reproduced on screen.  So I walked in making an effort to be open-minded.  I've worn out one copy of LOTR in hardback and who knows how many in paperback.  I'm one of the biggest Tolkien heads around.  I wanted this to be stupendous, yet I was doubtful.  It turns out I was overly optimistic.
Okay, the movies is cheesy, uneven, and disjointed.  I doubt that anyone could follow the plot had they not read the book repeatedly.  And the characterizations!  That was Aragorn?  Hardly.  Frodo and Sam were acceptable.  I liked Gandalf, even though a lot was missing there.  But where is the hidden nobility and power of Aragorn?  These qualities are not hidden in the movie, they are lost.  Elrond was not true to the book, but awesome nonetheless.  And what is Borimir?  He was not the nobleman Tolkien portrayed.  Did anyone figure out what he was?
I could go on and on, but the real crime is Lothlorien and Galadriel.  Did anyone come away from the movie with the feel that Galadriel is the high queen of the elves who lives in a timeless land of peace and beauty?  I guess I missed it.
Arwen combined with Glorfindel?  I swallowed that one.  It was early on in the movie.
I truly missed Tom Bombadil.  His elimination was saddning.  And what happened to the Sword of Elendil?!
Then there was Sauron.  What was up with that?  Sauron is the mysterious, unseen symbol of total evil.  I didn't expect to see him in the flesh, much less as a central character.  The eye was good.  At least at times.
I don't think anyone could have produced a physical reality that would resemble to Tolkien's Middle Earth.  But the movie was hardly faithful to the spirit.  Tolkien's Shire was a fastidiously neat place, a vast parkland that was quite tame and completely gentled to the hand of hobbit kind.  The Shire of the movie was true to medivial England perhaps, but it hardly reflected my image of the Shire.  Location were portrayed more grandiose than described, such as Rivendell, or too plain, as was the gate of Moria.  Moria was fair, but I'd hoped for better.  Every place seemed slightly derilict in the movie.  I didn't get that from the book.  Hmmm...
Finally, I'd rather have seen less action and more explanation throughout the movie.  Much was left out that was needful to support the later story.  Much was left out that was needful to support this story!  But instead, we were shown a confusing and unneccessary battle between Gandalf and Saruman, and a silly scene of peril on the stairs leading from the Chamber of Mazarbul.  Okay, the whole bit about the Chamber of Mazarbul was silly.
I guess I could go on forever.  But in closing, if the second installment isn't a significant improvement, I doubt I'll ever see the final installment.

I have watched about 150 movies this year (mostly DVD's) and this is without question one of the most impressive movies I've seen this year.

1327934,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay, listen to me....do not see this film.
Really, do not see this film.  BECAUSE...if you do....you'll end up watching the most astounding, beautiful, superbly acted fantasy adventure film EVER.  The world of Middle Earth in this film is so vividly portrayed and so gorgeous to watch and experience that you'll swear you were in the film.  And the acting, the casting...wow.  Everyone is just so...GOOD!  Honest.  And the block-busting length of 3 hours for this film will fly by so fast that you'll wonder where the time went.  By the end of the film, I was begging for more. (What? That can't be all! Please, just another 10 minutes, pleeeease!!!)
So why shouldn't you see this film?  Because if you love movies as much as I do, it will drive you CRAZY to have to wait another 12 months for the next installment of the Lord of the Rings.  I absolutely fell in love with this film, and I haven't even read any of the 3 books (ok, well, I did read the Hobbit about 15 years ago...) and I usually find fantasy films to be weak (remember the Dungeon and Dragons film a year ago?).  So, I'm just trying to save you from insanity, that's all.  For those who are old enough to remember Empire Strikes Back back in 1980, remember the anguish and agony of waiting THREE years for the next Star Wars film to find out what happened next?  Well, same thing here.  At least it's only one year, but those days will take a loooong time. Perhaps this may even be blasphemous to say, but I think the Lord of the Ring films will, in time, match if not surpass the Star Wars movies in popularity.  Frankly, this film is better than any of the Star Wars films, and I love those films, so I know what I'm talking about.  And Harry Potter?  Hah....doesn't even compare, and I love the Harry Potter books, too!
So please, spare yourself the misery and don't see this breath-taking movie.  Of course, you won't listen to me and you'll be GLAD you didn't...but you'll also be soooo sad (another year to wait? Noooooo.....)",1008806400,20,2001,4.4532967032967035

Scenes such as Rivendel and the Shire are filled with the same joy that I experienced when reading Tolkien's work.  The darker scenes (Isengard, Moria) capture the sheer horror with the same exactness.  My only complaint about the movie is that I have to wait a year to see the Two Towers!",1008806400,6,464,4.4

1327958,3,B00003CWT6,"Well..its exactly 20 min since I left the theater.  I must say, it was a good effort. Great action sequences..true moments of suspence, likeable characters, it was very good..though not great however.  When the main characters weren't running for their lives...the story dragged a bit..some of the dialogue was a bit on the...shall we say, cheesy side.  But, its the action sequences that keep this film afloat.  As for individual performances Ian Mckellar does a good job of bringing some vulnerability to Gandolph...and the man playing Bilbo adds a touch of creepiness to him that sure wasn't there in the cartoon. I also thought that Viggo Mortensen was very good as well as Cate Blanchett  and Liv Tyler. Sadly, its hard to be a standout when playing the hero of a story, though Elijah at least has screen presence.
The pitfalls of the film however I feel are how to keep the audience engaged in the characters when they are not in peril.  I have the feeling that, had I been a huge fan of the books and read them before hand...I would have enjoyed this film a bit more. But seeing as I haven't  , I must say I liked the characters..but did not love them.  So, that when a crucial cast memeber dies well....I didn't take it quite so hard. But, it is a huge task to ask to build repor when dealing with a huge novel and a long story ..to ask for more would prob require an extra hour of viewing time.and that is a touch unreasonable seeing as the film already clocks in on three hours.
AS for technical merits. I was not impressed with the cinematography that much..and the Cgi rendering wasn't that great. The stereo sound was decent..but I will say that the surrouind sound in the film was just incredible.  but otherwise, technically, Id have to say George Lucas would win that battle. But mr jackson admitted he purposely didn't go overboard with the special effects so as not to overshadow the story...a tip that mr lucas could benefit from(judging by the star wars ep 2 trailer).
All in all..for a movie as highly anticipated as this one was...its not by any means a total letdown. Granted..i was not totally blown away as I'd hoped I'd be..but I cant sya that I didn't enjoy the film..and I have a sneaking suspicion when its available on dvd that ill be in line to get it too.  So, good but not great, but worth the price of admission.  However...heh, I still say mr jackson's best directorial effort is Meet the Feebles  *wink*...no hobbit can top Garden of Love- A.N.",1008806400,5,2480,4.548314606741573
1327959,2,B00003CWT6,"A huge cinematic disappointment.  The movie is entirely too long -- and the first 1.5 hours almost put me to sleep.  There were way too many cheezy sentimatal moments that didn't advance the plot enough to warrant their inclusion.  I can't believe that this film is getting so much hype (and some Golden Globe nominations), and moreover, that they have already filmed the next two.  Whoever agreed to the $300 Million pricetag for all three movies should be fired.",1008806400,,464,4.8354430379746836
1327960,5,B00003CWT6,"I figured this movie would be fun, well-done, and a great companion to the book.  I hoped it would be able to stand alone; I hoped it wouldn't require the book to be enjoyable; I hoped above all that PJ would stay true to the feel of the books, and not succomb Hollywood (shades of Harry Potter).  It blew me away.  It was EASILY the best fantasy/sci fi movie I have ever seen.  It was probably the best movie (that's such a hard thing for me to decide, though...whenever I say ""My all-time favourite movie is..."" I end up with three or four!).
Let me just say first: Ian McKellen is God.  (Viggo and Orlando are minor deities--despite being a long-time member of the Aragorn Fan Club, I have to say that Legolas is giving him a run for his money!)  The reviewer who said, ""Ian McKellen doesn't appear in this movie.  Gandalf does"" got it dead on.  If he doesn't get an Oscar, I'll never watch the Oscars again.
To me, there were two things that made this a great movie as opposed to a good one.  First, I don't remember the last time I was so into a movie that I shrieked in fright.  But I did at one particulary frightening point in this movie (and I wasn't the only one!).  Second, and more important, there were SEVERAL times (and for extended periods) when I was completely, totally immersed in the MOVIE.  I was not watching the book translated onto the screen; I was watching the MOVIE.  I don't think I can give Peter Jackson and company much higher praise than that.
Now, I don't think the movie was perfect.  It took me a few minutes to get used to the hobbit-size thing, right at the beginning.  I don't think it was badly done, though: I think it was just hard to get used to seeing miniature people!  I wanted to smack Liv Tyler.  She's a decent enough actress, but I thought she really paled in comparison with the other acting.  Also, I have to admit, I said a year and a half ago that I was afraid I would see her riding in the movie, and only be able to think, ""She's riding a barrel,"" and I was right.  Now, I'm sure I've seen plenty of other movies where the character wasn't really riding, and liked 'em, but I just couldn't do it here.
Most of the CGI was great, but there were a few exceptions.  The thing about CGI is that it is SO EASY to point out when it's bad...but most good CGI you never notice because you don't KNOW it's CGI!  How much of the lighting in that movie was CGI?  How many of the mountains?  How many miniscule details?  We'll never know--and THAT'S the good part.  Now, obviously, I knew that Moria was computer generated.  But it certainly looked like they had carved it out of a cave in New Zealand somewhere.  (The fire in Moria was the BEST CGI fire I've ever seen--in fact, I think that maybe they DID set a cave on fire! :D)  I think I'm going to go to NZ and look for the Pillars of the Argonath, as I'm fairly sure that they really did carve those out of a mountain beside a river somewhere.
Everything else...was AWESOME.  I was dreading some of the compaction, but I thought it turned out fine.  Peter Jackson captured one last thing in this movie that is too often lacking in today's movies: FEELING.  I was happy, I was sad, I was angry, I was scared.
The score was a bonus here.  Shore captured the feelings of the moments PERFECTLY (he'd better get an Oscar, too).  The music was old and new at the same time--amazing, and just what was needed.  He didn't SHOVE emotion at the viewers/listeners, he merely echoed and enhanced it.
The Black Riders...whoa.  Talk about the stuff nightmares are made of.  Their screams were GREAT.  Their screams were AWFUL.  I wanted to run out of the theatre and hide and never hear that again.  They terrified me, even though I knew what was going to happen.
Saruman's orcs running through the woods...I considered crawling under my chair (movies do not usually do that to me!--at least not for prolonged periods of time).  I desperately wanted things to go completely differently than the book, just so the orcs would go away!
THAT is what makes this a great movie.  It's NOT the book, but it has the SPIRIT of the book and it ENGAGED me--even though I can recite the book from memory.  It truly did exceed my expectations.
Am I saying that the movie is better than the book?  Of COURSE not.  To me, though, it is absolutely, 100% AS GOOD AS the book.  It is different, to be sure, but that does not make it a bad movie.  It's written for fans and newcomers, and both can enjoy it and relish their 3 hour trip to Middle Earth.
Bottom line: It's not perfect (what is?), but I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!",1008806400,128,4591,4.323185011709602
1327961,5,B00003CWT6,"Okay, I admit it!  I'm a Lord of the Rings geek!  There!  I've said it.  Whew.  I've read the original LOTR books so many times that I've gone through three printings (starting with a 1960's and going to the most recent printings with artistry by Alan Lee).  I feel somewhat qualified (that's a large word here: 'qualified') to review and rate this movie.  So here we go:
The story is that of Frodo Baggins and his quest to get rid of the one ruling Ring of power that was forged by Sauron, the Dark Lord.  The Fellowship of the Ring is formed once a small band of Hobbits reach Rivendell (run by a half elf lord named Elrond).  Here Frodo, Samwise, Merry and Pippin (the Hobbits) are joined by Gandalf (a wizard), Gimli (a dwarf), Legolas (an Elf), Aragorn (a Ranger formerly known as Strider), and Boromir (a man).  They set out to help Frodo on his quest to throw the ring into the fires of Mount Doom and along the way are thrown into every fiery mess one could imagine (or maybe not).  At the end, the Fellowhip is in a shambles but that's no surprise considering the power of this Ring: it turns all around it to greed and dishonor.
The movie itself.  I'm sure that there will be much talk about what is lacking in the movie that was in the book.  But one cannot expect every facet of a book to enter into a screenplay.  The movie would have been 13 hours long then!  So let's take a brief glimpse at what was lacking and why:
#1:  In the book it is Bilbo's AND Frodo's birthday party (they have the same B-Day), but in the movie it it just Bilbo's.  This is not surprising since later, there is no mention of Frodo coming into his 'inheritance' because he was coming of age (33 to Bilbo's Eleventy-One).  No big deal there.
#2:  Some characters are completely omitted for times sake and this was not a problem since they didn't play pivotal roles later.  Notably there is no Labelia who buys Bag-End, no showing of old man Maggot and his mushroom farm, no Glorfindel meeting up with the travelers on the road to Rivendell.  There are more but I will dive no further into it.  These omissions were acceptable and expected in my mind.
#3:  The development of Old Bill, the Horse that faithfully lugs their wares (up til he is presumed dead at the entrance to the Mines of Moria) is never brought forward.  Oh well.
#4:  Galadriel gives only one gift (to Frodo) when the Fellowship leaves Lothlorien.  No surprise there since the light of Galadriel will be used later in future movies.  But the gifts given to the other members of the Fellowship is never addressed.  Not surprising since they don't play a role later.
Now.  What was good?  Well....almost everything.  There is something in the movie for everyone.  There are small tidbits that Mr. Jackson (the director) left in for LOTR diehard fans that I absolutely loved.  Notably, during Bilbo's birthday party you'll see Bilbo telling a story to children-hobbits about his adventures during the original, 'The Hobbit,' when he meets up with Trolls and they're turned to stone by the sun.  Then, later in the movie, if you watch closely, you'll see the Fellowship hiking by large boulders....what was that out of the corner of my eye?  That looked somewhat like a statue of a...a...troll?
Also, when Galadriel holds all of the Fellowship with her gaze there is no hint as to what exactly is going on there, but those who are the diehard fans will know, won't we.  I might have a bit of LOTR blasphemy here, but I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Jackson's development of the friendship of Frodo and Samwise (even better than Tolkien himself did!  Blasphemy!).
The film is completely satisfying in my humble opinion.  The shrinking down of the Hobbits and Gimli is masterfully done.  The sets are dark and mysterious, just as I'd pictured them (for this is a dark story).  The first ten minutes of the movie is crucial to those who've never read the LOTR books, since it gives a detailed history of Middle Earth.  And the movie leaves us wanting more.  The worst part, for me, will be waiting another year for the next installment in the excellent series.  I can hardly wait!",1008806400,25,4123,4.529810298102981
1327962,5,B00003CWT6,"After seeing Harry Potter (which I found do be a dreadfully long mishmash of thrown togther scenes) I was skeptical about what was being done with LoR.
  I saw the movie last night, and my skepticism was put to rest. It needs to be said first that even the greatest of movies can not match up to the experiences of the greatest books. So this movie needs to be evaluated at the level of movies and not the level of the book from which was based.
  As a movie it succeeds while maintaining a faithful adherence to Tolkien's original story.
  The movie is amazing visually, from a moth in one shot to the Balrog to the forests and mountains. I was hoping for more from the musical score. I didn't find it particularly memorable or even totally appropriate. Sometimes the tone of the music clashed subtley with the mood of the scene, but overall it was an adequate though not amazing job.
  There are a few instances of distracting editing and stilted if not unnecessary lines of dialogue--and I wish Gimly would have gotten to use his axe more--but overall this is an excellent picture.

1327963,4,B00003CWT6,"As a Tolkein geek since about age six, I was, overall, impressed by Peter Jackson's take on Lord of the Rings. Most of what he did I liked a great deal. There was only one thing I REALLY DIDN'T like: his interpretation of Galadriel and the scene at her mirror, which Jackson turned into some _Craft_-like evil witch nonsense. I always imagined Galadriel's reflections on what would happen if she took the one ring to be much quieter in tone, with almost a wry self-knowledge. I had expected this would be conveyed with acting rather than FX, and I found that the way it was done diminished the power of the scene.
If the movie had a general fault it was that certain things were just overblown. It was almost as if Jackson felt he had to point out significant events, rather than let them point themselves out. Some of the lingering, slow motion went on too long. Both times Frodo was wounded, Boromir's death and Sam's near drowning stick out for me as places where I thought the pace lagged and the story verged on the melodramatic. There were also a few places where Jackson inserted action that I definitely hadn't imagined, which gave the whole a kind of video game feel. I thought at first that this represented the difference between a woman's take on Tolkein;'s work and a ""guy's"" -- probably 75% of the theatre audience was male -- but my husband agreed with me, so I don't know. Just a dfference in vision, I guess.
Some of the cuts and substitutions, though necessary, bothered me. I missed the journey through the Shire. I REALLY missed Tom Bombadil, and I'm unsure about the substitution of Arwen for Glorfindel. The action between Bilbo's party and the arrival at Rivendell seemed rushed. I think the fact that there were 15 years or so between Frodo's inheritance of the ring and his leaving the Shire was an important one, and Jackson just ignored it. I also think that the ""conspiracy"" between Merry, Pippin and Sam was a major contribution both to the story and to the three younger Hobbits' characters, and I was sorry that it wasn't included. As Jackson portrayed it, Merry and Pippin ended up going along to Bree and farther completely by accident and that didn't work so well for me.
On the plus side: this movie looked FANTASTIC! Some of the scenes were obviously built from Tolkein's own drawings. The Shire, the mines of Moria, the Pillars of the Kings all were unbelievably real. I can't say enough about how incredible the look was; it just blew me away, which doesn't happen often. The cast was also incredible. The only one who didn't really meet my expectations was, surprsingly, Christopher Lee; I expected Saruman to be more suave and oily. The rest were phenomenal, though, particularly Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) and Ian McKellen (Gandalf). I also thought Elijah Wood did a fine job showing Frodo's transformation from a rather happy-go-lucky hobbit to one forced by circumstance to carry an incredible burden.
I was consistently amazed when I realised that none of these actors was a little person, but that all the size differences were done with CG. The CG environments were also amazing; if this movie doesn't win at least one award I'll be shocked.
_Fellowship of the Ring_ kept me on the edge of my seat for its entire three hours. (I would actually give it four and a half stars if I could.) I think it will stand the scrutiny of most exacting Tolkein afficianados. Go see it.",1008806400,2,3416,4.666666666666667
1327964,2,B00003CWT6,"Many of the comments that will be posted here will be from lifelong devotees of the 'Lord of the Rings' books, attesting to whether the film succeeds in recreating characters, places and events they have read a hundred times over.  But what about the rest of us, those who have somehow managed to survive adolescence without the help of Tolkien's epic goblindegook?  Is there anything for us to enjoy?
Well, it often looks beautiful, more so when it concentrates on New Zealand's unexpectedly wondrous and vast landscapes, less so when it relies on CGI effects which, though superior to those in 'Harry Potter', still look like effects.  There are some quite breathtakingly artful compositions, often resembling Pre-Raphaelite paintings of Arthurian subject matter, such as the hazy, dawnpink scene when Frodo and chums boat away from Cate Blanchett.  There is a willingness (if not ability) to be humorous that is refreshing.
Peter Jackson, to his eternal credit, avoids one of two cardinal sins of the 'historical' epic: pace.  Almost without exception, the epic is always ground down to an enervatingly slow pace, as much to show off the results of a big budget (sets, masses of men etc.) as to create an appropriately solemn atmosphere.  Here enormous battles and endless sets flash be in tantalising seconds; Jackson exhaustively uses as many different, arresting camera angles and movements and editing techniques to vary the cinematography and keep the film moving as briskly as possible.
Sadly, he is defeated by the second cardinal sin of the 'historical' epic: script.  There's nothing he can do with the risible, cod-medieval dialogue and monologues that destroy all credibility ('And I with mine axe!' 'But we shall meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the glade of Ebeneezer, mine loyal vassal' etc.).  He can't hide the fact that every plot development - quest, picaresque gathering of friends, wise Obi-Goondolph-Kenobi guide, hero nearly dying, idyllic period of recuperation etc. - has been done to death a thousand times over the millenia, most notably in 'Star Wars'.  He can't cover over the confusing and too-speedy opening exposition and explanation of the quest's context, which made the plot (for me) often mystifying, and can alienate anyone who hasn't read the book.  He can't quite avoid the pitfall of unintentional humour: when one character is stabbed with three arrows he continues to fight the hordes bravely, I was irresistably reminded of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', and the scene where Arthur lops off every limb of a knight who gamely refuses to give in.
On the other hand, the Darth Maul/Golem figure who becomes the ultimate tool of the enemy, suggests Maori culture, which in the context of the New Zealand locations is interesting; and, combined with the sly visual sublimation of taboo dsire in this homosocial fellowship (all these towering constructions and statues; all those ravines, pits and passages), suggests that Jackson has lost none of his sardonic subversiveness.
In summary: 'Fellowship' is an Arthurian/Narnian/Robin Hoodian/Wagnerian hodgepodge with Ray Harryhausen-type monsters.  These latter, including a 'Shrek'-lookalike ogre, are more nostalgically endearing than frightening.",1008806400,7,3242,5.3125
1327965,5,B00003CWT6,"As we pull up to the theater, the line stretches out into the parking lot. The people are filled with restless, nervous anticipation, talking quietly amongst themselves. Fortunately Dallas has arrived early and I find my place saved at the head of the line. The air almost crackles with the intensity, a murmur passes through the crowd when at last the doors are unlocked and the restless viewers begin to forge inside. Our tickets are purchased, our seats are found; eventually the trailers begin. The theater is packed, all 900 seats.
After being plagued with Spiderman and a terrible Austen Powers spin-off, the screen fades to darkness. We shudder with a sudden thrill as the voice-over, the voice we would learn to acknowledge as that of Queen Galadriel, begins the story of the Ring, its forging in the Mountains of Doom, its empowerment by the Dark Lord... and its keepers. We are swept into a story unlike any other, a story of many characters and places, of much depth and insight; but also a story of elves and dwarves, humans and hobbits. A story that has earned itself rightfully the title of ""book of the century.""
In the three hours that come about, we laugh, we cry, we are scared absolutely out of our wits. The time flies by without hesitation or fear, plunging ahead into Middle Earth with incredible aerial shots and stunning cinematography. The audience is in awe of the elves, terrified by the Cave Troll, grossed-out by the birth of an Orc from the depths of the ground itself; they gasp in fear as Gandalf is suddenly attacked by an unexpected enemy; they cheer when Arwen brings down the flood upon the dark riders; they draw back in surprise and sudden fear at the temptation of Galadriel. All breaths are drawn in as one when the enemy infiltrates the Prancing Pony, and let out in a roar when an Orc is defeated.
And then, as the screen fades to black and the credits role, it begins. One clap here, another there, until it breaks forth into thundering applause. The audience who was wowed with Gladiator, who shunned The Patriot, who stood in awe of The Matrix, have discovered for the first time the spellbinding storytelling of Tolkien... and the absolute magic at the fingertips of the filmmakers. As I exit the theater, I hear many things... words such as ""incredible,"" ""awesome,"" ""cool"" ... and ""Oscar."" The words that will spread from lips into ears across the nation and send Lord of the Rings into a complete and total bock office success.
But it is only later that the true test of the film begins; it endures in discussion over a late (very late!) luncheon at Chili's. All aspects are explored, from the hideousness of the Orcs to the angelic tendencies of the elves, even a character's intentional sacrifice for another. The Ring is deeply studied from every aspect, its character even more powerfully drawing than that of Frodo or Gandalf. All are in agreement -- that the film is a masterpiece. As we gather up our things and bid farewell, we leave with only one thought in mind...
Tolkien would have approved.",1008806400,15,3051,4.704672897196262
1327966,5,B00003CWT6,"The first installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" is quite simply an incredible accomplishment.  Considering how difficult it would be to satisty people new to the story as well as people who have read the books multiple times, Peter Jackson should be given the keys to the kingdom.
I won't get into the plot.  If you've read the books, you know it; if you haven't, see the movie.  I will say that the film succeeds on every level I can think of.  You feel like you are really watching real people (and other creatures) in a real place.  The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.  The costumes, acting, settings, props, weapons, language...everything is in place.
Having said that, will ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" be all things to all people?  No.  I imagine some will think that too much has been left out and that too much attention has been placed on action.  If you've read the books, I think you will agree that Jackson has kept the action moving much more than in the book.  What Jackson has left out as far as details of the journey and character background _I_ think are enough to keep the film interesting without slowing it down.
I think people will be talking about this film for a long, long time.  I saw several groups of people standing around talking about the film after it was over.  They all seemed to love it. The film will probably send more people to the book, which is great, since this is one of the great works not just of fantasy, but of 20th century literature.  The film will almost certainly be nominated for many awards and deservedly so.  This holiday season, treat yourself to a grand adventure.",1008806400,3,1628,4.549828178694158

The story involves Frodo Baggins and his inheritance of a magic ring (by Bilbo Baggins who found the ring) forged by a dark Lord in a fiery mountain - Mt. Doom.  Frodo's life is in constant danger and he must climb to the top of Mt. Doom and throw it into the fiery pit in order to destroy it.  The dark Lord's spirit is drawn to the ring - searching for Frodo and his companions to claim it and use its power to send darkness throughout the entire of Middle-Earth.  3 other hobbits, a wizard named Gandalf, en Elf, a dwarf and 2 humans join Frodo as companions to destroy the ring and thus are given the title ""Fellowship of the Ring.""
This movie was unbelieveably excellent in every way.  The characters had immeasurable depth and the action sequences were some of the best I've seen in a long time.  It uses alot of computer animation and it only complemented, rather than detracted from, the story.  I found that I was taken into this world as much as the characters were and it felt like I was walking with them as they ventured throughout Middle-Earth.  The monsters in the film are quite nasty and this is why the movie received a PG-13 rating - I wouldn't recommend young children seeing this movie.  I will admit I've never read any of Tolkien's books but this movie has me very intrigued.  The length of the film is 3 hours but you'd never know it - it felt like a 2 hour film or less!
I cannot think of any drawbacks in this film - not a single thing.  This movie is beyond excellent and will be an instant classic - it's a diamond in the rough.",1008806400,2,1683,4.32484076433121
1328017,5,B00003CWT6,"As a long-time Tolkien Fan and a person who has read The Trilogy three times, I must say I was absolutely astounded and captivated by the new Tolkien movie, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""
I am very proud of the Producers, Directors, Actors, et al !  It seemed as-if everyone had read the trilogy and understood their parts, not just memorized lines form a script.  The scenes were amazing!  Hobbiton has been brought to life in a way I really did not believe could be accomplished on film.  The Shire lives and breathes and will inspire thousands of people to read Tolkien's works.
This film series brings the world of Tolkien to the big screen and into people's homes like never before.  This is wonderful!  I had to sneak the books home and hide them under the bed & pretend to be reading something-else, so my Mom wouldn't catch me.  Now, teenagers can just sneak out for a night of Magick and Adventure.
I was a bit disappointed with the portrayal of the male elves--they seemed to be a bit too ""human"" and less ethereal (and wise) than they are portrayed in the books.  However, over-all, I believe this movie portrays the characters in the Trilogy better than most people can imagine.
Luckily, the film is more fast-paced than the Trilogy, and most of the important scenes are retained.  However, I still believe reading the Trilogy is crucial to understanding the film (and who wants to wait an entire year for the next chapter, so to speak?).  This film will bring a whole new generation to the world of Tolkien (and, Hopefully, a new generation of Book-Lovers).
I am so impressed with this film, that I have nothing negative to say, whatsoever.....and this coming from someone who's Wife quoted Tolkien on our Wedding Invitations !",1008806400,3,1762,4.65483870967742
1328018,1,B00003CWT6,"VIEWER BEWARE: This movie is three hours long. Not three hours of enjoyable movie viewing, but three hours of CRAP! Do not believe the good reviews, or see the movie because of the trailers, like I did! The good scenes, are there, but for three minutes at a time, for about ummm, 15 minutes total. So, there are 2 hours and 45 minutes of boring movie I had to sit through.
Also, the visual effects are good. Jurassic Park 3 and Godzilla kind of good though, because the plot isn't THERE! There are impressive scenes of Mount Doom (?) and of the general landscape, and mildly decent battle scenes.
I felt like yelling ""GOTH ALIVE!"" when I saw some of the characters though. Imagine the kid in all black working at Blockbuster or Kmart, take their personality and dress, and you have a Lord of the Rings character. The Elves and Rangers fit this personality profile the most though.
The music is overly pretentious at times, and doesn't fit several scenes.
The plot is atrocious. Numerous people and towns are mentioned with mystery and dread, yet are never seen. Some scenes are ridiculous, where characters are introduced as, (ex. not accurate) Agnathas,son of Herodotus...which comes across very awkardly in a movie theater.
 I imagine in the book, it comes across better. I've read the Foundation Trilogy and Dune, so I can probably guess Lord of the Rings follows those lines. Perhaps, one of it's faults is the movie follows the book too much.
Big special effects scenes are telegraphed two years in advance. Even when they're not supposed to. For example: ***SPOILER*** On the way over the mountains, a bad wizard is blocking the path through. So, the dwarf (or someone)suggests an alternate way through: The Mines of Moraia. The dwarf claims this is the home of one of his friends (or relatives or something) yet reacts to the mines with dread on the mountain???!!?? What?!?!? He didn't know the mines were inhabited with monsters!!!!
As you might guess, there were plenty of monsters there. And no, don't see the movie because of that big troll scene. It's at the end of this boring movie. You might as well be chasing a tiny carrot on a stick.  **end spoiler**
For a PG-13 movie, however, there are some inEXCUSABLE references to drugs and sex. And I'm 19 year old man, and no member of a prudish church in the south. ( I'm a catholic who hasn't been to mass since ummm... Titanic came out:) ) In one scene, a character is smoking, and he has the nerve to come out and say, (not accurate) ""This is the finest weed in all..."" Not to mention, numerous references to the boys hunting mushrooms in the forest, with a desire only surpassed by a heroin junkie looking for his next fix. Then there's the broken carrot scene... I don't believe this would have been tasteful in an R-rated movie. In fact, it's plain tacky.
Like this entire movie.

1328058,5,B00003CWT6,"Given the major competition that is out there for ""The Lord of the Rings,"" I think it is helpful to point out those who have not read the Trilogy will fare much better watching ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" than those who are uninitiated watching ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.""  In fact, this may well be one of those movies where the novices will enjoy it more than those soaked in hobbit lore and the history of the Rings.
Elijah Wood is a credible Frodo, although there are almost as many shots of him looking worried about what is happening as there are close ups of the ring (I might be able to recognize the skin patterns on Wood's hand in my sleep).  Ian McKellen, as would be expected, makes the most of playing Gandalf the Grey, bringing a most human dimension to the role while avoiding chewing the scenery except for those moments when the wizard unleashes the full force of his power.  Cate Blanchett is a rather cold Galadriel, missing the spark that should take our breath away just looking at her.  But ultimately the performances are almost incidental to the rest of what is happening in this film.
While much is to be said for the stunning set designs, of which the mines of Moria stand out even above the Elven havens of Rivendell and Lothlorien, equal measure must be given to the enchanted New Zealand landscapes.  The visual spectacles hinted at in the trailers are revealed in all their glory throughout the entire film.  The fight sequences hold up well against the current contemporary standard, albeit without any wire work.  Surprisingly with all the swordplay involved it is Legolas with his bow and arrows that stands out during every single battle.  The orcs are suitable horrendous (and numerous) and the balrog certainly exceeded my expectations.  But what really makes this film work is that the hobbits seem hobbit size and after the first time you see Frodo and Gandalf together you never give it a second thought.
In terms of the controversies that exist, I think omitting Tom Bombadil was a wise editing move (the film is almost three hours long as it stands and there are plenty of other characters in the tale who refuse to take up the ring and the burden from Frodo), and buffing up Arwen's role does not bother me a bit.  Tolkien's world is clearly male dominated, the Lady Galadriel and Eowyn being relatively minor figures in the tale despite their respective powers, and I can appreciate the idea that Arwen should be more than the elf babe who shows up and marries the King at the end.  Now she will be a worthy consort who offers the hero encouragement and support along his journey.  I have more second thoughts about Merry and Pippin being more so the comic relief than Sam than I would either of those.  Overall, the movie is extremely faithful to Tolkien's vision: the door to Moria is just as it appears in the book, down to the proportions.  The maps, the elvish runes, the lettering on the letter, are all precisely and perfectly rendered.  Even more importantly, the key lines are all preserved from ""I will take the Ring, though I do not know the way"" to ""Fly, you fool!""",1008720000,252,3134,4.611510791366906
1328059,5,B00003CWT6,"There were two ways to enter the theater for this film: sulking, picky, wondering whether Peter Jackson's vision would live up to one's own; or optimistic and faithful, realizing the joy of seeing a great story properly filmed for the first time on the big screen. Over time, I began to see the wisdom of choosing the latter, and I'm very glad for it now.
The film opens with eight minutes of prologue (narrated by an unseen Cate Blanchett as Galadriel) on the history of the One Ring and the reason for the title ""Lord of the Rings."" Seeing (and hearing) Sauron approach the high command of the Last Alliance, as well as the ensuing hand-to-hand melee, was worth my trip alone, I must say. After that, I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore!
Of course, there were additions and omissions. How could there not be? ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" alone would be a ten hour film without omissions, and would make less sense (and appeal less) to a Tolkien-challenged public without certain additions. So, in line with my optimistic appraisal going in, I prepared myself for such.
Some were expected, such as the absence of Tom Bombadil, the expansion of Arwen's role during the film's first half, and the emphasis on Saruman and his uruk captain, Lurtz. Some were not as expected, such as Aragorn not wielding Anduril, or even Narsil (apparently for the duration of all three films), Saruman's full allegiance to Sauron directly through the Palantir (and other Isengard-related liberties), and the emphasis on racial communion augmented by Elrond's actually having summoned the Council himself. In addition, there were numerous other petty strayings from the authentic that I won't mention here, but that again ties back into my previous point about the proper attitude going in. At least you'll finally find out whether Balrogs have wings or not!
My next point ties more closely into personal opinion, but I prefer Ted Nasmith's interpretation of Tolkien's characters and vistas to other artists, and it's worth noting that Peter Jackson prefers Alan Lee and John Howe, and that this preference showed: Orthanc's design, the orkish armor and weaponry, as well as thematic elements for Barad-dr, Minas Tirith, Minas Morgul, and Rivendell all reflected a leaning toward Lee's often dark, gothic, watercolor style and Howe's more traditional tabulation of the fantastic. Nevertheless, Nasmith's ""Anger of the Mountain"" portraying Caradhras was pretty evident at one point, and I was gratified that it was.
On the whole, the film's makeup and effects work were actually better than I expected, and I expected a lot. The relative sizes of the characters could have been a major problem, but I never found myself leaving the suspension of disbelief because of it, or anything else, for that matter. More than that, the actors filled their respective roles with true passion and authenticity, another potential hardship averted by players deeply and intuitively desirous of rendering an accurate and authentic portrayal of characters beloved by millions for decades. This desire, and the dedication which resulted therefrom, showed through with remarkable clarity and clat. I had been concerned with some of the casting decisions early on, but those fears have been authoritatively allayed by brilliant performances.
Whether a fan or aficionado of the books or not, this is one film that leaves the world a better place for having been made. Admittedly, three hours, thirteen minutes (including trailers) is quite an investment of time, not to mention money, but I believe this venture to be an adventure worth seeing. Oh, and for those who really haven't read ""The Lord of the Rings"" yet, do yourself a favor and make a stop at the library or bookstore on your way home from the theater, because you won't want to stop investing in quality entertainment just yet.

From the very start of the movie, we see severe changes to the plot.  The nature of the Ring is downplayed.  Bilbo drops it on the floor in front of Gandalf, rather than placing it on the mantle, where it will not be as great of a temptation.  Frodo is NOT at all astounded or reproachful when the Ring is placed in the fire (perhaps because this time, Gandalf has sealed it in an envelope), and, ""keep it secret, keep it safe"" sounds like a bad television jingle.
It is also interesting how the flock of crows attempts to attack the Fellowship, and how Saruman is responsible for the mishaps on Caradhras.  It is understandable that wizard duels and romances are interesting, but one could hope that in such an anticipated movie the effects would be decent.
Frodo, at least was played well.  Although the relationships between the characters were downplayed, the Ring was clearly a burden to him, and many of his internal struggles are depicted reasonably well.
Perhaps the only consistently (good?) aspect of the film was that it was quite unpredictable.  Readers of the novels certainly should not be bored by repetition of Tolkien's detailed plot.
Perhaps as a modern ""fantasy"" flick this film would be acceptable.  It is a shame that anyone would consider it worthy of representing Tolkien's work.  There is nothing remaining of the deep psychological influence of the Ring, the vast nature of Middle-earth, or the history behind it.  Instead, we see a sensationalized plot that would be more appropriate to middle-schoolers than the adult audience Tolkien intended.

For a Gen X guy -- who saw the original ""Star Wars"" 12 times in theaters and probably 50+ times total -- there is no higher praise.
Peter Jackson and company had a daunting challenge: To take a somewhat dense, somewhat long story where as much is told as is shown, where the prequel material is simply not available to make it easier to understand for an audience unfamiliar with the story, to use state of the art special effects to tell a movie that works on its own, yet stands up as a solid adaptation of the novel, and one that's a hit with audiences who've seen countless epics on the screen.
Jackson knocked this one out of the park. The adaptation trims where needed, adds new supplemental material where required (which nonetheless fits in seamlessly), provides us with terrifying villains, symapthetic protagonists, dazzling eye candy, and a human (or hobbit) dimension that will alternately have you clinging to your seat in terror or weeping at the nobility and self-sacrifice of the heroes.
Awe-inspiring, yet touching, with some of the best performances we'll ever see out of this cast (if Liv Tyler retires after this, it'll be because she's going out on a high note that no one could have expected from her), true to the books yet totally accessible.
Oh, and as I think I might have mentioned, it's even better than ""Star Wars.""",1008720000,5,1411,4.716599190283401

We won't discuss the fiascos that were done way back then. Well, they finally did it! They did an awesome job. If you are an LOTR fan you will greatly enjoy this movie. For those of us that are purest, there may be a slip here and there, but all in all it was a very well done film.
My wife who has not read the series (I know, but what can I do? I love her.) did not care for all the violence. If you consider the books, it kind of has to be there.
In any event, fan or not, if you like fantasy you should see this film. If you haven't read the books, order them now! Then go see the movie. It is very very well done.",1008720000,,771,3.6787878787878787
1328100,2,B00003CWT6,"Some people have associated me with JRR Tolkien's books for more than 25 years. I first saw this movie on opening day at a local theatre 12/19/01. I was extremely excited about this movie and the whole series of films - since ""The Lord of the Rings"" is my favorite book, I was hoping for nothing less than that the 3 movies would combine for my ultimate movie experience! I wrote a highly positive review that same day giving the movie 5 stars. I saw the movie 5 more times in the theatre and was even more excited about anything Tolkien or ""The Lord of the Rings"", so I decided to re-read the book. That was when my movie dreams came crashing down. The visuals (costumes, scenery, special effects) and acting in the movie are nearly flawless, so what was wrong? The BASIC story line IS the same as in the book, but I noticed far too many differences in the little details of the story line between the book and the movie. Since then, this, my biggest personal disappointment in a movie, has been festering like a disease and has now spilt over to become a broader disappointment in the entire movie industry's way of taking liberties with beloved books, or even history. The thing that really gets me is that there is so much material to work from in the first volume of the book, and condense it into a nearly 3-hour movie, but instead Jackson's screenplay changes some things and ADDS material! I noticed some differences when I first saw the movie, but since I don't have the book memorized, I assumed most of the little details and lines were from the book.  Some lines in the movie are not in the book, some lines are said by different characters, or some lines are said at a different time & location.  Aragorn's personality and reason for not claiming the throne of Gondor earlier are very different between the book and movie.  Let's face it, most people will see a movie a lot more often than read the book.  So people will remember the movie more, and that's a BIG mistake here because people should remember TOLKIEN'S story...and that's the book!  I need some way of showing the tremendous let down I feel because Jackson let a golden, and maybe the best, opportunity for my ultimate movie slip by.  That's now why I only give it 2 starts, and why I refuse to see the remainder of this series at least in theatres, and if I ever do see them, I then must re-read the corresponding volume in the book. I read that Jackson changed things to fit a different media - implying that a book must necessarily be different than a movie - something authors should now think about before selling movie rights. In my opinion, Ralph Bakshi failed to bring the book effectively to the screen in 1978 (because he never did the second, and concluding, part, and because his animation lacked a stunning visual impact), and Peter Jackson fails now only, but disastrously, because of a poorly written screenplay. Will anybody do it completely right? I hope there's a ""NEXT!""",1008720000,10,2966,4.534579439252337

This is without doubt the best film i have ever seen. Everything else pales in comparison with it.
Seen Harry Potter? If so, forget it. That film is just plain bad when compared to this piece of cinematic mastery.
A party of 50 students from our school were able to see the film today as a Christmas ""treat"". I had gone with trepidation, thinking it might be boring, fantasy not being my thing. but my my my, i was wrong. This film is ANYTHING but boring.
it was fantastic! You all have to go and see it. It's highly, highly reccomend. I can't actually think of a bad thing to say about it. It outshines almost every single film I've ever seen.
The film is almost indescribable. The acting is superb, no one character is any better than the next. it is a brilliant film which is the gigantic sum of all it's wonderful parts. Everything about it is stunning. A nice thing about it is that it doesn't feature too many well-known stars, (save from the sublime Christopher Lee) so we don't have anything to compare their acting to.
The wonderful scenery and breathtaking special-effects are just that, breathtaking. the film has left images with me which i won't forget in a hurry. In fact, the scenery and special effects are so brilliant and such a part of the film as to almost become a living breathing seperate character. It is nothing short of stunning.

1328127,5,B00003CWT6,"After seeing the film today I will share this with you all, from the view point of someone personally involved:
While a few special emotional moments were missed in favor of pacing, (especially a scene between Sam and Frodo when Frodo finds out Sam has told Merry and Pippin about Frodo's quest, and Aragorn's sword not being broken) over all this was a delightful experience and I totally enjoyed how much of the original story did survive.
True, if Universal or MGM had had the vision to make the movie, there are undoubtably little ""movie things"" that would have been better, (ie: Disney's Pearl Harbor was made by guys would never heard a gun really fired)but they did not, and all of us who love these stories must take our hats off to Mr. Jackson & Company, (Thorin & Company, if you will) and in my case, that's quite a hat.

1328128,5,B00003CWT6,"It all began last night at 11pm. i gathered up the little woman and we set out on our 45 minute journey to Northern Virginia (springfield) to see the premier of LOTR. We arrived at the theatre appx 11:45, buy our tickets, get concessions and find seats in the theatre. it was a fairly large theatre, seats 500; unfortunately no stadium seating. the crowd was an adult crowd, rowdy, unruly, just like me. after viewing the mandatory promotions and previews, the crowd miraculously went silent. the movie began.
LOTR opens with a prologue of how the ring came into being. it soon makes its way to a grand battle on the slopes and adjacent plains of mordor. where the Lord_Sauron(not related to the Lord_feyd) is vanquished.
well... we all know the rest of the story.
I really enjoyed the movie. The cast is wonderful. the battles are great. the nine riders are fell and gruesome. the hobbits, specially merry and pippen are jolly and funny, not to mention mischeivous. The elves, were just and fair, they looked like a blend of Mr Spock and Tyra Banks ( My idea!!!)
The movie for the most part was not a disappointment. the people who worked on this film masterfully gave the magic of lotr form and substance. I was enthralled by the battles, itimidated by the orcs and bad guys, awed by the inhabitants of middle earth and loved the hobbits.
My wife, who hasn't read the books, thought it was good too. she says that the battles were vicious; which made it more the cool for me. one of the best IMO was the vicious battle which takes place in the mines of moria, in Khazzad-dum.
OMG- just go out and see the movie. i won't spoil it for you. My biggist fear was, like most fans, that I would be disappointed. Some things were different than i would imagine them but i was by no measrure disappointed. if anything, i couldve used more.",1008720000,,1832,4.504504504504505
1328129,5,B00003CWT6,"If you ask an English professor about Tolkien's weaknesses, the chances are that, besides the 2D characters ascribed to women, they'll point out the pretty feeble attempts at humour in LotR.  Eleventy-first birthday?  Ridiculous and infantile.
So I'm very pleased to report that whoever has written the screenplay for Peter Jackson has improved this aspect.  They may have meddled with some of the minor details of who does what, but the jokes are clearly better than JRRT's.  Most of it stems, as you would expect, from the hobbits.  Elijah Wood's Frodo is pretty androgynous, and I particularly liked the scene in the mines of Moria where Gandalf says, ""There's a lot more to Frodo than we all suspected,"".  Here Frodo unbuttons his shirt to reveal a glimpse of his mithril vest, but it's so glitzy that the unstated punch-line is ""Yes, he likes wearing women's underwear!"".
Goodness knows whether the movie deliberately makes references to others.  When Gandalf says emphatically to Frodo ""Is it safe?"", are we supposed to recall 'Marathon Man'?  If so, why?
After an initial battle sequence, the movie takes some time to get going while it sets up the plot in the Shire.  My daughter got distracted.  But as soon as the quest is begun, there is never a dull moment.  The special effects are good, and it's good to see a competitor to Industrial Light & Magic.  Slightly tedious after a while is the technique used to solve the scale problem for the face-to-face scenes between hobbits and larger people.  The swirling effect whenever Frodo puts the ring on are brilliant.
The soundtrack is particularly well done -- there is music for much, if not all, of the time, but it's not as overdone or glutinous as John Williams' work on 'The Phantom Menace'.

Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Frodo are  perfect incarnations. A tale has come true, more true than I thougt it'd ever be possible.

1328131,4,B00003CWT6,"Having taken a 2 day break before seeing LOTR for the 2nd time, I'm now editing my original thoughts which expressed some problems I thought the film had.
The film is split in two halves; everything before the Mines of Moria happens at an incredible pace and with such break-neck editing that I still can't remember a thing that happened or what was said. In other words, its a real mess. However, from the Mines of Moria onwards, the movie really takes off with the Moria sequence in particular being realised incredibly well.
I think the main problem with the film is that I expect films to firstly deliver the character/relationship development and then follow up with the action that the people we have just got to know and like get involved in. The action IS all there in the second half of the film and it is all done extremely well. However, because the first half of the film absolutely does NOT deliver on the character development stuff, ultimately the whole thing suffers.
I can think of no dialogue involving Frodo or Sam that gives me any idea about their personalities or their relationship until the very end of the film (the boat) and that's GOT to be the wrong way round, the film's over at that point!
I suspect that PJ etc have gone way too far in trying to cram as much detail as possible from the book (places/names that noone will remember etc) into the first half at the cost of character development. LOTR is a very complex story and it HAD to be simplified hugely to make a good, or even understandable, FILM, they failed in this I think, I imagine because they were trying too hard to please fans of the book. Its understandable and even laudible but its a fatal mistake in any book-film translation, even when you have 3 hours to play with ...
Anyway, a word about the actors. I think everyone did a fine job. I can barely bring myself to use the term 'actors' regarding Frodo and Sam's characters as they are given nothing to act out IMO, they really are one dimensional and are the most underdeveloped characters in the whole film, pretty amazing as I recall them being the leads in the book! An interesting contrast to that is the Ring itself; I almost feel like it should get a mention in the credits as it spends so much time on the screen!
Best actors IMO are Gandalf, Boromir (especially) and Aragorn.
I'd like to finish off by mentioning the much-derided 1978 Ralph Bakshi animation. Its not fashionable to express this I know but I have to say that I like it very much and I would even go so far as to say that PJ and co could have learned some very useful lessons by studying this. It has a better (tighter) script/screenplay, is scarier and much, much more emotionally involving than this latest attempt. It even gets a book and a half into a couple of hours. Animation or not, its probably a better film if you remove big blockbuster special effects from the equation ... Last word on this, its just my personal opinion of course but I reckon that Viggo modelled his Aragorn on the Bakshi animation (his voice at least), they're just too similar for it not to be the case (it might also account for why he's so good) :)
Hope this all doesn't sound too negative. I've given the film 4 stars which I think is accurate. I'd very rarely give a film 5 stars but I think this would have romped home with a tighter and less confusing first half. I should also say that I was dying for this film to be released and while I won't say that I'm very disappointed with it, its true to say that it could have been a tremendous film with a bit more courage/thought in the screenplay/script/editing department.
I should also say that I think the next two films will be much better as the hefty weight of character development is removed somewhat. If they keep it on course, I really do expect the next films to be awesome ...",1008720000,2,3849,4.430183356840621
1328132,3,B00003CWT6,"First of all the characters are all portrayed adequately, except Elrond, Hugo Weaving sucks many people even laughed at his overacting, he ruined the role. The fights were awesome and quite exciting but like all modern hack and slash scenes they go way to quickly and the action is blurred. Legolas steals the show his battle scenes are absolutely incredible. the director made the mistake of adding some ridiculous comedy relief (merry and pippin) which is poor at best. Even Gimli is is humbled by wasted attempts at humour. The special effects are great but some are over done. Christor Lee does a great job as Saruman. The Uruk-Hai leader Lurtz is the epitome of macho bravado (in a bad way) Huge scenes are left out completely (Tom Bombadil). the dialogue was good but the animated versions script was far better. And Finally the character is so awful that it made me queasy. She replaces Glorfindel completely (even the animated version cut him out:-( ). The intro sequence battle was fantastic, but the rest sucked, again the animated version was much better. There are also inconsitencies due to they way it was filmed. Overall the film was decent and far from a masterpiece. Look for a cameo by the director in Bree (eating a turnip and burping).

1328153,5,B00003CWT6,"True moviegoers have come to know a familiar desire in these days of gross commercialization and cross-promotion: that an anticipated new film will live up to its hype.  Well, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" doesn't just live up to its hype.  It stomps all over it.  Hype becomes a devalued word, useless when confronted by a movie this good.  It is hype proof.
While it's shattering the need for one word, it is reincarnating another: Epic.  It is a word that has come to represent such ignoble qualities as garishness, largess, of being over done and over long.  But ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" restores the original sense of the word; it is historic, legendary, heroic, and grand.
Director Peter Jackson, an intimate artist who just happens to be painting on a large scale here, retains most (if not all) of Tolkien's story, while shedding a lot of superfluous background information.  He finds the middle ground between not pandering to those familiar with the book, and providing enough background for those not familiar with the book.  The information presented is necessary, and relevant to the story being told, but also alludes to the wealth of knowledge laying underneath, tempting those who see the movie to go out and delve into the book for more.  Which is really what a good film adaptation should do.
And Jackson, known for his keen cinematic eye, does not disappoint.  In fact, he exceeds all expectations, bringing to the screen a visual aesthetic that is both original and personal.  He constructs several visceral and kinetic, if a bit confusing, battle scenes.  The confusion works, however, in that it brings a real sense of danger to the scenes.  The scenery he (or rather, Grant Major) created was breathtaking when it needed to be, and foreboding when necessary, but always real, textured, and inspiring: The Shire was quaint and wondrous; Rivendell was majestic and picturesque; Mordor was vile and perilous.
Jackson, for all his skills with visual aesthetics, never lets it trample on his characters.  Most were fully drawn, with real emotion and motivations.  Legolas didn't say much, but when he did it spoke volumes.  Boromir, a conflicted man whose purpose to the plot is paramount, was handled well, with the respect and care the character deserves.  Gandalf the Grey, who has become the archetypal *omnipotent* wizard, could have been portrayed as just that.  But that would not have been true to the character.  Like in the book, Gandalf is not all-powerful, especially when confronted by, in one memorable scene, the formerly good now evil wizard Saruman.  Gandalf is a flawed man, but wise enough to know how to overcome his weaknesses for the good of the fellowship.  And Frodo Baggins, the little Hobbit entrusted with the Ring, begins life as a wide-eyed innocent.  But we watch him grow and learn of the magnitude of his task, sensing along with him the fear and obligation he comes to know.  But the one character who made the most seamless jump from book to film was Strider.  He was my favourite character in the book, and my assessment of him hasn't changed in his celluloid form.  In fact, the film Strider may have even more depth, as his key background information, which in the books doesn't come till much later, is revealed early on.  It doesn't take away from the flow of the story as far as I'm concerned, because Jackson handles the release of this information with a skillful touch.
I was worried that rumours of broadened female roles, in a cheap attempt to widen the film's appeal, would be true.  Rest easy, friends.  They're not.  Arwen and Galadriel, even though they're played by big name actresses, appear enough in the movie so that they register, but not so much that they'll anger hardcore Tolkien fans.
Some characters, however, left something to be desired.  Gimli the Dwarf was all gruff exterior, with no inner machinations to speak of (he has one line, in the Mines of Moria, that, while funny, seems terribly out of place).  Pippin and Merry acted more like the Two Stooges than loyal fellows.  However, they did provide the film with some much needed comic relief, and will get many opportunities to grow in the next movie of the trilogy.  Any criticisms leveled at these three characters, however, do not detract from the movie at all.  It should also be noted that all of the characters were perfectly cast.  Any reservations I had about, say, Sean Astin as Samwise, or Liv Tyler as Arwen, were quickly put to rest.  And some choices, like Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Strider, or even Elijah Wood as Frodo, were nothing short of perfect inspiration.
""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is not for the casual moviegoer.  It demands your attention and, at times, that you do some homework before viewing.  It's a movie epic in scope but aware of the importance of its small details (the musical score by Howard Shore, and the cinematography by Andrew Lesnie were always spectacular but never intrusive).  And even though it runs a hair under three hours, you'll wish that the filmmakers had given you more.  They will, don't worry.  Although you'll need some time to once again be able to produce adrenalin and experience awe.  And if the next two movies are anywhere near as good as this one, well, we're all going for a wonderful ride.",1008633600,19,5314,4.81367144432194

However, I am blown away by what I am hearing about LOTR. I am one of those die-hard fans who have been waiting for years for technology to catch up to Tolkien's imagination, and more, our imaginations.  There are those like myself who wish to see no change between the book and movie, and I hope that is so. However, I think I will be disappointed.  No characters should be allowed extra screen time because of the actresses stardom, and the dialouge should be almost word for word.  True, some things must be taken out, so I, personally, will be satisfied with some degree of dialouge editing in order to make the film understandable for those new to LOTR. My biggest hope is that people will NOT see this film and think they know LOTR.  I hope this film will spur people to go and read the novels, and live life on Middle Earth themselves like so many of us have. I read a review that stated that issues could have been explored within the movie and that the film is racist, sexist, and so on.  I disagree.  This isn't a movie designed to explore social issues.  These are films based on a series of novels, just as so many Steven King novels have been.  The movie should, for the most part, follow the books.  The directors of such films though are allowed some sort of poetic lisence.  I just hope it is not used too much.

1328157,4,B00003CWT6,"The question that everybody has been asking himself is finally solved. Yes it is excellent, both for the fans as for the ""soon to be fans"". However it is in by means perfect, the fans will cringe at the tought of removing the slower scenes (the big part between the Shire and Bree lasts about 5 minutes!) and, more disturbing to me, the change in little details that could well have rested the same (for example: Merry & Pippin trowing rocks in the lake by Moria instead of Boromir). However, the good outweighs the bad by far, the story evolves a lot faster than in the book and keeps you pinned to your seat for 3 short hours.
The casting is probably the best since Marlon Brando was picked for Don Corleone. Best example of this is of course Gandalf as Ian McKellen or was it the other way round... but all actors are up to their tasks even the dreaded performance of Liv Tyler was filled with a nuance we were perhaps not so used to.
Another plus is that finally characters are allowed to speak their own language, about time I would say, the erie beauty of the Elvish only adds to the atmosphere the entire movie is filled with.
I can be very short about the special effects, it's there, it the best ever and Elijah Wood is 3 foot 4 in real life.

  It's safe to say that I'm as excited as many others are about the release, but the one caveat seems to me to be the part of Arwen.  I read a fellow reviewer who also voiced his opinion about a very minor player that has been expanded upon and modified within the story.
  You can say that maybe the reason they did this was to make the love story a little more involved and add an important female part to the movie,  I don't agree with this because the story already has, in my opnion, a very strong female character in Eowyn.  Although she dosnt appear for a while, she is worth not modifying the story and having her part be the most important and influential strong female cast.
  Thats all that I really can say that im concerned about, but except for a few minor reservations i can't wait to see this movie and I can guarantee that I will be there the first day!",1008201600,,1126,4.319047619047619

Just as it is impossible to describe J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece in a few words, so it is with this epic movie event. Life in Middle-earth is brought to life with an attention to detail that is, at times, quite overwhelming in its exquisite beauty and authenticity. The cast of gifted actors (particularly Sir Ian McKellan in the role of Gandalf and Elijah Wood as the hairy-footed Frodo Baggins) have instilled their characters with a humanity  that will remain in your heart long after the movie is over. Add to that an extraordinary soundtrack and seamless special effects, and the result is nothing short of magic. Peter Jackson is a genius. He has created a movie that is about to make history. To those who have been anticipating its release as much as I have, you will not be disappointed (and that goes for hardened purists too). Now when is that DVD being released?

Before everybody had own vision of Tolkien books.  We had freedom of dreams; in our imagination we made hobbits look pretty much like we were with our own habits and speeches.  We saw orcs as bad as we believed the bad creatures should look.  We become older and our heroes grow with us adopting our new habits and experience.  Finally most of us leave them behind with a blue of nostalgia.  Well, we about to get everything back from unified view point of 40 years old kids with a lot of 3D effects and their desire to make everything looks ""real"".

I'm looking forward to the Two Towers myself, Gollum/Smeagol (He's a Schitzo) will captavate audiences and annoy them by saying precious over 100 times.

The story is true to the book and the actors are perfect in the roles they play.

1328187,4,B00003CWT6,"I was lucky enough to see the media release on Dec 6, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the film.
I am a huge fan of Tolkien, and refused to see the animated LOTR all those years ago because I thought a cartoon could not do the film justice.  So it was with mixed feelings that I went along to see the film of the book that I have to say changed my life when I read it at the age of 11.
Was it good? Yes.
Was it as good as the book? No.
Would I see it again? Absolutely.
Positive comments: The cinematography is excellent, the locations are excellent, the special effects are incredible (especially the fight scene on the bridge in Moria).  It is obvious Peter Jackson is a big fan.
Negative comments: There are a few corny Americanized comments from the characters; Gimli's last words in the film should be edited out!  Obviously done to keep the interest of those (few) who have not read the book.
Arwen is a little too heroic, but not as bad as I feared.
The film is too short!  I felt hurried as I watched the epic, there were whole sections from Lothlorien missed out, and the storyline has been changed in places to fit into a 2.45 hour format.
My biggest regret: more of the original dialogue from the book should have been included.  Too many times the characters spout sentences that were not written by Tolkien, and JRRT's wonderful descriptions of the woods and vales are sadly missing. Still, the director has made a magnificent attempt to bring the majesty and wonder of the book to the screen.  It is impossible to fully include everything from the book, and I think he has done well.
I would definately recommend the film; I took my wife who has not read any of Tolkien and is not a fantasy fan, and she enjoyed it.  I myself got goosebumps watching the film as all the memories came flooding back.

might take on the task, but after seeing the previews I can honestly
say that it looks extremely promising. The images I have seen greatly
resemble the visions I had created while reading the novel(especially
the characters of Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf). I saw the
special on Fox, and it dissolved any of my doubts-seeing the passion

1328211,5,B00003CWT6,"I also saw the 3rd trailer for LOTR at a screening of ""Harry Potter"".  The reaction was interesting - as you can imagine, the theater was full of young children who were making a typical amount of childish noise as the previews ran.  But after the LOTR preview finished, there was dead silence.  Obviously, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is going to be much darker and scary than ""Harry Potter"".  It's not going to be a film for young children.
I remain cautiously optomistic as I have followed the news about the filming of the LOTR trilogy.  Based on the trailer footage and interviews with the cast and directors, they appear to have done an excellent job of casting, cinemetography, costuming, music and effects.  It looks real.
Now the only question remaining is the screenplay and dialogue, bearing in mind that the excreble ""Dune"" by David Lynch looked great in the previews, too.  But the fact that they're taking three LONG films to tell the story raises my hopes.  I'm looking forward to this first one very much.",1007078400,6,1016,4.668539325842697
1328212,3,B00003CWT6,"I was originally against the making of a Lord of the Rings movie or trilogy because no three two-hour movies can do justice to a book series that took Tolkien a lifetime to write.  I have since changed my view because of the sincerity expressed on the part of the actors, actresses, staff, and director in staying true to the story.  They have made a strong effort to make the movie like Tolkien envisioned it on the written page, and I intend to see their work.  I can't expect it to be like the book completely, but no movie is ever like the book.  Although I expect it to be different and am prepared to respect it for what it is as a film rather than as a competitor with the books, there is one thing that can ruin the films completely--the portrayal of Arwen.  If Arwen is a chop-happy modern warrior woman as some of the previews have led me to suspect, the films will be bittersweet at best.  Tolkien in his first book does not delve much into Arwen's character, but she is without a doubt a pillar of strength from the beginning to the end.  She is the very essence of femininity which is not weak, but is not physically strong or dominating.  She is quiet, gentle, wise, and an incredibly powerful character.  She never accompanies the fellowship on their travels, but is nevertheless the motivating force behind Aragorn's actions.  I can not respect her as a warrior woman, and it would misrepresent Aragorn's character to portray that he can respect her as such.  In fact, there is a woman in the books who falls in love with Aragorn and suddenly takes up a warrior role, but Aragorn graciously refuses her.  My point is this--beware of the modern ideal woman (a man in a woman's body) souring a possible filming masterpiece.",1006992000,10,1737,4.496815286624204

The cinematography is breathtaking and delivers you to a time and place where fantasy and reality melt into one and manages to hold rapture all who behold it's splendor.
