196731,4,1582704708,"Things I had known or believed are shown to be fact as this movie unfolds.  Presented in a documentary style with a sub story line, you hear from many scientists but presented in a very easy to understand common sence way.

Quick paced and plenty of excellent graphics keep the visiual interest while the mind is amazed at the information presented.

The whole presentation gives the audience a lot to think about and besides highly reccommending this movie, I will be seeing it again  -  maybe a couple of times.  Go see it !",1096675200,11,526,4.542553191489362
196732,2,1582704708,"There's no denying that WHAT THE #$*! DO WE KNOW is a feast for the eyes - the basketball guru, the gee-whiz computer graphics, the dance of the body's own chemistry - but watch out.  The film's attempt to force-fit quantum physics with rehashed New Age ideology and pseudoscientific bunko work will leave your eyes dazzled, but your brain starving.

WHAT THE #?*! starts off promising enough with some of the more basic concepts of quantum physics - at this point, you feel you're definitely going to get your money's worth.  Marlee Matlin's portrayal of a photographer caught in the middle of a psychological crisis evokes enough sympathy to be watchable, but her character's ultimate path to reconciliation and self-acceptance lies within the realm of fringe science - where a Japanese researcher claims he can make water form pretty crystals purely with positive emotions - and metaphysical psychobabble centered around ""creating your own reality,"" happily supplied by spirit channeller JZ Knight aka ""Ramtha,"" alleged ancient Atlantean warrior-king, and John Hagelin, apostle of Transcendental Meditation and Presidential candidate for the Natural Law Party.

Thomas Huxley once declared that ""Science commits suicide when it adopts a creed.""  If it was the purpose of WHAT THE #$*! to refute this statement, it failed.  In the end, the film bogs down in its own pseudoscientific quagmire.  Neither the dazzling graphics nor the hilarious chemical party scene can save the movie from itself.  Same goes for the Marlee Matlin panty shot.  WHAT THE #?*! really goes all out to make you pay attention, but in the end, the first three words in the title will be the question that sticks in your head.  Either that, or ""Why didn't I go see SKY CAPTAIN instead?""",1096070400,34,1761,5.062283737024221
196733,1,1582704708,"Over my vacation last year, I listened to an audio book of lectures by Richard Feynman called ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"". The lectures left me charged with passion about science. One of the most memorable portions of the lectures involved Feynman wondering why so few people saw the beauty of science deeply enough to use it in art.

After all, there are many paintings of people or nature, showing their beauty. Why not tell the stories of scientists and their exciting discoveries? Why not show the beauty of mathematics in an interesting, fictional story?

When I saw the posters for What the #$*! Do We Know (which I'll call WT#DWK for brevity), I was very excited. I thought it would be such a movie, that would demonstrate the passions we can feel around science. I hadn't heard of the title before, and didn't know the origin of the movie until I researched it after leaving.

Before you spend time or money on it, you should know that the movie was directed by a bunch of new-agers who run a cult. J. Z. Knight runs ""Ramtha's School of Enlightment"" in Yelm, Washington. She claims to channel an ancient warrior from Lemuria (now present-day Monglia) who lived more than thirty thousand years ago.

This woman believes and preaches falsehoods and executes irresponsible practices. Statements like: ""It's just a fact that we use less than a tenth of our brain,"" and stories of trusting her child's healthcare to a vision she had during an out of body experience are the brunt of her website.

Had I this background before paying for my tickets, I would have been prepared. Instead, I had my lofty hopes for a science-focused movie and I was, instead, profoundly disappointed. This movie is absolute tripe.

The first thing that struck me was the vast inductive leaps the movie made. The movie examines some simple observations, such as the behaviour of a molecule. And it inductively rides those into saying that people, after all, must behave the same way. No connection is made; no explanation for _why_ we should believe that people behave like molecules. We're just expected to believe it. The movie saddles up this fallacy and rides it into town; if people behave like molecules, then all laws of physics that apply to matter must have analogous laws which apply to people, right?

Other phenomenon are treated as if they're unquestionable facts, as if they're every-day occurrences. Global conciousness, for example.

Particles can't be in two places at once. Quantum physics tells us that we're sometimes not sure where they are, but current thinking tells us that matter only occupies one space at an instant.

And so on.

I really loved some of the anmiations and graphics, which showed physical phenomenon in a very lear and approachable way. Why not spend this kind of money on making graphics for students and teachers?

This kind of inductive cultism scares the pants off of me. It was all I could do to not leave the theater; I tried to follow the movie and give it a chance, but I was vastly disappointed. I know that a lot of people believe that there's something more out there; I do too, sometimes. But the way this movie uses tangible science to justify such profoundly unsupported conclusions leaves me cold.

Proof by analogy means nothing, and neither does this film.",1094947200,204,3305,4.789103690685413
196734,5,1582704708,"I finally saw What the #$*! do we (k)now? at the Valley Art last night with my friend Andy. It was a very fascinating film - part drama, part animation, mostly documentary - lots of talking heads of physicists and spiritualists talking about quantum physics and reality and such.

This film for me called to mind another film I liked and admired more - Waking Life. Waking Life was the film Richard Linklater filmed and then animated that was more an exploration of dreaming and consciousness with respect to reality - much less academic than What the Bleep.

Like Waking Life, What the Bleep is a film I will need to see a few times to really appreciate everything that happens. For me, the most powerful scene was when Marlee Matlin (I love her) has her breakdown/breakthrough - smashing her bathroom mirror and confronting her own personal demons (specifically her outrageously low self-esteem) and choosing to love herself rather than hate herself.

Overall, an excellent film, even though I got a little sleepy at times. And I loved the chubby Barbara Eden lady who channels Z Gallerie. She was great!",1093305600,18,1106,4.810526315789474
196735,5,1582704708,"If you're bored sick of movies, this precious little film will cure you. A hybrid of the documentary-interview format, hilarious animation, and lite storytelling, it weaves a pleasant tapestry of physics and myth. There are no dull moments, lots of laughs, a few mind-orgasms, where you will say, ""Aha! I KNEW that was the secret of the universe!"" The little boy basketball guru is priceless. The whole thing will leave you chortling with existential joy, and will painlessly raise your IQ, too! It might make you appear insane, however. In fact, the more film-cynical you are before you experience this little gem, the more likely you are to charge out of the theater and run straight to your friends' houses and drag them out of their beds.

I sincerely believe that the vast, vast majority of physicists that watch this movie will turn over in their graves when they die, as will most of their ancestors. This movie is a necklace composed of assertions strung on a wire of fantasy. It tries to assume some measure of credibility by anchoring itself to the field of physics but the ropes are merely soft spoken illusions. In physics it is best to ponder the data for a long time before drawing conclusions particularly in quantum physics which is desperately difficult to comprehend or visualize. The discussions about actual physics are fuzzy and riddled with errors which might not be a big deal for a layman, but would would certainly cause blushing during a PhD thesis review. While watching this film, I found myself repeatedly asking, ""Who are they trying to brainwash, and why?"". If you already believe in fantasies like the one portrayed in this movie, you will like it.

196744,5,1582704708,"Review 2/6/2018
According to this book, [I paraphrase, so no offense intended], this is a paradigm shifted. First one has to look at one's belief system thus the effects of what you have been enculturated to believe. Most of us believe in God as an external force. The Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam control the masses of people.  One has to allow oneself to think out of the box. But first one must recognize there is a box we are all in!  We can change reality with our thoughts and feelings. Having studied neurochemistry and communications between the neurons and receptors cells perhaps I can explain: When you take narcotics for pain, evidentially you require more, as the receptor cells actually increase in number.  The more one engages in a particular thought(s) or feeling(s) the greater the number of receptors will form so thought and feeling can becomes like an addiction. When you remove the stimulus the connections will weaken and break apart.

Confused yet? Wait theres more!  By deciding perhaps to feel a certain way that feels good and practice feeling this way one can build up the neural connections according to this presented theory. If you feel negative or low self esteem most times you have built up the neural pathways causing a kind of addictive pattern similar to a drug addiction. Ive learned Fake it till you make it. Like an actor learns to pretend to have healthy self-esteem, eventually you may actually start to believe you can and what it feels like. This could rock your world.

You could possibly change your reality by changing your thoughts and feelings. I never said it was easy!  In Maslows Hierarchy of needs this would fall on the top level of existentialism; the bottom level being food and shelter.

There were some hilarious moments in the movie especially the Wedding scene with the CGI (Computer generated Imaging).

Of course I didn't understand all of it! That would be too scary as they say at the end. Its too much and too far out. Like freaky woman (or man). Quantum Physics is different with the parallel multiverses, dimensional levels with different wave frequencies.  Personally I love this stuff science meeting spirituality. Its a great escape for me dealing with multiply health problems. Its been said one can heal them selves with ones thoughts. Please someone teach me how to fix malformations, pathologies and Neuropathy's causing pain! I need an attitude change about my perception of health care and my body. Hard to stop seeing oneself as physically sick when one has been that way most of their life. But Im willing to try to break out of my personal hell. One can understand a concept but application is something else. I enjoyed the movie. A great escape.",1517875200,3,2749,4.854700854700854

196750,3,1582704708,"Having studied physics a long time ago, I was never comfortable with the notion that things could be in two places at once. This reminds me of the Firesign Theatre comedy album ""How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All?'. Nowadays some are questioning aspects of Einstein's theories and have invented Dark Matter and Dark Energy to explain the difference between real world scientific observations and what the theory predicts.

I would say this is not my favorite explanation of spirituality. I much prefer the six-part Nova PBS TV series on ""The Power of Myth"" with Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers. The main difference being how the concept of human spirituality is explained. Can human spirituality be adequately explained based primarily on human physiological processes, which would tend to result in consistent outcomes, even though the concept of choice (e.g. between two or more outcomes) is introduced to provide the possibility of an infinite number of outcomes? This movie tries to explain the concept of spirituality based on human physiological responses, specifically in the brain and how we perceive reality.

""The Power of Myth"" explains it from a more cultural perspective based on early humans wrestling with the concepts of life, death and other real-world ""primitive"" experiences. A key point being that different ancient human cultures separated by geography and in time, which had no way to interact with each other developed very similar explanations or myths about the physical and spiritual aspects of life and the cultural transitions from birth, childhood, adolescence to maturity, old age and death. That independent cultures without any interactions develop myths with strikingly similar themes would appear to be due to something more than coincidence or chance. Rather these apparent coincidences are due to something unique about the human experience. ""The Power of Myth"" goes further toward explaining that these myths provide cultures the basis for differentiating between right and wrong behavior. With the current ""myth"" being based on the ""Star Wars"" power of the force ""mythology"".",1516406400,,2147,5.311764705882353

I felt the ring of truth in it .I didn't hear it telling me what to think but more to question what I have been told to think from other sources. I don't expect anyone to get everything right but for me this felt like a breath of fresh air. It doesn't surprise me that there are one star reviews because some people are so sure that what they know is so right. I also enjoyed the direction and production, some other documentary type films may have interesting information that gets lost in a crummy production, this one was well made in my opinion and I would watch it again.",1516233600,,720,4.18705035971223
196753,1,1582704708,"If there is one instant disqualifier of the credibility about a documentary that purports to explain Quantum Mechanics attach the name J.Z. Knight to it. If one wants more than to discard such a documentary as merely scientific illiteracy, take the next step and have J.Z. Knight fund the project.

My first sense that someone was trying to palm a card off the bottom of the deck was when NONE of the names of the experts featured were revealed during the film. Knight and her cadre of pretenders chose to give the names of these individuals in the closing credits--a cute little trick
I had never seen employed in any of the hundreds of documentaries I've watched.

Knight's reason for doing this was shamefully transparent. If her people named the experts who appeared as they appeared they would have had to mention her name and her credentials: she channelled a 35,000 year-old being named Ramtha, with all the scandals associated with that cult and the documentary would be summarily blown up.

Most disappointedly for me was, in the span of just a few days, learning that Joe Dispenza was involved with her (which explains his disproportionate amount of time in the film as a scientific expert.) and yesterday discovering he claims a few thousand years ago he was a savant tortured for spreading counterculture ideas while chained to a stone slab. After his release, Dispenza claims he retired to a cave.

I am totally mystified why people need to buy into such bleeping B.S. when a simple book like ""The Magic of Believing"" has thousands of people
(including the late, great entertainers Liberace and Phyllis Diller) claim that all their happiness, health, fame and fortune were acquired by practicing the simple methods Claude Bristol spells out. (One can download a condensed audio-version of this book on YouTube as well as an equally iconic very short booklet, ""It works.""

I suppose that science has become so authoritative that if you could cloak the most farfetched nonsense in the words of scientists, anything becomes more believable.

Thornton Wilder really nailed it when in his Pulitzer Prize winning play ""Our Town"" he had a character say, ""Wherever you look with people there are layers and layers of foolishness.""

196761,1,1582704708,"Pseudoscience 'evidences' and junk science touting new age ideology. And I have many friends and acquaintances who cling to these beliefs with a religious fervor.

It's also about Things Beyond Our Grasp, previously known as God.

For me God is a codeword for The Big Mysteries that are beyond our ability to explain, measure or even articulate. But I suspect we're very frightened of the magnitude of these experiences of mystery. People want to rename it, tame it, label it, write it down and revise it until it no longer resembles their original experience and thus no longer frightens them.

Is this why we feel compelled to advance explanations even when they're not rational? Do we prefer self-deceit to ignorance?

There have been moments when I wished that I too could believe in explanations I knew to be false. After all, a lack of understanding is inconvenient and often frightening.

But why can't we accept and cherish our common human experience of magic, wonder, and connectedness, and appreciate that we can still feel the delicious sensation of mystery? Why do we insist on twisting all of our authentic yet mystifying experiences into some pretense of understanding? Will we never concede that the category of 'what is known so far' will always be accompanied by the category of 'what is unknown as yet? and ""what we think we know but is actually wrong?"" Will we ever shed this terrible habit of devising ideological paradigms and narratives that must be preached and spread to the non-believers, even if it requires that we annihilate the truth?

Whether Christianity, Islam, New Age-ism or the new religion of identity politics, purveyors of The Explanation offer deliverance of a sort but they demand a heavy price-- that we deny the certain knowledge of our own ignorance. In return we get an abridged guide to The Big Mysteries that promises to never actually reveal them in all their terrifying splendor.

Feelings of mystery and deep connectedness are real and wonderful; however theories and explanations are subject to scrutiny and if they're proven false, they should be rejected.

I wish someone would make a documentary about some unknown scientist who spends a lifetime searching for answers, who accepts when their hypothesis is proven wrong, who courageously perseveres and keeps trying new ideas. That's who I think the real heroes are.

... that we program our bodies at a cellular level with our interpretations of reality. ""You can make your future every morning.""  We're *edging* into pseudo-science here. There's *some* science to back the claims up, though it is *kind of* science: The assertions made can be the result of multiple causes, and it's hard to do controlled experiments to back up the claims. But they do this because it sets up the next assertion:

... that you are god. The old ideas of religion are bad because they are the creation of old white men to control and dominate you. How dare anybody think that there's a vengeful, wrathful God. That's all religions like Christianity are!  But now, since quantum mechanics say observation creates reality, and since cellular science says your perceptions & thoughts program your cells, guess what? YOU CAN CREATE THE REALITY YOU WANT. So, you *must* be God!

Of course, this movie is the ""Jesus Film"" of this particular branch of religion. It is an attempt to convert you into this way of thinking, which is - of course - better than your way of thinking, especially if you adhere to traditional expressions of religion.

Which is kind of sad. It's your religion, or mine, eh? Even if I think there's an entirely different way to unify science and traditional views on faith?

196868,4,1582704708,"So while, I'm sure the ""science"" behind some of the claims made in this documentary are questionable or edited to make things seem more one way than another, I still find this three-disc set really interesting because, at the very least, it will make people think and question and open their minds to a new ideas. I saw the original theatrical version and the extended version (both included in this set) and it really made me think about how perception might affect one's reality. There was certainly some content that seemed hokey, but the point is to introduce new ideas and viewpoints, and on that level, it succeeds.

That said, there is a definite divide between two schools of thought  science versus perception (by perception I mean how a person's perception shapes his or her reality). I'm somewhere in the middle of these two schools  that while perception and outlook do, in fact, create reality to an extent, the science behind it is very important.

I still don't fully understand quantum physics and some of the experiments discussed in the film, I get the simpler ideas  some of the Dr. Quantum cartoons were interesting. And I appreciated the storyline of the photographer (Marlee Matlin), which intermittently runs between ""science"" segments and shows some of the ideas in the context of an actual person thrust into considering said ideas. I also appreciated the segment on Dr. Emoto and his water experiments.

The extra discs, which contain interviews and lots of other interesting discussions are, in places, even more interesting than some of the film segments.

I really liked this, not because I believe that science and spirituality have actually reconciled, but because I think that opening oneself up to new concepts, presented in a thought-provoking way, can be beneficial. You can think and decide for yourself.

196894,1,1582704708,Somehow this movie manages to be offensive to both science and pseudoscience. Nearly 60% of all its statements contradict themselves. There's very little continuity and it just hops from one idea to the next never digging too deep into any one idea in particular. This is clearly because it doesn't have a deeper to go to. Everything the film claims is some great new revelation from quantum mechanics is actually the same stuff you would here from the free love era or The Secret. The filmmakers only manipulate science to make their particular pseudoscience seem proven. Possibly worse it has the gall to say the idea of god is ridiculous while treating quantum mechanics as a deus ex machina of life capable of making anything possible with our thoughts. Fun to make fun of but that's about it.,1471910400,4,797,4.782608695652174

I associate creating your own reality with the idea of what the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve point of view. I'm very much open to that kind of thinking because for me it opens up a world of possibilities. I studied Spanish language at the university level for many years. I even studied Portuguese and was good at it. While studying for my Masters in Spanish I began to realize something: I knew a lot about the Spanish language and also I knew very little about the Spanish language because the more you know about a particular subject the more you realize how much more there is to learn about it. However, if you keep an open mind, you can learn more about your field and the learning continues for a lifetime and as time passes on we all continue to learn things we did not know or realize before. This movie encouraged me to think more along those lines. I know very little about science much less quantum physics or theory that's way beyond my areas of expertise and to be truthful there is a great deal more for me to learn about Spanish anyway, but I do believe this movie does encourage one to open their mind to other possibilities and for me in the main that is what learning is all about.",1463616000,,1286,4.296296296296297

The film is densely packed a fair amount of complex science (i.e., quantum physics and biochemistry), all of which leads to a profound convergence of science and consciousness. Thankfully, the science and philosophy are beautifully brought to human terms by Marlee Matlin whose backstory illustrates the main points of the documentary. This is an amazing film. The only reason I give it four stars (which to me is very good, by the way) is because you may need to watch it more than once or twice before a lot of information and the messaging in the film really starts to sink it.

196954,1,1582704708,"The film attempts to build a case for atheism, while acknowledging psychic phenomena and ascribing them to quantum physics. The producers try to hook you with intriguing ideas about the power of the mind, but toward the end of the film they switch to anti-God rhetoric, insisting that you and I are gods, but there is no judging Creator God above us. They urge the viewer to love himself, forget about God and  ""go down the rabbit hole."" The rabbit hole is a place where they suggest you can manipulate quantum mechanics to become an all-powerful god.

I give this only one star because it offers quantum mechanics as a replacement for God, but:

  1) Nothing they say even begins to prove that the God of the Bible does not exist.
  2) Nothing they say proves that God did not invent quantum mechanics and the laws of the universe.
  3) They offer no evidence that quantum mechanics is the highest law of the universe.
  4) They offer no evidence that spiritual/psychic phenomena and quantum physics are exactly the same thing.
  5) They offer no evidence that you can become your own god and create your own reality, except one mind-over-matter incident that has been publically debunked.

However, I personally experience a universe, a reality much bigger than the stark reality of the five physical senses.  I own it and watch it about once a year just to get my mind right.  The reality that the physical universe, solid things, are mostly empty space, and that matter is bundles of energy, suggest to me that energy and matter is a probability stream.  Because we may or may not be comfortable with the suggestion that we cannot completely understand a thing is no reason not to consider the options.  Intention is a powerful thing.  We see this in people's health all the time.  Angry, bitter people pay the price with their health.  Happy, joyful people enjoy the benefits of that also within the aging process.

197004,1,1582704708,"What the Bleep!? Down the Rabbit Hole - Quantum Edition 5 disc set

A colleague at work recommended this film to me, and after looking around for a copy I decided to purchase a used edition of the 5 disc set, and although the film is out of production the used copy was still expensive. Still, I looked forward to being able to see an in-depth scientific documentary during some time off work... boy was I wrong!

So to begin with I viewed the original (shorter) theatrical version of the film, and this I found confusing and troubling in its presentation. I have watched every science and physics documentary on the BBC for years (professor Jim Al-Khalili, professor Marcus du Sautoy, etc) so I have a good basic introduction to the subject matter already. To begin with, I didn't fully understand why the film annoyed me so much. Then I viewed the longer extended version, and this time analysed what was being said.

There are two parts entwined within the film. One part presents known scientific knowledge regarding quantum physics that has empirical evidence to back it up, and to be honest these parts are presented in a clear manner. Then the other part of the film takes this known scientific knowledge and extrapolates a whole list of extraordinary claims that are unfounded and in actual fact have nothing to do with quantum physics. In short, the film is misinformation, the film is a misrepresentation of present scientific knowledge.

It worries me because this film is clearly aimed at the average person, and in doing so is exploiting the fact that the average person is mentally incapable (or mentally too lazy) of thinking in a rational, reasoned, critical, objective way. Indeed, I find it a difficult task myself, especially when being bombarded with unfamiliar scientific concepts and language.

Some objectionable points:

1. Empirical scientific knowledge of Quantum Entanglement, one particle being entangled with another regardless of distance and time - from this the film claims that one particle is entangled with ALL other particles in the universe, that all is one.

2. Empirical scientific knowledge that when a wave function is observed (measured by a scientific instrument) it becomes a particle in a specific time and place - from this the film claims that 'observation' means observation by the human eye and by extension observation by the human consciousness, that is, by observing with our consciousness we literally create physical reality. The film urges us to become better observers in order to create the reality we desire... wish fulfillment... rather infantile.

3. Scientific theory of the Unified Field or Super String Field being the foundation or base level of quantum physics - from this the film claims that the Unified Field is 'pure consciousness', that consciousness brings physical matter into existence, that thought creates the universe. And following on from the misinformation regarding entanglement, the film claims that we do not have individual consciousness, but that we are one with the universal consciousness of the Unified Field, and our physical bodies and physical reality is a manifestation of the universal consciousness.

4. The film claims that by thought we can create our own reality. By extension, the film also claims that disease is caused by the way we think. One 'scientist' actually says that by changing the way we think we can change our genetic structure... which of course is nonsense.

5. There there are ludicrous claims such as thought intentions put upon water, whether positive or negative, can determine the structure of the ice crystal when said water is frozen. The films line of reasoning is that if human thought can affect the shape of ice crystal growth, then just imagine what effect our thoughts have upon our own bodies as our bodies are 90% water (actually, our bodies are between 55% to 75 % water, but no matter). Ha! Totally pure water does no freeze. In order for water to freeze, a nucleator (an impurity such as a particle of dust, or even a bubble) has to be in the water to be the nucleus of an ice crystal, that is, an object upon which an ice crystal can form and grow. So the shape of an ice crystal is determined by the type of nucleator and its size. Nothing to do with imprinted thought intentions! There is more nonsense like this in the film, such as thought intentions being imprinted upon electrical devices.

And so it goes on and on and on, one nonsense claim after another, all using twisted and misrepresented facts to back them up. And ALL of them can be torn to shreds with a little bit of rational thinking.

Then there are the 'scientists' whose testimony is used to back up these nonsense claims, such as...

Joseph Dispenza, D.C., Doctor of Chiropractic Degree, Life University... yes, that's CHIROPRACTIC: a system of complementary medicine based on the diagnosis and manipulative treatment of misalignments of the joints, especially those of the spinal column... Mr Dispenza literally has nothing to do with quantum physics what-so-ever!

To his credit, David Albert, Ph. D., Professor and Director of PHILOSOPHICAL Foundations of Physics, Columbia University, the first interview on the first interview DVD, forthrightly says that the claims of the film are unfounded and are at odds with the scientific consensus regarding quantum physics. However, because the language is technical, I doubt that the average person will understand exactly that his point of view is the antithesis of the film's.

JZ Knight doesn't even have a title board come up before her interview. No wonder!... JZ Knight is an American mystic teacher and author, and is known for claiming to be the channel of a spiritual entity named Ramtha... she peaks in tongues! And it has made her a millionaire! JZ Knight is also the founder and president of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment... this film, 'What the Bleep!?', is made by Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. The aforementioned Joseph Dispenza is a member of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment.

In short, this film has an agenda: to make huge amounts of money for the makers of the film and all those involved, either directly through film distribution or indirectly through book sales, tours etc. That these people chose to make their money by exploiting the ignorance of the average person who are desperate to find some meaning in a meaningless universe.",1443052800,5,6413,4.979439252336449

197119,1,1582704708,"The film originally leads you to believe that it's about science, but it's really a surreptitious attack on the Catholic Church. It's not long before the viewer is right inside a Catholic Church, with Holy Water, Devotional Candles, Stations of the Cross, statues, etc. While this is going on the various interviewees are talking about our religious ideas of God as being a ""blasphemy"", and how we don't need these ""backwater"" religions any more, now that we have quantum physics. It's actually laughable.

There's one guy (a science professor, I guess) who is so weird it seems he has consciously mastered the art of speaking without moving his mouth. He emphasizes his words with both hands clenched throughout, as if this new kind of self importance just might get him a raise. He's what you'd call off the screen ""a bad actor"".

There's also an over the hill slut, who seems to be a fortune teller turned scientist, remarking with fascination that a man's thoughts alone can give him a hard on. And yes, that's the expression she uses.

You'll see no mockery of Hindus, Buddhists or Jews - they go right for the Holy thing, this band of lesser demons. I say this because of the seething hatred of the Catholic God presented. These aren't scientists - they are God haters. Using quantum physics as a prop, they try to achieve that ""we're over your head"" credibility to make you believe them.

So the ""hussy"" goes on a rant, saying that we're carbon units in the Milky Way, and to say we have any relation to God (that we could betray Him, or sin, e.g.) is the height of arrogance. (She's pointing her finger here like a prosecutor accusing a murderer.)

If you want to learn something about quantum mechanics, don't watch this. As I said, it's a prop. You're supposed to accept that they all know what they're talking about, and they're way beyond you, and it's time for you to move forward - meaning of course, stop going to church.

Be prepared for absurd statements like, ""The brain is unable to distinguish between what it sees, from the recollection of that experience in the future - because the same neurons are being fired."" Or (the Hussy), ""How can someone say they're in love with a person? They're only in love with the emotions they're addicted to."" The term ""addiction"" has a special significance in this movie - what this has to do with quantum physics - you'll have to ask them.

We also see the inner working of our cells in cartoon forms. If someone's angry, the cells are angry; if someone's hungry, the cells get piggy. These are portrayed as little ""ghostbuster"" shaped blobs with faces. Some of them carry nightsticks.

Here's the problem folks. Quantum mechanics is a logical dilemma, because we actually observe things that are contradictory. So, ""observation"" (as in ""observational science"") has come up short. Without observational certainty, these scientists have nowhere to go - they're finished. So, they appointed themselves philosophers and gurus. But they don't know anything about philosophy, so they just make absurd statements that you're supposed to pretend you understand. I'm sure it works great on the college kiddies.

One of our several co-narrators laments that because of our limited views, we ""live our lives in mediocracy"". (I guess that's a ""so-so"" kind of government?) The Hussy's final words are that we should dream bigger dreams. And here's a humdinger, ""We are the only planet in the Milky Way that has habitation, that is steeped in enormous subjugation of religion."" She's apparently done a lot of traveling.

Another huckster, speaking from inside a church (Catholic no doubt, since on the outside says ""Gloria in Excelsis Deo""), tells us to abandon right and wrong for ""Does this or does this not evolve me?"". Further on, we're told that the purpose of existence, ""is to develop our gifts (so far, so good) of intentionality."" What? What??

By the way, the movie, in the big picture, follows a pill-popping woman photographer around (Marlee Matlin) who you learn was married, cheated on and dumped, and today she will get trashed and wake up guilty in the morning. The advice is, don't pray, don't go to church, don't be guilty or disgusted with yourself. Think delusional positive thoughts, and your wildest dreams will come true.

This was an atrocious movie of tortuous length. It's entire ineffectiveness made it difficult to end. They don't know what their point is, or exactly what they want to say, and so they're never satisfied. Don't watch it. If you do, you'll be sorry.",1426636800,,4538,4.833762886597938

There's some concepts discussed that I find hard to grasp, as metaphysics and quantum physics is very deep stuff that goes beyond your typical Newtonian ""if a ball is dropped off of a building x meters high about how long before it hits the pavement..."" type of physics (which I hated with a passion in school, as I'm not the world's best math student.) I've always appeared to be ""ahead of my time"" in ways, so I have interests that go beyond what is typically expected of my peer group.

Is it really that difficult for us to understand that science is just our current understanding/approximation of reality and we moved from newtonian mechanics to relativity theory and now trying to fit string theory to our perception of reality.. ??

Science is a means to understand reality, it isn't reality in itself and it is not perfect, it is also mystical or mysterious because nothing in science is beyond assumption.. you create theories and then validate them at certain approximation like fitting data to a graph.. but graph is the reality which can still be much different from what you approximated based on your observations/experiments/data-fit,,, and you will get to know of it only when you find a new graph that fits even better..
It is quite surprising that knowing a little science, we even start pretending that we know all of it and can even forget what science is all about.. individually we all know little bit of science, irrespective of how many books we have read on it and science itself knows a little bit of reality.. irrespective of how many scientists we have...",1423872000,,1314,4.995433789954338

I will be playing these DVDs over and over many times. Additionally, I have purchased a few books authored by a few of these brilliant people, and will be purchasing others.

Although I admit that when I watched it the first time, I was overwhelmed with the science but I could not let go of some parts of it as I moved through my spiritual journey of what resonated as right for me.  This helped me understand that science has gone very far in understanding how atoms work within us but they are stumped when it comes to the ""God"" particle - thus leaving me with the knowing that it is all connected but to a level that we may never truly understand but must inherently 'believe' or have 'faith' that it is.

I have to admit I was fooled, yes and being moulded into someone I felt uncomfortable with.

It took a Richard Dawkins documentary, my father's death to wake up, and understanding there are people who want to control your thoughts especially when you are vulnerable.  Under extreme emotional stress we make bad decisions and reviews.  The ""friend"" who gave me this movie, was no friend but a predator and or a sociopath.  I consider myself lucky to have woken up and enjoy doing research, enjoy treasure hunting for the good stuff.  Look at both the pros and cons of other people's reviews and opinions.  Then look elsewhere to find what is behind these things.  e.g. with this movie most of the people involved are from a cultic organisation, also who are the ""scientists"" and are they qualified in to make statements on their claims. Look and you will see!!.  Unfortunately its so easy for most of us to fall into traps of pseudo (fake) science thinking, that is why its so easy to get trapped into cultic organisations ""personal development"" courses, question yourself are they really and ""education"" or a selling, manipulative, wolves in sheep's clothing.

The most difficult part for me personally is remembering to focus on and utilize the knowledge daily.

197270,5,1582704708,"I have watched this documentary countless times & purchased it for family & friends. It is part movie, part animation, part interviews, & entirely mind-blowing! This quantum edition contains three discs which are dual sided. You can watch the original theatrical release of the film & the extended version of the film, which is much longer & delves much deeper. On the second side of the DVDs are more interviews ~ which are unedited ~ with scientists, neurologists, biologists, theoretical quantum physicists, & many others discussing the quantum nature of reality, consciousness & so much more. It's so wonderful! These concepts may seem difficult to grasp at first, but that's where the ""movie"" & animation aspect of this film become useful to help show you examples of what these experts of various sciences & professions are talking about.
  This special 3-disc set includes: Cutting-edge quantum viewing mode ~ which includes hours of all new randomized clips throughout the movie for a different experience every time you watch; the theatrical version as well as the extended director's cut; you also get almost SIX HOURS of additional interviews; and the filmmakers' Q&A. You even get to choose whether to watch the film with or without the dramatic scenes & see it plainly as a series of interviews ~ at random or in sequence! Depending on the viewing mode you've selected, the total run time of the film can vary between 15 and 300 minutes!

  Now, there is one person in this film who I personally believe should have been left out, that is the supposed channeller JZ Knight, who claims to channel the entity ""Ramtha"". A couple, but not all, of the makers of the film attended Ramtha's ""School of Enlightenment"" and thought that since the film had cutting-edge science talking about consciousness and the nature of reality, why not include a space for spirit (which is consciousness). I would have prefered it without her in it. However, this matters very little since she is HARDLY in this documentary at all & she only contributes a handful of sentences.

  The reason I have watched this film again & again is for the facinating SCIENTIFIC information that comes from the professionals featured in this documentary, who are:

197275,5,1582704708,"Life is complexity. Looking at it through the eyes of native peoples, the eyes of Albert Einstein, or the eyes of quantum physicists hardly makes a difference. Actually, the difference is one of precision. Most native tribes do not know much about the subatomic world, yet they know about uncertainty and nonlocality. They do not only know about it, but actively use these laws for connecting with the quantum field.

Most native shamans can be at two locations at the same time, they can relocate instantly, and travel back and forth in time. They do this not for fancy or as a pastime, but for healing people, for doing something useful to a community. And the field responds. Quantum physics teaches us that this is exactly how electrons behave, and electrons are in touch with the base layer of the universe, that is, the quantum vacuum, the level of the Planck scale.

In this review I would like to elucidate and review in some detail what scientists are saying in the movie 'What the Bleep Do We Know!?' My idea is that, given the complexity of the subject, it may not suffice to watch the movie once or twice to really understand what is being said in the film. It is for this reason that I found the idea useful to just typescript some of the most interesting interviews. And I made the discovery that, although I have watched the movie, and even the complete Rabbit Hole Quantum Edition, several times, I got a more complete understanding of the various subjects treated in the movie once I wrote interviews down word by word, and phrase by phrase.

To begin with, this famous movie is not just about quantum physics, while quantum physics is as it were the hanger for the other subjects that I would like to simply list here, as a starting point.

Basic principles of quantum physics, such as uncertainty and nonlocality;
The basic unity and integrated wholeness of all life;
Time and space are just constructs of the basic unity of life;
We are all interconnected through the quantum field;
The nonlinear and co-evolving logic of living systems;
The energy nature of emotions and sexuality;
The danger connected with following life-denying ideologies;
The possibility to create our own reality;
An ethical code based upon one single principle: don't harm another;
A liberal approach to all basic life functions;
Honest and truthful language in dialogue;
What is the purpose of life?
Why are we here?

Einstein marked the important transition between Newtonian physics, and quantum mechanics: it is relativity theory. With relativity, the concept of time changed from an absolute to a relative concept. Einstein namely found that time is relative to velocity, the speed with which a certain amount of mass moves through space. In the Newtonian universe, time was an absolute constant, which is why we can say that relativity theory was nothing short of a revolution in physics.

Newton and Planck can be seen as the poles from which Einstein moved away and toward. He moved as it were away from Newton and toward Planck, because Planck was one of the real innovators in physics and one of the founders of quantum mechanics.

Let us first have a look at the relationship between relativity theory and quantum mechanics. Contrary to what popular science magazines sometimes state, relativity theory was not left behind, and has not been superseded by quantum mechanics. The laws of relativity that Einstein found and mathematically described are still valid for the macrocosm at large; they apply in the relationships between large bodies, and in just any situation where a minimum amount of mass is in play. Grossly speaking, they are valid for matter. They are not valid for the subatomic realm where we deal not with mass, but with dynamic patterns.

Generally speaking, apart from all science, from all religion and from all learning, we need a certain basic openness for acquiring real knowledge, which first and foremost means self-knowledge. Fred Alan Wolf coins it in the formula that how far you want to go [down the Rabbit Hole] really depends upon how much you want to discover about yourself.

This is the amazing truth about our interconnected universe: knowledge always includes the observer, which means that whatever we learn about our universe, we learn about ourselves as organic elements of this universe.

If we call the base layer of the universe the quantum field, or the unified field or superstring field, the Planck scale, the A-field, the zero-point-field or the quantum vacuum, it doesnt make a substantial difference. I do not say that the terms I have put here are really synonymous, but to demonstrate the metaphor, I have approximated the truth somehow.

William A. Tiller clearly says in the Bleep that the zero-point-field and the quantum vacuum are strictly speaking not one and the same thing. So I am well conscious of my metaphorical diction here. What I want to convey is that what really is at the basis of all creation, of all life, and new life, is a vibrational field so subtle that it was being overlooked for centuries, while the Taoist sages were absolutely aware of it, calling it the Tao or the subtle energy.

This interconnectedness has been called entanglement, nonlocality, connectivity, colocation, coherence, morphic resonance or the quantum field effect.

It is important to understand that the unified field is a vibrational pattern that is not filled with mass, but where mass is absent. Stuart Hameroff, Professor of Anesthesiology and Psychology, and Associate Director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona describes the properties of the unified field or vacuum field as largely empty space.

I am using here Ervin Laszlos expression puzzles and fables as a metaphor for the many paradoxes quantum physics produces when we look at it with the eyes of conventional physics. It was exactly those paradoxes that led to the revolution in physics that we today find is established in some way, but was not just some decades ago. Thus the puzzles and fables really had a creative impact and its as it were through their push-and-pull that the new paradigm in natural and social sciences was going to be leveraged. There is gravity in our science establishment, a fact even the reader of popular science magazines is aware of. This gravitational pull basically holds scientists in outdated views because every move into scientific novelty questions the established organizational structure, thereby causing a threat to existing research funding and, worse, the reputation of the researcher himself.

Now, this is really an old hat, but there is something unique in the current paradigm shift, or transition from the mechanistic to the quantum mechanical paradigm. Its the fact that the push-and-pull from quantum physics was so strong that that scientific gravity was virtually annihilated our outweighed by a leveraging factor of potentiality which was unknown in all of our pre-quantum science history.

Thus, the emergence of the new physics was nothing short of a novelty event in human evolutionary history! What is so dramatic about this novelty event? Its that it brings us back at what Laszlo calls the reenchantment of the cosmos, thereby linking us back to the oldest of scientific traditions that were not yet fragmented by the mind-body split, the consciousness split so typical for modern times. Hence, science then assumes a quality of religio in its purest sense, a link-back to our foundations, and thereby becomes enchanted itself, and full of religious meaning.

The most striking characteristics of the unified field are coherence, connectivity, entanglement and nonlocality, while one may argue that all these expressions are saying basically the same, namely that we are all connected, and that isolation and fragmentation, if we experience them, are of our own making, the making namely of our thought interface.

John Hagelin explains that somehow we are not using the brain in the way it was designed to be used. He asserts that the brain is actually specifically designed and carefully engineered to experience the unified field, to experience the unity of life.
There is a unison agreement now among quantum physicists that this field exists, while there is still little agreement about the main characteristics of quantum physics, that are uncertainty and nonlocality. The ground in the quantum world, as it were, is not solid ground, its floating, constantly moving, and this situation creates insecurity, and fear.

Fred Alan Wolf is one of the quantum physicists who is next to Ervin Laszlo perhaps the most outspoken, and non-hesitant, to claim a total renewal of organized spiritual ritual to reflect the consciousness boost quantum physics triggered both on the individual and the collective scale. He voices his concern in the Bleep in clear terms:

Quote
We need a new spiritual milieu, we need a new spiritual way of understanding the nature of what it is to be a human being because the old ways, the old mythologies, the old monarchy-king-god versus the old lawful-scientists-way-of-doing-everything are dead. They need to be buried. We need a new realm, a new vision and I think that quantum physics, if anything, can help us get a step up in the right direction.
End of Quote

Besides the insight that there is one unified field of vibration, energy and information that interconnects all, creates all and recreates all, for understanding our universe we need to learn about the impact consciousness has upon this unified field. Candace Pert, author of the book Molecules of Emotion (2003), humbly states:
I think the key aspect of the new paradigm, at least in medicine, which is my little piece, is that consciousness is real and has an impact.

While Joe Dispenza claims our need to go beyond our senses to create a new paradigm, Fred Alan Wolf is more explicit in that he points to the danger to focus upon the external world when we expect the world to change. I would term it in the words that all change is an inside-out process and starts at the level of human intention, and thus on the nonmaterial level of reality.

Joe Dispenza gives an important point of information when he compares the total information our human brain receives per second, compared with the information we are actually processing. And the question obviously is why human consciousness evolution has left out or has degraded what I call direct perception?

We know the answer in the meantime, its because the brain mainly serves survival purposes before it serves cognitive completeness and accurate perception.

This brings me to point to the important difference between our self-reflective consciousness and perception; perception is the more practical tool for consciousness to operate in informing itself. Ideally, perception should be accurate, but isnt, the way our brain has evolved till now, which is an insight that was voiced already back in the 1960s by Edward de Bono, in his book The Mechanism of Mind (1969).

Now, in the Bleep Quantum Edition, Andrew Newberg, M.D., Director of the Center for Spirituality and Neurosciences, Assistant Professor in Radiology and Psychiatry, and Adjunct Professor at the Department of Religious Studies, University of Pennsylvania, points out that perception is the pure receptory process of information gathering, while consciousness is what gives meaning to every single bit of information we receive through our perception interface.

How do consciousness, perception and memory work together? This point was well explicated in the Bleep with the example of a woman who is disgusted at all men because she hates her former husband. Amanda, when she was young, grew up in a rather traditional environment where she was not having the opportunity of various love affairs until she married. For her, the marriage and the way her husband was treating her became for her the pattern for her love, or in one word, her love pattern. The problem was that her husband was having affairs with other women, even before Amanda married him.

The tragedy in Amandas life was her strong attachment to the past, and to her husband, for paradoxically we cannot let go of people if we hate them. Forgiving him was obviously out of question for her. In addition, she was egocentric enough to believe that her own story was a blueprint for the world, generalizing her experience and projecting her husband upon all the males she met in her subsequent life.

The claims that William Tiller is making are not minor ones. I would go as far as saying that they are the most controversial and disputable arguments brought forward in the Bleep. They go beyond the general criticism of the film by David Albert who found that the impact of consciousness on matter and generally, the universe, has never been proven by quantum mechanics.

William Tiller doesnt speak generally about the matter: he simply went about construing devices that do the job because they were conditioned by human intention, a beam of strongly focused conscious awareness.

With these devices, it was found possible to raise or lower the pH of water at 1.4 units, which is considerable, so considerable that if that was done to the water in our bodies, we would die upon the alteration!

One could possibly doubt these findings if they were standing alone in a desert landscape of innovative science, but they dont. They are not isolated research events and actually fit rather well in a series of similar experiments conducted by other researchers over the last two decades or so.

Let me first come back to Dean Radin, whose scientific corroboration of psychic phenomena has grown largely beyond the Uri Geller audience in that they can be said to represent conclusive scientific evidence as to the existence of psychic powers and the various phenomena correlated to exercising those powers, consciously or unconsciously. Today, any skeptic who rants about mental derangement when psychic phenomena are concerned really should engage a reality check with Radins research, or he risks to lose his credulous negativist audience. Nobody can ever be so negative to discard out scientific research that has been time-tested and peer-reviewed, or he risks to lose his own credibility as a skeptic.

Dean Radin reports random-number generator experiments that are really uncanny and seem to stand in line with Tillers experiments in that they show that human intention does matter and influences research results on a probability scale considerably higher than random, and thus largely beyond pure chance.

But please do not lure yourself with the great promises done in the Bleep. I do not say they are wrong, I do not say they are exaggerated. I do say they apply for people who do not suffer from major hangups! If you are as incurable as Amanda do not blame the Bleep if reality creation doesnt work for you but get to see the whole of the picture! If you have a hangup with your past, you cant just simply apply the teachings of the movie, but first have to clear your memory surface from the negative imprint.

On the other hand, people are often overwhelmed with beliefs and ideologies that they take for granted, which means they take religious, social or political concepts for reality and behave according to the demands imposed by those group fantasies.

Joe Dispenza gives useful comments on how we actually can impact upon our neuronet by focusing on certain wanted outcomes, stopping to focus on unwanted ones. But even prior to using such techniques that he boils down to the slogan creating my day, he explains that all knowledge gathering leads to changes in the neuronet, which actually means that the old maxim that books make you wiser is true, not just in the literal sense that you gain more knowledge, but in the sense that the very fact of gathering knowledge regularly through reading books renders your neuronet more complex, with the result that your IQ will go up because of more preferred pathways in your grey matter. I think this is important to know as a starting point.

While Dr. Daniel Monti puts the stress on the therapeutic nature of this knowledge, speaking of a basic ability to change that is part of the nervous system and makes out its plasticity, for Stuart Hameroff and Fred Alan Wolf, its also the fact that science and spirituality will begin to function as complementary ingredients in that kind of metascience to be created in the future. Fred Alan Wolf affirms that while quantum physics was mainly an achievement of the 20th century, the new reaching of science and spirituality will be one of the tenets of the 21st.

In my view, the main problem part of that new science will be its lacking coherence, or the rather enormous task to work out this coherence, while for the moment, the picture quantum physics offers is, to repeat it, one of fables and puzzles. There is not much help in Tillers statements that we are co-creators and somehow responsible for all we find out there in the world, not only because Krishnamurti said this before him. There is also not much help in the insight that when you come back out of the rabbit hole, you have gained what Terence McKenna called the greater picture and you come to a point of sudden realization of your true nature. There is practically speaking no controversy about these assumptions; the problem is how to integrate them with quantum physics without, as Professor Albert would put it, grabbing at those concepts in an attempt to justify your desired outcome with quantum physics as the ultimate backup provider for all kinds of agendas.

When we look at Alberts argument closely enough, we see that he doesnt want to say the filmmakers are as fundamentalist as the Vatican was toward Galileo, but he sees a parallel in a postulate to bring a good message to the masses that can indeed be detected behind both forms of behavior. Now let us put this question squarely in our lap: Is science supposed to give comforting messages to the masses? Is science to be salvational?

The answer here, not only Alberts, but generally, is a clear no. Science is not supposed to give us any specific vintage of truth, it is only supposed to give us truth. What we do with that truth is not sciences affair.",1401321600,,18306,4.947899706935852

Deftly edited interviews of Ph.

That we have infinite possibilities is made abundantly clear.

Marlee Matlin, in a story reflecting real experiences of so many people, brings to life the meaning of the scientists and educators' observations and studies. She integrates beautifully the science implications to our everyday experiences.

A bit of background is helpful to follow the thinking of this work. I live and work with people in recovery with limited education; they have a hard time following the thoughts. But learning how their addictions become hardwired has been helpful to some. Learning how to try to focus their minds on positive goals has been a major effort. But the influence is clear.

Are you rely interested in new thought and clearer understanding or being comfortable with the way things are? Even traditional science changes its beliefs constantly and has many questions it cannot explain or won't even attempt to look at. Relax folks... We're all in this together.

Takes words of a real scientist out of context to support the charade, he never intended at all, that quantum physics ""proves"" we can shape reality with our thoughts. A bunch of bull.

197357,1,1582704708,"This story pivots on the claim that New World natives could not see Columbus' ships because they had no perceptual category for it.  After a time, a wise shaman accomplished the breakthrough of seeing the ships and then told everyone else about them.  In the same way, supposedly, we modern people do not see a number of supposedly real (paranormal) phenomena and need to rely on a spiritual leader to guide us to the ability to see them.  But, the core claim is simply false, historically, physiologically, and experientially.  Columbus himself reported in letters that natives fled the shoreline of newly discovered islands at the sight of his ships - hardly possible if they were unable to see them.  The visual pathways in the brain do not simply discard or filter out novel inputs - to the contrary such are more likely to attract attention.  And ahem each of us has had the experience of seeing something new for the first time... we may need to ask someone what the object's name or purpose is, but that is because we DO see it, NOT because we can't!

The movie has a storyline about a deaf woman interlaced among interviews with experts in science and spiritual fields talking about quantum physics and personal growth.
I would not say this is really a ""self help"" movie, but not strictly a ""scientific documentary"" either.  It is one of those unclassifiable films that falls into many genres.  There is a lot of information about physics, the laws of the universe and also about spirituality, healing, positive thinking and emotional wellbeing.

I had friend's parents go into bankruptcy because of this group. This was a PR film. The film has maybe one or two actual science theories that they mention and then they go into their own assumptions of how that explains the metaphysical or spiritual experience.

Alternate universe, yes, but read it from a scientist, not a farce medium.

197417,5,1582704708,"What the Bleep Do We Know?! is a movie/documentary combining film, lecture, and Q&A sessions challenging the viewer to consider ""consciousness and reality."" It brings together several different types of media including documentary, story, and elaborate visual effects and animations to explain the foundations of quantum physics and how it correlates into religion, Positive Thinking (or Positive Psychology) and consciousness/reality in which we all view ourselves in! The protagonist, played by Marlee Matlin, takes the viewer on a journey throughout the movie based in a wonderful Alice in Wonderland experience! When she ""dives into the rabbit hole"" she begins to watch her life unravel and begins to learn about how the world of quantum mechanics creates our own perception of our lives. Matlin's character, Amanda, is challenged to think about life's most challenging questions: What is reality? What is my life about? What are relationships? What is reality? What is consciousness? These are just a few of the very deep, challenging questions that is encountered throughout the movie!

Throughout the movie, there are several interviews with quantum physic experts and New Age authors including JZ Knight, a mystic who has been known to channel a 35,000 year old ancient sage called Ramtha, Will Arntz, Betsy Chasse, Mark Vicente, Marlee Matlin, John Ross Bowie, Elaine Hendrix, and Robert Bailey Jr. This movie is inspiring and thoughtful! It really does make you think about how much control we have over our own ""reality"" and how much we can actually change that ""reality"" by changing our way of thinking! I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in quantum physics or simply is interested in the question of ""what makes us... us?""",1357430400,,1757,5.252669039145908

197428,5,1582704708,"I watched this film some years ago before the extended version was produced. If you're religious and you can accept the tenets of your faith, or credit that any faith could be true, then this film isn't proposing anything that's beyond your ability to give respect or appreciate the gravity of what it proposes about energy, power, potential, and our responsibility for our reality. Using and uniting with the energies that help make it a seeming reality.

""The Burning Monk"", aka/ a Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist monk who's name was Tich Kwong Duuk,in order to protest the Vietnam war set himself afire in 1963 in a busy intersection in downtown Saigon. With the assistance of fellow Monks, he assumed full lotus, while gasoline was poured over him and he was then set afire.
He moved not a muscle. He sat and he burned for a number of minutes and still never moved a muscle. Finally his charred body fell backwards on the street. Onlookers, passersby with camera's snapped pictures and someone even captured it on film. Which is available to view today on You Tube.
Mr. Duuk sacrificed himself to protest the then south Vietnamese government and it's abuse and oppression of the Buddhist people of Vietnam.
Mr. Duuk's sacrifice became one in a long list of world famous photos.

The reason I mention this is not only out of great respect for Mr. Duuk, but to also bring it into alignment with the proposal of this movie in how the power of the mind can control and be responsible for the individual's perception and experience of their unique reality.

If the material world is not affected by our thoughts, and we can not affect our life by changing our mind in any way, how then does a Mahayana Buddhist monk voluntarily assume the Lotus position on a busy street, allow gasoline to be poured over him and then be set afire, and he doesn't move a muscle the whole time his body is burning to char?

This WTBDWK DVD is worth every penny. If nothing else it will give you something to think about. Even if you think it's rubbish,at least it will have imprinted onto your psyche a different way of seeing things. And once impressed you're changed forever.

What the bleep do we know?
Not a lot, obviously. Otherwise the religious wouldn't think they're battling against the Scientists. And the Scientists wouldn't think they should feel sorry for the Religious. While it just so happens there are devout religious Scientists.

I have no idea why the director and others responsible for making this film decided to go this route. It would have been much better to focus on the talking heads who brilliantly discuss theology, quantum physics, the meaning of life, etc. There were some excellent, intriguing points made.

However, there's a goofy movie that keeps interrupting these intelligent discussions. Marlee Matlin is an accomplished actor, but even she can't overcome this lame, boring script. That part of the film ends in a feel good finale when the main character throws away her prescription drugs. Really? A film about how profound human existence is really an anti-drug film?

It's as though the filmmakers thought the fictional film would draw more people in, but I'm not sure that audience is even interested in a movie about the meaning of life. Ultimately the film does not work, though some of the insights are inspiring.

Throughout the film you get the strong feeling that they are trying to make converts to some strange cult. The longer it went on the more uneasy I felt. It felt like a film intended to brainwash people with weak minds.
After watching it I did some research and found out this film really is an indoctrination video for a religious group previously unknown to me.
There really is no good reason to like or watch this film, unless you are already brainwashed.

Also notice the reviews are mostly 5 star, then 1 star. If its just an ordinary science documentary, how come people are flocking to Amazon to give it a glowing 5 star review?

Within the movie, they document the work of Masaru Emoto, and his work with water.  Essentially, they talk about how thoughts can influence reality.  Positive thoughts can influence positive crystal formations within water, whereas negative thoughts can influence horrid looking crystal formations.

Unfortunately, the writers use that as little more than a launch pad to promote a lot of unfounded metaphysical gobbledy-gook. It is, ultimately, just another version of ""The Secret"" only with the audacity to tie it to Quantum Theory.
The opening sequences give an elementary intro to Quantum Theory which leads the viewer to assume that it will be an easily digestible exploration of complex theories and how they may engender a greater understanding of our place in the Universe. This hope is unfortunately unrealized as the movie then takes you through a repetitive series of 'interviews' with people who are already invested in metaphysical beliefs that have no basis in science.

The movie was created by the ""Ramtha School of Enlightenment"" in order to sell their new age ideas to a gullible public. They talk to some respected scientists, then edit their conversations so it sounds like they're in agreement with what the producers are talking about.

Some of the most egregious errors are on Dr. Emoto's work, how meditation can reduce violent crime and how quantum physics implies that consciousness is the ground of all being. But the producers are counting on the general public not knowing anything about quantum physics or basic science and therefore they can make up any crap they want to link their view with the scientific.

197483,4,1582704708,"I found this film to be fascinating and a fine introduction into the mystery of human consciousness.  I have always been intrigued by the spiritual implications of quantum theory and the recent scientific studies in genetics and brain development.  While I applaud the film in these respects, I was concerned by the somewhat glib remarks directed at the religions of the world.  While the various traditions have contributed to ignorance and violence through the centuries that is not the fault of the religious systems thesmelves so much as those who distort the essence of their traditions that lead to such perversity.  I would remind the sceintists that their understanding of God from science tells us very little about the God some speak of.  For Christianity, its a mix bag.  Sure, there are folks in the various denominations who give lie to the Father of Jesus Christ. However, the essence of the tradition is the transformational power of love, forgiveness and redemption--is that something bad?  Also, science itself is not free of sin is it?  Nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and so on clearly point us to the conclusion that the source of peace and a more human world rests on the decision for people to surrender to the Divine will of sacrifical love for the other and the creation.  There is no other way out of the mess.

I also found the spritual monism of new age thinking a bit too dangerous.  To suggest that there are no caetgories of good and evil is a dangerous idea.  It is one thing to speak of this in a post-mortal life, it is another to posit it from this world that has witnessed the countless horrors of war, genocide and the like.  We need to be careful with this. Clealry, this film accepts a more Eastern view of reality as is found in quantum physics, noting that appreance is illusion--panthesim. But what about the Western traditions of prophetic religion and revelation?

So, the film was good but flawed.  In the end, most people when speaking of God want a God who is accessible in prayer, God calls people to do the good and resist evil.  They want a God who they can address in and I-Thou dialogue as the compassionate One, not some vague force of possibilites only.",1301616000,,2209,4.698701298701299
197484,1,1582704708,"Though I am very a-spiritual, I am not opposed to the discussion of spiritual or mystical ideas. I am not bothered by people's belief in such things. I am, however, deeply bothered by attempting to support such ideas with fraudulent science. If you have a commitment to your spiritual ideas, then cool. But please don't pretend that physics has anything to say (along the lines of either proof or disproof) about these ideas.

What upsets me is that people with a genuine and sincere interest in science will be so radically misled by this film. The central idea espoused by the film is that conscious observation alters reality, and that with training/practice/belief/whatever one's mere thoughts can start to actively influence the outcome of events. First of all, does observation affect the universe around us? Yes -- but that's implicit in the classical physics of Isaac Newton. In classical physics, one can typically regard the observation process as negligibly affecting the observed system, while in quantum theory one cannot. What of it? The mystical content here is zero. Secondly, does observation ""collapse"" the wavefunction of a system and cause it to ""choose"" amongst different potentialities? This isn't known. It's not even clear what the question means, since ""observation"" has no precise meaning in the conventional quantum theory.

Yet like so many other careless and uncritical thinkers, the filmmakers and so-called ""experts"" claim that this vagueness of the conventional theory proves/implies that our brains/souls/whatever are somehow responsible for birthing concrete reality from the misty birth-canal of superposed quantum potentialities. Here is some news for those of you who don't know: the scientific evidence for this assertion is quite literally zero. In fact, the central examples brought up in the film (the double-slit experiment, etc.) are completely described in an intelligible way by well-known deterministic quantum theories, such as the non-relativistic de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory, in which ""observation"" and ""consciousness"" play no role whatsoever. What about relativistic quantum theories? Well, we don't know. Quantum field theory has spectacular successes in describing certain elements of the world, but it's fair to say that physicists don't really understand much of the meaning or ontology behind the calculations. The fundamental principles of the relativistic theory are inconsistent and not understood. By anybody. Most certainly including the filmmakers.

The film also demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of other features of quantum reality. Consider the photograph showing the simultaneous existence of a particle at two points. Think about this for a moment. Even if you take the film's point of view seriously, you will conclude that the simultaneous existence of a particle at multiple locations is an a priori *unobservable* superposition of potentialities, with the particle having no ""concrete"" realistic existence until somebody ""looks"" and the particle ""decides"" where to be (with the particle apparently carefully weighing all the different advice from the various brains observing this phenomenon). So if this superposition of potentialities defies observation or measurement until it is graced by the presence of a conscious mind, whereupon the superposition ceases to ""exist"" and a single location is ""chosen"", how can there be a photograph of this superposition? The ineptness of the film (and any so-called scientist who presents things in this way) is truly embarrassing.

Details aside, my big question is this: how exactly is it that our incomplete and misunderstood ontological picture of quantum theory provides evidence for such a fanciful worldview as offered in the film? Well, it pretty clearly does not, and in my opinion the film is utterly outrageous. I don't mind some of the speculations, which even some very great quantum physicists have had. But the film doesn't present this stuff as speculation at all -- it's presented as virtual hard-science in support of mystical ideas. If you would like to see a serious and knowledgeable scientist grapple with mystical/spiritual ideas, read about David Bohm. If you would like to study science with no mention of mysticism of spirituality (which is my preference), this clearly isn't the film for you.

Even the film's title is irritating. The title ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" could in principle suggest a critical inquiry into a realm of phenomena for which our current knowledge is pointedly incomplete. I would have enjoyed such a film. Instead, the title is implicitly used repeatedly throughout the film as a thoughtless and disingenuous retort to critical questioning of the scientific claims presented: ""You can't say that I'm wildly wrong -- I mean, what the bleep do we know?"" A line from Futurama comes to mind: ""As Deepak Chopra taught us, quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason.""

If you are fascinated by spiritual/mystical ideas, then please keep learning about them, and connect with other people. The same thing goes for science. But avoid train wrecks like this film, which has only dishonest or banal things to say about both of these areas.",1301097600,12,5232,5.374390243902439
197485,1,1582704708,"""Scientists spend their days confronting what they don't understand...It cannot be that reality depends on our existence"" ---  Lee Smolin

Those words aren't  something the makers of this film have confronted.  If you didn't already know, the producers selectively  edited interviews and stacked arguments to ""explain"" quantum mechanics.  Don't take it more than what it is - a veiled recruitment film for the Ramtha cult.  Look it up people.

Before the 16th century, most people's thoughts said the universe revolved around the Earth.  Thanks to Nicolaus Copernicus we know we simply revolve around an ordinary star.  Our thoughts did not cause this to happen, it has been this way for nearly 5 billion years.
Before modern humans, dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions upon millions of years.  Their thoughts did not create homosapiens, we rose into being in a complex string of chance and time developed genetic advances over the entire 4.5 billion year evolution of the earth - and itself from the elements created in the evolution and death of stars that came before our own solar system.
Before 1923 we didn't know there were other galaxies besides ours.  We didn't create those galaxies in our mind.  They existed long before we did.
Movie disproven, move along.  Go watch an episode of Star Trek instead.

My critical analysis is almost unnecessary.  This is a companion piece to ""the Secret,"" another garbage can of no ideas taking advantage of the weak and ignorant for a buck. The only thing missing in this science fiction story, is Captain Xenu.  But they do have a certified Chiropractor as an ""expert"" witness.  I am not joking.  No, photons do not ""think"" or react to our will.  Scientists don't have the luxury of simply making stuff up to accommodate flawed human senses like these filmmakers - that is the job of religion and that is what this movie is all about.  Phenomena covered in this film are glossed over with amazingly simplistic explanations.  Quantum mechanics is the most powerful triumph in the history of science.  It is also incredibly complicated and every great mind in the field from its inception has struggled with the theory to this very day.  An aspect of QM, and proven in practice, says in the world of the smallest pieces of matter and energy, no precise amount can be absolutely known - in effect, the aspect of measuring the object disturbs it's state so we can only know the general idea of a state - though thanks to people like Feynman - we can know it to an astounding degree of accuracy.  The movie doesn't confront that side of it.  Nope this movie is about how your thoughts create reality.  So even though billions of people have lived and died - their thoughts with them - why can I sit here and type this review?

Ploys like this film aim to label science as some monolithic sovereignty we never question and propose how mind blowing something is we don't know the answer to and then propose we can control it with consciousness.  If science was all nonsense made of our own minds, cell phones, computers, satellites, MRI, GPS and even the DVD this is printed to would never have been made.  The human mind did not create the universe, it is a consequence of it.

This Jedi mind trick is engaged without any serious authority or serious debate.  It's just a bunch of new agey feel goodness advertising the old ANTHROPIC principle for the profit of a bunch of fruit cakes called Ramtha.  Alchemy, eugenics and this all go together nicely in the great big book of bleeping bull.  Also, to the people who thinks this movie is smart - it isn't.  This is the equivalent of a dictionary where all the spelling is wrong -- please look into topics covered in the film on your own time. If you watch this film and don't realize by the end you've been hoodwinked by an infomercial, then you are beyond help.

So despite the title of ""What the bleep do we know..."" the movie does love to dole out explanations. That's usually the sort of irony you hear in a church revival just before they hand out the collection plate. In short, obviously this is a negative, and sarcastic, review and there is no use in beating a dead horse.  You'll get more positive mental development from carbon monoxide poisoning.  However, if your mind gets a workout from this stuff, then you'd also be blown away to know that an ice cube is just frozen water.  WOW.",1300233600,7,4389,4.672750977835723

Clearly this movie is a 'love it or hate it' sort of affair with very little middle ground. (Just look at the hugely bimodal distribution, with lots of 1 star and lots of 5 star ratings.)

But there *is* middle ground. The amazing spooky world of quantum mechanics has so much richness of interpretation that scientists in the field are still arguing over it.

This movie provides a service to the lay public in that it engages them in the world of science. If a few of these people become scientists rather than metaphysical practicioners, then we're all better off for it. If the language of quantum mechanics enters the public lexicon, it opens doors. Is a little knowledge a dangerous thing? Perhaps in for some hapless individuals, but for society, no. We emerged from a little knowledge and now we have more. A thousand years in the future everything we know now will fill a thimble in comparison to the ocean of wisdom since achieved.

There is plenty of reason to suspect that effects like universal quantum entanglement (everything started at the big bang, so everything is still connected in terms of its quantum field), can play a role in consciousness. The example I like to use is in the form of a set of questions: How many electrons does it take to fire a neuron? What causes an 'inspiration' in the conscious mind? Can a single electron circulating at just the right location in my mind, quantum entangled with one in yours, trigger a pattern in my cerebral cortex when you have a certain thought that triggers a similar pattern in your cerebral cortex?

This movie raises many such questions and then leaps into bold answers that have little rational justification or reproducible evidential support.

197507,3,1582704708,"I saw What the Bleep many years ago and recently viewed this extended version. Most of the reviews here fall generally into two categories; those who are searching for and finding herein a confirmation for the notion that it's super cool that we create our own reality, and those who take up the ""real science"" camp position or who may have a more refined understanding of quantum physics and know that the application of quantum mechanics to consciousness is still possibly quite the quantum leap.  Unfortunately, this latter group suffers from much of the same extreme thinking as the former group; the former not engaging in enough critical thinking, and the latter claiming that it's all pseudoscience by non-scientists. Neither of these extremes is anywhere near accurate.

For me, there were some real gems in this movie. The cartoon demonstration with Dr. Quantum of the double slit experiments was the best description I've ever seen of them. I wish something this amenable to common sense was available to me any of the many times I had to suffer through abstract explanations of this model in school. In fact, I think that the film makers should rent/license this segment of the film to universities. Once students gain this common sense understanding of these experiments, then the math of it becomes easy. This appreciation goes doubly for the great graphics explanations of neural networks and the neurochemical feedback from the cells demanding satiation [and who doesn't love a Polish wedding]. This is a reasonable and literature supported model of cognition and addiction that is presented here in a way that is completely accessible and very well done. I have often referred people in my care to this segment of What the Bleep? because it's such a great explanation of neural networks and the relationships among brain, belief and behavior, and I feel it's handled even better in this extended edition of the film. My best friend, an academic physicist, said to me a couple of decades ago that science is completely amenable to common sense understanding. We all interact with science all day long in every common thing we do. If someone can't understand science it's because the scientist has failed to properly explain it. I have found this to be absolutely true as it relates to my field of biology. These two demonstrations in this film are excellent teachings of REAL science.

I'm one who bristles regularly at the new agers around me who chirp on about quantum physics and yet wouldn't know Schrodingers cat if it threw up a hairball on them. But I take even more exception to the critics writing here who dismiss everyone in the film as pseudo scientists, or non-scientists, with the exception of the real scientists who supposedly all complained about being misrepresented in the film. Really? Candace Pert is not a real scientist? She was only the director of an NIH lab and discovered the enkaphalin [opiate] receptor. Amit Goswami? He was only a distinguished professor of quantum mechanics for three decades, and wrote two text books [one used on the graduate level] on quantum mechanics. Just because these have retired from their establishment positions doesn't detract from their entire lifetime of experience as scientists, and people who have said such things as ""not currently earning a paycheck in a scientific job"" as a credible critique of their appearance are merely taking cheap shots. I guess Einstein's not a real scientist either because he's so retired he's dead. Stuart Hameroff? Are you kidding me? This guy is *currently* testing a hypothesis that the collapse of the wave function occurs in the cytoskeletal proteins of the neural microtubules, and therefore, that consciousness *is* the collapse of the wave and it occurs in these brain structures. This hypothesis is co-authored by Roger Penrose for heaven's sake, the all but sainted Oxford mathematician and physicist, and the math of it - especially the temperature issue, is currently being duked out in those circles. The Google corporation is sponsoring a meeting on their campus this coming October [2010] on this very issue of robust quantum effects in warm biological systems, at which Hameroff will participate. This is a truly hot topic in neurology right now, developed by Hameroff's decades of experience as a physician and anaesthesiologist. In the film he articulates very reasonable ideas about the interface between quantum effects and brain microarchitecture.

All the bruhaha in these comments about the real scientists all complaining about their appearances is false. Yes, David Albert complained about his appearance, but both Pert and Goswami list their appearances on their websites. Hameroff, in answering a critical review of the movie in Scientific American, told people to lighten up because entertainment often opens minds to new ideas. And it is also a false claim made here that many of the presenters in the movie are affiliated with the Ramtha School of Enlightenment [the film makers are RSE affiliated]. Only Joe Dispenza seems to have an actual relationship to RSE, which is unfortunate because he's a smart guy who well articulates brain learning systems. Others, such as Goswami and Hagelin have been invited speakers at RSE but are not otherwise involved. An ex-student of RSE, a neuroscientist, invited them to speak when he was with the school, but as he discusses in a film clip on Factnet dot org, none ever joined or taught there. IMO, the problem with the ""science camp"" reviewers here is that they can't curb their dogma long enough to remember that all the current scientific ideas once came from people thinking way outside the box, and that this is exactly how science moves forward. Scientists are often not afraid of exchanging ideas with others who challenge their assumptions about reality, and in doing so, a scientist does not lose credibility. These scientists have not lost their credibility just because they have exchanged thoughts in a public way with meditators, or disembodied entities or other scientists who are attempting to apply the experimental method to psychic phenomenon. The ideas about consciousness as a quantum phenomena pondered in this movie are deeply provocative, not just to new agers. Listen to Roger Penrose in the movie A Brief History of Time based on Hawking's work; he ponders this relationship between quantum findings and consciousness. So our BEST scientific thinkers think about these things and feel there is a worthy connection.

As for the Ramtha issue, well yeah, that's big time problematic for me. It's not even so much the channeling of a disembodied entity, but there's just so much information about JZ Knight being such a scam and RSE being a truly abusive cult that it fatally burdens this film with baggage making it too difficult to define the film as a documentary. Although it is not true as claimed here that the film can then be deconstructed to be little more than a support for her cult's views because we hear nothing in the film of some of RSE's teachings that evil lizard aliens will come and defeat our world and that only her initiates will survive because they've tunneled into copper-lined caves where the lizard aliens cannot find them. My main problem with the film is that I take huge exception with the conflation made by the movie's premise that consciousness as a quantum event means that science and spirituality have met, which is obviously the whole sell of the movie. There is absolutely nothing necessarily spiritual about any of this, even if it is shown that consciousness is a quantum event, even if it is shown that consciousness is the observer and can influence the eventual collapse of superposition and that it is the mechanism through which entanglement unfolds. If these things prove true, it means that the brain is awesome which still has nothing to do with left over church fables about a god or about a spirit.",1282435200,423,7953,5.0174110522331565

The whole movie can be summed up as:

""Quantum Theory is 'really cool' - because this means we can create our own reality.""

The movie is nothing more than a constant repeat of this mantra - there is no depth to it and and you won't get any new ""insights"" beyond the statement ""We create our own reality"". Let alone that quantum physics and whatever comes with it is seen in more scientific light.

The movie rather seems to be some kind of ""feel good"" movie based on the wonders of quantum physics - however, also from a philosophical point of view the movie stays very, very shallow.

What i also found very odd is that we see a bunch of people interviewed, each of them stating their amazement upon this ""exciting new quantum physics and what it means for our reality"" - however i have NOT the slightest idea who those people are. Are those scientists, philosophers or simply new age people?

I have participated in online discussions which had more depth and which were more interesting than this movie.

I think the movie is only interesting for people who never heard about quantum physics and its philosophical ramifications...but it is far too shallow if you really become interested in that subject and want to know more. What has been said in the movie could have been fit into a 10 min clip - the movie NEVER goes beyond those basic ideas. Sad. I hope the second movie is better.",1280275200,2,1447,4.521072796934866

The overall effect was a distinct impression that you were watching an infomercial.  A barrage of distorted facts attempting to persuade you to believe a theory that you really want to believe.

I was shocked and amazed by those who gave it low ratings, and would justify that rating by attacking and tearing apart minutiae details used to illustrate an idea being presented, (e.g., the story of the Native Americans being unable to see the Spanish ships approaching the coast, etc.)  Some of the reviews included what seemed to be an attempt at character assassination of some of the spokespersons in the movie.

My first viewing was the theatrical release version - to which I reacted with awe and wonder.  Then, I watched the hyper-extended version - MORE awe and wonder.  It seemed as if most of the negative reviews were based mostly on the theatrical released version.  Many of the criticisms revolved around an idea that the film was somehow attempting to indoctrinate its viewers to some religion or cult.

My opinion - nothing could be further from the truth about this film.  If anything, many of the discussions and scenes presented actually were highly critical of traditional religions and the way they are typically practiced, pointing out how most religions fall very short of providing any real meaning or insight to its followers.  There was ABSOLUTELY NO SINGLE RELIGION OR SPIRITUALITY THAT WAS PRESENTED, IN BOTH VERSIONS OF THE MOVIE, THAT WAS PROMOTED AS THE END-ALL AND BE-ALL TO RELIGION OR SPIRITUALITY. If anything, this movie encouraged the viewer to question religion.

Interwoven with the above, the movie gave the viewer a crash course in quantum mechanics to bring one up to speed on our current understanding, and did this using various examples, including a clever cartoon about Professor Quantum in ""Quantum World"", helping the layperson to understand its basic principles.  It also reviewed some quandaries in physics, such as ""reversal-time symmetry"" that still baffle physicists today.  I felt it did a great job in explaining the history of Dualism, and how it split human understanding of our universe into the ""seen"" and ""unseen"", or clock-work mechanistic world versus a spiritual world.

And finally, the main theme of the movie is presented, i.e., that our knowledge of physics and the physical world actually does allow for Free Will and spirituality, and that the world is not as mechanistic, or deterministic, as it may seem.  In the end, the movie leaves the viewer feeling more empowered, spiritual, and self-confident in one's own consciousness than previously, but without any sense of being manipulated into one religion or another.",1258243200,3,2691,5.040632054176072

197558,3,1582704708,"Do you know what Einstein said about Quantum Physics? He said; ""All my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundation of physics to this new type of knowledge failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under me"". And; ""The quanta really are a hopeless mess"". Einstein was mightily humbled by the vast implications. The quanta are a hopeless mess from a classical Newtonian perspective because it appears random or limitless in expression, and the results of endless controlled experiments prove beyond any doubt that the thoughts and intentions of the observer profoundly effect the results. This film, in an imaginative way, explores the possible implications of the quantum field. I wish I could say that I really like this film, but I applaud the attempt, I think it's on the right track. There are many who see an exciting new Renaissance in physics on the horizon that will change everything. For example, do you know that subatomic particles have been consistently detected that appear and disappear, seemingly to bi-locate (you know, like Star Trek), and is not even subject to our concept of linear time (that part is really deep). And do you know that in the last decade+ within established circles it has become overwhelmingly accepted that all matter is energy, and is almost entirely empty space. And the sum total of all solid matter in the entire universe could be contained within a particle smaller than a quark, called a singularity or infinite density. This calculation, being so unimaginably close to zero solid matter should act as a big hint. It points to an illusion created by the quantum field, directed by consciousness(which does not imply only an individuals consciousness), for the purpose of providing an experience for the observer. Does that seem too far-out for you? Congratulations,.....you are in the majority. If it was an election you would be on the winning side........ A little clarification may be useful to some. The word illusion as it is used here isn't meant to imply that physical matter isn't real, only that it isn't what it appears to be. Also, the word observer merely denotes a unit of consciousness within the field, and not necessarily or exclusively any particular process that may be associated with the word. And most importantly, the term empty space is only meant to refer to the absence of separate and solid matter. There is actually no such thing as empty space, all is full and inseparable. The exchange of information through consciousness creates vortices, also called torsion fields, that produces the illusion of borders or a separation of matter. This intelligent self-organizing effect, called a fractal feedback dynamic, is all that exists ultimately, and there is not and can not be any separation between anything..... Bare in mind the words of a marvelous philosopher ""All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed, second it is violently opposed, and third, it is accepted as self-evident."" Arthur Schopenhauer 1850 ....... My point being, this is more than just science.",1247788800,7,3082,5.045098039215686

197579,5,1582704708,"I saw this movie & was impressed at the way science & spirituality are meeting. Being a student of quantum (small particle) physics and if you watch carefully you will see that some scientists don't like to go there but have reached the point where science, mysticism & philosophy meet. If you are old school you will poo poo this, if you are willing to take a leap you might find new possibilities to become aware of. Consider that Todays Physics was yesterdays Meta-physics (Meta - meaning other than normal). I understand the unwillingness of some people (as evidenced by negative reviews) to take that jump, it can be disconcerting and scary to entertain the possibility that our old paradigms are shifting, many many new researchers are criticized initially & over time they become accepted i.e. Galileo, at least they aren,t killing the new thinkers today. I used to meditate A LOT & have experienced a full blown OUT OF BODY experience, have seen 3 AURAS very clearly & have seen what I would call a HOLOGRAM of a black panther head appear in front of me while scrying in a mirror. Also my wife has had two different completely unrelated people in different parts of our state both say out verbally & clearly the name Esmerelda as a female energy/guide or whatever name you want to call it that is around her. All these events were very clear/real and not fuzzy shmuzzy sort of experiences. Quantum physics does support/lend credence to the mechanics of these experiences i.e. entanglement, superposition, Copenhagen interpretation etc are related to consciousness. I was raised in a very scientific household & all I can say is that most people go by what they know until something of an aberration or mutation happens in ones experience to allow for new possibilities. People often say ""how come I didn't have an experience?"", and I say ""You never even looked"". to say it hasn't happened or doesn't exist doesn't mean it doesn't or won't. You are involved & have to participate, or not.  Relating to the movie, I felt it was a good experience for those who want to open up to science meets spirituality. A funny note that sciences own investigations are showing that science is limited & just as much an institution as any. Bashing new ideas that threaten the old dominant paradigms is what people seem to need to do at first. Remember lots of those paradigms were bashed at one time to. OLD SCHOOL says Energy first then matter & somehow consciousness came about. NEW SCHOOL says energy, matter & consciousness are ONE. Thank goodness for pioneers of science & spirit.

197591,2,1582704708,"Amanda (Marlee Matlin) is a divorced photographer under the influence of prescription medication to control her anxiety takes this incredible journey through so called rabbit hole in search for physical reality. She runs on the beach of the Caribbean seeing the ships of Columbus approach the shores of the new world for the first time with a native American who has never seen a ship; she plays basketball with a kid who ask ""how far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?"" in a vague reference to the superposition of several wave functions of an object (s) and conscious observer that crystallize physical reality (according to Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics). She stands in an airport taking pictures of air travelers; attends a wedding, the reception and finds that she hates weddings, she hates herself for trusting guys, being cheated upon, and lost love. She expresses rage at the sight of infidelity and her utter disappointment in married life. She lives with a room mate named Jennifer (Elaine Hendrix) who is friendly and loveable, but Amanda is unhappy in life, then what exactly is she looking for in life? She is searching for the soul, pure consciousness, and meaning of life (reality and existence.) She is not a physicist, and utters very few words in the movie which are not intelligible and her strange accent makes it difficult to understand her. Yet the scene is set for experts to give their opinion on quantum reality and consciousness in a PBS style documentary similar to NOVA. Experts in quantum physics include, Amit Goswami, Fred Alan Wolf, and few others; and neurobiologists include; Stuart Hameroff, Candace Pert, and few others.

Amit Goswami dwells on wave - particle duality of quantum physics and reality in terms of possibilities (should have been probabilities). One commentator states that God is a superposition of realities (probably because he is the ultimate conscious observer, who happens to see everything in the universe,) but there is a little question that gets unanswered; what reality is the expert talking about? Quantum reality as explained by Copenhagen school of thought? Another commentator observes that we all are connected to the universe at the most fundamental level but doesn't elaborate.

Cells are the smallest unit of consciousness, but the panel of experts doesn't say if consciousness exists in lower animals and plant kingdom. Roger Penrose elsewhere states that consciousness exists in lower animals but he doesn't know how far down the ladder it goes (1). Erwin Schrodinger in his book ""What's Life"" states that consciousness exists in all animal species (2). Some philosophers claim that plants also have consciousness because a living cell is the basic foundation for central nervous system and consciousness.

The movie refers to the work of Masaru Emoto which purportedly show that good words, good music, and blessings on water results in good crystals upon cooling is really absurd (3). The animated neural cells during the dance at the wedding reception are perhaps boring and a love making scene is totally inappropriate when discussing serious physics. If you are planning to understand physical (quantum) reality and consciousness by watching this movie you will be disappointed.

197608,5,1582704708,"I was unaware as to the extent that this movie has been in the popular media in the recent years since it came out in 2004. I stumbled upon it while looking for videos about quantum physics on YouTube after one of my college professors got me into this stuff. My initial impression was sheer fascination. I have been getting into a lot of this New Age self help stuff over the past few years and, as well, I'm very well read in the areas of personal communications, psychology, and spirituality. I'm all about broadening my awareness of my reality and the world around me. I think that knowledge is the ultimate key to everything in life. This is quite possibly the most encompassing piece of education you can get in under two hours. The amount of enlightenment crammed into this presentation is incredible. I would recommend this to anyone of any age as an absolute must see.

Now for the other part of my review. As I said, I was unaware that so many people have been exposed to this film because only one person that I know has heard of it. I didn't read any of the reviews until just now as I am writing this. Apparently, there are many people who are trying to discredit the validity of this film due to many factors including a lack of ""real scientists"" and relevant contributers, the oversimplification and misinterpretation of the science regarding sub-atomic particles, a misinterpretation of the philosophical meaning of quantum science, and the inclusion of J.K. Knight, otherwise known to her so-called ""followers"" as 'Rithma,' a mysticis who claims that she channels her being from a 35,000 year old Atlantian warrior.

In my opinion, only the truth matters. The subject matter covered in this presentation may have been oversimplified but the ordinary person does not have the time to study this kind of science in any detail because we all have are own individual fields of study that occupy the majority of our lives. To give this movie one star and to criticize its intention and cast it aside as just another cultish New Age pop-psychology film is incredibly unfair not just to the people who helped make the film possible but to anyone considering watching it. I sincerely hope that anyone who has read any of the bad reviews will still give this movie a chance. I do, however, appreciate the skeptics who have attempted to tare this movie this apart.

197611,1,1582704708,"Any Amazon buyers who are thinking of purchasing this DVD are strongly encouraged to first go and do some checking on the Internet about this movie and its background. What you find out may or may not surprise you.

I didn't check deeply enough, and regret the money I spent on buying this DVD. I watched only one side of the three double-sided discs (the original theatrical version) and then filed it away under ""DVDs to be pawned off at my local record/video shop"". I will not watch the other five sides of the discs, and that is something very unusual for me as a regular Amazon buyer.

Don't get me wrong: Marlee Matlin does a decent job of holding up the ""drama"" side of the film and there is lots of humor, intriguing testimony and amazing graphics in the ""documentary"" side of ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"". But after watching this movie just one time, the word FISHY kept coming up in my mind. I went on the Internet and did some searching, and found out why.

What the filmmakers of ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" do not tell you in the film's trailer and in the film itself is that they, the filmmakers, as well as some of the interviewees, are affiliated with the mega-million-dollar organization founded by JZ Knight, famous for her channeling of a 35,000-year-old spirit named Ramtha. Her organization is based in the rural city of Yelm, Washington state -- the same city where ""What the Bleep"" was first premiered and where the producers of the film are reported to be based.

What the filmmakers also don't tell you (but which you will find out if you check around on the Internet) is that one of the credible sources in the film has completely denounced ""What the Bleep"" and the way his interview was misrepresented to promote the film's premise. The filmmakers also will not tell you that there are a number of people (including Knight's late ex-husband) who have left her organization and called it little more than a cult in New Age clothing. This is distressing.

Spirituality is one thing, but deceit is quite another. We all want more spirituality in our lives. But we need to be cautious and selective about this because there are just as many so-called New Age organizations out there that will take our money as quickly as some mainstream Christian churches will.

Which is exactly why I give this film the same low rating of ""1"" that I gave to the DVD ""George W. Bush: Faith in the White House"". If there is one thing worse than being conned by a bunch of true-believing, right-wing Christian fundamentalists, it is being duped by a group of true-believing New Agers who align themselves with left-wing causes (see ""What the Bleep's"" website store for examples). I would give both the Bush and Bleep DVDs a rating of zero if I could.

To be fair, JZ Knight and Ramtha are given only a few cameo appearances in this film. But those appearances are just enough to weave their way into the scientific dialogue and dramatic acting scenes to give Knight, the millionaire spirit-channeler, some much-needed credibility in the movie. Plus, hers is the only ""non-expert"" interview featured in the film, making you wonder why she's even in this movie in the first place. Again, the filmmakers make no mention whatsoever in the film of their connections to Knight and her organization.

But the good news is that spiritually hungry people everywhere are waking up and smelling the coffee. Using their brains, people are increasingly coming to tell the difference between true, dedicated people of spirit, like the Dalai Lama of Tibet, and fishy facsimiles. Buyers in the New Age marketplace are not the only ones who should beware -- channeled spirits also have to be on guard for the growing numbers of human beings who are thinking more deeply before spending their hard-earned money on movies like this.

If you must buy this DVD, then at least first spend some time on the Internet checking out this film's background. If you decide to buy it after that, well, it is up to you. At least consider yourself a forewarned (and wiser) consumer for having read this.

Enough said. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to shut down my computer and go out for a long, quiet walk in nature -- where I'm more likely to encounter Spirit in its purest form than I would in this film.",1223337600,11,4290,4.640316205533597

2. Masaro Emoto's work does not follow the scientific method.

197613,4,1582704708,"When ""What the Bleep Do You Know"" came to the theatre, I was almost alone in the audience.  I told a lot of my friends about it; and the second time I went there were seven of us in the audience, six of whom I knew.  So this was not well publicized in our small city, but still drew people to it.  Had it played more than a week, perhaps we'd have had a dozen!  I recently saw a used copy and decided to add it to my collection.

I really enjoyed this docu-drama.  I found the use of actors, scientists and animation to have enough diversity to keep my attention.  It was both informative and entertaining.  Marlee Matlin won an Oscar & Golden Globe for ""Children of a Lesser God"" in 1986.  She does good work as Amanda who has come out of a marriage with an unfaithful husband and chip on her shoulder.  Her houseguest Jennifer is played by the perky Elaine Hendrix, who gets to foot paint.  I also thought John Ross Bowie as Eliot that Amanda meets while she photographs a wedding did a nice job.

The subject matter intrigues me.  As I've thought about this film, I keep considering how our expectations color our perceptions.  If you ever heard a record by Harry Nilsson called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Point-Deluxe-Packaging/dp/B000077SX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Point! (Deluxe Packaging)</a>, I keep recalling, ""You see what you want to see; and you hear what you want to hear.""  In much that same way, if we work to make our thinking positive, I believe we perceive the positive aspects of things happening around us and draw more positive things to us.  I particularly was impressed when I watched the DVD how one scientist planned his day.  I've been trying to work with this idea, thinking about being positive and loving with the people with whom I'm in contact, even praying for those where disagreements seem to persist.  My experience is that when I do this, I have a better day!

I was also very impressed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Urantia-Book/dp/0911560513/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Urantia Book</a>&nbsp;how it says that thoughts are things.  We know although it's not able to be seen, air is a thing.  For those of us living in the hurricane belt, we know air (wind) can be destructive.  In the same way, I think this film illustrates the chemical counterparts of thought in the brain.  Just like air can be positive and life-giving or destructive and life-taking, I believe the consequences of thought can also be similar.  Yet few work to seriously address the quality of their thinking.

When I watch this film, I don't perceive it as having to believe everything in it before I can get something from it.  Parts of it have relevance to me, particularly I'm in a bit different place in 2008 than I was when the film came out in 2004.  So I recommend this film.  I seem to get new things as I watch it over time.  Enjoy!",1222819200,5,2963,4.893574297188755

What The Bleep Do We Know isn't a DVD for scientists; it's for everyday people who want to understand how the human mind works to help create our day-to-day lives. Think of What The Bleep as The Secret under a fascinating scientific microscope.

My husband and I watched this DVD for the third time last night and we were both taking notes. I have five pages of notes and ""aha's."" If you're ready to change negativity into possibility thinking, I suggest it's time to watch What The Bleep Do We Know.

Marlee Matlin plays the main character Amanda who is negative, angry and stressed. In Amanda's life, the glass is always half empty. Through a series of eye-opening ""coincidences"" she begins to see how her life can be more content, fulfilled and satisfying.

This DVD is a wonderful lesson about quantum physics and the human mind disguised as a well-made Hollywood movie. Every assertion made in What The Bleep Do We Know is backed up by scientific fact and explained in very colorful and interesting detail.

If you're ready to understand the scientific ""secret"" of your mind and how it literally creates the world around you, I highly recommend What The Bleep Do We Know. I believe though, you have to be in the right place at the right time in your life to truly appreciate the power of this message.

The biggest lesson I learned: We literally create our own possibilities.",1222387200,15,1719,4.564935064935065
197617,1,1582704708,"Recently, on a visit from my mother-in-law, I was surprised that she wanted to take me and my wife to see a documentary film about `quantum physics'. The surprise came from the fact that she is far more won't to New Agey beliefs than either of us. The film was called What the #$*! Do We Know? After seeing it I understand why my mother-in-law was interested in this `physics film'- because it's not about physics.  Instead, it's a propaganda film put out by a cult headed by a bovine blond woman named JZ Knight, who's claimed for decades that she channels the spirit of a 35,000 year old warrior from Atlantis named Ramtha. Yet, it's not even a clever little film as propaganda, because it's so poorly edited, atrociously acted, and inanely backdropped against a dozen or so talking heads of the sort that usually delineate documentaries. Except, there's a difference. These talking heads go uncredited until the end of the film because they are all charlatans and quacks. The film also had three directors- William Arntz, Betsy Chasse, and Mark Vicente- who just happen to be Ramtha cultists. Worse, the film's a mess- all that spiritualism and not a dram of creativity? This is not like New York Stories where three great directors- Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese- did three small films that were independent. This film is tripartite, but interspersed like water, oil, and- oh- New Age bilge. It's part faux documentary, part lame Junior High/Industrial film, part psychedelic cartoon. Tag team directing, yet no one in charge.
 This film is a combination of bad art, and emotional and intellectual dishonesty- the very reason they do not give the names and backgrounds of the `experts' until the end. The problem is not that the film has no answers to the questions it posits, but the questions, themselves, are asked with annoying smirks by condescending fakers who seem contented with their own superiority, and ignorance. Here's hoping rationality still has a place in President Bush's world (grimace).",1222214400,6,2034,4.944444444444445

197619,2,1582704708,"This movie presents an odd mix - a positive personal outlook with scientific substrate. The writers draw on brain imagining, neurochemistry, and quantum physics. Using those bases, they describe how the intention to feel a certain way or to have specific events occur comes from a personal choice. That in turn changes the body, the physical substance of the mind, to reinforce those feelings. It's a positive and empowering message.

The problem is, they distort or simply invent the science to support their message. Yes, in a common interpretation, the quantum wave function collapses when the observer measures the phenomenon (creating profound philosophical quandaries). That does not imply that happy thoughts affect the outcome of that collapse. There's some unsound biology, as well, too much to go into.

On the whole, this comes across as a gram of genuine fact diluted in liters of wishful thinking.

""The real trick to life is not to be in the know, but to be in the mystery,"" is one of the many brilliant thoughts you'll hear throughout, as an abundance of teachers and scientists give their view on the meanings of life. The concepts and applications of science and spirituality do come together throughout this movie, and all cleverly woven into a storyline featuring Amanda(Marlee Matlin)as a frustrated photographer who begins to question her own purpose on this earth, and comes to understand, as we all should, how there's always a deeper meaning to everything we experience.

197626,3,1582704708,"This movies tends to create a lot of friction when discussed.  It's easy to see why.  It belongs in the new/re-branded area of mysticism that dresses up in the trappings of modern physics.  Science as a name has belonged to scientists for so long that their not willing to let mysticism use the name just yet.

If you practice Astrology, science of mind, out-of-body travel and so on, this movie is for you.  It validates such pre-existing beliefs with the reputable stamps of ""Science"" and ""Physics"" placed on the box.  The belief-system is now more aesthetically repackaged and can be widely recommended to co-workers throughout the office without being construed as ""hokey"".

If you're this type of person, don't bother preaching it to those co-workers in the engineering department, though.  It won't catch on with them.  Admittedly, I'm one of those guys, but I do understand the appeal.  Those with any actual background in the hard sciences will just scoff at this or demand that their wasted time be refunded through your positive thinking.

I was disappointed when I went to see the movie because I was hoping for a study in Quantum Physics, as the movie is often proclaimed to be such a study.  It's not.  I was hoping to see cool (colorful CGI imagery) examples of sub-atomic particle behavior, the Butterfly Effect, maybe even some of the parallel worlds stuff, and so on (even if that is all stuff widely available on the Discovery channel).  While this movie did touch on those things a tiny bit (maybe not the Butterfly Effect), for the most part, it was about metaphysics, pseudo-psychology and personal sociology.  The movie has a closer relationship with the daily horoscope than with Einstein.

For those of us who prefer that theories be scrutinized and tasked with proof under the scientific method, we really just have to accept the fact that we got something mis-labeled and wasted some time watching it.  There's no point in trying to change the views of the other half.  Trying to get someone who loves this movie to read some Erwin Schroedinger over Uri Geller is a lost cause.

It's geared towards newcomers to the topic, but it fails. Look around on Amazon for highly rated intro-to-quantum-theory books if you're interested in the subject, don't buy this.

Some of these ""scientists"" think we are always in the process of making our own little universes.

Just think positive little one, you'll soon be eating gourmet food and all the caviar you can stand. Then you can run and skip around in your pretty little dress or even fly if you want to.

I would NOT recommend this movie ever. Rent it for $3-4 bucks and save yourself the agitation of feeling jipped.

What I can say is that the most interesting part is when the scientists/experts give their explanations and references of how our minds create our envioronment and how it effects our bodies but it seems to be about 25% of the movie. The rest is unnecessary elongated filming that is supposed to describe/support the experts views. All it is doing is filling up space between experts speaking to make it seem like a full length movie. It didn't seem to match and flow with the experts; not as far as content but presentation.

197635,5,1582704708,"I think that like many theories (science or otherwise) Quantum physics produces a mental model or conceptual model of how reality is. In this case it's a way of visualizing what is happening in the experiments in those particle accelerators. Language, including mathematics (wich is just a language too,) is more or less a set of symbols that point to that wich they are describing. A way to fit what is experienced into a framework we can wrap are heads around. The verification for it, like most theories about how reality works, comes not from the irrefutable proof that our way of thinking of it is the be all end all deepest most complete mental model of the world there is... But rather, it's verification comes from the fact that like any theory that stands the test of time..... It allows for predictions that are consistently congruent with our experience. In other words, they calculate the answer we are looking for, and they do so very well. If it didn't work for practical intents and purposes, we would have moved on to a model that gets the correct predictions. Or at least we'd be trying to move toward one. Like language, mental models of what happens in the sub-atomic realm are not the thing itself to wich it points. But a set of symbols to explain what it is pointing to.

  Does the math behind it being consistent with the results of experiment REALLY mean that matter is spread out in all the probable locations, spins, velocities etc at once like a number matrix? Until a measurement is made? That, I can't tell you. But the equations do seem get the result that agrees with what we experience in experiments.
  But what I DO know is this: In regards to the questions of consciousness....  My EXPERIENCE of what appears to me to be reality ""out there"" is  profoundly effected by MY ""mental model"" of how reality is, and how things are ""supposed to be"". If I become convinced of new way of looking at the way the world is, then regardless of weather my perceptual differences and habit's of thought patterns actually have an effect on the ""out there"" (matter, events, etc) it's undeniably effected the way I'VE experienced that event. Wich for most people is highly relevant to their ability to be happy in the present moment. Does experiencing reality in a new way equate to changing it? Maybe or maybe not. It seems that at this point in the evolution of our consciousness, we can't get out of our finite brains and bodies and experience to test what we experience against ultimate reality, to confirm that it was purely the perceptual, or if some effect on the events was induced by that perception.

  If we (any individual person) choose to be totally honest with ourselves, we will acknowledge that whatever our current world view is, we don't absolutely KNOW that it's the deepest most perfect model of the highest most complete in-alterable truth of everything there is, was or will potentially be. But rather that it is merely the world view that SEEMS to be the most plausible given our current level of consciousness, and the information we have available, and how well we can reduce our bias's when analyzing our experience. And that goes for ANY person and ANY honest assessment of one's one world paradigm. It seems there is always a possibility that a deeper or more complete view of ultimate reality exists than whatever our current one is. Brainwashing oneself to believing that there could be no question that there is any inaccuracy or lack of completeness in ones world view may serve to make that person feel comfortable by taking the out of control feeling that is all to familiar to any person who has searched for a way to exist happily in the world, (wich I deeply empathize with BTW), still, it is not being very honest with oneself unless it is backed by experience. Not necessarily using exclusively a realist/materialist method of experience, but just experience of some kind.

  To me, this movie is mostly about various phenomena of experience (Weather it be quantum mechanics, neuroscience, out of body, or psychic experience, emotional or psychological experience,spiritual experience or WHATEVER type) any phenomenon that makes us keep re-evalutating our ""Paradigm"" or model of how we think different aspects of reality are like. If it changes the reality ""out there"" to look at it in a different or more empowering way, then great. If not, then at least it clearly effects how we live our life, and how happy we are (while we're stuck living in this meat-suit) for the better.  And that seems pretty important to me. Even if the particular world view espoused is later updated, or changed. If a paradigm becomes obsolete, then you move on. That doesn't change the fact that the old paradigm was useful for a time, and helped you get to a new and hopefully better one. And in that way, the old paradigm need not be a time to regret. But rather a time to let go of and move on in light of a new way of understanding your place in existence.",1213228800,3,4997,4.683010262257697
197636,1,1582704708,"I'm not really sure why I'm bothering to review this film.  Except that I heard a woman on the radio the other day referring to this film as if it were a source of knowledge.  This concerns me.  It (like creationism/ID) is another example of the scientific illiteracy in the US.  I'm not going to try to catalog the silliness of this film, but I'll hit some of the ""high"" points.

The main feature of this film is a series of talking heads that spout sound bites that are meant to sound ""scientific"" and mysterious and amazing.  I'm not surprised they don't identify them; why should we listen to anything these people say?  They provide no data and make many bald-faced assertions that are false, misleading, and unsupportable.  They spout fluff like:  ""this requires a whole new science,"" ""we can't explain X,"" ""if you look into it carefully, it's so strange that there's just no way science can explain it,"" ""Heisenberg himself said ...,"" ""scientific experiments have shown ..."" [why do they never cite the journal article for these ""amazing facts?""], ad nauseum.

All this ""information"" is supposed to make you think (at least this is the message I heard):
1. Dualism is true [it's not]
2. You can create your own reality by conscious will [you can't]
3. You can time-travel, change the form of matter, etc. [you can't]
4. Science actually doesn't support naturalism; but rather some kind of new-age spiritualism/mysticism [it doesn't; scientific knowledge supports naturalism in every detail]

The silly non-sequiturs include, primarily:
1. Certain very strange things happen with matter at the subatomic level, therefore they can occur at the middle-world scale of our bodies.  For instance:  the fact that you can't measure both the location and velocity of a subatomic particle at the same time means that the middle-world objects around you don't exist until you observe them.  [We experience is the SUM of trillions of motions of subatomic particles that actually does act just like we perceive it does, on our scale.  The fact that you can't localize an electron does not mean we don't understand the macro (middle-world) behavior of matter very exactly.  People in China do actually exist and live their lives whether you observe them or not.  You may be ignorant of them; but that has no causal effect on their actual existence.]

2. ""X"" is deeply perplexing or difficult to understand, therefore it's a ""mystery,"" therefore something supernatural must be going on, therefore that's somehow comforting.  [""X"" includes (of course!) quantum physics, human consciousness, the subatomic world, etc.  These things are perplexing because our brains evolved to help our DNA replicate in our ""middle-world"" of objects from the size of sand grains to mountains (as opposed to the atomic/subatomic or very large (stars/galaxies/the universe) scale.)  The subatomic world is completely different from middle-world, as is the very large.  We only needed a useful (for propagating DNA) model of the world in our consciousness, not an accurate model of all reality.  Your or my lack of intellectual skills does not warp space-time, nor does it imply or require ANYTHING about the nature of reality.]

3. Science doesn't have the perfect model of how sub-atomic and astro-physical scale events behave, therefore your brain creates its own reality and you can travel backward or forward in time, walk on water or whatever.  [Do I need to even comment?]

4. The mathematics that describe the physical world have a time scale (dimension) that mathematically allows ""motion"" in both directions.  Therefore we can time travel using our minds.  And the corollary:  the direction of time seems real; but is arbitrary and we can't prove why it goes the way it seems to us that it does.  [The first statement is trivial, since math always allows this.  There IS a real direction to time:  It is most forcefully pointed by the increase of entropy of the universe as a whole.]

5. In the past we used to think that the earth was flat, then we thought it was round, now (in the post-modernist miasma of the film) we can't be sure that it really IS round, since we were wrong about it being flat.  [Again, there is a direction to our accumulating real knowledge of the world.  We do know that the earth is round and revolves around the sun, it's not a guess.  And it will be round and revolving long after we are gone.]

The ""dramatized"" parts, that purport to show Marlee Matlin making some kind of ""spiritual journey"" replete with time-travel and Matrix-like special effects, are just amazingly lame.  This film isn't just lame, it's supine.  It doesn't need a cane or a walker, it needs a complete ICU.  The acting is abysmal, as is the dialog.

This film purports to address the ""Big Questions,"" like, why are we here [it's not a question that requires or deserves an answer], how did we get here [we evolved from earlier mammals in Africa], the meaning of life [if there is one it's:  replicate your DNA], the nature of consciousness [If you actually want to learn something, please read ""Consciousness Explained"" by Dennett and Pinker's books on consciousness]:  you know, the usual suspects.  But, again, it just lamely tries to make it all mysterious and pseudo-scientific by innuendo.  This is the very worst kind of new-age fluff and pseudo-science magic that tries to replace the comfort of religion with the comfort of some other sort of supernatural delusion.  As science has found actual, useful, verifiable knowledge about the world/universe/life, the magical ""explanations"" of religion have been replaced.  But most people seem to desire the comfort of religion, mystery, whatever.  This film is the kind of thing that results.  Don't fall for this snake oil.

I know quite a few of you only gave this movie one star. You've pointed out that a lot of what's been covered in the movie is a lot of ""flap doodle."" But let me just go over a few things that have really helped me.
The part of the movie that covered peptides and emotions and how they can physiologically affect us was really fascinating to me. When they talked about how we can be addicted to emotions (whether good or bad) I finally realized that I was addicted to negative thought patterns that I've been aware of for years. These thoughts would bother me and I would try to do my best to think of something else. It was like I had no control over my thoughts or my own mind. I never considered myself an addictive person. I don't do drugs nor do I drink. So, since watching the movie, every time I find myself indulging in negative thoughts I quickly remind myself that I must be addicted to these angry, sad or other negative emotions and I immediately correct myself. I can't explain how self-empowering this has become for me. I can already see a positive difference in my life.
Another point made in the movie also helped me a lot. It has to do with the concept of God and either being punished or rewarded for being a bad or good person. One person said (and I can't remember the exact words) that ""God is the highest elevated spirit within all things. We are God."" And it made me wonder about the concept of our ""higher selves and that perhaps all of our higher selves are connected in someway. I have to admit, it makes me ponder with some enthusiasm as I have been quite disappointed with traditional religions and have become a bit hopeless as to what really is out there for us beyond this life.
I guess, if I were into metaphysics perhaps I'd be disappointed with this movie as well. I would have to say that my perspective is more like a mystic's. I went into watching this movie with a totally open mind, no expectations, and I got so much from it.",1212451200,5,2144,4.283251231527093

You really don't need over 2 and  hours of the same thing over and over.  There is no basic premise other than the world around you is not what it seems and you can create your own reality.  The film takes this topic and spins it in a hundred different possible directions through the use of Marlee Matlin as the goofy curmudgeon of a photographer spliced into a world of meta-physics while a dozen talking heads of worldly experience (doctors, philosophers, engineers, biologists, physicists, spiritualists, etc.) interject what their beliefs are about every day life.

Getting past the long 3-DVD edition, this film does offer some interesting insight into what we see, believe, interpret, recognize, rationalize and live.  There are no limits other than your imagination.  Everything is perspective and perspective is everything.  Can you fit a million little worlds on the head of a pin?  Are we unable to grasp a completely different outer world that we are simply a minute part of?  Can we decide what our day will be like?  Is there a God?  Why do things happen the way they do?  Can we change our lives?  These are just a few of the hundreds of questions tossed about - this film is a nicely choreographed lesson in Philosophy and Quantum physics.  Of course, it is `dumbed down' a bit to appeal to the masses and the commentators are highly respected, if unknown.  At times these `talking heads' can be amazingly acute and at other times, irritatingly hyper-positive!

The film is definitely worthwhile to watch and to ask yourself these same questions.  I kept thinking that most of the jargon was simply the `power of positive thinking'.  Seriously, you can decide whether you are going to act one way or another - or - make it a great day or a lousy day.  It's mostly all choice.  I give the filmmakers and writers great credit for the way they managed to take what most people find as a `dry topic' and turn it into something palatable.  But again, you only need and hour and a half of this, to see the point.  If you truly are interested in meta-psychics, read something by Stephen Hawkin.  He has one of the most amazing perspectives of any human being on this planet.",1211241600,8,2301,4.666666666666667
197644,1,1582704708,"The film's junk spirituality is like salt water--water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink. This movie tries to use the spirituality of religion without its key concepts such as a belief in God (as in the Personal written in the old and new testament).  Not so much as contradicts any doctrine or system of Jewish-Christian thought as it suggests that such doctrines and systems are irrelevant now that we have all these movie special effects juxtaposing early 20th century quantum physics and late 20th century neurobiology.  Somehow a new spiritual thesis founded on a quantum-neurobiological ""science"" is supposed to emerge.  It doesn't.  Also it's a cheap knock-off of the PBS video series THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE (which was just a good film about theoretical physics that wasn't trying to start yet another new age movement).",1210982400,4,833,5.102941176470588

But I watched it with my wife hoping to at least get a layman's introduction to quantum physics.  Maybe there was one somewhere at the end, I don't know-- we couldn't bear watching it all the way through.  Having gotten about two thirds of the way into it, all I can say is applying the thin patina of science to the mysticism that forms the basis of the film only serves to discredit the entire work.

There is a long tradition of taking new scientific theories and building whole new systems of social thought around them.  That's perfectly legitimate as a though experiment.  In this case however, there appears to be an attempt to warp quantum physics into ""proving what we've known all along"".  I find that to be less of an expansion of world view and more of an attempt at justification.

In the end, this is an attempt to conflate two independent concepts that would be better served by independent treatment.  I have nothing against mysticism, and find it every bit as fascinating as physics, but the pablum presented here so offended my scientific nature that I was left more embarrassed than interested.",1210896000,7,1367,4.584362139917696

Some of the speakers were quite credible and what they had to say was interesting. One speaker in particular was rather over the top and her approach came over to me somewhat like a pseudo science wannabe psychic.
I don't profess to be of any religion personally, but I was not overly impressed with the rather mocking stance toward the topic that was inserted in places. I would rather listen to carefully researched and well reasoned comments one way or the other on any topic.

197655,1,1582704708,"As a casual physics and cosmology fan, I would give this movie zero stars if Amazon allowed.

I could write a long review, but it basically boils down to four simple things:

1.  They (mis)use the basic and fascinating concepts of quantum theory to add credibility to what amounts to the same tired old one-mind, we're-all-god mysticism that invaded popular culture in the 70's.

2.  This movie has nothing to do with real physics, except where they use quantum theory to prove their ideology.

3.  This is mainly about cognitive pseudoscience.  For heaven's sake, one of the main interview contributors claims to be channeling the ancient spirit of someone from Atlantis!

4.  I could handle all that, since the movie technically doesn't CLAIM to be real science, just presents itself as such.  But it's also dull as dishwater, a real snore.

There's really no reason to see this at all unless you already believe in such things and want to add some shaky scientific justification.  I know this review reads as if I'm close-minded and find offense in a movie about alternative views of consciousness.  This isn't the case.  What bothers me about this boring piece of well-funded fluff is that its contributors expect me to believe that quantum theory (physics) vindicates their beliefs (metaphysics).",1207267200,8,1301,4.986046511627907
197656,1,1582704708,I am a devout follower of the the Law of Attraction.  I read almost everything on the subject I can get my hands on.  But this movie is just plain silly.  I have to be honest and say I haven't watched the whole thing because I couldn't get through it - TWICE!  One of the most annoying things for me was the some arrogant woman who believes she channels some long dead Atlantian.  (I'm rolling my eyes!) The Law of Attraction is THOUGHT combined with ACTION.  There are so many better sources of information on the subject out there.  I cringe to think of people unfamiliar with the subject watching this for the first time and seeing all these goofballs.

197658,5,1582704708,"My husband and I have watched this movie several times, and each time we notice something different.  It's that type of movie.  You find yourself really focusing on something said in the movie that gets you thinking and then you miss the next couple of things said...so when you watch it again, you notice something new.

This is definitely not your typical movie.  It is loosely about a photographer, Amanda (played by Marlee Matlin), who is disillusioned primarily due to an unfaithful ex-husband.  She is taking anxiety pills just to get through the day.  As the movie progresses, she begins to question reality as she goes ""down the rabbit hole"" and discovers the endless possibilities in life.  At one point, in a train station, she is looking at photographs of the impact thoughts have on water.  A man walks up to her and says, ""If thoughts have that effect on water, imagine what effect they have on us.""  Very thought-provoking stuff!

Seamlessly integrated into the movie are appearances by various doctors, scientists, professors, authors, and other believers in quantum physics who explain how they think reality works.

One of my favorite parts is when Joe Dispenza explains how he creates his day each morning.  He notes that by focusing on our intentions for each day, we're more likely to create the kind of day (and ultimately life) we want, rather than just being buffeted around by whatever shows up.

There are a lot of other great points made by the contributors to the film, too.  For instance, one comment made is that if we continously experience the same emotions over and over and never build on them, then we're caught in the same pattern of stimulus response.  Nothing changes in our lives because we're trapped in the same thinking/feeling response.

Another comment, made by Fred Wolf is that ""there is no 'out there' out there, independent of what's going on ""in here.""

The thing I like best about this movie is that it demonstrates that reality isn't just something that happens to us; it is something we can co-create (with God) based on our thoughts and beliefs.  It's a movie that really makes you think about your life!",1206662400,5,2156,4.8125

The scientists usually spoke for only a few minutes or so before they were interupted by some lame storyline or graphic.

Also, why do they wait until after the film to list the names/credentials of scientists? Bad idea.",1206316800,,430,4.443037974683544
197661,5,1582704708,"Looking at the reviews for this film you'll notice as some reviewers have noted - that there are few in the middle - either 4's and 5's or 1's.  What I find interesting is the visceral reaction some have to this movie - as though it is somehow dangerous like Nazi propaganda or Creationism.  What I see is an entrenched scientific community that refuses to accept anything that isn't purely ""conventional"" at all.  Just as science denied the existence of meteors in the 19th century as they claimed the heavens could never be unstable (they suppressed evidence of meteors were falling to the earth for a long time) I see others today who just can't seem to accept the fact that we're getting close in some cases to explaining some questions in the mystic world with science.  Being grounded in reality with a graduate degree from MIT I wouldn't consider myself a New Age type per se - but I've worked with for example a police detective who had firsthand experience of psychics calling in to help solve crimes.  This type of psychic and other paranormal activity is easily explainable if one just has an open mind and thinks about some of the theories suggested in this movie or The Field.  The conventional scientific community seems so afraid of embracing research that may connect the dots and help us to learn that we're not simply machines that will just die off into nothingness.  We are beings that are likely connected with a greater reality - and as this movie suggests - we don't know anything about all of it at this time.  We've got to stay curious and keep searching.

Sorry for the length here.  What this movie and books like The Holographic Universe and The Field do is to get a person thinking and becoming curious about physics, science, metaphysics and the nature of our reality overall.  At least this is what has happened to me.  After reading The Holographic Universe I went out and got Einstein's biography by Isaacson.  My search is ongoing and I hope never will end.  This is a fabulous movie I would recommend to everyone.  Does it get a little unscientific at times?  Surely.  Does it make you think about lots of things?  Absolutely.  Can we likely affect our own realities with thoughts and intentions?  You bet.",1206230400,6,2241,4.653944020356234
197662,5,1582704708,"This movie deserves more than 5-stars for being the first such attempt to bring the marriage of science, religion, medicine, and spirituality together.  Obviously, when you do something like this, there will be those in each camp who don't want to move in with their neighbors; but the real point of this work is that, you don't have to like your neighbors, but you don't have to kill them, either -- and hating them is only bad for you.  There is nothing new in this movie (for those who have been studying this information...); but this is the first major offering with leaders in all fields unifying their voices and message to a simple truth:  We don't really know anything -- there is no master truth -- you have more control than you have been taught you had -- reality and experience are worth experimenting with.

The message in all spiritual works worth spending your time and money on is simply, ""Stay in the mystery.""  Even science is not truly ""scientific;"" it is constantly changing, and it is always subject to an observer, their goals and opinions, and beliefs and perspectives.  This is obvious to anyone who pays attention to life; this movie is a wake-up call for the 90+% of the population who don't pay attention to their lives.  This movie tells seasoned travelers, ""Hey, you aren't alone on this adventure;"" while telling newcomers, ""Slow down and pay attention; there's more to life than you've been noticing thus far.""

Like The Secret, very complex issues are addressed -- incompletely -- by a variety of people with a variety of different ways of explaining something that really has to be experienced and felt first-hand.  Those new to this kind of information have a lot more studying to do before the implication of this movie for their own life may be fully realized; but this is a great introduction to some very complicated concepts.  This movie will make you think.  If it irritated you, watch it again without looking for where they went wrong...  If you still don't like it, give it to someone else; maybe they will...

I think marrying these concepts with a story-line many people can relate to was a brilliant way of trying to weave together these concepts with a ""real-life"" example of what these ideas might look like in a typical human life.  Everyone involved with this project did an excellent job!  If you want more of the same, the ""Down the Rabbit Hole"" box set has several additional hours of information from these same healers, scientists, doctors, researchers, and teachers...",1205020800,3,2525,4.772413793103448

197665,1,1582704708,"The What the Bleep Do We Know? sequel, Down the Rabbit Hole is a movie that ought to carry a warning to lactose- (and lachrymose-) intolerant viewers: ""Contains potentially dangerous levels of cheese.""
A quasi-documentary about ""the fundamental truth of unity,"" Bleep 2 is more New Age physics for lazy laypeople to ooh and ah over. In fact, it is more of a remake than a sequel, a compendium of stuff left out of the first movie, perhaps, and with nothing at all by way of upgrading in evidence. 2 hours of ineptly staged dramatizations and waffling interviews with self-satisfied ""experts,"" and perhaps a half hour of original material to justify, however limply, its existence, Bleep 2 is a shameless cash-in on the first film's success that suffers from all the failings of the original. Despite the larger budget and longer running time, the filmmakers have chosen not to develop their technique in any significant ways, revealing their utter complacency as ""artists,"" and betraying a smug simple-mindedness and appalling lack of imagination completely at odds with the ""ground-breaking"" nature of their material. I can only presume they considered the original formula to be already perfect and that, since it wasn't broken, why fix it?

The first movie made money and seemed to spark interest and excitement in the most unlikely of viewers, viewers perhaps grateful that such ideas were getting air-time at all in a popular movie. Yet it's hard to imagine a work whose style is so profoundly in conflict with its content, that juxtaposes such profound, challenging ideas with so daffy and clichd an execution. The expressed end of the Bleep films appears diametrically opposed to the means employed. They propose to present a whole new paradigm by which to interpret our reality (and live our lives), a quantum weltanschauung if you will; yet the methods employed are so profane and uninspired that the result is rather to discredit (if not actually debase) the awesome concepts which these films are so gleeful to bandy about. By endeavoring to deliver the findings of cutting edge physics to the mass consciousness, the Bleep films are the quintessence of New Age reductionism. They present a lowest common denominated version of the Mysteries, selling audiences life-changing ideas in cozy, non-threatening forms, so that the masses can have their manna and eat it, feel ""enlightened"" without having to change in any meaningful way.

In a quantum Universe in which information determines the spin of each and every particle, the Bleep movies spin their information into one big, dull, self-satisfied blah. As with all things New Age, by focusing exclusively on a positive ""spin,"" they render the subject flat, two-dimensional. Throwing around words like God, eternal, absolute, infinite energy, consciousness, etc, with so little force or precision saps not only the words but the concepts behind them of power and vitality. The concepts may reach more people by being so diluted--thinned out--but at what price? This user-friendly, multiplex-tailored view of occult realities is as far from shamanism as art from kitsch (and kitsch is what the Bleep movies are).

Fuzzy-headed professionals talking about the power of the brain? People we would avoid like the plague at a dinner party holding forth on ""avenues of reality, unborn"" and ""infinite tomorrows."" Please.

Words, words, words, but where is the spirit? Images that belong in a Gatorade commercial not in a movie about time and space. The magical Universe seen through the lens of the Bleep movies becomes the asinine universe. A supremely patronizing experience.",1204588800,8,3632,5.171768707482993

The bottom line is that it cherry picks catch phrases from various religions and various philosophies without paying attention to consistency, scholarship, or logic.

197683,5,1582704708,"A thought provoking DVD which explores various points of view as to how quantum mechanics could possibly explain some of the larger questions that we ask ourselves including questions about how the our universe began, our perception of reality (hang on to your seat), consciousness and its role in creating reality etc. etc.

Some physicists that were interviewed felt strongly that our own self awareness could be some kind of resonance emanating out from the creation of the universe itself.  That resonance, could possibly, it was suggested, be the one unifying thing for all conscious beings. It is suggested that we are not accidents, but that we had to be. Several of the physicists interviewed extracted the philosophical conclusions that arise from quantum physics that were indeed thought provoking. For example the concept was put across that we are intertwined just as quantum mechanics provides for ""superposition"". Another point put across was that, matter isn't really matter, it is mostly empty and essentially can only be described in probabilistic terms. Matter at its lowest level was described in terms of ""information"" ""thought"" and ""consciousness"". Reality itself is ""illusory"", the mere ""act of observation"" snaps the quantum wave of possibilities into a fixed point of reality. These snapshots of reality then play out somewhat like a movie and coupled with our memory, forms the basis of our sense of reality.

If you have read the elegant universe and (like me) didn't get the bits on the conscious universe, then this DVD should put you right. The quantum edition has both the theatrical version as well as the straight interviews. I prefered the interviews.

I liked the DVD. It had pretty freaky stuff that will cause you to change the way you think about things. But hey, I guess the observer will change and cause change..",1199750400,2,1852,5.082236842105263

197688,1,1582704708,"Silly, incoherent, misleading, unwatchable: when fuzzy mysticism pretends to be science the results are ridiculous

First a disclaimer, albeit an informative one: I could not finish watching this movie. After the novelty of being outraged by its disrespect for norms of argument wore off, there wasn't enough to sustain interest.

I had my fill right around the point where the movie makes the claim that each cell in your body is conscious. (The statement was, I believe, ""The cell is the smallest unit of consciousness."") This was accompanied by an animated sequence featuring gluttonous and lecherous cell-blobs, in nauseating neon colors, mixing it up at a wedding reception.

The scene was representative of the mode of argument -- a confusing staccato montage of talking heads spitting out a few sentences each, inter-cut with special effects animation, and dramatic (I use the term loosely) sequences.

Other critical reviewers have done a good job on noting a variety of absurd claims made by this film. Let me share a few that jumped out at me as especially vivid silliness.

1. Pre-Columbian Native Americans could not see Columbus' ships as they approached, only the ripples in the water.

2. If you really, really, really believed you could, you could walk on water.

3. Scientists have shown that thinking can change the molecular structure of water.

4. Scientists have shown that group meditation can reduce the violent crime-rate in the surrounding area (here, Washington, DC)

5. (The last one I could put up with.) Each cell in your body is conscious.

I could add to this list loose talk by some of the ""experts"" in the movie about living in an age of ""anti-gravity magnets"" (what the hell is an anti-gravity magnet? how's it different from a magnet?) and ""zero-point energy"" (I must have missed the big story about the invention of the zero-point-energy generator) indicating that these experts had a weak grasp on the physical sciences. However, the mode of presentation made it hard to get a handle on what any of the experts were really saying much of the time.

Which leaves us with a question: what exactly were the movie's expert expert in? My guess is that they were experts in spiritual leadership. These were charismatic and eloquent folk. They spoke engagingly about the human condition when not speaking about science.

The basic argument, as I could extract it, goes something like: Quantum Mechanics is mysterious. Thus, all reality is mysterious. Thus, you can influence reality with your thinking. Thus, you should think more positively about your life; if you do, things will get better.

So, should we view this film as a documentary or a fable? Was this an attempt to describe what is known about the world in some objective sense, or just an allegory?

If it's a parable, than it may be churlish of us to chastise the authors for playing loose with the facts and the rules of reasoning -- like criticizing Aesop on the grounds that mice and lions don't really talk. Perhaps all the movie is trying to convey is a sense of possibility and empowerment to those in need of solace. The message that one ought to strive to think positively and to be open to the opportunities in your life is, well . . . nice, if hardly novel.

If taken merely as an inspirational fable the movie fails aesthetically -- the narrative is weak, hackneyed, and uninteresting -- yet it could remain immune from the epistemological bludgeoning it would deserve if it pretended to be a documentary. SHould the anti-junk-science crowd just chill out and treat this as an unusually poor work of fiction? I don't think the film-makers get off that easily. They seek the prestige of science to give substance to their argument. If they want to wear the uniform, they better learn to dig the trenches. And I don't think these guys even know what the basic digging tools look like.

Falsifiability, anyone? Public disclosure of evidence? Reproducibility of results? These are not some arbitrary emblems of a cloistered priesthood. They are evolved standards that support the progressive knowledge growth that separates science from less rigorous ways of understanding. Those who seek the credibility earned by science over the last few centuries of progress can't be allowed to get away with using pseudo-scientific jargon while ignoring -- hell, actively undermining -- the hard-won epistemological standards that gives the jargon any meaning.

So, which is it, fable or farce? I say farce -- pseudo-science of the worst sort. My irritation is tinged with worry that viewers without a strong scientific education will be mislead into believing patent falsehoods, and will walk away with a distorted idea about how science works and what it says.",1199318400,13,4751,4.9634760705289676

So, what I will say is that the information is deep. You can't watch this DVD and be doing something else while it's playing and expect to understand it. Give it your full attention. I can tell by reading a lot of these reviews that many people who gave it a bad review weren't paying full attention.
One thing this DVD made me look at and realize was how much self hate I have going on every day. I had no idea of what I was doing to myself until I saw the scenes with Marlee Matlin after the wedding scenes.. and the animation portraying what was going on inside her chemically when her hatred of herself started to emerge. It was very powerful and made me very sad over how many years I have been emotionally abusing myself inside.
What makes me even more sad is that I see people all around me doing the same thing to themselves.

We know only a little of our world and universe..... and there are ""infinite possibilities"", which is what the DVD expands on. It's observation and science, it's theory and possibilities. But so was the science of flight at first.
As a whole, we tend to be mentally lazy and ""go with the flow"" of things that are happening outside of us so we don't have to create. Creating takes mental sweat and mental labor and feeling like you're a bit crazy at times. Not to mention, the uncertain can be a bit scary.
Let this DVD take your mind to the possibilities of things you can create in your immediate world. What is there to lose? Negative outlooks? ""bad luck""? A life of mental slumber? The phrase ""Attitude is Everything"" rings true more than ever!

Also, I would not have understood this as well as I did had I not seen The Secret first. The Secret gave me a foundation of understanding of the possibilities in the Law of Attraction, and the Bleep backs this up with scientific proof in a lot of cases that this Law Of Attraction is real and working all the time whether we believe in it or not.
I don't know about anyone else, but I love knowing that unpleasant things don't have to ""just happen"" to me. I like knowing that I have the possibility of creating my life with intent. I especially love knowing God isn't judgmental or forbidding. I love the possibility that God is waiting on us to finally ""get it"" so we can be everything we can possibly dream....it's an awesome world we live in.",1195776000,2,2435,4.361233480176211

To anyone that has actually studied Quantum Mechanics, it is quite evident that basket balls (macro world) will not move randomly, but follow Newtons laws and in fact, the Schrodinger wave equation can be reduced to Newtonian Mechanics in this realm.  Also, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal again only really applies to the micro world because it is only then that the measurement of momentum or position is sufficiently precise to bring it into play.  The transformation of the dual slit electron defraction to combined single slit via observation can be explained by the introduction of the monitoring mechanism (e.g. light or field detection) without the need for a person to ""look"" at the data.

There is a whole other regime of Quantum physics that now makes more sense and is the physics of the 21st century.

I totally liked the DVD and strongly recommend it to anyone who has the time to really be challenged and learn. It will definitely open your mind and make you think. Check out [...] for my personal views of how it impacted me.",1192060800,2,786,4.496503496503497
197716,5,1582704708,"I love this movie/documentary, althought I have to admit that it took me awhile to get into it, but once I did, oh boy, it was like a light bulb suddenly flashing in my head. It made me think about everything in life in a new way, my whole life perseptive change after viewing this movie. Don't miss it !!",1191974400,2,305,4.1
197717,4,1582704708,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this movie and then turned it off somewhere in the middle and went to bed feeling excited and expanded. The next night I eagerly returned to the movie and watched what appeared to be an entirely different movie. The second part was stunningly materialistic and reductionistic. I had the sense that the entire movie was bodysnatched by a band of ""nothing but-ists"". We are nothing but the activity of ""neural nets"" and neuropeptides. Interesting...but I think the non-material part is more interesting. In a sense, who cares how our experience is mediated? The brain-body is a vehicle of consciousness. It is fascinating how a soul operates a brain-body vehicle (Fred Alan Wolf expounds a great theory on this in ""Taking the Quantum Leap"".) I admit mind and brain are inextricably connected during the life of the vehicle...if you change the brain you change the mind...if you change the mind you change the brain. Why all this interest in neuropeptides and neural nets? Are you going to make a new drug? Are you going to fix the driver by messing with the vehicle's mechanisms? Oooo...I want a new neuropeptide...One that won't make me sick...And a new neural net. That's what's missing! Then I'll be happy and I won't have to face all that nasty stuff in the basement. I've heard of spiritual bypass...now we've got psychoneuroimmunological bypass. I won't have to deal with the cause of my discomfort; I'll just have a net or a peptide replaced.

I don't get it. It was a very strange dichotomous experience. I was inspired the first night and dunked in fancy psychiatry the next night. I'm tired of psychiatry. I like the idea that soul alters the machine...and I dislike the idea that tweaking the machine is the best way to improve the life of the soul. It didn't make sense to me.

But I liked their glitzy, simplified perspective on parts of Quantum Mechanics so much I gave the movie four stars anyway.

As far as the JZ Knight flap: I don't really care whether JZ Knight is really channeling some disembodied spirit or not. She either is or she isn't. What a grand and preposterous story, though.

In watching some of the supplementary interviews I was mortified by the babbling intertwining mixture of literal and figurative ""explanations"" from the chiropractor. Stuff like if you concentrate it moves from this part of the brain to this part of the brain where there are x number of synapses per neuron...blah, blah, blah. Really? What difference does that make? Would it matter if there were a hamster in there running on a treadmill vs. another really cool sounding, important-like explanation? The powers Dr. D is describing are the powers of attention, concentration, and intention. You can wield attention, concentration, and intention. You cannot wield a neural net or a neuropeptide.

Dr. Hagelin's perspective made the most sense to me. Dr. Newberg's perspective also made sense. Dr. Hameroff's perspective made little sense to me...fancy reductionism...consciousness is produced by the collapsing of superpositioned blah, blah, blah. Huh? If you can't explain it to a 6th grader, you don't understand it. Dr. Monti evidenced startlingly impoverished knowledge of psychosomatic medicine. I don't think he is aware of the work of Dr. Sarno on back pain and TMS and TMS equivalents. Sarno's work is suggestive that most non-traumatic illness and most psychiatric illness are caused by powerful emotions repressed in the unconscious. Dr. Sarno's treatment is highly effective and dramatically points out (to the sighted) the profound impact of the mind on the body, health, and its absence, disease.

Oh, yeah, Dr. David Albert: Hoo wee! What a profound reductionist. Stunning. Amazing. Matter gives rise to consciousness. (He can't be saying consciousness doesn't exist.) So you and I are frisky dirt? It's the Frisky Dirt Interpretation! (This term is borrowed from Ken Wilber. Anyone interested in the movie should read some of Wilber's more accessible works like, ""The Marriage of Sense and Soul,"" and ""A Brief History of Everything."")

197719,3,1582704708,"This documentary is enlightening at one level and disturbing at another. To be specific, I loved the light they shed on the difference between Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics. Furthermore, the idea that our bodies emit energy when we simply think and that we can influence our health among other things was fascinating. I take it as a challenge and a personal quest that started when I read the book The Biology of Belief.  This quest is driven by the fact that my child has autism and that I want to foster a healthy subconscious in him to give him the power to choose his destiny someday. It also gives me perspective for some of the energy based treatments I am seeking such as CranioSacral therapy and why they improve behavior.

The part of the movie I hated was the spiritual propaganda in support of the Ramtha school.  Nights/Ramtha contradicted her/himself. On the one hand by claiming that we are all divine, and on the other by stating that little carbon units could not sin against Almighty God.  I don't think that is necessary or desirable that I stop believing in the creator of the universe to benefit from learning about energy and quantum mechanics. If anything, the possibility that our minds are so powerful just makes me feel more amazed at God's creation. It makes me feel that his creation is so perfect beyond our understanding.

The movie put down the idea of believing in a creator. It was especially offensive against the Christian God mocking the truth that your sins can be forgiven. And can anyone tell me if having the [...] girl flirt with the priest behind the scene where the obese man engages in eating is a subliminal message?

I would recommend this film to people that have a strong spiritual foundation; however if you are in an exploratory phase, please consider that the path of this movie is not the path of truth.

In the movie they talked about Emoto's water experiments focusing on how thought and intention can influence water crystals. This is a profound idea that gave me a new appreciation for Holy water and for the Eucharistic bread and wine.",1189468800,11,2101,4.692934782608695

197743,3,1582704708,"You already know all about this movie from the other reviews, I will just add a personal stance on the ""being"" channelled by JZ Knight: it's a load of rubbish.

 Everything this plastic-surgery inflicted woman said the whole way through the film was utterly contrived and self-important and devoid of truth, at times (especially toward the end) even diverging away from said truth to a harmful extent; it was only vindication to discover during the credits that this woman decided to present her words in the form of the channelling of an ultra-dimensional entity called Ramtha, who no doubt runs seminars and classes in Beverly Hills for $3,500 a session.

 Apart from this woman, give the DVD a watch and a listen with an open mind and see what you think. One or two of the contributors add unworthy and unwelcome opinions on such things that they should refrain from, and it is testament to the integrity of the others when they freely admit that some things are simply beyond them and that they have nothing concrete to offer on the matter.

 Life is more of a mystery than most people living in today's materialistic society are capable of realising. This DVD, if nothing else, is swimming upstream in that respect.",1184630400,9,1220,4.758293838862559

197747,2,1582704708,"This movie is admirable for its attempt to counter the scientism so prevalent today, but it replaces the stifling monism of materialism with the equally hollow monism of idealism or solipsism(in the sense that our thoughts alone determine what is real).  While it is true to say that the quantum particle is affected by measurement, this state collapse is caused by the particle's encounter with the measuring instrument.  To take the leap and conclude that the scientist's mind controls reality is quite preposterous. The experimenter has no control over what the measurent will be anyway(other than by what physical conditions he employs in the experiment. )
 Some of the ""experts"" in this movie are also fishy: a chiropractor,  a woman who claims to be channeling a warriot from Atlantis,  a physicist who won the Ignobel Prize(awarded for bad science) for the dubious meditation experiment described in the movie, etc.  A physicist from Columbia even claims that his interview was presented completely out of context to make it look like he supported the movie' s main thesis(which he does not).

197764,5,1582704708,"I loved What the Bleep - so the quantum edition was just going to be more of the same - right? Wrong!

The whole layout and design of the DVD makes this an amazing experience to explore. You can just watch the movie - but if you do that you will miss the richness hidden in the depths of the DVD.

Information wise you can explore just one person's views in depth, a topic in depth or a series of topics in depth. You choose how deep you want to dig.

You can choose random events/snippets for days when you want to see what the universe will tell you, you can choose documentary style (no story) or just the story. This makes it one of the most interactive and interesting DVDs I have seen or purchased, and as a result gets a lot of air time in our house.

My recommendation is to explore one person that you are interested in and listen to their whole interview. The nuances that you will find can't be replicated by just seeing edited parts of them in the movie.

Oh ... and of course the information contained in the movie is mind-blowing in itself.

Is the spiritualism types of points right or true? i don't think so, but that really isn't the point. The point is trying to pass off science and it's authority in the service of spirit possession and 40K year old avatars.

The movie is infected with premature closure and selective observation. It only tries to seek out evidence that will confirm its own beliefs. Almost all, except one professor who was misrepresented, are non-professional scholars and mystics. This movie is really a pathetic attempt to cover up the teachings of JZ Knight, who claimed that a spirit named Ramtha revealed itself to Knight.

Basically, this is just New Age propaganda.

I sought out the author of that tidbit, and bought his book.  It was almost five hundred pages of pretentiousness.  He did mention the hardwiring concept, and did say it could be changed, but never told how to re-wire one's body (or offer any information on where to learn more about it).

There is no death, no life, and in all places at the same time, and not anywhere at all.  While truly a fascinating study, it has no real use other than entertainment.

2) A proffessor (from Columbia University I beleive) who is quoted repeatedly about quantum physics later issued a statement saying his interview was cut and taken out of context to support the position of the makers of this film.

And hey, if you're a little slow on the pickup, all you really have to do is watch Amanda (Marlee Matlin) stumble through the rabbit hole into some odd environments (like our brains, where electrical storms between synapses are the norm) to see how reality works.

First it completely misapplies the idea of quantum mechanics (e.g. uncertainty, superposition, etc.)  These effects occur at the atomic level and below.  Even as the so-called ""observer"", you do not get to change the macroscopic world by simply seeing the universe as you'd like it to be.  Reality is still reality, even if our perceptions of it are incorrect.  I don't know if the ideas of cellular structure and brain chemistry are presented in an equally incorrect way, but I would suspect so...  based on the things that I do know, and how they treated that.

They do no better with history.  I don't know how they could possibly get the idea that the Peruvian Indians literally could not see the Spanish ships on the horizon when they arrived in the Americas (ostensibly because it was not a part of their reality)...  nor can I find any such story from a credible source after the fact.  I've read that they percieved the ships to be raven gods and whatnot, but they sure SAW something in all the accounts I've heard.

And water molecules that change their emotions due to what's written on a piece of tape stuck to their container?  Puh-lease!  Even if we grant that a molecule is somehow capable of emotion and empathic communication with humans, why would something that's been traveling the planet for the last 4 billion year give a damn about my opinion of it?

Sagan at least tried to keep his facts reasonably straight, and didn't try to degrade the sciences into a new mysticism.  The universe is a beautiful and complicated place.  Theres no need to embellish on the way it works.  Of course, watching a 2 hour movie and thinking happy thoughts about it is a lot easier than actually working to understand what we truly know (and don't know).

I thought the whole idea of the film was overblown, and honestly as much as I hate saying it I had to watch it more than once just because I kept falling asleep.  The only thing that kept me awake was looking for its fallicies, which were plenty.

After awhile it became evident that his attraction to me was there-but not on the level I perceived it to be. He wisely suggested I watch this movie.  At first I thought he was nuts and there was infact no movie by this name, but for sure there was.

He suggested I watch it as many times as it took to fully grasp the concept and I did. At first I thought it was a bit of an intellectual cop-out on his part given all the solid things he did say over the course of the relationship, nonetheless I did still walk away with a lot of info I had overlooked before.

We all tend to say and do alot of things under the influence...of love and lust that we might not normally do in a different state.  It is a bit disappointing to reduce ""love"" or part of it to nothing more than a bio-chemical reaction, nonetheless this is infact, part of it. Though I remain 2 much of romantic to reduce if soley to that level.

That aside the movie does tend to alter the way we all look at the world, in a positive and radical light. I highly recommend it to everyone.  It is both thought provoking and mind enriching.  It presents you with more than one scenario in the never ending question to ""what's it all about?""

And as for that gentleman?  Well there is more than one way to alter his sense of reality as well and there will be, trust me...stay tuned and while you're at it buy the book in addition to the DVD-it expands on the concept which , in case I gave you the wrong ""perception""...isn't just about love, but life in general.",1176681600,7,1613,4.17741935483871

Even as a physics enthusiast (I have read many books, but have little formal education aside from a few semesters of physics in college) I was able to point out the clear flaws in logic and the improper applications of quantum mechanics to the macro world.  It's lies and half truths wrapped up in a pretty documentary.

I can't say it's 100% bad.  I completely agree that how you do in life is intrinsically linked to your outlook.  I.e. positive thoughts drive positive behavior which drive positive outcomes.  However, I in no way agree that my positive thoughts have a direct physical affect on the outside world.  The notion that one could walk on water if one simply believed in oneself hard enough is completely insane and makes it clear to me where these people side when it comes to reality.

197807,5,1582704708,"This revised edition contains most of what was in the first edition, however it seems to have been put together in a more coherent and understandable format.  Additional interviews and animations were added to accomplish this.  If you are interested in learning about quantum physics, and dramatically increasing your understanding of reality, this is an entertaining way to do so.  However, it should be mentioned that the information is presented in a very rapid manner, for the most part.  For the average person, it may take several viewings to be able to adequately comprehend some of the concepts that are being discussed.

Plus as a bonus, DVDs #2 and 3 contain an unedited version of the movie, which is about 5 hours of information, about half of which is in the edited version.  There is a feature that allows you to turn off the ""drama"" sequences which is nice.  There is also a random generator feature that switches around the order of the information, I think.  I didn't try this feature because the original layout has been ordered in a coherent manner, and I believe it would make it difficult to follow the content if it weren't done like this, but I can't say for sure.

197808,1,1582704708,I have no idea what the message in this movie was supposed to be. Maybe it was meant for someone on LSD. Ya think?????,1175558400,4,118,3.9583333333333335
197809,4,1582704708,"First, let's compare this version with the original. For those of you who don't know, this isn't a sequel to the original cult hit What the bleep do we know? This is actually a director's cut of sorts, with more interviews, some with people that weren't in the original, as well, as some re-editing of the actual movie. I have to say that the re-edits significantly improved the movie. They shortened or cut out many scenes that were ""silly"". Alas, the polka dance scene is still there but mercifully reduced. I'd be more willing to show this movie to my family if it weren't for that heinous scene!

OK, let's talk about the ideas. Certainly, take many of its ideas with a grain of salt. You should be doing that with anything produced in the media anyway. By building on some of the latest and more far out ideas developed in quantum physics and neuroscience, this quasi-documentary tries to argue that we can control reality with our consciousness. Now, many of the ""weirder"" ideas in quantum physics are actually ""true"" and you can go read it on your own. Of course, nothing in science is ever really without debate, so bear that in mind. It's easy for a layperson to take for granted many ideas that are in fact not as settled and closed as we think.

The good news is that this movie doesn't purport to sell you anything. It doesn't say ""Yes, you can achieve all this after you spend $4000 on a sumemr course with us"" or ""Buy these special blessed crystals"" and such. At worst, you spent $15 on this DVD or maybe more reading up on other books. Seems like that alone is a good thing. Whether consciousness alone can help us affect reality in a tangible way is hard to prove I think, but positive thinking alone does help. I know many people (myself included) who can get into the habit of being self-defeating, of giving up before trying. In some ways, this documentary has given me some energy to stop doing that.

Am I convinced? Of course not. But it never hurts to keep an open-mind, especially when you have nothing to lose. We can certainly wean ourselves from our various addictions to pills/substance/television and go out and be happier and live our lives.

Yeah, I know, there's some new theories going on in physics these days and there's much less certainty about the basic nature of the universe but a film that just keeps reciting the words ""Quantum Physics"" and espousing the notion that we create our own reality really doesn't educate or bring me any closer to understanding those things.

On the plus side I found the animations amusing and the cinematography well done in places. The story seemed to move along at a good pace and the editing and production values were good.

As always with this sort piece, there is a mild yet emphatic statement of beliefs about who and what God is at the end and this one didn't stray. For those who believe in the god-is-one-god-is-all notion, you'll love the message. For those who don't, you'll be disappointed.

So, if you've never given spiritual issues a serious thought, are unfamiliar with the concept of postmodernism, have never read the existentialists and haven't heard of the new theories in physics, this could possibly be a good trailer to rouse your appetite.

The first half of the movie met those expectations; the second was more metaphysical, smacking of 70's mysticism.  (The experts come from a variety of fields, one specialized in psychic phenomenon.)

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it.  I watched the entire movie, all five hours in two, two and a half hour sittings.  It is long and there is a great deal of material to digest.  Its overall message is a simple one; we are all interconnected and that we need to love ourselves.

The official website for the movie charges $79.99 for the three DVD set.  The Amazon price of $19.99 is giving you (forgive the pun) a lot of bang for your buck.  The movie is thought provoking and even if you don't agree with its content,that isn't a bad thing.

In this movie, science and unsupported claims are mixed in an effort to validate all kind of stuff. I highly recommend ""The Demon Haunted World"". In it, Carl Sagan speaks about J.Z. Knight (more accurately, JZ Knight, the ""narrator"" in this movie) as follows:

""Suppose Ramtha were available for questioning... How does he know that he lived 35,000 years ago, even approximately? ... What were things like 35,000 thousand years ago?

I think what I liked the most about the movie was that, while it leans into a certain direction, it left room for people in the movie to say things like ""...up to this point, it is an undeniable truth, but going any further is a bit of a stretch..."" Ok, so most people were leaning into the same direction, but there was still the physics teacher from Columbia University who was the devil's advocate, which I think is great.

I don't think we should ever read a book, or watch a movie, expecting it to hold the universe's ultimate truth. If this is what you're looking for, then you will be one more person writing a review, like others we see, saying this is bad science, etc.

But if you watch this with an open mind and heart, you may find it interesting and thought provoking. This, in my opinion, is what makes this a great movie, and one of the best I watched in the last many years.

We should always remember that lots (if not all) of what we accept as truth today, was once considered absurd and/or obscene.

Factual errors:

The movie states humans are ""90% water"" when in fact newborns have around 78%, 1-year-olds around 65%, adult men about 60%, and adult women around 55% ... and that's just the beginning.

About the film's ""Experts""

As the purported experts speak throughout the movie, they make several references to concepts, ideas, and alleged facts about quantum physics and other specific items. However, few of the scientists involved are actually professional physicists doing research in quantum mechanics, and one of those, David Albert who does such research has complained that his views were deliberately misrepresented.

The ideas and theories presented are based upon the beliefs of JZ Knight/Ramtha, who appears frequently in the film as a scientist or spiritual teacher. By the end of the film, during the credits, she is identified as the spirit ""Ramtha"" who is being ""channeled"" by ""JZ Knight."". Knight was born Judith Darlene Hampton in Roswell, New Mexico. The spirit, Ramtha, whom she claims to channel, is ""a 35,000 year-old warrior spirit from the lost continent of Lemuria and one of the Ascended Masters."" (Knight speaks with an accent because English is not Ramtha's first language.)

John Hagelin was the head of the 1993 Transcendental Meditation project in Washington, D.C. (The Washington TM study was mentioned in the film, but Hagelin was never identified as one of its authors.) He was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize, which is a parody offered by real Nobel prizewinners, for the most ridiculous theories. Organized by the scientific humor journal Annals of Improbable Research (AIR), they are presented by genuine Nobel Laureates at a ceremony at Harvard University is for ""achievements"" that ""cannot, or should not, be reproduced"", i.e., for pseudoscience, for this project.

David Albert, a philosopher of physics and professor at Columbia University, speaks frequently throughout the movie. While it may appear as though he supports the ideas that are presented in the movie, according to a Popular Science article, he is ""outraged at the final product."" The article states that Albert granted the filmmakers a near-four hour interview about quantum mechanics being unrelated to consciousness or spirituality. His interview was then edited and incorporated into the film in a way that he claims misrepresented his views. In the article, Albert also expresses his feelings of gullibility after having been ""taken"" by the filmmakers. Although Albert is listed as a scientist taking part in the sequel to What the Bleep, called ""Down the Rabbit Hole"", this sequel is a ""director's cut"", composed of extra footage from the filming of the first movie.

Dr. Joseph Dispenza is a teacher at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment as is Amit Goswami, Mgr. Miceal Ledwith, and JZ Knight, who channels the Ramtha warrior spirit.

People quoted in this movie do not even attempt to explain precisely how the theory of quantum mechanics actually proves any of the mystical or religious teachings found in the film. Statements from physicists are made, then they are intercut with statements from people who have created their own religion, medical doctors, and others. No logical proof connecting the findings of Quantum Mechanics(QM) with the movie's core message is offered.

Bob Colwell, who was Intel Chief Architect for pentium 2,3 and 4,and who presumably knows a lot about quantum physics, wrote a review of the film for ""Computer"" Magazine. A brief excerpt:

""One particular interviewee kept reappearing, and I couldn't make heads or tails out of what she said. Eerily she was precisely mimicking the physicists intonations, facial expressions, and utter confidence, but to me she was speaking utter gibberish. It suddenly dawned on me : She wasn't a physicist- She was some kind of New Age mystic who had borrowed the physicists' language and was happily doing free associations between quantum physics and her personal religious beliefs.""",1172448000,196,4039,5.2562111801242235

His references to ""scientists"" and ""junk science"" threw me because, gauging from his name, I didn't see any references to HIS education (which probably isn't more than the 8th grade).

But, then again, we are still dealing with the ""dinosaur"" belief systems with a bunch of people who don't want to take control of their lives and who take pleasure in blaming others for the way their lives have turned out.  And, if that works for them, so be it.

If you are really serious about changing your life, you need to watch THIS video and THE SECRET.  Both videos will blow you away.

I've been a devout believer in New Age and Metaphysical concepts with reference to using energy to change your life.

Books that do briefly touch on the topic don't really explain how it works or how WE can make it work in our own lives to change things.

197855,2,1582704708,"The plot summary above leaves out an important aspect -and that's Ramtha-do search first and you'll understand an aspect of this movie's theme.

I am interested in quantum mechanics, and I am a lawyer, not a scientist.  I think it fascinating that electrons can be in two places at the same time and also not be there at all.  I was hoping to understand more about this.

I watched this long movie end to end in about three nights-paying close attention.  I don't know enough to be able to take some of the 'scientific' statements at face value as truth or as 'truth' applied in a way to support the basic premise, that is, that at the quantum mechanic level, your thoughts manifest in your life, and that we are all literally connected in the cosmic scheme, that all particles in the universe have a sympathetic and interactive nature.  That IS interesting to me.  But how its really supported by science wasn't made crystal clear to me from this movie.

I found the movie postive and thought provoking, even inspiring, and confirming some things I have experienced.  I found the female in the movie, who smokes a pipe, and has the red dress/tunic with gold epaulet-like decorations to have really interesting things to say.  I thought she was a philosophy professor or something.

But it wasn't until after i watched the movie and saw the actor credits did I discover she is ""Ramtha"".  Odd kinda name. No last name, you know like Prince or Madonna or Buddha- cept I didn't recognize who Ramtha was.  So i googled, and her site promises a variety of ""California style"" wonders (hey I like the place so take it with a smile), including remote viewing and sending and recieving thoughts-all in a four day course-for a mere $750 taught by her teachers....well call me Mr Negative thoughts....cynical. Probably.

Well perhaps I AM a scientist, or at least sceptical.  As I listened to the movie I did not really understand and connect what information was delivered as directly applicable to quantum mechanics.  Its an interesting proposition, even plausible, and as we lawyers say, ""I neither admit or deny"" the premise, but it did not logically connect-it was like listenting to bits and pieces of intriguing facts, like random number generators being influenced by world wide thoughts before and after 9/11 and the like-but not exactly connected clearly to how this applies to quantum mechanics.  Or that it actually IS connected.  Could be. I remember long ago watching a movie called Chariots of the Gods that claimed aliens had always visited earth and were depicted in Aztec carvings, egyption pyramids were landing markers and other 'evidence'.  As a teenager I was impressed, because I believed this evidence had to connect in the way they suggested.

Call me a dummy. Then and now.  Dont get me wrong, I WAS inspired by some of the movie's ideas, and I think this is worth watching.  I bought it 'cold', ie not a clue,  as the dvd box description was interesting and eccelectic.  I will watch it again.  Just to make sure I didn't miss something.

Some of the terms bandied about by the scientific persons are technical and hard to digest and follow-for example 'unified fabric'.  Some of the concepts really don't fit into english or logic-such as a wave/particle 'being in two places at once and yet not being anywhere until you actually look', or 'seeing two electrons but they are really the same electron'.

The movie goes back and forth between 'scientific narrative' sound bites which present to concepts and a drama with Marlee Maitlin and Elaine Hendrix that demonstrates how these explained concepts might apply in this reality.

-I wouldnt call it tightly analogous -but its ok-but makes this pretty long, without adding a lot of substantive information or understanding.  It seems to be the worst type of 'science' -a mixture of mystical drivel claiming that quantum physics proves that its valid, a miracle blend of science with the spiritual.  this isn't about quantum phsyiscs.  Its about a rather far fetched interpretation of quantum physics theory.  PT Barnum would be proud.  Nice cover art, promises of an interactive story. Unfortunately I wasn't able to interact and change the story with my thoughts and meditation.  If so, my DVD player probably would have ignited and my credit card account would have shown a refund for this DVD!

197857,1,1582704708,"A friend recommended this film (he had not seen it). The idea sounded nice. However it really is a load of nonsense. The basic message of the film is ""You can create your future"". It is largely explaining (in a watered down pop-version of an already flakey theory) that there is free will. Trouble is, it was only western scientists (and maybe some crazy philosophers) who didn't believe in free will in the first place!

Classical science, believe it or not, teaches that there is in truth no free will. Some of the scientists in the film then learn about quantum physics and are so shocked that actually there is free will. They then try to explain that to the audience. But who of you ever thought there was no free will??

If you are a scientist, you had better read The End of Certainty  by Ilya Prigogine. He is a scientist really worth listening too. He shows how there is free will and introduces that even into the foundations of Classical science. Furthermore, as is mentioned in the film, in science there is actually no arrow of time - that is, we should be able to influence the past as much as the present. Only a scientist could think such a thing, as they believe their primitive theories are more real than their experience!! (Can they unscramble an egg? I think not.) Prigogine introduces the arrow of time (time is non-reversible and directional) into the whole scientific framework, and also reformulates quantum physics to make much more sense, and also removes the necessity of the observer. So if you are interested in quantum physics, you will learn nothing from this pop-babble film, and had better read Prigogine.

If you are interested in spirituality, you had better get any book by the Dalai Lama. If you are interested in how we create our reality, perhaps

Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism (Ray, Reginald a. World of Tibetan Buddhism, V. 1.)  by Reginald A. Ray

and

Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet (Ray, Reginald a. World of Tibetan Buddhism ; V. 2.)  by Reginald A. Ray

and

Magic Dance  by Thinley Norbu.

This film is more trying to encourage you that you can #get what you want"". A very self-serving egocentric attitude. The best parts actually were when the Irish fellow was speaking. He seemed to be very nice and have some depth to him. As it turns out from the credits at the end, he spent most of his life as a teacher of Theology.

The darkest character was the one who actually spoke the most! I thought she was a scientist like the rest of them (except the Irish fellow) but reading the credits at the end, saw that she was ""Ramtha"" and is

""Master Teacher - Ramtha School of Enlightenment

Channeled by JZ Knight"" Interestingly one other reader (Reviewer: Jonathan Jett-Parmer) commented ""In addition to being funded by JZ Knight's organization, many of the ""experts"" featured in the film have dubious or even sinister backgrounds.""

Looking on her page here on Amazon for her DVD Ramtha: Create Your Day, you will see that The disc is nominally directed by Mark Vicente, a Ramtha student who directed What the Bleep Do We Know? Also you will read ""the DVD package comes with pamphlets instructing the user on how to enroll in Knight's school, including a biography of Knight that describes her as a ""very successful businesswoman,"" which seems like an understatement.""

By the sales of this film What the Bleep, she does sound indeed like a successful business woman.

Business, ego, pop-science catch phrases, and high profile marketing.

I should rather recommend pure entertainment, good science, or genuine spiritual instruction.

Here's another one if you want spirituality mixed with lovely and beautiful, inspiring story:

197858,1,1582704708,"Sadly, the immeasurable gap in scientific knowledge is shared by the filmmakers with their watching public.  In addition to being funded by JZ Knight's organization, many of the ""experts"" featured in the film have dubious or even sinister backgrounds.  Candace Pert, perhaps one of the most promising cell biologists quickly ""went down her own rabbit hole"" in pursuit of extreme theories which have consigned her to the fringes of academia.

The public no longer has the ability to engage in some critical thinking when confronted with a slickly packaged mass media tool like WTBDWK.  In fact, the very nature of this film is meant to engage our suspension of disbelief switch and draw us into its fantasy world.

If you are a believer in the extreme ends of metaphysics, then do yourself a favor and pick up Sagan's Demon Haunted World.  Read it, if you read nothing else.  If you still cling to beliefs as espoused by WTBDWK and its ilk of this genre, at least you took a look back on the other side of the looking glass.

As for me, I am content to avoid the unreality of this ridiculous and insulting film.

197878,2,1582704708,"After reading about this film, I decided to make the time to watch and review it.  Fortunately, I located a streaming video of it on Google Video.  This means you will not need to pay for a film with a questionable agenda and apparent ties to a New Age cult that aims to separate people from their money.

This film attempts to ""prove"" the primacy of consciousness over existence by appeals to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM).  For those unfamiliar with QM, one of its central mysteries centers on the double slit experiment.  In this experiment, scientists send streams of subatomic particles through double slits toward a screen.  Unusual phenomenon such as the apparent passage of the same particle through both slits simultaneously, and screen results depicting particles as points or particles as waves depending upon the presence of observers, led physicists collaborating in Copenhagen to advance the idea that subatomic particles -- the constituents of reality -- exist only as ""probability wave functions"" that collapse into specific points only upon being observed.  In other words, reality's nature depends upon the consciousness observing it.  Parts of the film also appeal to the many worlds interpretation of QM which argues that the odd results of experiments like the double slit arise from the existence of unobservable parallel universes.

Although many scientists -- even one interviewed in the movie named Dr. David Albert -- have condemned this film as New Age nonsense and an abuse of QM concepts, the fact that most quantum physicists accept the Copenhagen interpretation while many others accept the many worlds interpretation should lead rational viewers to think of Ayn Rand's essay ""The Chickens' Homecoming"" and her famous words: ""Brother, you asked for it!""  Any yielding to the idea that consciousness can reshape reality must lead inevitably to New Age entertainment of the idea that we can reshape our world through our thoughts.  This film explores that idea and the quantum mechanical chickens come home to roost.

The film features the attractive deaf actress Marlee Matlin as the protagonist who plays a divorced photographer named Amanda.  Much like THE SECRET, it showcases a female central character in distress and looking for answers to get her life on track.  As the film progresses, it intermixes the story of Amanda with interviews of scientists in a variety of fields ranging from QM to neurology.  The first half of the film features a number of QM scientists of varying degrees of credentials and credibility as they speculate about the nature of reality and its link to spirituality.  They all march lockstep to the tune of the primacy of consciousness over existence.

The second half of the film steps up a level to the molecular level of human neurology and the nature of emotions.  Had the film focused solely on this fascinating subject and foregone the QM silliness altogether, I could have recommended it without hesitation.  It hints at links between reason and emotion and the idea that we can volitionally reprogram our thoughts to alter our emotional responses.  Here, Amanda finds herself at a Polish wedding at the church where she herself got married the same day her husband met his future marriage-busting mistress at Amanda's own wedding.  Finding herself in emotional distress at these memories, Amanda embarks on a drinking binge that leads to hilarious results.  The film accompanies these antics with some impressive anthropomorphized computer animations of chemical interactions within the human endocrine system.  This section alone makes the movie worth watching.

Amanda finally reaches a turning point when she looks at herself in the mirror the next morning, hung over, and says that she hates herself.  Recalling some supposed words of wisdom heard earlier in the story, she decides consciously to begin to love herself and her existence in this world.  Adherents to Ayn Rand's philosophy, Objectivism, will have no objection to making such a conscious decision, though they will object to the pseudoscience that led Amanda to make that choice.  She decides to do so because water constitutes the bulk of the human body and a Japanese ""scientist"" did a study showing how thoughts affect the beauty of water crystals.

Perhaps the most frightening and offensive aspect of this film comes from the end credits.  Nowhere during the body of the movie do the names or credentials of any of the talking heads caption the visuals.  Instead, the viewer must wait until the end credits roll to see that one of the talking heads, a blond woman in her middle years wearing heavy makeup who talks with a thick ""Count Chocula"" accent, has throughout the film served as a ""channel"" for a mystical figure named ""Ramtha.""  Even this part requires further research on the part of the viewer to learn that supposedly Ramtha lived millennia ago in the ancient civilization of Atlantis and now speaks through J. Z. Knight -- the woman -- to inform us of our god-like powers of human potential.

Critics on various open review sites such as the Internet Movie Database have observed that this film serves as a lure to draw gullible people into Ramtha's School of Enlightenment -- a costly cult trap.  Horror stories of credulous relatives drawn into this school and made the poorer for it have made their way into these comments.  Objectivists grasp the primacy of existence well enough to avoid these traps.  Thanks to Google Video, they can also forego financing Ramtha in any way whatsoever while still experiencing the film.",1168732800,20,5607,5.084061135371179

If you did't see the original and you are willing to ask the questions: what is the nature of reality?, why are we here? and what role do we play in our reality?, then this is a must see.",1168473600,2,565,4.261682242990654

197893,3,1582704708,"I am afraid that I will probably burst a few people's bubbles with this review but there you go.

Once the movie had begun I was reminded of the Tao of Physics, a well written book of a few years ago which created a bit of a stir by suggesting that physics had gone from a hard science to more of an art due to the integration of uncertainty into the philosophical ethos and that the science was becoming akin to mysticism.

I have found that work on uncertainty and theories of chaos have created some interesting areas but the incorporation into mystic and so-called new age ideas do not work for me.

The areas of the movie that deal with quantum mechanics are a good way to bring these complex models to the awareness of the general public and for those I have nothing but applause.

What I find disturbing is the way the film reaches out into other areas like emotional states and health and makes links which are hjust not there. I believe that a good mental attitude is a good factor in living one's life and an aid to recovery from illeness or surgery and no-one can deny the power of the will to live. However, as Karl Popper famously observed: a theory that explains everything, explains nothing.  It strikes me then that this film is an attempt to link a particularly comple notion to areas beyond which it is meant to apply in some sort of Hippiesque mythology as some sort of panacea to all of the ills of the world.

I am afraid that we have a long way to go, socially and technologically , before we can live off the land with enough food to feed everyone and when disease has been vanquished. Those things are probably more capable of being achieved than curing the human tendency towards violence and imperialism.

There are some great aspects to this movie, the inclusion of a deaf actor being the greatest in my humble opinion. Special effects are interesting and having the variety of speakers commenting throughout is impressive although I would have liked to have known who they worth.

Worth a watch to learn something? Absolutely!

Will a lot of people be taken in by it's basic premisses?  Almost certainly.",1168387200,10,2132,4.514285714285714
197894,5,1582704708,"What the ""Bleep"" Do We Know!?: Down the Rabit Hole is in my opinion, the best DVD I've seen in a very long time.  Why? Not because I necessarily agree with everything (and there's a lot to even consider) but because it makes you THINK. Part science, philosophy, psychology, theology--there's something here to engage everyone.

Most films are mind numbing, silly and insulting, and yet What the Bleep contains enough of a story and context to hold a dizzying amount of information together in a cohesive journey. The narrative lends itself to an array of scientific facts and some new-age concepts presented by impressive scientists and others (I might have made different choices in some of their experts). But what is impressive is that there's substantial material here--on everything from interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships to quantum physics and contemplative elements of God and faith that are respectful and yet open-minded.

At least the writers and producers of What the Bleep are attempting to offer viewers something fresh, innovative and well worth a look. I, for one, am impressed.

197931,4,1582704708,"To start off, if you are easily offended and you are a firm believer in the traditional religions, you may find this blasphemous...

The material is presented using a loosely-linked story of a young professional photographer (using a medium format camera), interwoven with talking heads talking about ""things"". The movie also mixes in animation and graphics. At one point it turns into a musical, including a performance of Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to love"" by a ...cell (I kid you not!).

Humor was also used, although a bit controversial at times, it worked. The movie was viewer-friendly, although in some cases they were compressing too much content into long sentences, which works when reading a book/paper, but when listening to it, it forces bird-brains like me to listen to the long-winded sentences 2-3 times to get it :-)

The majority of the talking heads had impressive lines in their resumes, such as PhD/MD degrees, some of them from (or currently at) places like Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, etc. Only one of them was self-described  ""master of enlightment"" - Ramtha, no scientific/scholastic credentials presented. I am not familiar with all these people, so I don't know how their work/research is perceived by their peers and the general public. It should be noted that each of the talking heads has their own ideas, and they do not all agree on everything, so even if you consider ""Ramtha"" to be too ""out there"" or New Agey, it shouldn't necessarily discredit what the other people are saying.

Some of the material presented passed the test of common sense. A couple of things seemed to me a bit ""too convenient"" such as the ability to design your day, but being surprised by the actual events that shape your day and lead you to your day's goals (randomness and preparation can also do the same thing). A number of the things presented were counter to ""everyday reality"", which is where quantum physics lives.

The majority of what was said was based on quantum physics. Given the uncertain nature of quantum physics, there are enough holes in it for most of the material presented to be true, but just because they are possible and there is no way to prove/disprove them right now, it doesn't necessarily make them facts or ""reality"".

I am by no means an expert on this topic, so I will reserve judgment until after I read more on these topics... However, it is an interesting and intriguing docu-film to watch, regardless of one's personal and religious beliefs...

And a note for Star Trek fans: Armin Shimerman, the actor who played Ferengi barkeep Quark in Deep Space Nine makes a brief appearance in two segments of the film.",1167177600,3,2655,4.8584070796460175

197933,1,1582704708,"Like many viewers, I was at first enthralled by the viewpoints presented in this movie. But further inspection of the sources severely damages the credibility of the movie. In short, I felt betrayed. I want to believe there is more out there, but this movie is NOT the path to it.

The woman that speaks in an Elizabethan accent is actually J. Z. Knight, who claims to be channeling Ramtha, a 35,000 year old spirit-warrior who lived among the lizard people and Atlantis. (info taken from her site)

Many of the people appearing in the movie are instructors at Ramtha's school of Enlightenment or are selling their books through related websites.

Another gripe I have is that the photos claiming to show the effect of thoughts on water crystals are a joke. When taking a picture for ""love"" one can pick and choose the nicest pictures with beautiful lighting, making it purely subjective. The movie makes a big point of the reasoning that: our bodies are mostly water, and if thoughts can make water/ice look ""ugly or pretty"", then what is negative thought doing to our bodies?

I am all for positive thinking, but this concept falls apart when looking at the manner in which the ice photos were made.

One good point that the movie makes is that positive thinking could possibly ""re-wire"" your brain by making new connections.

197934,1,1582704708,"Viewing this film as a person who has experienced spiritual transformation and life recovery for over 16 years, I was saddened. The message of this film is that you are God. And when the main character discovers that she is God, she is depicted as being liberated from an addiction to prescription drugs. Ironically, believing you are God is the exact control issue that holds so many people captive to addictive behavior, prompting us to continually struggle unsuccessfully on our own to overcome something which we can only truly overcome by ""letting go and letting God"". It's precisely the point where we recognize that we really aren't God and that God is God and we surrender our lives and will to Him that we can truly begin the recovery process.

Sadly, a glaring example of how the delusion of being God and acting as if one's destructive behavior had no consequences can be seen in the life of one of the film's primary ""experts"", Dr. Michael Ledwith. In the film, Dr. Ledwith makes extreme statements regarding his disbelief in a supreme God and our responsibility to live our lives free from that idea. What the film doesn't mention is that while Dr. Ledwith has lived his life as if he was God, his career has been marred by accusations of behavior which those of us who don't consider him to be God call child molesting, one of which resulted in the loss of his job and was apparently settled out of court.

Much of the rest of the film could be described as a primer for the Hindu concept of ""Maya"" which may be roughly defined as the belief that what seems to be reality is actually a dream or illusion. While soft peddled versions of this concept can seem trendy to people in the West, in India this worldview is one way people can excuse/ignore the social injustice perpetrated towards some 130 million ""untouchables"" or Dalits, the lowest of the Hindu castes, held in abject poverty and misery, many of whom sleep on the streets each night and have little or no hope of improving their lives.

May I alternatively recommend for those interested in real spiritual transformation and making a positive difference in the world; a film on the life of the remarkable man who was the driving force behind the abolishment of slavery in Britain, William Wilberforce.

197942,1,1582704708,"According to quantum theory, this torturous atrocity didn't actually exist until I observed it. I must wholeheartedly apologize for my blunder, for the world would be a better place if ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" remained as an undefined cloud of possibility, insubstantial and utterly unknown.

It's not that the basic ideas in this film are flawed. In fact, the piece manages to unwind some of the mysteries of quantum physics, which are baffling enough to give even the most lettered professionals ravaging headaches. No, quantum physics is not the problem here. The problem is what the film does with quantum physics. The basic ideas of quantum mechanics are warped to enforce the teachings of a cult. That's right, this film is essentially a production of ""Ramtha's School of Enlightenment."" Its leader, JZ Knight, believes that she is channeling Ramtha, an ancient and thoroughly dead spiritual guide that hails from. . .wait for it. . .the lost city of Atlantis. The cult's philosophy of merging science with spirituality and religion permeate the piece.

The producers of this film throw up a amateurish smoke and mirrors show in an attempt to dazzle and confuse the audience into buying into the cultist theories. I guess simply conveying the mind-shattering concepts of quantum physics through speech and maybe a few diagrams isn't enough for your typical fructose-fattened, science-ignorant religious zombies. Apparently they need to have mystery hammered down their throats with a crude sledge of graphic nonsense, bad acting and spooky pseudo-spiritual new-age mumbo-jumbo.

The film begins with a dreamy sequence scored with, of course, last year's ambient electronic music hit. Employ some hackneyed editing tricks--sped-up sequences, fast cuts, over-exposed frames--and you end up with what small-town newspaper movie reviewers might call ""innovative"" and ""cutting-edge."" But it gets worse. The producers let some third-year motion graphics students into the editing room! Enter bad 3-D artwork fused with fractal imagery that makes the old HBO promo look like the work of omniscient, hyper-intelligent beings from a parallel universe. Some basic documentary-style interview footage emerges through this visual vomit; prominent scientists who look very important telling us why the universe is insanely nonsensical. They're very smart-sounding and convincing, but we don't actually get to know who they are or why we should listen to them. They are anonymous experts, mysterious entities who seem to know a whole lot about quantum mechanics. Ramtha/JZ Knight makes several ghostly appearances, staring into the camera with startlingly wide eyes as she unloads some supposedly mind-bending truth about the universe. We are led to believe that this cult leader is, in fact, on par with the other theoretical physicists and microbiologists.

This kind of crazy cinematographic blender action continues for a while.  Then Marlee Matlin enters the scene. That's right, the deaf wonder Marlee Matlin. No, her deafness has not endowed her with the ability to sense  quantum particles and energy. She's just doing her thing, which is acting. Acting like a miserable photographer who's in the middle of an existential crisis. We are forced to follow her character through an excruciating story of enlightenment that's injected with, you guessed it, more terrible computer graphics.

The inner workings of Marlee's biology are painstakingly described by more anonymous talking heads as her character blunders through life. These explanations are illustrated by corny 3-D graphics of dancing cells and pulsating brains. It's embarrassingly ridiculous. Well, I do suppose that this terrible display of computer animation might be mildly entertaining to brain-damaged chimps who haven't ever laid eyes on a television, but for most of us it's positively painful.

Finally, after several hours that can roughly be equated to three weeks in a Viet-Kong tiger trap, we get to know who the talking heads are. They are physicists, teachers, biologists and spiritual guides. But even while we're being introduced to the experts of this pseudo-documentary, the directors feel the need to cut in shots of abstract art and more bad computer graphics, which makes it exceedingly difficult to discern names and titles. It's undoubtedly done to confuse the audience, because if anybody actually took the time to research these ""experts"" they'd quickly learn that most of these PHDs have a long history of fusing spirituality/religion and science, a truly frightening pastime. Science is contrary to religion. Science asks questions, performs experiments and comes to conclusions based on evidence. Religion comes to conclusions based on blind faith and discourages questions and experimentation and ignores evidence.

If you want to know about the inner workings of the universe, save yourself some mental agony and find a nice article on quantum mechanics. Pick up a copy of Discover Magazine or National Geographic. But whatever you do, don't observe ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" You'll only call the  abomination into existence yet again.",1164412800,42,5133,5.421052631578948

In it are interviews of many well credentialed and credible physicists, philosophers, and theologians, making it engaging for even the most cynical of viewers.  Interspersed is a drama showing the theories in action for a regular person.  For me, it helps to reconcile spirituality (Christian in my case) and scientific theory whereas before I always felt my love of science and reason were in constant conflict with my spiritual beliefs.

As for quantum physics, what well-rounded individual these days would want to get caught unaware?  You never know when the subject might come up at a cocktail party, or at the company golf outing or worse yet when you finally get that date with the special person you've been eyeing.  I'm a little slow with physics so I had to watch the thing a few times, often rewinding and repeating some parts to make sure I understood the point being made.  But it was a worthwhile investment and if you are in the right mood the film can be both entertaining and thought provoking.

The film confronts you with scientific evidence that proves why traditional scientific measurement is completely unreliable.  If you are light enough on your feet you can take that conversation anywhere, even if like me you don't really know dork about physics.

To sum it up, this whole endeavor is like the particles they talk about in the movie.  Sometimes they're there sometimes they're not.  They fade in and they fade out.  What is reality one moment is fiction the next.  That, I suggest, is an excellent vantage point from which to view this work.  Fade out long enough to fascinate yourself and others imagining and discussing all the things that can be.  Fade in long enough to reconcile your bank statement and renew your driver's license.  Try not to spend all your time in one dimension or the other though.  It might not work out so well.

Watch the film.  See how it makes you feel.  Also, read the reviews.  They are every bit as entertaining and provocative as the film itself.",1161129600,14,1800,4.632911392405063
197968,5,1582704708,"All of a sudden we find a number of films aimed at the populace and explaining the Law of Attraction with its underpining concepts of quantum physics. Coincidence? Proof positive of the point of it all? Bleep! opened the cultural door to a number of other films, chief amongst them ""The Secret"" which is presently skyrocketing to underground success on the internet (and as of this writing not available on amazon - one has to go to the film website to view or purchase it).

When I first viewed Bleep!,I had a broad smile, and in the very fashion the film would have us adopt, had a flashback to five years ago.... excuse this review lapsing into a memoir; you see the story illustrates the very points made in the movie.

In 2001 I met Fred Alan Wolf over at Deepak Chopra's in La Jolla.  I was in a small group of people who had been invited to hear him talk about his latest book: Mind into Matter.  Dr Wolf was fascinating. His concepts made my head spin. I had never before been told about the notion that thoughts have energy in and of themselves, and that matter springs from these thoughts. His lecture was extremely enlightening.

It was a marvelous talk, an even better meditation session afterwards, and at the very end, the twenty or so of us present got very silly, rapping Rumi poetry to the beat of tabla drums. Musician Dave Stewart was in our group.  We actually made Dave go out to his bus and bring in his guitar so he could play and we could continue to rap Rumi.  I felt like I was on LSD, and  by midnight I found myself in an odd corner, in conversation with Deepak, Dave, and Fred.

I am not making this up.  You can't make this stuff up.

Fred said that he dreamed of making a film in which quantum physics would be explained in a comic fashion to lay people. His fantasy was to make it a la Monty Python. He felt that by de-mystifying the concepts of the quantum reality and infusing it with slapstick humor, people who were otherwise unschooled in it would not only ""get it"", but could incorporate it into their approach to life, for their betterment and the betterment of humankind.

Dave, who was as blown away by Fred as the rest of us, remarked that in a couple of days he was returning to London, where he was going to be meeting Eric Idle concerning a music project. He vowed to somehow get Fred and Eric together.  Fred was very excited. The synchronicity of the evening was a mirror of the concepts discussed.

From the film credits, it looks as though Idle didn't get directly involved. But clearly this is the film that was just a dream in Fred Alan Wolf's mind back in early 2001.

It took him three years. What could each of us do in three years if we intended it?

Do you want the red pill or the blue pill, Neo?

If you imagine it, so shall it be. And if your Christian/Jewish/Muslim/Vedic/you-name-it texts didn't demonstrate that clearly enough for you, then perhaps this psychedelic mind trip of a whirling dervish will help you out. Take the plunge.",1160956800,19,2995,4.406533575317605

However, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the movie deserves to be taken with a grain of salt.  The filmmakers are all members of a cult called the Ramtha School of Enlightenment in which the founder (JZ Knight, who appears in the movie), claims to be channeling the spirit of a 90,000 year old Atlantean.  She apparently began this channeling after putting a pyramid on her head one day and seeing visions which she later started charging people to hear about.  (Price of admission is gold; not cash.)

That aside, other claims of the movie are ridiculous.  In an effort to ""prove"" that we don't see things that we don't know about, one of the speakers in the movie claims that South Americans ""could not physically see"" the approaching ships because....they'd never seen a ship before.

This is ludicrous.  Claiming that a person cannot see something unless they believe it's there?

Overall, I found the movie to be good.  And I enjoyed parts of it.  But, knowing that I was watching what amounts to a recruitment film for the Ramtha cult has made me look elsewhere for DVDs about the law of attraction.

It gives some great insight into where science is taking us. It also shows that the long held conceptions of the mystics are quite correct when one gets to the integral essence of everything.

I bought the movie because I had heard much about it. What a surprise I got!! It confirmed many of my own thoughts and ideas. It also secured a few things that I already knew about.

197974,5,1582704708,"Finally, I don't have to feel like Giordano Bruno anymore.

Ever since I was 5 years old, I was told to go to church, be like all the other kids, and conform to what everyone ""should"" believe in.  Even back then, I was aware enough to know that there was definitely something wrong with everything thats been stuffed down our throats, and hungered for the day that something would come out like this movie.  It's not based on one sole idea, and the interviewee's all give a well rounded consensus on what is conscious, thought and how quantum physics may be the key ingredient to the everlasting question ""Who am I"", and ""What am I doing here"".

I bought the first release DVD and got hooked.  When the Quantum edition was released, I couldn't put my laptop down for a second while typing out quotes and info from the movie for reference.

I was enthralled by many of the explainations from most of the scientists, theologians, and doctors on what quantum physics is, how we have emotional addictions, and FINALLY an actual professor of Theology telling us like it is about the whole precepts of religion and how we have it so mangled and disconfigured to appease the masses that don't want to take control of thier own reality.  - Yes, I said it!

One of the grabbers for me was a quote by Dr. Joe Dispenza, DC about quantum physics and creatng your day.

""Why do we keep re-creating the same reality?

Why do we keep having the same relationships?

Why do we keep getting the same jobs over and over again?

In this infinite sea of potentials that exist around us, how come we keep re-creating the same realities?

Isn't it amazing that we have options and potentials that exist but we're unaware of them?

Is it possible that we're so conditioned to our daily lives, so conditioned to the way we create our lives that we buy the idea that we have no control at all?

We've been conditioned to believe that the external world is more real than the internal world. This new model of science says just the opposite, it says what's happening within us will create what's happening outside of us.""

You'll either love this movie or hate it.  Usually, the one's that I have showed this movie to that didn't like it (and that's only been one so far) mocked the movie and it's message, but have asked if they can borrow it to watch again, and again. Make's you wonder if the movie actually started remapping a few of the old neuronet connections and reactivated some brain cells to make them curious enough to want to see it again.  Also, in my opinion, anyone that ""don't get"" this film are just totally in denial.

Everyone else that I know that has seen this, has said that it just blew them away.  The one's that are skeptical, in my opinion, are just too entrenched in the paradigm of what they had others tell them what reality is rather than having them find out themselves.

This extended version goe's well beyond what the first release had, and is worth its weight in gold.  You may not agree with every opinion presented, but I gurantee that you'll find a few that will grab you and not let go.  Because, like me, after you've watched all 6 sides on the 3 DVD's, your way of thinking will begin to change entirely.

As the physicist, Alan Wolf in the movie says:

""We need a new spiritual milieu.  We need a new spiritual way of understanding the nature of what it is to be a human being.  Because the old ways, the old mythologies, the old monarchy, king, God, versus the old lawful scientist's way of doing everything are DEAD.  They need to be buried.  We need a new realm, a new vision.  And I think quantum physics, if anything could help us get a step up in the right direction.""",1159920000,15,3691,4.4413075780089155

The movie states humans are ""90% water"" when in fact newborns have around 78%, 1-year-olds around 65%, adult men about 60%, and adult women around 55% ... and that's just the beginning.

About the film's ""Experts""

As the purported experts speak throughout the movie, they make several references to concepts, ideas, and alleged facts about quantum physics and other specific items. However, few of the scientists involved are actually professional physicists doing research in quantum mechanics, and one of those, David Albert who does such research has complained that his views were deliberately misrepresented.

The ideas and theories presented are based upon the beliefs of JZ Knight/Ramtha, who appears frequently in the film as a scientist or spiritual teacher. By the end of the film, during the credits, she is identified as the spirit ""Ramtha"" who is being ""channeled"" by ""JZ Knight."". Knight was born Judith Darlene Hampton in Roswell, New Mexico. The spirit, Ramtha, whom she claims to channel, is ""a 35,000 year-old warrior spirit from the lost continent of Lemuria and one of the Ascended Masters."" (Knight speaks with an accent because English is not Ramtha's first language.)

John Hagelin was the head of the 1993 Transcendental Meditation project in Washington, D.C. (The Washington TM study was mentioned in the film, but Hagelin was never identified as one of its authors.) He was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize, which is a parody offered by real Nobel prizewinners, for the most ridiculous theories. Organized by the scientific humor journal Annals of Improbable Research (AIR), they are presented by genuine Nobel Laureates at a ceremony at Harvard University is for ""achievements"" that ""cannot, or should not, be reproduced"", i.e., for pseudoscience, for this project.

David Albert, a philosopher of physics and professor at Columbia University, speaks frequently throughout the movie. While it may appear as though he supports the ideas that are presented in the movie, according to a Popular Science article, he is ""outraged at the final product."" The article states that Albert granted the filmmakers a near-four hour interview about quantum mechanics being unrelated to consciousness or spirituality. His interview was then edited and incorporated into the film in a way that he claims misrepresented his views. In the article, Albert also expresses his feelings of gullibility after having been ""taken"" by the filmmakers. Although Albert is listed as a scientist taking part in the sequel to What the Bleep, called ""Down the Rabbit Hole"", this sequel is a ""director's cut"", composed of extra footage from the filming of the first movie.

Dr. Joseph Dispenza is a teacher at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment as is Amit Goswami, Mgr. Miceal Ledwith, and JZ Knight, who channels the Ramtha warrior spirit.

People quoted in this movie do not even attempt to explain precisely how the theory of quantum mechanics actually proves any of the mystical or religious teachings found in the film. Statements from physicists are made, then they are intercut with statements from people who have created their own religion, medical doctors, and others. No logical proof connecting the findings of Quantum Mechanics(QM) with the movie's core message is offered.

Bob Colwell, who was Intel Chief Architect for pentium 2,3 and 4,and who presumably knows a lot about quantum physics, wrote a review of the film for ""Computer"" Magazine.  A brief excerpt:

""One particular interviewee kept reappearing, and I couldn't make heads or tails out of what she said. Eerily she was precisely mimicking the physicists intonations, facial expressions, and utter confidence, but to me she was speaking utter gibberish. It suddenly dawned on me : She wasn't a physicist- She was some kind of New Age mystic who had borrowed the physicists' language and was happily doing free associations between quantum pysics and her personal religious beliefs.""",1158710400,129,3961,5.261489698890649
197982,4,1582704708,"Although, this DVD has a lot of commercial aspects (many references to various publications are made throughout the film) that somehow all link up to the same source (Ramtha), the many messages that are conveyed in this film are very powerful. You will start to see that many things that you called a reality are not necessarily the way that you think they should be, but are the way that you imagine them to be. Thus, the main message of this film (and there several others), is that reality is nothing but a construct of our minds.

This very powerful idea is illustrated in this film through the eyes of Amanda, who follows her own curiosity, like Alice in Wonderland, further down and down the rabbit hole. Of course, the story line is only a pretext to make the somewhat very complex concepts more accessible. On the whole, this DVD is more of a documentary than a film, but the story line is a great metaphor to most of the points raised.

The source and the inspirations for this film came from scholars of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, a 35'000 year-old entity who also appears in this film. Yet, this somewhat more paranormal source only appears very little, and the vast majority of scientific comments and descriptions are made by quantum physicians. Therefore, what you'll learn is not something that is made up, on the contrary, you'll find the results of solid academic research. This in return makes the whole idea all the more disturbing, as after watching this DVD you'll have an even harder time to accept that what you thought was real actually is.

Don't watch them all at once, as I did, because there is a lot of repetition.  Now -- regarding the title of this review:  I think that a person's response to this film would be based on his/her receptivity to, or bias against, New Age philosophies.  Rating it is absurd.  It is neither a ""good"" nor a ""bad"" movie.

It combines normal documentary interviews and layout with special effects reminiscent of NOVA's ""The Elegant Universe"" then relates this to some loosely defined story involving a deaf woman. While there are practical applications to her story, having her in it is awkward at times and unneccessary. There are quite a few lies told too (we are not 90% water/the water experiment is controversial) and the religious condemning was completely uncalled for. I also think that there were too many Ramtha references in the movie -- I was expecting this to be science, not pseduoscience.

We have to be willing to not preemptively dismiss possibilities, or worse, throw the covers over our head in the face of spooky new concepts. So for courage and dignity in exploring the potentialities of life, I give What The Bleep full credit.

I also find it strange that people think there's some sort of cult involved with liking or the making of this film. Where's the evidence? I guess, once again, evidence isn't needed but being scared of people justifies making up claims to help just put the whole matter out of sight.

197995,3,1582704708,"I watched this movie at least two or three times as a part of my college education.  I have also sat through discussion groups regarding the content - both pro and con.

Two-thirds of this movie was great!  The explanation of quantum physics was right on the money.  The illustrations through both graphics and story helped simplify the concepts more clearly.  The third part was the application of quantum physics to our life as seen through the eyes of mystics and disgruntled ex-catholics.  I will not attack these people nor their beliefs, however, be it known that I believe many of their statements were unscientific and, at times, contradictory.  At one point, a statement is repeated twice, ""There is no God.  There is no God.""  A moment later, it is followed by the statement, ""You are God.""  First, the Bible does say, ""The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God..."" (Psalm 14:1; 53:1).  Second, the logic of this comment would be...if there is no God, and you are God, then there is no ""You"" - you don't exist.  Third, if one were to claim to be God, remember that the Bible said that Satan wanted to be in place of the one true God as well (Isaiah 14:12-15).  Remember the deception that he used to deceive Eve in the Garden with the promise of faux deity (Genesis 3:1, 4-5, 14-15).  I don't believe that the mystics were intending evil toward anyone.  However, I do believe that they may have suffered ills at the hand of ""religion"" in previous years and have since inadvertantly accepted misinformation.

If you want great information regarding quantum physics, two-thirds of this movie is verifiable through not only MIT, Einstein, and other great scientific sources, but the scientific explanations are quantifiable within the pages of Scripture.

It has more depth with the interviews. the 9-11 statistical bell curve ringing is something Im sure many people would like to know more about. Influencing random number generators is another thing Im sure people would love to see more depth and documentation.

But having been a physics major I could  see where some issues could be brought up. Some of the scientists spoke with a seeming authority to make certain ideas seem verified certainties when infact the scientific community still Ponders those ideas and their implications.

I actually prefered listening to JZ knight than to ramtha.. ramtha only answered questions with questions.. and I have a hard time wondering why ramtha didn't offer any thoughts or information BEYOND what you can read in many physics books or psychology/philosophy books today. ( I'm biased a bit because I bought other ramtha dvds after seeing this movie and they were a total waste)

The interviews are good and thought provoking, but again I didn't like the way some physicists or non physicists spoke as if they Knew the answer to questions posed..  a better format might be to ask questions and give the major sides of the issue, not just one side, especially when most everyday people don't know all sides of physics issues.

The water crystal-thought portion was great. I just wonder why Other scientists haven't confirmed this experiment. I saw Emotos website and it seemed very commercial right down to selling water bottles..  which takes away from the authenticity or sincerity of the science.

The one thing I didn't like in the shorter version (theater version) was how they seemed to make quantum physics seem more confusing than it really is..  I hated having priests as a kid tell me ""dont ask those questions"" or were only humans and cant possibly understand god... so why do I now have to put up with Ph. Ds or PhD wanna bes sounding the same way??

The double slit experiment graphics were good but there could have been more given to help explain the particle-wave nature (see DeBroglie and/or Bohm)  and there was little mention of the Holographic nature of the universe.

It was nice to see the Bleep people had the guts to put the first scientist's interview that sharply disagreed with the movie and its overall premise. He had many valid points. Especially how the movie may seem to be attempting to create a New touchy feely religion based on quantum mechanics. The old religions don't seem successful in our world, so why would a ""newly organized"" one be better? (see Krishnamurti on that idea)

Overall.. if you didn't like the theatre version due to the premise you may not like this version either.. if you liked the theatre version but found it a bit cheesy this may give you more to bite off.. assuming you like science. Will you become enlightened from watching this version?.. ummmmm probably not.. but who knows... there are some AHah moments in it..

If they mentioned she was channeling an ancient sprit or sited who she was I would not watched any of this video.  I remember her from television and thought she was first class fruitcake.

Ramtha is the name of an entity that JZ Knight claims to channel.a Lemurian warrior who raised an army and fought against the tyrants of the times, the Atlantians, over 35,000 years ago. All three directors follow this woman JZ Knight. These are the philosophies of the film.
* The Statement, ""You are God""
* The mandate to Make Known the Unknown
* The concept that Consciousness and Energy Creates the nature of
  Reality.
* The challenge to Conquer Yourself

These are also the teachings of Ramtha. Many call this film a form of pseudoscientific fiction. One of the ""experts"" in the film David Albert feel his was misrepresented by the films final cut.

That aside the film is full of inaccuracies. The Native America story that's related in the film. About how they couldn't see the ships. Where did they get this information? None of the journals from the original voyage say anything of this. And all oral records of the Native American tribe the Awarks were lost in over a 100 years of spanish rule.

Humans aren't 90% water as this film wrongly states. Adult males are 60% and Women about 55% even infants, which are 78% water, aren't that high.

Amit Goswami,Dr. Joseph Dispenza and Mgr. Miceal Ledwith are all pupils of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment . Speaking of Mgr. Miceal Ledwith he was forced to resign from Maynooth College after being accused of molesting a child.

If you're not, you will feel so challenged (read: threatened) by the material that you will either (a) run screaming, flailing hands and yelling ""Devils!"" or (b) write negative derogatory reviews here, hoping to dissuade everyone from going where you dare not tread.

This is not a criticism, merely a fact. Those who are ready for a quantum leap in spirituality will ""get"" this material . . . those who aren't merely run back to their mother's skirts, aka familiar beliefs/religion.

For those who are open-minded enough to *think for themselves,* watch the movie and then decide. The filmmakers themselves encourage viewers to THINK -- and not necessarily to agree.

As for me, I have now viewed the Quantum Edition (NOTE: MANY of the reviews here were of the ORIGINAL version, as they were posted long before the QE was released), and as a Thinking Person I will say that most of it stimulated inquiry into the deeper questions, deeper than I have gone before in my 13 years on the spiritual path.

Some of it -- Ramtha, in particular -- I found to be less than enlightening, as both Ramtha and Joe Dispenza seemed to be so focused on the physical aspect of humanity that they forgot that we are *not* these finite bodies, but infinite spirit -- which does not have addictions. Basically, the overall message I got from Ramtha and Joe was: We are slaves to our addictions, caught in the human drama. Yes, that's true--IF you only look at that level of consciousness.

As for the film (Bleep or QE) being a ""recruiting"" tactic, I have seen Bleep numerous times and have viewed both the theatrical release as well as the full-length QE release, and I can absolutely say I have NO intentions of pursuing membership in Ramtha's group, nor am I interested in any of Ramtha's teachings. As with all teachings, metaphysical ones especially, we should remember to take from it what we find of value and leave the rest behind.

One question worth asking, of this or any other teaching: Does this material leave me feeling uplifted and empowered? If so, then follow your heart. If not, move on to whatever calls to you.

198009,4,1582704708,"I love this film. But it does have a problem and that is Ramtha. Let me state that I am open to the idea of a channeled being just as I am open to the concept of reincarnation. They both may exist but I have no personal experience of either. What I am most concerned about in the introduction of this important material to a mass audience is that the concept of interconnectedness is hard enough for most people to accept. Your film does a wonderful job of doing that but when it is discovered that one of the interviewees is a ""channeled being"" it's a pretty big opening for someone to chuck everything you've offered.

What is my problem with Ramtha? Just based on what she said in the film and with no deeper research by me there is nothing that Ramtha said in your film that can't be found in other material from Florence Scovel Shinn to Neville Goddard to Joseph Murphy and many, many others. This knowledge can be found in all sacred text including the Judeo/Christian bible. So for someone like Ramtha to be credible, in my view, what they have to offer really needs to be original. And this is simply not the case.

To put this all in perspective, I have personal experience of healing at a distance, mind to mind communication, and manifestation. So I don't make these statements as an ""unbeliever.""",1154563200,21,1308,4.468619246861925

198012,4,1582704708,"As per the previous reviewer, I also poured through the reviews of this film.  My immediate reaction is that the vast majority of negative reviews are from the ""Intelligent Design"" crowd.  Dollars to donuts says that most of them also believe Evolution is a myth and the universe is 6500 years old.  So if you're one of those people, this film is not for you... it's often hard to hear the cold, hard truth about how silly one's religion is.

The amount of protest should clue you in as to just how dangerous this film is to the snake oil salesmen known as Priests, Mullahs, Rabbis, Monks and Gurus.

There IS some dubious science in this film.  But the sections involving Dr. Andrew Newberg and Dr. William Teller alone make this film worth watching.

There's a huge debate going on right now between neuroscientists, psychiatrists and physicists as to the nature of consciousness.  Many physicists refuse to accept that there's a difference between mind and consciousness, which is where much of the argument comes into play... the physicists find the concept of ""mind"" existing separate from consciousness to be too metaphysical.

However, there's a simple way to demonstrate that they're wrong.  Most of us have been drunk or stoned at one time or another and in that state, have done ridiculous, embarrasing things which we later regret.  We were conscious, but ""out of our mind"".

Get it?

This film is no Holy Grail of neuroscience and quantum physics.  But it's a GREAT point of entry into the subject matter, which is convergence of the fields of study of the mind and the natural world.

If you find common ground with some of the themes in this movie, I encourage you to do further research on your own.  There are PLENTY of published books from the speakers.  And I'm not talking about Ramtha here... read the books from the scientists instead.  You WILL find much food for thought there.

One word of warning though... Tiller's book, Conscious Acts of Creation, is not for the layman.  If you don't have a basic grasp of modern day science, don't attempt to read his work.  It's not written for the general public in the sense that Tiller makes no attempt to dumb down his work for us plebs.  But it is a fascinating read if you can handle it.

I would pass it off as nothing more than dribble if it didn't hypnotize so many ignorant people to such a crippling degree. The filmmakers are doing a major disservice to the world by presenting made up garbage as science. They do this simply to advertise for Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, a borderline cartoony cult in Washington. I have a master's degree in engineering from Berkeley, so I have taken many courses on physics and feel that I am in a good place to pass judgment about the scientific legitimacy of the movie. I saw this movie with two of my graduate engineering friends and we all left the movie laughing and wanting a refund. If there is a single shred of scientific fact that is not distorted to the point of being unrecognizable in the movie I must have been too busy laughing to notice it.

The so-called ""experts"" are not scientists, they are quacks. One of them is a chiropractor! Not exactly the type of person from whom I want to learn about quantum mechanics. In the movie he uses the word ""mediocracy"". Did you mean ""mediocrity"" buddy? I think you probably did. Although it seems as though Ramtha's School for Wandering Morons is probably set up like a mediocracy. Which brings me to my next point:

RAMTHA! Are you kidding me? Look up JZ Knight and Ramtha on Google before watching this movie. It was made by and stars her and her mind numbing followers. David Albert, the physicists from Columbia University who appears in the movie, had this to say after seeing the movie for himself: ""I was edited in such a way as to completely suppress my actual views about the matters the movie discusses. I am, indeed, profoundly unsympathetic to attempts at linking quantum mechanics with consciousness. Moreover, I explained all that, at great length, on camera, to the producers of the film ... Had I known that I would have been so radically misrepresented in the movie, I would certainly not have agreed to be filmed."" Wow, this is like shooting fish in a barrel.

Look, I understand that some people out there, who, for some reason, can't find enough beauty and mysticism in the natural world, turn to metaphysics and spirituality. I can't understand this myself but I accept it because I know and love people who are like this. If you are one of these people and are thinking about seeing this movie so you can feel validated about your beliefs, know that the scientific ""proof"" presented therein is hogwash.

It is only a matter of time when someone will create a new theory which will show how imperfect is the one presented in the movie.
There is a quite extensive discussion about who the God is (or could be) and about all kinds of unlimited possibilities but, right after that they are trying to explain how human body works by describing all kind of chemical reactions.
They mentioned about dual nature of particles and they are even describing some experiments which have visually proven the phenomena and still there I could find nothing about other areas of our live which we can not explain like for example all supernatural stuff.
I understand that it is hard to describe the environment in which we are living without a possibility of going outside of it. The thing I do not understand is why do we tend to believe in what scientists say (even though we have no way to verify their theories) but, we do not believe in what was seen or physically experienced by other people and what is on purpose ridiculed by naming it a ""supernatural phenomena""?
It looks to me that the ""supernatural"" term is kind of a sack where people throw in all unexplainable phenomenons, and from time to time one by one is pulled out only to be announced as something what can be explained and really experienced (like the single particle seen in two places in the same time).

The answer? Well, you needn't look farther than any other quick fix scheme. While you may think the video is encouraging you to think for yourself, thinking critically about the world we live in, it falls way short of anything truly profound.

1. THIS IS a production of a cult localted devoted to Ramtha.  Seriously, look it up.

2. Now, you won't learn anything about science you didn't learn in high school, except this time it's all mashed up and purposefully confounded with emotional appeals (which is, by the way, the antithesis of science).

While the premises underlying the film are valid, I found the presentation and support lacking.  I'm not sure if it did more to help or hurt a paradigm shift that may be in the making about our basic assumptions about reality.

In my opinion, there was too much of an attempt made to appeal to pop culture.  In the pursuit of this goal, I think some very important context was missed and supporting evidence left out.

- We create reality
- God is a superposition of all the spirits

198039,4,1582704708,"""What the Bleep"" looks at quantum mechanics and how it might relate to the human mind.  It's interesting that, in each era we've passed through since Newton, theories of mind tend to mirror whatever happens to be the scientific theory of the day.  Thus in the age of the steam engine we had Freud's theory of repressed unconscious energy building up pressure and being released through dreams and slips of the tongue.  In the cyber age we've used computers as metaphors for how the mind works.

In the same vein, we are now beginning to look at the mind in terms of quantum physics.  This does not negate the previous metaphors, but rather builds on them.  According to the scientists on ""What the Bleep,"" the quantum world is not determined, but rather potential.  That is, nothing is really set in stone until an observer observes it.  Thus we, as observers, have a huge effect on the reality around us via our attitudes and thoughts.  Rather than being helpless victims being acted on by an insensate world, we live in an interconnected, conscious universe in which thoughts, emotions, and information send out ripples which affect the universe.

The film contains short bits of discourse from various scientists and thinkers interspersed with a story of sorts that is put in there, I suppose, to illustrate the points made by the experts.  I found many of the scientific explanations for laymen to be clear and very interesting, but the film also had some problems.

The story centers around a deaf woman who seems to be an extremely self-absorbed ""H.S.P.,"" that is, a ""Highly Sensitive Person.""  Everything she bumps up against seems to affect her in the way that salt affects a slug.  I found this distracting and rather overdone.  Also, the uneven sound quality makes it so you have to crank up the volume for the discourse and turn it down for the music.

In addition, the speakers are not credited until the end.  I was at times unable to figure out whether a speaker was a scientist or someone in the spirituality field with an interest in science.  A lot of time was given to the ideas of  JZ Knight, who, it seemed to me, had a lot of opinions based on, well, her opinions.  If she had data or experience to back them up we did not hear about that.

But the main question I have after viewing ""What the Bleep"" has to do with whether or not the quantum level of physics can practically interact with the Newtonian level of physics, which is the level we live at every day.  According to quantum physics, most of everything is empty space.  I accept that.  But I still cannot walk through a wall, because I inhabit a Newtonian world--albeit one which emerges out of a quantum foundation.

Now if, indeed, there is research showing that all the mystical, magical aspects of the quantum level can indeed reach up through the Newtonian level and render reality more fluid than we generally regard it to be, that's great.  I want to see it, and I wish the film would have presented it.  But until I do see it, I wonder if trying to merge quantum and Newtonian modes of experience isn't sort of like mixing metaphors.",1150848000,10,3122,4.608695652173913
198040,4,1582704708,"I really had no intention of writing about this film until I read so very many negative reviews about it, from people who obviously had a strong opinion often coupled with a poor basis in fact.  Most of the negative reviews focus on issues extraneous to the film and were written by people disturbed by the film's philosophical perspective.  Leaving aside all the spiritist mumbo jumbo, this film is trying to say that Science is undergoing a sea change in our time, if you haven't heard, and it means something to you personally.  That's all.  If that bothers anybody, they should stay in bed.

It just so happens to be true, and you don't need to have watched this film to be aware of it.  I remember in graduate school that if you went to the university's Physics department, where a number of Nobelists were in residence, the theoreticians lectured that it was impossible for events at the subatomic level to affect the superatomic level.  Newton was right, and classical mechanics still carried the day- I think several famous physicists had put together a credible 'interpretation' of Bell's Inequality in line with their own dogma, and that won their case.  But if you went across the hall to the Chemistry department, they would tell you those guys were dead wrong.  At the practical end, `the world of the tiny' appeared to cross that supposed `unbridgeable' gap all the time.  So what we ultimately are left with today is a paradox where theorists won't try to explain something they can't predict because it's not in their model, while the practical people have evidence in their hands that can be measured and repeated, but not explained.  I ran across a glaring example of this paradox when Scientific American published a review of this film in the Skeptic's column.  The columnist very smugly trounced it as `pseudoscience', citing the same dogma and a few other things.  But further on in the magazine, there was a feature article about how quantum technologies were finally becoming more available and already giving us better home electronics than we ever imagined....  WHAT?!?!  You Mean, we ALREADY have MACHINES in our HOMES that ACTUALLY WORK AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL?!?!?!  The short answer is yes you do, for a long time now, several, your DVD player being one...even though theoretical dogma says it's impossibile.  So Folks, you can't have it both ways.  Practical evidence is leaning towards some holes in the 'unbridgeable gap' proposition.  The film does make a number of conceptual leaps about what all this means, but no one, not even your dear professor Dr. Aunt Mildred, Ph. D., can tell you where scientific investigation is going in this field with any certainty.  So the film makers filled in the blanks, just like film makers have done and will continue to ad infinitum.  After all, it's their money.

If that's true, then where IS science going?  I'll give you a hint: the brain also works at the subatomic level, which is where the metaphysical angle comes back into play.  That's why the film interviews people from a spectrum of disciplines, as they all seem to be converging in, of all places, your brain.  It is here that researchers are seeing the most extraordinary and unexplainable events at the quantum level affecting a larger world, namely your body.  If they are right, the implications are staggering.  If they are right, it means something of the utmost importance to everyone, in every possible way.

Many reviewers have cast aspersions on the credibility of the interview subjects in order to disparage the film indirectly.  This is both ill-advised and undeserved.  The interview subjects include scientific researchers, doctors, theologians, one self-purported mystic and a chiropractor.  My favorite interviewee in the film is Dr. Candace Pert, who happens to be one of the most celebrated researchers of recent times whose discovery of the opiate receptor in the early `80's marked a watershed in brain science.  Her original paper announcing that discovery has the distinction of being one of the most cited pieces of research in scientific history.  Her subsequent research career has been long, highly respected and copiously published.  If she thinks there is a brain/quantum connection worth studying, then there probably is.  Only an idiot or an ignoramus would call her a ""pseudo-scientist"".  Most of the other scientist/participants are either near that level of accomplishment or more than well educated enough to form an opinion, which the viewer is free to accept or reject as they like.  Oddly enough, it seems that the inclusion of the chiropractor in this group upsets people more than anything else, if reviews are any guide.  Why is that?  Are they bad, or what?  Is there something going on about chiropractors that I haven't heard?!

Is the film propaganda?  Of course, just like all works of art; show me a film that isn't.  Is it an infomercial for the ""Cult of Ramtha""?  I did not find that.  No one is going to jump out of the TV screen and make you join their church after you watch this film, nor will you be brainwashed into such an action.  Reviewers who suggest this (and many, many did) really have a problem.  It is true that the film pushes a certain philosophical perspective, and this is bound to upset people who cling to a Newtonian, mechanistic world-view.  But to be fair, those same people don't appear to object to agenda-pushing in other films, which they should do if only from a standpoint of ethics.  Either that, or just admit their prejudices as we can all see them anyway.  It's already obvious they don't like chiropractors.

198041,1,1582704708,"Actually, deceitful is too soft a word.

The movie is actually a frontpiece for a New Age cult that tries to attach some credibility to themselves by attempting to blend their beliefs with principles of quantum physics.

Unfortunately, the movie isn't honest about this.  The experiments they present have all been easily debunked (as a web search will quickly demonstrate).  Their ""experts"" comprise one real expert who was misrepresented in the movie (and subsequently highly critical of the film), several of the cult members themselves masquerading as scientists, and a couple of people whose initial careers seemed to be about doing real science but then clearly went off the deep end.  (Mental illness may be involved in one of these latter cases but this cult doesn't seem inhibited about exploiting the person in any case.)

Quantum physics is truly a mind-bending science that has altered and will continue to alter our understanding of reality.  The precepts of this movie do not represent any real scientist's expectations of what that understanding might be.  People have fraudulently tried to use science to justify their idealogies since science began.  This movie is a just another (rather creepy) example.",1150156800,30,1221,5.220512820512821

The people who don't like it really don't like it.

I liked this movie a lot, although I some of it was just too strange,  Ramtha was too scattered, hard to understand, and I think brought down the rest of the movie.  I would leave ""Ramtha"" out of any future productions.

What I liked the most is that it provoked thinking, kind of like a helpful nudge in the question of ""What do I want to believe"".  I think one of the greatest things about living in this time is that we have so much information available to us.  We also each as individuals get to choose what we want to believe; one of the real gifts of being human.  To tell someone that they should not see this movie, or that it is bad or wrong is just stuff of the dark ages.  Anything that makes people think should be a good thing, right?  So I would reccomend it to anyone who has an open mind, and even anyone who doesn't.  Who knows, it may crack open a little bit.  Would be pretty sad to live in a mindset which didn't allow for our own personal growth, and personal freedom to constantly contemplate what we each believe.

It's sad really. They prey on people with an interest in science and make it sound like what they're presenting IS scientific. I thought I was watching a movie about the nature of quantum physics, much like ""The Elegant Universe."" But it's a bait-and-switch.

Yes, they found some scientists who agree with what they're saying, but they also took a lot of what their scientist experts said out of context. And they certainly didn't select their ""experts"" as representing the best of their field, as they claim in the credits. They just went looking for scientists who held similar views.

Also, one of their main enlightened experts is a 35,000 year old warrior from the lost continent of Atlantis, named Ramtha (look up ""Ramtha"" on wikipedia), being channelled by a woman named JZ Knight. They don't tell you who their 'experts' are until you've made it to the end. And they don't tell you that the three directors of the film are admitted students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment.

Most physicists hated this film. Read the wikipedia entry for this film. What they've done is tried to provide a scientific basis for their mystical new age, Transcendental Meditation, alternative-medicine, etc., beliefs.

There's a million dollar reward out there offerred to anyone who can recreate Emoto's results in a double-blind scientific study, and no one will take the challenge.

I must say, however, that I really LIKE the way they've put this movie together. The seamless blending of interviews with ""experts"", illustrative CGI, and a related plot make for a very unique movie-viewing experience. Could be a trendsetter. Please don't misunderstand my review: the movie-making was excellent. The directing was great. The music, pacing... all of it was top notch. My only problem is with the content and how it's misrepresented as being science.

A cheesey plot with a few scientists thrown it to ""verrify"" what they are saying and they think people believe whatever they say...unfortunatly the scientists only have about 30 seconds of time to speak each time they appear to ""back up something"" so there is no real explanation of ANYTHING.

I will say there is a LITTLE information thrown in there, such as the photographs about 'words and water' as well as about how your brain produces different chemicals when you think about thing. If you search hard and listen the bit of info that is there is interesting however most of this movie is just annoying. The lack of touching on WHY in any off this makes it seem like you are watching billy graham meets the xfiles, and seems totally ficticious.

If quantum mechanics tells mankind one thing, it is that quantum effects completely disappear at normal, everyday scales.  All the quantum fluxuations, strangeness, and weird predictions average out to make our universe one that obeys the more organized kinematics of Newton and Einstein.  In other words, the universe is a quantum mechanical one, but at normal scales of time and distance, it acts like a classical mechanical one.  The statistical nature of quantum mechanics averages out to leave us with ordinariness.

What this means is that the precise claims that this ridiculous movie makes cannot be measured or observed by any methodology at the scales involved.  In general, one cannot influence quantum effects with non-quantum forces.  If that were not true we would see large scale quantum mechanical effects all over the place.  We don't see baseballs tunnelling through baseball bats.

This whole movie is garbage of the worst kind.  Its claims have long since been completely falsified by the very quantum principles that any undergraduate physics student knows well.

198049,5,1582704708,"Part documentary and part comedy-drama, WHAT THE &#!@ DO WE KNOW!? is one of the more thought-provoking films produced in the last few years.

Marlee Matlin stars in the comedy-drama segments as a disgruntled photographer who begins to question her perceptions of the universe. During Matlin's journey through the film she is alternately guided, challenged and accompanied by various people who willy-nilly act as her instructors.

The premise is fundamentally simple: Essentially, the universe contains far more information than we can possibly ever assimilate. It is said that a human being receives 400,000,000,000 bits of information every second, and that only 2000 become part of our ""reality."" The 2000 tend to be the most self-serving and expected items in our environment, leading us to believe in the permanence of what we see. However, as Quantum Physics shows, reality is an ultimately malleable substance in which potentialities trump set-pieces, and it is up to the observer to determine what he or she sees from moment to moment. In turn, these decisions influence our reactions, which change the structures of our brains, which alters the biochemical composition of our proteins, enzymes and neurotransmitters, which impacts each of our cells. Thus, if we are happy, each cell is happy; if we are angry, each cell is angry. Behavior and personality are determined in part therefore, by what has come before. Our neural nets and our cells are predisposed to react to those chemical structures most comfortably, easily and quickly recognized. This recognition is a form of addiction: We can be addicted to happiness in much the same way as we can be addicted to heroin or overeating. In short, changing your mind involves literally CHANGING your mind.

All of this is illustrated by some very amusing graphics in which cells and enzymes dance, fight and laugh amongst themselves, altering the behavior of the poor, unaware people they belong to. Matlin can see this, and though she is overwhelmed at times by the energies whirling around her, she, the film's Everywoman, becomes the ultimate beneficiary of the lessons taught.

Central to the film are the discoveries of Masuro Emoto, who has proven how the spoken (or even written) word can change the crystalline structure of water. This is visually depicted in the film, as we are shown the difference between ""The Chi of Love"" and ""I Hate You And I Want To Kill You,"" the first a graceful lotus-like image, the second an oily chaotic abstract. Emoto points out that this as true in the human body (90%+ made up of water) as it is in a plastic tumbler, a stunning example of how thought can change the substances around us that we otherwise perceive as separate. For more on this subject, the reader is referred to Emoto's series MESSAGES FROM WATER.

Get a load of her accent! I thought JZ was from Germany..only to find out later it was just her Ramtha voice , so all would be able to tell when she was Ramtha the Warrior from Atlantis vz JZ Knight the housewife from Washington..

JZ, or should I say , Ramtha,  just where is Atlantis , by the way? How about chartering a boat , hiring a film crew and making a movie about that? Now THAT would have been far more interesting. One of the experts is a chiroprator ..say what? The religious expert (in a movie about quantum physics?) is actually a defrocked Catholic priest from Ireland.

""What the Bleep do we know?""

My answer is pretty simple.

You know bleeping nothing about Science!

I watched this movie with an open mind thinking at first it was actually a serious attempt to present Quantum Physics in a simple and fun way to people who don't know very much about science.  They got the interest of people who don't know much about science alright, but unfortunately they don't know very much about science either.  Granted, they know about some real Quantum Principles, but they mix those few tidbits of knowledge with a whole bunch of philosophical nonsense.  If you want to learn anything about Quantum Physics, I really suggest a different source.  Friends of mine have tried talking to me about Quantum Physics that they get from this movie and books like it, and they only end up sounding like idiots.  This movie is just another example of pick and choose science.  Science is not pick and choose, its question, experiment, experiment, experiment, and accepting the results.  Not saying ok, well i liked experiment #1, not 2, and maybe i'll redo 3 and alter some base logic, and yeah, that sounds just like what to believe.

My viewing of this movie can be summed up in 3 basic steps, presented here in chronological order:

1) Hmmmm... that's odd.  Normally when a documentary type movie like this cuts to the scientist/expert for comment, you see a subtitle telling you the expert's name and credentials.  It's not there?  Why?  Where is it?

2) Whaaaa...?  That [insert unbelievable not-supported-by-real-science quote/claim here] is not true.  Hmmmm.... this movie appears to be pseudoscientific BS.

3) Ahhh... the end of the movie.  Finally we get to see the subtitles showing who the 'scientists' are.  Oh, I see, it's a woman channeling 'Ramtha', the 35,000 year old mystic.  All becomes clear.

I think this movie probably appeals to people who don't have sufficient scientific training and/or critical thinking skills and  can't differentiate between real science and pseudoscience.",1145664000,25,1084,5.319526627218935

And they're using REAL science.  That is not just a waste of intellect, that's been termed ""intellect totally devoid of intelligence""!

Fact is, YOU the viewer, need to make the final call on what meaning you get out of this movie.  There are some discrepancies, that is obvious.  Discrepancies - if you will - are a 'reality' of life as we seem to know it.  Deal With It!  With a little scrutiny we can learn some positive lessons from this harmless flick.  Stuff I find 'boring' is that every latest science-inspired wide-screen, surround-sound movie we see today, has one narrow attraction / selling angle:  Violence, suffering and sex.  Futuristic flicks show idiots fighting with laser swords for the same dubious values as folks did in the dark ages.  THAT is disappointing!

198066,1,1582704708,"I am very interested in science, and scientific thinking.  I have spent considerable time studying physics (quantum mechanics), and later electrical engineering.  When I heard of a movie pertaining to quantum mechanics, and interviewed distinguished scientist, I was naturally very excited.
But the movie is an UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT.
The film has two parts, a story of a girl, mixed with interviews with several experts from several disciplines, physics, psychology/medicine, metaphysics, and theology.
The title suggests an exploration of our current understanding of the universe, and limitations there of.  But goes into some false wonderland, asking such unintelligent questions as: Why does anything exist? How do I know it exists? Where are we going? Why are we here? What is reality? What should we do?  Do I exist? Several questions on God.

My answer: Most of these questions are irrelevant.  Similar to why is 1+1 = 2. Because it is by definition.  Why does anything exist, so you can ponder about trivial issues.  Ask your fruit!  ;-)
What is reality?  Word used to define nature no matter how strange it is. Is reality really real?  :-)
Why are we here?  Well I am writing this because I strongly disagree using a fundamental physical science that describes an aspect of nature for purposes of mysticism.

- Drivel quotes from movie:
""What I thought was unreal now for me seems in some ways to be more real then I think to be real which seems now to be more unreal.""
Quantum mechanics... is physics of possibilities.
""Is everyone a mystery, is everyone an enigma?""
(don't expect an answer to any of these questions)
""This camera is seeing a lot more around me then is here because it has no objection or judgment."" (So does it see through you, or the quantum interaction, is the camera hallucinating)

While I watched this movie (while working on comp as same time) I was convinced that these people learned their physics by reading the back of a Cracker Jacks box.  But surprisingly some have distinguished credentials.
Some may have been taken out of context and misrepresented.  But Dr. Amit Goswami clearly states his thoughts manifest the world around him.  Sorry that is just nuts, and it is easy to verify experimentally!  Also he clams to have a scientific proof that God exists.  If you have a clue, you know that physics is not determine by proof.  That is done in math, where you define axioms and work up! Science such as physics relies on experimentation to verify or disprove theories!  Also unless Dr. Goswami has had an upgrade lately to a quantum brain (center of consciousness) is brain mechanics are not even governed by quantum mechanical laws, but chemical and electrical behavior.
-This belief of being able to be in two places at same time contradicts several quantum mechanical laws, and countless physicists far more distinguished then these ppl. Such as de Brolie relation, if that is false that implies Plank-Einstein relation is false.  Heisenberg would have to be wrong to, then there is Fermi.  For a Fermi particles such as proton the distance is impossibly small!!! 10^(-23)m which means all of Goswami's molecules are where they are within ~0.00001% of molecule size!  Oh yes you can see diffraction of a photon, but you are not made out of a photon or other mass less particles.

Don't know what these peoples motivation is.  Greed, blinded by cult belief, hooked on smack, taken out of context, lost brain in accident.  Are a few of my guess.

BOTTOM LINE
PROS: creative way of using complex subject: quantum mechanics, to baffle the gullible into believing in some cult. And buy cult merchandise.
CONS: Disjoint compilation, of story and material.  Movie gives a false impression that quantum mechanics is like the study of Alice in Wonderland, and that we have no idea what is going on.  QM is wondrous and involved, but it is study of nature that has been around for the past 100 years and is highly successful.  Even I routinely use QM for everyday work in solid state electronics. It also bother the heck out of me that physics and metaphysics are brought together.  Analogy is like bringing a witch-doctor into heart surgery.  Maybe my local psychic or priest can tell me how much Al impurities I should add to my silicon crystal wafer of my photodiode for best power characteristics!",1144713600,22,4589,4.900259067357513

Judging by the amount of `positive' reviews this film/cult-recruitment-ad have generated there should be a minimum standard for scientific literacy. It is not even worth arguing over their take on quantum mechanical theory, though they are VERY fond of the term itself.

The film (apparently) is meant to inspire thought provoking questions, questions that penetrate the very meaning and structure of our existence. Such as...

1)Where does the extra 20 % of water come from?

2)Do they tell you in the director's cut?

3)If it's not in the director's cut, than where can I find out?

4)Has anyone ever photographed a water molecule from a toilet?

5)Is it in the director's cut?

6)If it's not in the director's cut, then where can I find such a photograph?

7)How does the chiropractor who creates his reality deal with his neighbour who plans his day around the chiropractor having a bad day?

8)Does my sphincter really have emotions?

9)What is my sphincter addicted to?

10)Is the PHD student going to return all those library books?

11)Is it okay to be addicted to pseudoscientific theories?

12)What can I do about my addiction to breathing?

13)Does anyone have the number for BA?

14)There were three directors for this movie, does that mean there are three director's cuts?

15)What's the second answer to that question at the beginning that had two answers?

16)If you say `quantum mechanics/physics' often enough, will people be lulled into believing anything you say following it?

17)If that doesn't work for you how about seeing dancing peptides?

18)If the guy who wants the chiropractor to have a bad day takes a picture of a water molecule in a toilet and shows it to a 35 000 yr old channeled spirit does the PHD student still have to return his library books?

Seriously, if you are interested in real scientific truths, do not pick this up. But if you're into a good laugh, fond of peptides and want to hear the phrase quantum mechanics/physics 500 times then go to it.

Yes, some of the science is, for the most part, true. But after saying something scientifically credible the movie uses it as proof for the validity of some mystical pseudo-science concept.

Also this movie tries to convince people that things that happen on the quantum level, happen on the macroscopic everyday level. Things like particles popping in and out of existence and how a particle can be two places at once and so on...what they fail to mention is that those effects only happen on the quantum level, that is when stuff is around 1.61624  10-35 meters long and the unit of time is 5.39121  10-44 seconds....which is VERY FREAKING SMALL....TOO SMALL TO IMAGINE....when stuff is on a larger scale (such as everything we see in normal, day to day reality) they follow the ""old school"" rules of Classical Mechanics...This movie attempts to say that macroscopic things can behave like quantum particles...which is totally false..

I was surprised when I saw this recommendation connected with ""The Divine Milieu,"" by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a Catholic in the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), also a book that I would only recommend for a learned Catholic familiar with mysticism as written about by St. John of the Cross and St. Catherine of Siena.

Many people are interviewed throughout the film, which combines Discovery Channel-type expert interviewing with the fictional story of a deaf, female photographer (Marlee Matlin) dependent on anti-anxiety medication who is bitter about life.  These people are not identified until the end credits roll.  I thought they were actors like Matlin.  It would have been much more helpful to include at least name and career.

What I liked about Bleep is the statements that we hold ourselves back from developing our full potential because we cling to the past, and to chemical addictions related to past events.  I liked the change that Matlin undergoes, from self-loathing to self-love.  And that is also what I did not like about the film.  The film is self-indulgent and will make people even more selfish.  Not only, says Bleep, are you the center of your universe, but you can control your environment and the people in it.  This world is full of self-centered people only out for themselves.  If we thought of others, it would be a much better place.

What not to take seriously is Ramtha, the Sylvia Browne-like spiritual guru who says that we are God, that it is arrogant to think that we could sin against God.  I beg your pardon, but it is arrogant to think that we are God when we did not create the Earth and all the people and creatures in it.  She says that all our technological achievements are evidence that we are god.  Well, until we can make - not clone - a living being as complicated as a human - I will worship God and consider myself smaller than him.  Yes, I am creative.  But who made me this way?",1142985600,7,2071,4.616438356164384

I am half skeptic-half mystic, so this was a really hard film for me to believe in.  My emotional side, my mystic side, was so ready to give this movie 5 stars.  My skeptical side, however, coupled with the negative reviews I read on this site, made me do my research.  I also did not really agree with everything in the movie.  What also made me skeptical was the whole Ramtha thing.  I didn't even know what it was until I saw this movie and then looked it up online.  What I learned is that this film was made by the Ramtha cult.  Do you know how scary that is?  I was almost sucked into this crap!!  I was born and raised in the Mormon church, saw the light and left when I was 18, and promised myself I would never get sucked into a cult again.  (I am now happily agnostic.)  It is scary that there are so many organizations out there that want to control your mind.  It is better to think for yourself and keep an open mind.  If you can separate the good things about the movie (promoting healthy self-esteem, treating others with kindness and respect, knowing that the mind is a very powerful thing) from the mumbo-jumbo (masking mysticism as quantum physics, the Japanese water crystal thing) then you can get something helpful out of it.  It's funny how the movie explained that the brain is a very powerful organ, and indeed it is, but it is also important to realize that it is possible to be tricked into believing something that is not true... like this movie!!

The concept that we are all connected at the subatomic level has been demonstrated many times in many different laboratories.  The concept that our thoughts can shape our day and even our bodies is a known fact.

198088,1,1582704708,"""What the Bleep Do We Know"" is a movie that should set off alarms in your head as soon as it starts. The new age graphics involving bubbles and tunnel vision is a clear indication that this film should be approached with a critical eye. Indeed, the introduction does not mislead. The next hour and a half is filled with pseudoscience mixed with half-bake philosophy that makes the film seem like some kind of a cult advertisement.

This movie tries to do to viewers today what the church did to the laymen of the Middle Ages. Instead of using the Latin bible which the illiterate Middle Age laymen could not understand and so had to accept as true, this movie turns to the one thing that has as much authority today as religion had in the middle ages to back up its arguments: science. The average viewer today has about as much understanding of quantum physics as its medieval counterpart had of Latin. The film takes advantage of this and goes on to make comments like reality is a holodeck created by thoughts and that you can have a good day if you think you will (Em.., I think I'm going to win the lotto 649 jackpot today!) and backs all of its outrageous claims by saying that the claims are supported by quantum physics. The film in no way tries to explain just how quantum physics backs up its claims. A classmate of mine actually asked me just what quatum physics was after seeing the movie. A lot of the claims made in the film sounded really fishy and seemed backed up on wonky science. After all, one should be cautious before believing any information out of a film that states more than 90% of the human body is made of water (feeling bloated much?). The first thing I did when I got back home the day  I first saw the film was to cross reference some of the ""facts"" in the film. My great faith in science makes me refuse to believe that somehow quantum mechanics proves that a man can walk on water if he did enough positive thinking.

A quick check on google shows that the movie was produced by members of Ramtha's schools of Enlightenment, a school lead by a spirit channeller. Ah, so that hunch about the movie being a cult ad was not that far off the mark after all. But really, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that a film which uses jello-like cartoon characters to illustrate pectates can't be taken all that seriously. All this shows you have to be careful about the information you receive nowadays. Just because some experts tell you that matter is composed of thoughts and that everyone is god, does not necessarily mean they're right. Your common sense is your friend.

Effectively, they think that because quantum particles exist as probability waves until they are ""observed,""  consciousness is somehow the primary force in everything, and that if things are not as we would like them to be, that is a failure of our faith, not of the world around us; the world around us is a product of our consciousness, not the other way around.

The bulk of the film consists of snips of conversations with various ""experts"" who are not identified until the end of the movie.  Some of these, anyway, really are experts, but at least one (David Albert) has since objected that his comments are taken out of context, and that he does not at all support the thesis of the film.  His verdict on the film?  It is ""swarming with scientific inaccuracies, and its overall thesis is (in my opinion) wildly and irresponsibly wrong.""

The film does not approach its thesis with anything like a critical eye; it's more like a collection of animations and sound-bites that support its overall thesis.  It doesn't dig deep into the various experiments that it makes reference to (such as ""Dr"" Emoto's experiments with water crystals); if it had done so, the viewer would have seen how subjective and ill-conceived those experiments were.

I thought the ""we"" in the title was in reference to the human race, but the ""we"" evidently refers to the makers of the film. This thing was the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen. It's supposed to be about quantum physics, but it is just a lot of pseudo-psychobabble. And what little physics there is, is blurred by ridiculous claims, like, if you believe 100% that can walk on water, you will be able to walk on water. This claim, however, does not explain how, when I was a kid, my Mom broke her ankle when she stepped in a pothole she didn't see because she believed 100% that she was walking on solid ground. At another point in the film they talked about a photograph of a single particle in two places at once, but they gave no further details about who took the photograph, how and where the experiment was conducted, or how and who actually came to the conclusion that it was indeed the same particle. The film got really strange when they showed pictures of water molecules that had formed into different shape in accordance with a word written on a piece of paper and taped to a bottle, but again provided very little supporting information about the experiment and the controls. Uggg.

Quantum physics is endlessly fascinating stuff and a really cool DVD on the subject is called The Elegant Universe which features Brian Greene, who's a Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Columbia University. Many of the theories in The Elegant Universe are about string theory, and thus, quite strange, but he always explains the differences between fact, theory and speculation and always gives you the facts about the speculations so you can come to your own conclusions.

I own it and believe that taken 'with a grain of salt' this movie is in a league of it's own.  It is one of the most thought provoking and inspiring movies I've ever seen.",1141344000,,814,4.159235668789809
198124,4,1582704708,"Saw the movie, am halfway through the book.

What interests me is the quantum physics/mechanics info, and the possibility that I have more control over things than I'd thought.  Well, that's what Wayne Dyer, the Silva Method, Jesus Christ (something about being able to move mountains, with enough faith), people who tout visualization and goal setting, Goethe (there's a famous quote about Providence stepping in to help out, once we've committed to a course), and studies that purport to show that prayer is much more effective than one would suspsect, as well as many, many others, have been saying.

People are getting all bent out of shape because of the Ramtha channeling thing.  I don't know what to make of that, but the message IS something I can test out for myself, regardless of this particular messenger.  If it happens to work, then I'd be foolish for denying any possibility that it could, just because I have a hard time lending credence to channeling.

For the people bent out of shape that some diseased child could be responsible for his/her situation; my understanding of that is that some people believe that karma effects us from life to life (the kid could've been Hitler, last time around); others believe that some essential part of us (higher self? soul?) chooses the conditions of a life for the learning possibilities involved, before joining with that body.  It's not one bit stranger than many of the Christian ideas inculcated into us before we could think for ourselves.

For the person who felt like 2 hours of his/her life had been stolen, it seems to me that you could simply avoid anybody else's recommendation on a movie, because there's ALWAYS the possibility that you'll feel robbed.  If we do have free will, then you freely chose to act on that recommendation.  Maybe you could stop blaming others for your decisions - or not.  That's a choice, too.

I LIKED the notion that God is above our ideas about good & evil.  I came to the conclusion lately that we don't have to do one little thing to please God, that God is quite happy to let it all happen, because, if we are immortal souls, or some such, then it doesn't matter if something truly horrible happens to us in one life.  It never made sense to me that God would throw us into hell forever because we like sex, or even kill people for money.  Thinking that something like that would be that important to an all powerful, all knowing, all loving and forgiving God, busy running a universe, just never made any sense to me.  S/he/it just might have more important things to do, despite our attraction to the idea that it's all about us.

In Steinbeck's East of Eden the term 'timshel' - thou mayest, supposedly a Hebrew term, seems apropo.  If you want to find God and/or enlightenment, thou mayest - but you don't have to.  If you don't like one messenger, you can probably find another more to your taste.  That won't work for people who think Jesus is the ONLY light, and the ONLY way, but I don't share that belief.  If it works for you, then good. But even the small part we can experience of the universe is strange enough that willing possession by a 35,000 year old Atlantean warrior just might be possible. The existence of the universe is, all by itself, infinitely stranger than that.

Last thing.  Today, I decided to not go spend the money on an overhead projector, that I would do the goal/visualization thing.  My wife just called and told me that her boss's boss told her he had a bunch in a closet, no longer used, that she could simply have one.  I've seen enough of that kind of thing to want to see for myself if consciousness can interact with matter.

Be well.

198127,2,1582704708,"If I am to summarize this movie in a few words, I'd say it is an irresponsible use of scientific theories to indirectly promote a cult, and here is why.

At the beginning, the movie starts with a bunch of nice talk about quantum physics etc.. But soon you realize that there is a twist, when the movie suddenly jumps from Quantum physics to talking about our mind, and how to ""reframe"" our thinking. Every now and then they pitch in some ""experts"" to give their opinions, and through a sensational story about a deaf girl they get you going. Towards the middle to the end of the movie, you start seeing a promotion of a concept of ""god"" in it.. I thought to myself wow cool, trying to merge science with religion, however you will soon realize that the concepts introduced are nothing but those of the Cult of Ramtha. This lady claims that a 35,000 year old warrior from Atlantis is talking through her, and you can tell that there is a lot of inconsistencies in her statements.. and one of the major teachings of her cult is that ""you"", everyone, anyone, is god.

Anyway I was pretty disappointed at the end. With what started to be an interresting scientific DVD turned out to be an information flr the Ramtha cult (google it).

Unfortunately in such a setting, and even though they bring up some interesting ""theories"" about quantum physics in the beginning, their deliberate tweaking of the concepts to serve their cult makes any sane person lose trust in them. One of the experts interviewed, David something, was outraged after he saw the movie and realized they misquoted him to say the opposite of what he meant by ""cropping"" his statements..

Anyway.. just a sensational cult informational. Not worth a penny.",1141171200,10,1718,4.641447368421052

I see this movie as Scientology agenda movie, ""you create your reality"" kind of crap. Science, fundamentaly, is based on the assumption that nature ignores us. Otherwise science cannot be objective, and cannot exist. I know all about quantom physics, but there is alot more, actulally, as Godel proved, every examined system is just an approximation of the truth. Science doesn't stop, and this people are really sure that they got the ultimate answer, and the music, cinematography and cheap computer graphics try to brain wash you...it's unfortunate because someone can truly do a good movie with the same concepts, I just don't like to be brain washed, but simple minded people will defintly swallow this shallow, eye-wash, pseudo science...",1141084800,11,1162,4.933673469387755

198132,2,1582704708,"The ideas behind ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" are not new.  The idea that our thoughts come from quantum fluctuations was covered in ""The Emperor's New Mind"" by Penrose.  The notion that quantum theory has deep philosophical roots was covered in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" by Zukin. And the idea that we create our own world through our thoughts was discussed deeply in ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill and ""The Power of Intention"" by Wayne Dyer.

Given that I already believe the ideas behind ""WTBDWK"", I was looking forward to a documentary that approached these ideas in a new and interesting way.  I was sorely disappointed.

The documentary completely failed to make its point.  It's anonymous interviews with spacey looking individuals did nothing to support its assertions (they are named after it is over.) Most of these people seem to have been chosen to match our stereotype of what a strange new-age scientist would look like.  Many of them have an annoying superior attitude.

The documentary never makes a coherent argument.  It never explains itself in terms that a lay person could understand.  It never relates the concepts it espouses to the real world.  Apparently, it was attempting to do this through the Matlin drama -- a story about a jilted woman who is depressed. But one does not walk away with a firm grasp of anything.

The documentary seemed to be designed to blow the mind of the naive.  Perhaps it succeeds at that level. But, if you already familiar with the concepts expressed here, this will be a boring 90 minutes.",1140825600,11,1554,4.775280898876405

Then he has them pray for the well being of a group of cancer patients. He had selected cancer patients in various stages of the disease. He selected a control group of compariable cancer patients.  The meditation group did not know any of the patients. The patients did not know that the experiment was being conducted.  The results were amazing.  Not that he cured cancer, but the prayed-for patients showed better progress against the disease. Those in terminal stages did not degenerate as quickly as the control group terminal patients.

198143,3,1582704708,"[After hashing it out on the IMDB discussion forum with another viewer, I am inclined to agree that this film was first and foremost a pitch for JZ Knight's RSE cult-religion-scam. Everything else you are about to read is subordinate to this premise.]

It gets worse: One of the Ramtha people just admitted to me that the whole Columbus's Indians story was completely fabricated just for the movie :(
These people seem to shoot themselves in the foot whenever they try to establish a modicum of credibility. I don't know why anyone should trust anything they have to say.

There isn't anything positively inaccurate about ""What The Bleep Do We Know?"" It honestly isn't too bad for a light-hearted introduction to quantum physics from a New Age point of view. However, it is hardly original material. This has all been covered before in Gary Zukav's ""Dancing Wu Li Masters"", the original ultimate New Age classic on relativity from those halcyon days of yore, the 70's, which had then just begun to step into quantum physics, and the even better Brian Greene book, ""The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory""--better because Greene really does know what he's talking about, being an MIT physicist.

For as entertaining as W.T.B.D.W.K. is, it is not narrated or commented by serious physicists, but by marginal, sensationalist scientists and channeled spirit entities (I don't know about you, but I'm kind of washed out on obese tarot card reading channelers with bothersomely fake accents). I would label it as ""science light"". A likeable, entertaining bunch of coots, nonetheless. To her credit, JZ Knight is 100% accurate, I couldn't agree with her more. Which begs to ask why she just doesn't come out and be herself, why hide behind an invented persona? Drama? Commercial value? Too bad, keeping up the act must grow tiring after some years. However, she, and the other commentators, are indeed thought provoking. The idea of reinventing oneself may be the most important message of this story. What they have to say is important to the day, and I'm positively conflicted! If one comes away with the message of the film, and a good, helpful message it is, I think it can be life changing.

Dr. Emoto's photos (I'm a poet and don't know it) are great, but they're just artificial snowflakes. If you do a little research on the subject, the whole bad-flake, good-flake word induced crystalline formation doesn't quite pan out. Beautiful and artistic, but what he does is take select samples from thousands of laboratory created snow flakes, and photograph the ones that make his point, while discarding the ones that don't work out quite the way his theory says they should. Well, he's a great artist, but now I see he's training people in his new ""Hado"" flake... er, snowflake religion.

Marlee Maitlin did an outstanding job, I believe, and was well cast. She can act, and her physical attributes work very well in this context. By no means do we get the feeling she is handicapped (with her hearing impairment), instead, it's more like the subject is one who perceives the universe at an oblique or counter angle from the rest of us. It was a valid point of JZ Knight, when she spoke about how the brain, like the camera, is capable of receiving all kinds of input, but that is not necessarily what comes out on film. The same principle is applied to people, we do take in the sum of the vast universe through our senses, but we only perceive the thinnest sliver of it all. If the sliver that the heroine Amanda is processing is less for her inability to hear the lower vibrations (audio), well, it is still not much less than the rest of us.

If you enjoy this film, as I did, take the physics part with a grain of salt. There is a reason why the book goes on and on about quantum physics, and not mathematics or biology (well, actually, neurotransmitters and enzymes were pretty decently illustrated, at that! More conflict for detractors. Hmmm...), and that is because quantum physics is an easy target for the ""anecdotalists"". You see, at this point in time, we know so very little about quantum physics, that anybody with a vague idea on the subject can go on ad nauseum about that which they do not really know (particles in two places simultaneously, ""wavicles"" or wave-particle theory, and the like). These are people who would fall apart at the seams if they were required to write a scholarly thesis on quantum mechanics, and actually have to pore over other researcher's works. For example, we don't see Ramtha tet-e-tet with Stephen Hawking. That would be like pitting Rush Limbaugh against Al Gore. These are people with a good spiel on the surface, but it breaks down in intelligent debate at a more academic level of analysis. Expect philosophers to have themselves a wild time with quantum physics until such time as basic tenets are more solidly established. In the mean time, enjoy W.T.B.D.W.K., but don't short yourself by not reading other great books on the subject by people who actually know what they are talking about.",1140652800,5,5098,4.807297605473204

However, I wanted to preview it first because the reviews were mixed.  I'm not a physicist but I'm trained in the sciences so I have a decent base of understanding to spot pure BS.

Early in this film I thought it was interesting because it was laying out some of the strange discoveries that have occured in QM.  Anyone who has kept up with the field knows what these are and I don't think the film was misleading in that regard (when the scientists were talking).  However, as happens in a lot of places, the strange world of QM is taken as some kind of basis for how we ought to live our lives.

In the ""second"" 1/2 of this film they launch into a really heavy handed attack on religion.  It is almost like this was two movies pasted together.  The first is about how strange QM are and the next was an attack on religion.  They seem to be trying to say that the first justifies the second when nothing could be further from the truth.  Note that I am not religious and don't have any particular love of organized religion.  However, I don't think it appropriate to attack religion with QM when there are so many other, and more appropriate, things to attack it with.

Yes, it is a documentary, but it is also a story and there are some really wild special effects. I am not sure what to make of ""WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW"", but I know it is worth watching at least once, and if you find it interesting, as I have, perhaps more than once.

IN A NUTSHELL: Call it ""Sacred Science"" or ""What the Bleep do we know?

The original name for the film was ""Sacred Science"" if that is any help, but what it gets into is basically the idea of ""I think, therefore I am."" Stephen Hawking wrote a couple of very important and interesting books titled ""The Universe In A Nutshell"" and ""A Brief History of Time"", the latter of which was made into an interesting film as well which also delves into similar themes. Are we indeed happening to reality or is reality happening to us? Quantum Physics literally explores countless possibilites and probabilites so obviously the choices and outcomes are - well - countless! Unfortunately, so too are the theories!

BUT THERE IS MORE THAN THAT: There's a story too -- SORT OF . .

Many of the quantum speculations are put forth by ""talking heads"" and then acted out in a sort of story of the mind, and reality, starring Marlee Matlin. In this story, we see reality, the mind, and something that is tangible but different and difficult to quantify enter into human relations. It's almost as though the thinking power of the mind and its emotions combine to form something that alters reality, and the perception of reality, so that different people in the exact same setting may see, experience, and feel very different things.

ONE MINOR CRITICISM: A LOT OF INFORMATION DOES NOT EQUAL A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE

If I were to pose one point of criticism, many of the interviews contained in the ""Special Features"" section highlighted the notion that the film ""presents a great deal of information"". There is a large gulf between information and knowledge because knowledge makes information useful. To a degree, the knowledge to be gained from this subject is still in the future and depends on the psychology and wisdom of the viewer but, as this film clearly illustrates, we as human beings are getting closer to that understanding in our journey toward our ultimate destination in the universe. Of course, in Quantum Physics, what happens in the future may not necessarily take place on a linear time-frame.

Interdispersed with these interviews are laughably awful fictional story meant to demonstrate the complex issues the movie brings up.  The entire film feels like a creepy cult recruitment video.  In a way, that's not far from the truth (more on that below, too).

There are so many problems with this movie, that I'm going to go with bullets for brevities sake (and I'm not going to hit everything):

Why does this movie not succeed?

* The central problem, which is the source of much of the film's failure, is it's attempt to intermix hard science with nothing less than mysticism (as opposed to mere organized religion).  The film introduces its ""experts"" without saying who they are and what discipline they represent until the ending credits.  They hope this will lead you to amazement over how everyone in the film agree with each other.  Unfortunately that's not the case (tricky editting, see below) and anyone with a modicum of reasoned skepticism will start to realize that some of their sources are bring up things that go way beyond what a person would readily accept.  That brings us onto the next problem:

* The movie sets out believable (and widely accepted) science and then proceeds to extrapolate wild tangental claims.  Much of it doesn't pass the laugh test of an educated person.  For example: the film claims (without any opposing view) that labelling jars of tap water with negative or positive words actually changes the shapes of the water molecules themselves.  Somehow, if this were true, it would seem likely that it would be widely reported.  A number of claims in this movie are equally as hard to swallow for even the best-intentioned open, albeit scientifically skeptical mind.

* But the movie doesn't want you to disagree with it.  It goes to great pains to try and state that everything in unknowable and, thus, it's claims could all be taken as true.  The movie tries to take advantage of the areas of quantum physics that show that particles are hard to grasp because they seem to be many places at once, then tries to take that premise to the extreme in suggesting that we can occupy many dimensions of our own destiny and the world around us.

* The movie uses complex scientific jargon not to enlighten, but to confuse.  The process of the movie is to have one of the scientists briefly describe a complex area of quantum physics, then, instead of taking moments to explain the basics of how a concept works, try to bring the words in line with the ramblings of a mystic who is credited in the movie as a 35,000 year old Atlantian god (Ramtha) ""as channeled by"" someone.  That brings up a very important point to consider:

* The movie was independently made and funded by indivudals associated with the New Age sect Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, the source of the wildest, pseudo-science posited in the film.

* So this brings us to the experts, both real and in quotations.  At least one, Dr. David Albert of Columbia University, has publically spoken against the final product as something he doesn't want to be associated with (and nothing that they used selective editting to have him ""say"" things he didn't agree with).  A few of the experts, despite their good degree pedigree, have associations with, at best, odd institutions of higher learning.  Another expert is a chiropractor... how that gives him expertise on his subject is never explained.  Yet another is a former priest who left the Catholic Church after allegations of sexual abuse (and who talks against the ""mentality of the victim"").  The latter two experts are followers of the Ramtha movement, but the movie does not state that anywhere.  Hmm...

* The film's fictional story is a travesty.  Why?  It takes the talented, Oscar-winning Marlee Matlin and plants her in over-acted, over-set-designed, just plain tacky sketches that insult her ability.  I know it must be hard for a hearing-impaired actor to get work, but I had no idea it came to this.

* I haven't watched the extended edition released, subtitled the ""Down the Rabbit Hole"" edition, but all reviews say that the extended cuts of the interviews only accent the truly wacky side fo the film.

According the my non-scientific examination of reviews on the net, the group this movie appears to be least popular with are  physicists and other ""hard"", non-pseudo scientists.  That should be ample warning.

Unless you find the idea of watching something like this amusing, save your mind for a better mind[Bleep].",1139788800,20,5348,4.777777777777778
198157,3,1582704708,"This movie was recommended to me by several people.  I had no hopes, no expectations as to what the movie was about, though it was hinted to me that quantum physics was the basis.  I'm a chiropractic student and quantum physics is often discussed, as Q Phys (of sorts) along with standard science as the basis of what I'll be doing, so I gave the movie a try.  I was surprised from the beginning at how little the movie had to do with actual science in conjunction with Q Phys, but that was fine; people can believe what they believe, as long as I am allowed the same freedom.  Understand that the views given in the movie are not the whole scope of Q Phys, but rather an opinion mixed with it.  This is evident from the interviewees not able to agree on the same topic.  Again, nothing is wrong with a little debate, especially in such a controversial topic.

What bothers me the most about the movie is the absolute obsession with the ""I,"" the ""self.""  So much emphasis is put on the self, that they go so far as to say matter is scattered until you pay attention to it.  Nothing is really there unless you imagine it.  The boy bouncing the ball is a good example.  It shows several possibilities of where the ball could be when the woman is faced away from it, and not until she faces it does the ball appear in the boys hand.  Is there a problem with this?  Yes.  Saying this is saying we are the center of the universe.  They have no problem with this notion, going so far as to say we are God, creating and destroying where we will.  But the movement of objects, like the projectile of the basketball is said to only come from what thoughts we create and the influence of others on us.

If you performed an experiment on this concept, theoretically, you could put a baby in captivity on an island by himself, and he could ""experience"" the ball moving in ways the rest of us don't imagine, like bouncing once, then being absorbed by the sky, or erratically moving right to left as it bounces, or not bouncing at all.  Would the child experience this?  Q Phys says yes!  It also brings up chemistry (at a time it is convenient for the movie) to illistrate that the woman being hurt by the ball being thrown at her is impossible, as it is only electrons interacting, and the ball never touches her.  I'll remember this excuse the next time I have the urge to punch a quantum physicist in the face.  After all Newton's third law of motion says what we hit hits us back with equal force in the opposite direction.

The only experiment the movie is willing to produce (or able to, depending on your level of suspicion), is the photographs of water droplets changed by the positive or negative thinking of the experimentor.  Next time you watch the movie, notice the lighting on each of the photos; a pretty blue on the positive thoughts, and an ugly yellow-green on the ""I'm sick of you"" drop.  If there was no tampering of the experiment (which is never discussed, nor is it discussed if the experiment is peer reviewed) and the droplets are so drastically different, why would they need to enhance the effects?

Also, lots of cheerleading is given to the lifestyle of Q Phys, without a lot of examples of what the follower can do or act that is different than those of us unbelievers.  They mention seeing the future, going backward through time, and other amazing concepts.  But as well versed as these people are in the language of Q Phys, none of them can do these things.  Well, they're working toward doing those things, right?  What about children who don't have thought limits like adults do?  The first time the baby falls off the couch, wouldn't it stand to their reason that he could fall... up?  What about objects without a soul or thinking or an innate intelligence?  Couldn't they defy gravity or other man-made laws?  Oh, they do, but we can't see them unless we change how we think.  This circular logic is Q Phys's saftey net.

Now don't get me wrong.  There is much good in what is being taught, like thinking positively, ""we create the world around us by our attitude,"" and much of what we do is self-fulfilling... all these things are correct in my opinion.  But they act like these things are revelatory.  Much of this logic has been taught for thousands of years, and many by the very thing Q Phys detest the most; organized religion.  We'll get to that in a minute.  The hormones of the body really DO go to the cells that are expecting a certain emotion to feel validated.  Thus, if I consider myself a victim, I won't feel whole until something bad happens, then I can say, ""See?!  It ALWAYS happens to ME!""  I know because I've thought this way; I wasn't happy unless I was miserable.  Likewise, neurons of the brain really DO travel in a pattern of habit.  So if I'm confronted with a situation I'm used to failing in, I have a difficult time imagining myself succeeding.  And yes, often times our minds can confuse its past with the present andsee ourselves in situations that we have attatched a strong emotion to.  These concepts are very beneficial for everyone.  I may disagree with about half of the movie (maybe more :), but I honestly think this knowledge should be taught to young and old.  ""My negativity will stop when I stop justifying it.""  ""If you can dream it, you can do it.""  ""Success, happiness, and love are determined by my attitude.""  Etc, etc, etc.  This is the good part of the movie.

And the bad?  Their take on religion.  Now even with that sentence I just typed, you as the reader have already formulated an opinion on what I'm going to say before you even read it.  Try not to do it.  Let's be objective about what the movie says and what it does.  First, just before religion comes up as a topic, it is said that there is a difference between trulely thinking positively and having a positive thought wrapped around a large ball of negativity.  Fair enough.  Then they go on a mini tirade about the follies of organized religion and how they get everything wrong and how they fail to teach the true nature of God and.... whoa, whoa, wait a minute!  Didn't you just say there's danger in thinking negatively?  You mean you can talk about it, but not feel it for something so prevalent in the human experience??  Next, they admit that God is so big and mysterious that he can't be understood, and two minutes later they're tlaking about how a God so perfect isn't concerned with concepts like right and wrong...  Is this not a contradiction?

""God must be greater than the greatest of human weaknesses and, indeed, the greatest of human skill. God must even transcend our most remarkable-to emulate nature in its absolute splendor. How can any man or woman sin against such greatness of mind? How can one little carbon unit on Earth-in the backwaters of the Milky Way, the boondocks-betray God almighty? That is impossible.""  Why is it impossible?  Because YOU as a person can't comprehend anything else?  Because you tried this way of thinking and it didn't work for YOU, so it must not work for anyone?  The logic is if God created us, we can't go against him.  Think about that the next time your child disobeys you.  Then tell me it's impossible.  I made myself a sandwhich today, but it didn't teach me anatomy.  ""The height of arrogance is the height of control of those who create God in their own image.""  Oh, our short sightedness.  When this woman says this, she can't see she's doing the exact thing she's condemning.  She creates God to fit HER mold, her way of thinking.

Lastly, religion isn't even presented as an OPTION.  This is the fault of som much of this new-agey, hippie thinking.  They say ""think for yourself, don't let others decide for you,"" but what if I CHOOSE religion.  Religion doesn't require me to live a certain way, or think a certain way, or aspire to be a certain way.  I require that of myself.  Religion happens to be MY model for how I can obtain MY happiness, satisfaction, and love.  Again, a contradiction:  ""There's no right and wrong.  Only emtion.""  And as she explains this concept, she is saying that organized religion is wrong.  ""But I thought there was no right or wrong.""  ""There isn't.""  ""Okay.  I'm going to Church now.""  ""Don't do that.  That religion is wrong.""  ""Wait I'm confused.""  If you really want to let people make their own decisions and create their own reality, then let them do it.

The last part of the movie shows the heroin thinking positively about herself, writing positive messages on her body, and finding happiness.  As she walks down the street she sees the church again, and it is reiterated where religions get it ""wrong.""  Somehow, they connect feeling negative about life and religion.  As a firm advocate of ""All religions are not created equal,"" I can tell you if ANY religion makes you think negatively about yourself, you are in the wrong one.

Overall:  The movie makes some nice points, some bad ones, and some obvious ones.  I could discuss them more at length, and would be willing to do so via e-mail.  Feel free.  The movie is at best good, but inconsistent.  At worst, hypocritical, self-serving, and intollerant.  It may be a nice way to reaffirm what you already believe.  5 out of 10.",1139529600,14,9235,4.51207729468599

198171,1,1582704708,"I just recently viewed ""What the Bleep"" after hearing about the positive response it has generated from much of its audiences.  I was interested to see what questions are posed and how they are answered.  The film does advocate a certain view of the world and of ourselves.  To my disappointment, it dodged the most important questions a worldview must answer - the ""why"" questions most of us have (why are we here, what is our purpse, etc.)

After viewing it I began to research much of what was shown in the film.  After doing so,  I believe it to be pseudo-science selectively presented to persuade the viewer to consider the spiritual beliefs of those who follow Ramtha, a purported 35,000 year old warrior from Atlantis.

The filmmakers would have you take them at face value - neutral parties who are simply on the journey to know more about ourselves and the world around us. It is all about possibilities they say.  The film is a clever editing job, with comments interspersed from Ramtha (aka JZ Knight,Judith Darlene Hampton), and several of his (or her?)appointed teachers.  Be prepared for several creepy, spacey gazes from Ramtha.  None of these teachers were identified as such during the film.  One is left to wonder why(see below for an idea).

The film's explanation of quantum physics is very narrow, and many of the experts give an agenda-laced explanation of quantum physics.  I cannot find anyone respected in the field who is standing behind this film.  If you are swept up in the film's seductive notion that we create reality, and think that it is based on science, you are likely to buy into many of the other claims in the film.  The filmakers see no problem with their approach to avoiding background information about some of their experts, claiming ""it's about the message, not the messenger.""

Here are some interesting things I researched or observed:

  1. In addition to the films three directors, there were actors and others involved in the production who are long time students of Ramthas' School of enlightenment.

  2. A disproportionate amount of time was given in voice and film to Ramtha, Dr. Joe Dispenza, and Miceal Ledwith.

  3. Dr. Joe Dispenza and Miceal Ledwith are both long time students and ""appointed teachers at Ramthas' school of enlightenment (RSE).

  4. Dr Joe Dispenza (the one who creates his day) has gone to court and testified that his teacher (ramtha) has told him that terrible times are coming and that he needs to protect his family. He also invested over $10,000.00 in an infamous scam that infected RSE and was touted by Ramtha as a vehicle to gain fabulous wealth and many of the schools membership lost substantial sums of money. Some lost their entire life savings. This is the person who teaches the brain science in RSE.

  5. Miceal Ledwith a clergyman with a rather dubious past (a quick internet search will explain why)  He is the one chosen by the film makers to be the theological spokesman.  Why? He is also the theologian in residence of RSE. He has been marketing several products within the school and its followers. I suppose that could not have been done to easily in the Catholic church.

  6. The following persons in the film have all spoken at RSE and sold books there:  Fred Allen Wolf, Dr. Candice Pert, Amit Gotswami, John Haglin, Joe Dispenza, and Miceal Ledwith. This is not disclosed by the filmakers.

  7. One of the scientists who was in the film and had never appeared at the school is Dr. David Albert, Professor and Director of Philosophical Physics at Columbia university. He has stated in several venues that his views were totally misrepresented in the film. He claims that in over 5 hours of interviews he explained to the filmmakers why their concept of how Quantum Physics works has virtually no support in the scientific community.  None of those comments are in the film. He even called in to a radio program the director was on to discuss this and was cut off.

  8. To date, the filmakers cannot offer a source for the information which lead to the story about the natives not being able to see the ships of Columbus originated from. There appears to be no evidence to support this claim. In addition, the film mentioned ""clipper ships"" which were not even in existence at that time. Perhaps that is why they couldn't see them.

  9.  John Haglin does not mention that he organized the experiment in D.C. with 4000 meditators.  He also states that violent crime declined as he predicted beforehand.  Official stats say it rose!

  10. As for Emoto's water experiment, there has been no replication by other scientists, no control groups, and no publications in reputable peer reviewed scientific journals to confirm his findings.

  11.  One of the film's directors, William Arntz, along with one of his science consultants, Joe Dispenza, was invited to a forum at Portland State University. To put the question of free will and responsibility to the test a professor put up a photo of a child with Downs Syndrome. The professor asked if this child was free to create any reality he wanted. Was this child responsible for his condition, he queried? Arnzt responded that in fact the child is to blame for his own disorder--he is paying for transgressions in a previous life.  A similar worldview is responsible for the persecution of the millions of Dalits in India.

I want others who see the film to consider these facts, as it seems to me that the filmakers ommitted a lot of relevant information and misrepresented the views of experts not tied to the RSE.  Don't take my word for it.  Do your own research and decide for yourself!  The film is a slick package of ideas.  Investigate those ideas if you desire, but the know about the messenger.  The filmakers have said again and again that the message, and not its messengers are important.  Is it not important to consider the motivations of the messenger?  Despite my negative comments, I don't have anything personal against the filmakers.  Obviously I disagree with their worldview and their attempt to hijack science and merge it with Eastern mysticism, but I hope they one day find that which they are seeking.",1138406400,66,6181,4.768867924528302

Upon this hypothesis, the rest of the movie rests.  I don't know if this hypothesis is right or not, but the problem is they don't know if it's right or not either.  Wishful thinking can be right; but it can also be really wrong.  The studies they did of consciousness effecting water crystallization seemed interesting, something to investigate further, but they are hardly double blind studies that have been verified by others, so I looked into it deeper.  If something is a true law of how things work, it should be repeatable.  The movie doesn't let you know that such studies have already been debunked.  In that way, it is deceitful. I suspected the movie was flawed, because its description of quantum physics is really very bad (if you want a good description of physics, read Richard Feynman, Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene). I'm sorry that I had such problems with the movie; alot of my friends liked it.

There are really only two groups of people who would not like this film, one group is the types of scientists who are simply not open-minded enough to except any new scientific ideas such as quantum physics (especially as these new scientific ideas start to prove some metaphysical ideas thus blending science and spirituality - some scientists unfortunately just can't accept that no matter how much there is to prove it).

The second group that would probably not like it are the hardcore religious extremists who are to firmly set in their belief systems to open their minds to brand new ideas no matter how much these new ideas start proving their old ideas to be wrong.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is open to learning a new concept of reality that is not only very interesting, but makes total sense when you really stop and think about it.",1137628800,4,1116,4.683673469387755

The New Age path, is the path of responcibility and dedication to a better social/emotional life. Many people miss the point that you actually have to get off your buts and DO something.

I guess most of the negative reviews come from people who cant or won't accept responcibility and are offended by it.

I've never seen these thoughts conveyed so poignantly before. Seriously, this stuff is REAL, it works. You can directly project thoughts into others, as suggested in the movie. I can prove it, these people aren't making this stuff up.

There is no proof for the claims that are made in this film.  There is plenty of evidence to refute the claims made in the film and with a very small amount of investigating, one can find this evidence.  Now, a person who refuses to investigate such claims, to me, is the one with the closed mind.

Those who are set in their ways of ""The Olde School"", with minds set and brittle, will not get it. They are like the Church in response to Galileo's discoveries. It takes a LONG time for new ideas to set hold in a society, perhaps at least three generations. But eventually, society's thinking, and even the sciences, eventually change. Even Einstein opposed quantum physics until he studied it and his own thinking and logic more thoroughly. Then he accepted it. Truly, scientific revolutions are fought hard and strenuously. The ""old guard"" refuses to give in and update their thinking, and the new guard has to expand its ranks. Academia and its own set ways can be its own worse enemy (""We have met the enemy, and he is us""), and the enemy of progressive thinking. Much of the material in this film has been subject of many studies that verify the various phenomenoms.

Anyway, this movie is an eye-opener for many, because of the strangle-hold that ""official entrenched scientific dogma"" has had for so long on so many people, so firmly, and for so long.

But this movie needs to be followed by sequels that give even more information, and brings followers along to higher levels of knowledge and understanding.

It explains how these two belief systems are NOT irreconciliable and in fact, shows how nicely they can be dovetailed together.

While viewing this movie, I thought about the fact that 125 years ago, a little Victorian woman from New England wrote, ""There is no matter,"" (Mary Baker Eddy, 1875) which Einstein reaffirmed a few decades later and now this movie explains in contemporary language.

I have watched ""What The Bleep Do We Know"" about five times thus far and each time, I learn something new. Through the centuries, the most sagacious philosophers have repeated the same message time and time again: We have more control and dominion over this life experience than we accept and/or understand.

This movie explains the complex concepts of quantum physics and blends in a spiritual message of hope and love. I highly recommend this movie. The information it contains has the power to change your life.

This film is about a major branch of philosophical inquiry and it is simply poor scholarship to ignore the entire field you are discussing.

This film is like a documentary on evolution that never once consults a biologist or a documentary on open-heart surgery that figured it would be unnecessary to consult a doctor.

Think about it can we ever truly be happy with, death, disease, abuse, sexual misconduct, war, and bankruptcy, knocking on our door. Where can we find true happiness then? Is it even possible, especially if all the modern day religions tell us that we will find it within our environments and ourselves? So why do we keep buying into the lies the world is telling us.

We watch the news and get angry that there is war. Why are we getting mad that their is war? Because it is disturbing our peace, our happiness. Furthermore, we go out and protest for peace, ultimately causing less peace by protesting.

You know what I am going to say something that might cause some of you to stop reading this but I do not really care. THIS LIFE IS NOT ABOUT YOU!!!!IS IS NOT ABOUT BEING HAPPY!!! You keep searching for contentment you will never find in your science books.

People have told you before come to God and you will feel contentment. But let me tell you something else that won't make you feel good. First answer these questions to yourself; do you consider yourself a good person? Most of you will probably say, ""i try to be."" Have you lied before? If you have what does that make you? A LIAR!!!

WE deserve death. But because God sent his son, Jesus, to die for us! He forgave us! Murderers, adulterers, liars, thieves, all of us, he forgave. Yet we mock him and curse him.

Also, if the story of Ramtha didn't make you giggle then you might as well start believing in Leprechauns and the Tooth Fairy as well.

What's scary about this is that the film tries to incorporate science in it, only it's bastardized and absurdly used. One of the best quotes I have read in response to the movie was in Michael Shermer's ""Quantum Quackery"" printed in the Scientific American. The comment was in rebuttal to Amit Goswami's statement ""The material world around us is nothing but possible movements of consciousness. I am choosing moment by moment my experience. Heisenberg said atoms are not things, only tendencies."" Shermer's response is one not to be argued with, he stated, ""Okay, Amit, I challenge you to leap out of a 20-story building and consciously choose the experience of passing safely through the ground's tendencies.""

The Universe is truely a magical place and quantum physics shows us that there is a vast amount of invisible activity happening around and through us all the time.

I teach psychology and am generally interested in philosophy and science. This movie, is great for those who have similar interests. It isn't an ""exciting"" movie in the sense that mostly you will hear people being interviewed in a sort of documentary style and those wishing for typical movies should look elsewhere.

However, for the rest of us, this is an outstanding movie. I know Christmas is past, but this would be an excellent present for the intellectually curious person you know, or simply a gift to yourself.

What the video is about is listed in the editor's comments, but if you made it this far into the review, I will mention some thoughts and points. The video goes into what we as a community of thinkers and scientists are learning about the human mind and reality. As a psychology teacher the information on ""plasticity"" (changing your mental structure for better or worse) is very accurate and has been shown to be what happens in the brains of addicts AND in the brains of those who meditate. So, in this way this movie shows that much of your reality is constructed by you, which is why a die hard optimist and a die hard pessimist will probably never convince the other they are wrong, it's a mental outlook, that can change with time and effort.

So, finally this video is simply excellent. I saw it in the theaters and I will probably buy a copy too and who it to my advanced students, I hope they like it and I hope you do too. And I hope to get your vote for my review! Take care,

198201,5,1582704708,"Hello & Happy New Year to all those with open minds and who revel in the endless possibilities of thinking outside the box. This movie enthralled me from start to finish. And I'll admit, I had a problem with JZ Knight's inclusion in the panel of experts being interviewed...when she first became what you'd call a public figure back in the late 70's, I saw a film clip of her ""channeling"" Ramtha. Regardless of whether you interpret Ramtha's words as timeless wisdom or cosmic hooey, JZ's ""performance"" of being under Ramtha's spell was, at the very least, questionable. I am open to the spiritual possibility of channeling, even though I have yet to experience it myself...but if someone like JZ or the one who calls himself ""Lazarus"" is going to present it as a viable concept, it should at least give the appearance of being believable, and not something that looks as if it could have come out of a tent at a carnival.

There are 618 reviews ahead of me and I'm astounded at the depth of hatred being generated over a movie that, for all intents and purposes, exists for the sole intention of bringing us into a greater awareness of what we perceive to be reality and spirituality. As some have noted, when certain types have their deep-seeded thinking challenged--when the walls of their belief systems appear to be about to cave in on them--the first reaction is somewhere between hostility and ""kill it!"" You know, kind of like the yokels in old science fiction movies who see a UFO or an alien, and immediately go for their guns. How sad is that? And amusingly enough, have you noticed that most of the 1-star diatribes include grade school level misspellings and sub-par grammar? This leads me to believe that these reviewers aren't paying enough attention to the detail of what they're saying...or, more to the point, they just don't PAY ATTENTION. To do that requires effort. Thinking, and maintaining an open mind, requires effort. The path of least resistance is always the more frequently traveled one for the vast majority of the human race, which indicates to me why so many people gave this movie such vitriolic ""reviews.""

For me, what I got most out of this movie was the uplifting message behind the talk of quantum physics and its multi-layered facets, especially when they delved into the spirituality questions facing us all as individuals and as a race of beings. Many reviewers here have recommended other books instead of or in addition to the material presented here; the one I would recommend would be Neale Donald Walsch's CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD trilogy. Those 3 books had an indelible life-changing effect on me (pointing out in unmistakable terms what God IS and ISN'T), as has this movie. If, after reading these reviews, you're convinced that it's a propaganda film for JZ Knight, that it's all ""New Age hogwash,"" that the interview segments were ""subversively edited to fit their purpose,"" then by all means, don't waste your precious time watching it. Stay safe and warm, right where you are. But if you want to remove the rose-colored glasses and get what I believe to be a pretty good glimpse at a clearer view of Life as we thought we knew it, then plug in that wonderful open mind of yours and be prepared for a new experience. Only a complete dunce could walk away from this movie unmoved, one way or another. And I am in complete agreement with those who've expressed excitement at all the DISCUSSION this movie has generated...seriously! Bring up topics like philosophy and spirituality, and then step back and watch the fireworks. :o) Kudos and heartfelt thanks to the family of truth-seekers who put this movie together and gave it to the world.

2 final points: 1. I loved the soundtrack to this movie. In addition to incidental music being provided by grand Tangerine Dream alumnus Christoph Franke, they even included a snippet of ""Tingri Maiden"" by my electronic music idol, Jonn Serrie. Great music throughout the entire flick; I wish there were a soundtrack CD available. 2. We are blessed, as Americans, to live in a nation where we are still allowed to think and believe as we choose...thank God. If we disagree with each other, let's do so without cutting each others' throats, OK? For those who watched the credits clear up to the end of the movie, there is a final disclaimer that ties it all together: ""Agreement is not necessary--thinking for one's self IS.""",1136073600,18,4415,4.783748361730013
198202,2,1582704708,"I didn't understand over half of what was being said in the movie. However, to it's credit, it does at least get people's mental juices flowing and percolating.

I have a friend who had reviewed Amit Gosami's writings professionally and I asked him what on earth was Dr. Gosami on about? He explained that the way it was cut and pasted in the movie, it was very hard to understand the essence of what he was saying. Dr. Gosami, aside from being a world-renowned physicist, is a highly respected Vedantic scholar. However, the way he was spliced into the movie it made him sound like a rambling fool, incapable of talking to the lay person. I suspect much of the same is true about many of the other seemingly non-sensical points.

On Ramtha--I would question the authority or validity of a being that actively uses a human (i.e., possesses) to start a cult (that is what has happened, tho the movie doesn't get into that).

Emoto's work is interesting, but upon slightly deeper research, seems to be more hopeful in his conclusions about water, than truly scientific.

It is important to note that modern science cannot and does not deal with that which is beyond the five sense, mind and intellect and thus beyond our capacity to correctly test. So why then this movie about theories?

I saw this movie with many friends, all of whom are intelligent and spiritual. They were lost/confused for the greater part of it, and some of it is just hooey.

I also don't recall ever hearing about Native Americans not seeing ships because of lack of familiarity with them. That is bunk. That's like saying, well, when  you first meet someone, since you've never seen them before, you don't actually see them (in the physical sense). Nonsense.

However, like with Emoto, there are other points made worth pondering--if you can sit through the first half (or sleep through it, like my husband did).",1136073600,17,1887,4.714285714285714
198203,2,1582704708,"When I was much younger there was a series of movies that I watched with my little brother with such titles as ""There goes a fire engine!"" and ""There goes a police car!""  We lovingly called them Dave movies.  Whenever the main character, Dave, needed to get somewhere fast he used ""Quantumportation"" which allowed him to teleport from one place or time to any other place or time.  I asked my Dad, who knew everything, if quantumportation really existed, and he let me down easy, ""Well, they just needed a scientific sounding word.  It's just in the movie.""  What the Bleep has just about the same grasp of what quantum mechanics actually entails as the Dave movies, which were more entertaining to boot.
  I've been studying the history and philosophy of quantum mechanics for about a year solid now and I believe I have hacked away a gold nugget of misunderstanding, which in clearing up I hope will help people see that ""mind over matter"" is just a saying.  The misunderstanding falls around the meaning of the word OBSERVATION.
  But first, I'll take away the veil of ignorance about what QUANTUM in Quantum mechanics actually means.  It's good to pull out at dinner parties and such.  When you heat something up to a certain point, it emits light.  Since light is a wave, you'd expect it to be emitted continuously, like an ocean wave is continuous, but instead, it's absorbed and emitted in little packets called QUANTA.  Then it turns out that not only can light behave like a particle, but to fully describe the atom, you have to treat matter like a wave!  Now matter is ""stuff"" that takes up space, while a wave is an energetic disturbance in ""stuff.""  How can anything be both?  It can't.  But in treating matter as a particle, you can perfectly describe some elements of it, but not others.  Treating it as a wave, you can perfectly describe the other parts, but not the first parts.  You have to use both models to fully describe the atomic world.  Weird no?
  So, when an observer measures an electron, the more precisely they know the momentum, the less precisely they know the position, and vice versa.  And until a measurement takes place, position is ambiguous to the extent of the very precise uncertainty formula.  Once a measurement takes place, that uncertainty breaks down into a precise position, but one which could not have been predicted.  That doesn't mean that the electron could just as easily be ANYWHERE, just that there is greater probability it will be in certain places than others, but that probability is never 100%.  By the way, the uncertainty of something like a basketball is something like 1/10^54th m/s.  The probability of it teleporting across a basketball court is much less than one in millions of times the number of subatomic particles in the universe.  The chance of you doing it with your mind is nill.
  So, what is meant by observation?  In quantum mechanical terms, ""Observation"" is synonimous with ""Measurement.""  The electron is not collapsed into a position by the power of the human mind or any such nonsense.  It is collapsed into a position by the physical act of measurement, carried out by a person, a dumb machine, a toad, an ET, whatever.  A machine programmed to send a beam of light into an atom at regular intervals and record information about it will get the same result whether there is a ""conscious observer"" or not.  What you see in this horrible monster of a movie is pure overblown failed analogy, like any piece of ""scientific mysticism"".  For an absolutley brilliant and unassuming look at quantum mechanics as it relates to science, history, and humanity, pick up the play Copenhagen by Michael Frayn.  It's mystery, historical fiction, physics lesson, and all heart.  How can it be all those things?  By the end of the play you'll understand.",1135987200,22,3819,4.7534246575342465
198204,5,1582704708,"There are some fantastic ideas in this movie. People will get what they can/want out of this movie.

If you liked this movie I would also suggest I Heart Huckabees.

I've heard this movie is similar to some of the ideas at Landmark forum. I've had several friends do Landmark and they don't seem cultish or brainwashed at all. Quite the contrary.

When someone starts to ask questions such as ""why am I here, what happens when I die?"" They start to flirt and interact

with the perception...""that they may be having a nervous breakdown""...and in reality, what they're doing is opening up to the possibility of new concepts and possibilities. haha.

In I Heart Huckabees they refer to that process as dismantling.

Human drama is envitable, so I wouldn't worry about being brainwashed or disconnected.

Oh and the myth about the Native Americans and Columbus's ships I believe to be very true. Aparently there was a study where some aborigines from New Guinea were shown television. They had never heard of television and they could not see the images, all they could see were dots.

Some of the ideas in this movie combined with other things I've experienced in my life have liberated me from so much suffering in my life.

I have found that we all create our own reality. Everything is the same even if it's different.

Like everything in the universe we strive for balance. I balance my love for the abstract with my love for the condition of addiction/human drama/the chains of society.

In this life there are nothing but possibilities...of which you are one.

But the acting in the movie is very poorly done. The ""over-acting"" by the roommate is so horrible to make it unwatchable, and the other parts are no better. Marlee Matlin is no better, she really puts in a poor performance in this movie. Without a good director to help her, she just went off the rails. That wedding scene just went on forever, I thought it would never end.

The so-called experts are mainly frauds, cranks, chiropractors, and the only legit experts in the film have repudiated the film, due to deceptive editing. Candice Pert sadly went flakey on us a while ago.

There are a bunch of outright LIES in this movie, being promoted by the TM cult, Transcendental Meditation. The so-called ""TM crime study"" is a fraud.
The stuff about Emoto and his weird water crud, is another outright fraud and deception.
The stuff about the natives not seeing the ships is not only false, but is also racist.

Ramtha is simply a new age cult leader. Her followers are the ones who made this movie. If Ramtha can ""create her own reality"" then why is she obese and hiding behind a baggy suit that covers her neck-fat? Why is Ramtha talking about erections? We do not need to see that! Notice how much time they spend on sex? Obviously sex sells, but this is a familiar cult technique, interest people in the cult with sexual advertising. Also notice near the end of the movie, they show the woman meeting the man of her dreams? This is another way for Ramtha to influence women to buy her books, so they can ""find their soulmate"" by buying her products. But Ramtha, who is behind this movie, is dangerous to vulnerable people. She also speaks and looks like an alcoholic, notice how Ramtha is always talking about ""addictions""? Also, in the special features in the DVD, one of the ""directors"" talks about how when they went to interview ""Ramtha"" that ""he"" (she) ""got them all drunk"" in an 8 hour interview. Its obvious that Ramtha is a FEMALE (not a ""he"" as the director claims), and also probably a raging alcoholic. The ""director"" of this movie is obviously a Ramtha fanatic, who openly declared to one of the producers of the movie that he wanted 100 million people to see this movie. Its pure cultic propaganda for Ramtha. Period.

As far as ""Quantum Physics"" this movie is a complete outright fraud.
Its a complete misrepresentation, and the so-called ""experts"" are not experts at all, but rather shills for the particular New Age religion being sold by Ramtha. The neuropeptide stuff is complete drivel in this context.

Its depressing that the public is so easily fooled by this type of drivel. There is a profound lack of critical thinking in the public due to lax educational standards.
I feel sorry for those who are going to fall into Ramtha's clutches after seeing this horrible movie. So many people are going to be tricked by these con-artists, and are going to ""fall into rabbit hole"" for many years.

When Marlee Matlin starts drawing all over herself, and having some type of mental breakdown, notice how they glorify this? They even tell people that are having a ""nervous breakdown"" that this is a good thing, as they are moving into higher realities! Of course, they then have a woman who is mentally unstable, and suffering from delusions, throw away her medication! This is very a very dangerous behavior to encourage, and can lead to suicidal behavior in certain people.

Do NOT buy this movie, it is extremely bad, its dangerous and very deceptive. It's a conscious manipulation, and they want to sell you Ramtha's books and programs, and hook you into her cult.
Not only is this movie dangerous to vulnerable people, it is extremely poorly done.
This movie is being returned.

Although the movie starts as an objective documentary on different views on cosmology/reality/quantum mechanics, it quickly becomes evident that the interviewers are all on the same page on their view of spirituality.  There's a reason for this -- most of the panelists are apparently members of Transcendental Meditation, the organization that charges people thousands of dollars to meditate.

I only know this because a week later I was watching public TV and there were some physicists saying the same thing about meditation and spirituality.  Turns out they're also from TM (one was from the movie) and they're traveling college campuses with famous filmmaker David Lynch trying to make TM look attractive to students.

I've known former members of TM who say it was definitely a cult that siphons people's money, can't back up its claims, and teaches people to meditate so much that they begin to dissociate (separate psychologically from reality) all the time.

Look at the above list of recommended items which are in the same category - it contains books which are frankly just esoteric tales without pretending to have anything in common with science.

198211,1,1582704708,"""What the Bleep Do We Know"" is both misleading and just plain disappointing.  It consists of clips from various interviews, intermingled with about 15 minutes of tenuous plot and a few cheesy transition effects (like meaningless formulas floating around). It was nice to see Marlee Matlin (The West Wing) in a leading role, but there wasn't enough story for it to really matter.

I picked up this movie because it looked like a decent explanation of quantum mechanics and its relevance to daily life.  In fact, it mixes both accepted scientific theory and pure conjecture, without making a clear distinction between the two.  Halfway through, the movie takes a sharp turn.  It completely drops quantum mechanics and begins talking about the neurochemistry of the body.  It is here that we actually get a mediocre dose of storyline, and some brief but funny animations.  However the haphazard mix of conjecture and fact continues.

The movie really stars JZ Knight, one of the interviewees and a cult leader who claims to channel the spirit Ramtha ([...]  In fact, several of the directors are apparently part of her ""School of Enlightenment"".  The interview segments of the other interviewees appear edited to just reinforce her case.  Reportedly many of them were dissatisfied with the final product.  The movie really exists as an ad for this cult!

Okay, say you're willing to watch a documentary that's really an advertisement.  Maybe you're still interested.  But wait, there's more!  Not only is the movie misleading, it is also incredibly boring and confusing.  Imagine a TV.  Now imagine there happen to be interviews on several different channels that all have to do, more or less, with the same topic.  Maybe some of the interviewees contradict eachother.  Now throw in a show about cult leader (who claims to channel the spirit of an ascended being from Atlantis -- oh, wait, maybe we should just throw in the sci-fi series Stargate.  It has the same plot).  Now throw in a boring movie about a deaf photographer.  Now, imagine you are switching channels completely randomly.  Do this for two agonizing hours.  Okay, you've just watched this movie.

It's not just that the movie is badly put together (there is no narrator, just a succession of interviews).  It's not just that its a thinly veiled ad for a cult.  It's not just that the small amount of plot that exists is boring and already done a million times.  Its a combination of all of these that makes the movie completely unwatchable.  Don't waste your money.

Oh boy! This movie is like Aristotle meeting the Flatlanders.
Amazing how hateful and violent people get when a paradigm comes along that threatens their box of beliefs and opinions. I suppose it just adds more credence to the movie and the power of its message. If anyone has ever sincerely questioned the nature of reality and their participation in it, this movie is for you! But go with an open mind, and be ready to step outside the box of religious, social and even 'scientific' programming. And suspend judgement and opinion until after the movie and after you've made at least a sincere attempt at grasping the concepts being presented. Opinions and judgements without a sincere attempt at understanding is just an attempt by the brain to protect its set of programmed beliefs and opinions from change. Notice, how the brain has a whole plethora of knee-jerk reactions that refute anything that does not belong to it's current programmed paradigm.
Anything outside its boudaries is viewed with fear, suspicion and hostility. Human resitance towards its own evolution has always been an enigma, but history bears it out. Any attempt at expansion always seems to bring out the perverbial 'lynch mob' whose job, it seems, is to discourage change and evolution and to maintain the status quo.

Knight says that she is able to channel Ramtha by leaving her body; he uses her body and speaks through her.  Knight now lives in a multi-million dollar French chateau-styled mansion in the outskirts of Yelm, Washington, where she teaches courses and runs Ramtha's School of Enlightenment.

I don't personally put a lot of merit into the words of a woman who claims to be channeling an ancient spirit called Ramtha.  However, the points she made about God and inter-human connection were very sentient and valid.

This movie also made several somewhat unnerving points about addiction, not only to substances but to relationships (why do we keep falling for the same losers over and over?), and most of the points the filmmakers made in those segments are relatively uncontested among modern neuroscientists (neurons that fire together wire together, that sort of thing).

I can recommend watching this movie to anyone, because even if you hate it (which you very well might, and if you do, you have undoubtedly valid reasons), it WILL make you think, and not only will it make you think, but it'll make you think about BIG ISSUES.

If you don't believe me, do a search on google.com.  Supposedly, after the movie was released, one of the scientists (David Albert) claimed he was heavily edited, and said had he known he would have been so grossly misrepresented, he would never have agreed to the interview.

If you want to experience a twisted sense of reality, you might enjoy this film for entertainment purposes.  However, you should realise that the directors are misrepresenting science in order to promote the school of an ""enlightened one"" named Ramtha.  It is a religious cult, and like any organized religion, it imposes a set of beliefs upon you, rather than encouraging you to think for yourself.  It's worse than other organized religions in that it misrepresents science to mislead well-meaning, intelligent folks into believing it is based on scientific research rather than on the occult.  At least most other organized religions do not claim to be science-based, they admit to being faith-based.

Many people seem to think it was too new-agey, but the movie deals much more with science than religion, approaching the nature of reality from a quantifiable perspective rather than subjective conjecture.  The people interviewed were almost all scientists; scientists with open minds who like Einstein were enamored by mystery and able to conceive of a reality much more fantastical than we are used to seeing.  Also, the scientists all have credentials; phD's etc...as some folks might not have seen because they left before the movie was over.  The inclusion of one religious woman: Ramtha, against about ten scientists however seems to tip the balance in favor of ""new age""--that is ridiculous.  There is a stubborness on the part of many to investigate the nature of reality, and to use scientific means to further prove that ""religious truths"" do have credibility.
There will always be a rift between believers of science and religion, but there will also be a few who can simultaneously believe in contradictory concepts, like creationism and evolutionism.  Being able to embrace paradox is important in understanding reality, as any physicist would tell you, and any Zen Master.  Not many people know that Newton was more interested in alchemy than theories of motion, but he is considered by many to be the father of modern science.  I suspect that if people were not so rigid and dogmatic in their thinking, more people would know the truth about Newton as he would not have had to go about his experiments in secret.  As far progressed as we have come in our thinking, it is clear that the majority will always prefer to live in the wake of history rather than be at the bow of the ship.  Many scientists are not  able to see, and are consequently far from admitting that they are as dogmatic as right-wing religionists.
I did feel like there a lack of continuity at times, and also that some of the scientists were vague in their statements, but that did not disrupt my intense interest.  I am not sure why the directors chose the lead actress who is deaf, but I suspect she has a 'real' quality to her that made her desirable.

198222,5,1582704708,"I liked that this movie offers examples of seeing everything in an unconventional way, specifically in how it addresses the depressive ruts that many of us experience from time to time. I don't care if any of it is scientifically plausible or not, it's fun just to speculate. I mean, throughout the history of our species, most of mankind has believed in a world beyond the five senses. This movie simply offers different interpretations on those ideas.

When reading the reviews, you notice the 1 star-5 star gap. I'm unsure why there is such a persistent, concentrated effort by this film's haters to smear the ideas presented in it.

According to the film's haters, those who took anything posivite from it are going to shave their heads and start wandering airports handing out brochures on the subject, but I think that's highly doubtful. I'm unsure why some are so offended or frightened by the ideas in this movie. It's just one way of looking at existence. So....why all the hatred?

The scientific community is usually more discerning, and would tend to ignore and dismiss out of hand ideas it collectively considered unsubstantiated. Afterall, if the scientific community so assuredly knows that those who made this movie are inept sharlitans, and those who enjoyed their film are, as Peapod Fontain claims, uneducated, inferior drug addicts, than why would those representing the lofty pedestal of the scientific collective even BOTHER with a persistent campaign of negative, counter reviews for such a ""goofy"" movie? Wouldn't they just ignore it, realizing that such ""numskull"" ideas will only find foothold within a very limited niche who realistically will have very little, if any, influence within establishment circles? Are, do the film's haters simply enjoy bullying those from the ""unwashed masses"" who found something positive in this movie?

Unlike the scientific community, the fundamentalist right wing community, on the other hand, is VERY dilligent in its attacks on every and anything perceived as a threat to its beliefs. Just as Peapod Fontain makes the sweeping generalization of those who give this movie 5 stars, I too will rely on speculation, and suggest that, under the guise of defending ""science,"" many of the hateful reviews for this movie may indeed be part of a collective effort of online saboteurs seeking to discredit this movie because of its very ""liberal"" take on faith, god and existence.

That alone wouldn't be sufficient to organize a smear campaign though: the pivotal point would the *widespread interest in this movie*.

Only when the fundamentalists realize the perceived ""threat"" is gaining acceptance are they compelled to organize, take orders, and march in lockstep onto their various disinfo campaigns. These are the very same wonderful, inquisitive types sometimes rally at gay people's funerals with ""God Hates Fags"" signs. Conversely, if you go through and read the 1 star reviews, you'll often find that its not so much the ideas of this movie that they seem to hate, but rather those who liked it, got something positive from it, and expressed it in review.

Similarly, prior reviewer Peapod Fontain equates anyone who enjoyed ""What The Bleep..?"" as likewise explaining the public's unfortunate acceptance of the illegitimate Bush Co regime.

Now really, if you read the 5 star reviews of this movie, you'll likely not find the thoughts of automatized, unconscionable Bushbots. I happen to think that rampant, unchecked competition and ultra-greedy and aggressive ME FIRST consumerism - the type of people who are often unable to see the Bush Co for what it is - has gotten much more mileage in the declivity of our superficial Western culture than has, by comparison, the minuscule fraction of our populace that can dragged away from the TV, the workout/stairmaster club, the shopping mall, or the athletic field long enough to even think about something like the ideas in this movie for more than thirty seconds.

Perhaps Peapod Fontain is much ""higher"" than the others he or she accusses of being? Or maybe he or she, although rightfully critical of the Bush Co, doesn't fully realize the illusory, multifarious agenda of our governments hypocritical, counterfeit ""war on drugs?"" Or maybe it's simply a matter of Peapod's inability to get the ""good stuff?"" Who knows? Who cares?

Overall, I found ""What The Bleep..?"" very interesting in that it made me think while being entertained, and that alone is quite rare for any movie these days.",1134345600,19,4504,5.099050203527815

198224,1,1582704708,"What the Bleep Do We Know? is a not-very-entertaining and ultimately frustrating mishmash of quantum physics, psychology, new ageism, and post-modernism. I have a mental image of the producers of this movie asking each other, ""What kind of film can we make that will make us seem really intelligent by virtue of confusing our audience and misapplying scientific concepts?"" If this was their goal, they have succeeded admirably.  While presented without the advantages of clarity and logic, the movie makes a half-hearted attempt to use the implications of quantum physics to help people with their psychological problems. That sound you hear is Werner Heisenberg turning over in his grave. To gain an understanding of silly movies like this one I recommend reading Fashionable Nonsense by Sokal and Bricmont.

But the primary problem with this film is that its main thesis fundamentally contradicts itself. Specifically, it states that modern science in general, and quantum physics in particular, have shown us that there really is no objective reality or truth, that all experiences are fundamentally subjective and dependent on the observer; we create our own reality.  The movie then proceeds to make a variety of confident truth claims about the nature of emotions, the brain, addictions, neurotransmitters, morals, God, religion, spirituality, history, etc. Subjective, observer-dependent reality has conveniently gone out the window. Don't they see the contradiction?",1134172800,20,1474,5.542222222222223
198225,5,1582704708,"This well-made documentary explores the subject of Quantum theory in relation to consciousness in terms of our perceptions of reality. The sub-atomic level of existence, when observed, does not follow the determined laws of Newtonian physics, that is to say, cause and effect, notions of forward time continuums, and the rules of motion. In fact, scientists have observed particles, electrons, even the nucleus of the atom, disappear and reappear for no apparent reason. Even further to this, these so-called particles of matter also appear to have ""consciousness"", as they react to being observed under certain laboratory conditions. Known in quantum physics as the ""non-locality"" theory, a sub-atomic particle seems to know what the others are doing - this discovery has opened the door to a whole new world of our conceptions of reality: are we the creators of reality or mere pedestrians of an ""already-made-world""?

The film raises some very provocative questions. One of which is the fact that we have been conditioned to view the world in a certain way. There is only so much information that our brains can process over a period of time. The vast majority of our knowledge of the world depends largely on our experience. In other words, if we have not experienced a particular phenomenon, chances are it can exist right before our eyes, and we will not perceive it.

A good example the film provides is the native Indians of the Caribbean. When Columbus arrived in the 13th century upon the shores of the new world, the natives, because they had never witnessed anything like it in their reality, could not see the ships on the water! An Indian Shaman observed the ripples on the water indicating some kind of disturbance, but he still could not see anything on the water. Determined to do so, he walked to the beach every day until he finally could see Columbus' sailing vessels floating off the shore. It was only after forcing his fellow natives to ""see"" and to trust his judgement that they too could see the ships. What does this story tell us about consciousness and so-called reality?  We really can only perceive those things in our environment that has been experienced or processed in our brains. This begs the question: do we create our own reality? Is there phenomenon or another reality existing right before our eyes that we just cannot see? As the film asks, how far are you willing to go down the rabbit hole?

Teaching science has now grown into an art form, where complex theories can be conveyed in an entertaining manner, making the learning experience easy and fun. This film attempted to present quantum theory, cognitive theory, epistemology and neurology, combining to give the viewer a different perspective of the world. Written with expertise and compelling imagery with excellent interviews of academics and theorists, What the Bleep do We Know is a documentary of the highest calibre. Recommended for professional educators and the curious.",1134172800,11,2977,4.983903420523139
198226,5,1582704708,"What The Bleep Do We Know?

A very popular film indeed, for good reason. It introduces many of the Mind-Over-Matter concepts in a concise way, and it does it very entertainingly indeed, a great trick to pull off!

Mankind is currently in the middle of possibly the biggest spiritual renaissance in history.

There are literally hundreds of books written in the past decade about how spirituality and science are now meeting in the middle, to a new awareness of how we are all of us taking part in the creation and the control of the universe, of our own bodies and even way beyond that.

It is a tricky subject. Most of us get strong emotional reactions to such statements. We know damn well that we are not god or anything like him. We know that we are just small particles blown about by the winds and the wims of the big, cold universe. We know we are victims.

Responsibility is a frightening thing. And ""with big powers come big responsibility"", as one of the good ole superheroes likes to point out. What if we are not really small helpless victims who deserve all the sympathy we can get when we whine about the government and how the rest of the big cruel world does us in? What if in reality we are really running the show from a secret little place hidden away in our mind, and if we really wanted, we could take over that power, and potentially change not only our own lives completely, but also have big effects on the world beyond? Yes, very scary indeed.

Yet also exhilarating... what if shirking our responsibility does not really relieve us of it, but instead buries it underground, where it becomes a nasty zombie monster which we have nightmares about in the night, but which only became a monster because we tried to kill it? What if a ""big responsibility"", when accepted boldly into our lives is not anything scary or negative at all, but a thing as natural as breathing, and indeed even very easy to live with? Indeed, what if wielding your superman-like powers and responsibilities can one day seem kid's play?

The interesting thing about this particular spiritual renaissance is that this time it is not just coming from a few nutcases and hardcore philosophical fringe groups. It is not just spiritual teachers in lotus positions who tells us that ""you are creating the universe"". This time it is coming from all kinds of places. And this includes hard core scientist.

Yes, that's right. In the past several decades, more and more top-rank scientists, including nobel-prize winners, have started talking about how there are energy fields outside the areas we normally have recognized as ""physical"" and how life force seems to be one of them. They have talked about how at a sub-atomic level (quantum level) the universe does not follow traditional (Newtonian) rules, and things can be more than one place at once, and super-light speeds are attainable. They talk about how the observer in ACTUAL EXPERIMENTS have measurable influence on the outcome of the experiment, just by the expectations he holds in his mind!

In addition, many, many experiments have been carried out by both scientists, mystic groups, and Eastern and Western religious groups, many of which show beyond any reasonable doubt that prayer or meditation (in other words, deciding on or expecting a certain thing to be true) DOES IN FACT influence the the real world in a very measurable way. People are affecting the healing of other people with illnesses in double-blind studies, and they are affecting the crime rates of major areas by their minds.

I frankly will not bother to document all these things here, for they are documented in literally hundreds of books. If you do a few searches on Amazon, you will find them. Some are written for scientists, others are more accessible for laymen.

This revolution is huge. I have long had no doubt that almost all the ills of mankind (the four horsemen of the apocalypse: War, Hunger, Pestilence, and Italian Pop Music) are mainly based in a mechanistic view of the universe. If you are just a meat machine, and others are only upright animals, who cares what you do to them? If you die when your body dies, who cares about the effects of your actions in 500 years? If you are the whipping boy of the world, who can blame you if retaliate with a few morally doubtful actions of your own?

Not to mention, if you have no clue that your thoughts, your emotions, and most of all your expectations are the very thing which are creating your life, in the big and in the small, then obviously you will not be aware that it is probably not a good idea to expect a whole lot of undesirable things to happen to you! You will not be aware of the amazing things you can make happen just by thinking and feeling.

The long and the short of these developments is: we are not in Kansas anymore. And when this hits the mainstream consciousness for real, I doubt we will even be on the Earth anymore, as we know it. The fun is just starting!",1133568000,12,4972,4.617214043035108

It did introduce seemingly new ideas that we can look at and determine if they have value.... But you might want to research the sources of the information. After my own research I've determined this film was not a very good source of information. it distorts Quantum physics to support a mystical/New Age viewpoint. The main point of the film is that Quantum mechanics proves a conscious observer is needed to create reality. The conclusion is we actually create reality with our thoughts. The theory of Quantum mechanics does not say this at all. The film producers are confusing the theory of Quantum mechanics with an interpretation of Quantum mechanics. Also, David Albert, the professor fat Columbia University physics department who was featured in the film, has stated at Salon.com as follow:  --- "" was edited in such a way as to completely suppress my actual views about the matters the movie discusses. I am, indeed, profoundly unsympathetic to attempts at linking Quantum mechanics with consciousness. Moreover, I explained all that, at great length, on camera, to the producers of the film ...

198228,1,1582704708,"I expected to like this movie since a number of friends had recommended it. However, as soon as I saw JZ Knight I had my doubts. She seemed to me be a huckster. I wondered why, with all of the really solid spiritual teachers available, the filmmakers would choose her. The other talking heads were a bit uneven, but one or two seemed like they might be solid. Anyway, I saw the movie twice and then, because I still had doubts, I looked into the film a little more and found a few unsettling items:

*Followers of JZ Knight made the film. They were apparently unconcerned that in the 1980s she had her students use copper to shield against aliens, that she had predicted a number of apocalyptic disasters which never occurred, that it can cost thousands to hear her talk (yes, I know that initial lectures are less expensive).

*One of her former students says he quit working with her after finding her practicing her Ramtha voices. It didn't seem to me she had practiced them very well!

*The psychiatrist studying physics, Jeffrey Satinover, has a book calling for attempting to cure homosexuals. He believes that they are ill. He lists Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as one of his heroes!

*The Irish theologian in the film had to resign as president of his college as a result of a scandal.

*Many of the ""scientists"" are lecturers at Knight's center.

==> One of the few real scientists in the film, David Albert, has charged the filmmakers with carefully selecting bits of his hours of interview to present a point of view that is 180 degrees opposite of what he said. THINK ABOUT THIS. The filmmakers have, I believe, discredited themselves entirely through their misrepresentation of Dr. Albert's views. Why would they do this if they were really interested in the truth? <==

I really believe that intentions matter and that they shape our life. If you agree, please ask yourself, what could possibly be the intentions of filmmakers who distort the material provided in interviews? More importantly, what is the intention of JZ Knight in making up a story about channeling a 35,000 year old teacher from Atlantis?

198231,5,1582704708,"I just finished watching ""What the Bleep do we Know?"" and feel compelled to write this review.  You should watch this movie not because it will enlighten you and make you see your world in a different way but because it is in a sense ""educational.""  It educates the viewer on what bad science is.

I have two main problems with this movie:  one is based on science, the other is based on religion.

Since the time of Copernicus and Galileo science and religion have been at loggerheads.  Scientific atheists have overstepped their bounds and claimed there is no God since he can not be proved.  Meanwhile, religious lay and clergy have reacted with fundamentalism and overstepped their bounds by claiming science is faulty and so they come up with their own ""science"" (Intelligent Design and Creationism among others).  The movie is about scientists overstepping their bounds and becoming theologians.  Buy it because it shows you what NOT to beleive about science and religion.

I am a scientist (Physics) and an engineer (Electrical) and keep abreast of the latest scientific developments and I can tell you this movie is a lot of bad science.  But don't take my word for it.  Ask yourself ""Where are the heavy hitters in this movie?  Why don't I see Steven Weinberg, Murray Gell-Man, or Stephen Hawking in this movie backing up these theories?""  The ""scientists"" interviewed are merely science writers with a lot of New Age philosophy at their core.  I'm sure some of them are scientists but after viewing the extra material on the DVD where the directors talked about interviewing them I think any REAL scientist involved with this project was caught up in the Hollywood glamour and agreed to make the movie against his or her better judgment.

The biggest problem I have with the science in this movie is its depiction of Quantum Mechanics.  It is the science of ""infinite possibilities"" according to the movie.  True.  Probability plays a key role in Quantum Mechanics (on a tangent. . .Douglas Adams has a lot of fun with QM with his ""improbability drive"" in ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.""  His improbability drive has as much probability of instantly sending someone across the galaxy in tact as some of the possibilities expressed in ""Bleep.""  Adams was joking around but Chasse is serious.)  No narrator, however, gets into the details of what is meant by ""infinite possibilities,"" so I will.

There is a non-zero probability that when I run towards a brick wall I will pop out on the other side with no damage to myself or the wall.  That is a quantum mechanical probability.  The probability that that will happen is somewhere around one in ten to the 54th power.  It's a non-zero probability but very nearly zero.  The movie doesn't get into the ""improbability"" of the experiment.

So what?  It's possible, right?  Yes.  But I have better things to do with my time than bang my head against the wall ten to the 54 times in hopes that just once I'll pop through.

This quantum probability (quantum tunneling) has its place in the universe.  It is the reason why the sun burns as brightly as it does for such a long period of time at a temperature much LOWER than expected.  QM paved the way for the laser, transistor, nuclear power, and the electron microscope among other inventions.  Quantum Mechanics is truly a fascinating adventure but the movie never really delves into the real heart of the field or how it can legitimately affect the way we look at the universe.  A simple quantum dual slit diffraction experiment could illustrate the truly incredible ""quantum connection"" that exists between every particle in the universe and therefore between every person including you and me.  No real time is given to matters such as Quantum Teleportation, Quantum Encryption, or Quantum Computing.  No detail is presented in HOW we humans are all connected.  Instead, we are invited to imagine an existence where we rely on this idea of ""infinite possibilities"" to create our own reality which should include becoming our own gods.  It's very (yawn) empowering.

The movie uses the ""infinite possibilities"" angle as a tool in which we can somehow guide our thoughts to create our own reality.  Could my thoughts transform and improve the probability of passing through a brick wall unscathed to, say, one in three or better?  The narrator seems to think that this can be accomplished by thought alone.  The point is that we, the observers, can not observe without changing that which is observed.  There is no ""out there"" that exists independant of our observations.  Physical phenomena are OBSERVED through our senses and our senses are a sophisticated collection of neural transmitters and pre-programmed patterns existing in the neural network of our brains.  Even matter itself can not escape existence through our observations.  Historically, the concept of matter has gone through change after change until we realize today that sub-atomic particles and atoms are very little more than just empty space.  Since matter doesn't exist without our thoughts and perceptions, our perceptions MAKE the world we live in.

And that is where the problem is.  Saying ""matter is a thought"" is a non-sequitur.  Matter will exist and will be ""observed"" (through normal chemical and nuclear reactions such as solar fusion mentioned above) regardless of whether or not humans are around.  Matter is not a thought.  Matter makes up the universe.  We study matter.  We think about it.  We theorize on it.  But drawing the line between thought as CAUSE and tiny day to day improvements that would otherwise be thought of as disconnected as a macroscopic EFFECT in the ""plan your day"" model is not a product of science.  It is a product of wishful thinking, ad hoc reasoning, and debunked telekinesis.

Notable quotables:
""You really can walk on water if you completely believe it.""

The idea is that even if we totally believe we can walk on water we still sink because our ""total belief"" is only a skin of belief enveloping a world of disbelief.  Thought affects matter as shown in the differing caracteristics of bottles of water frozen with emotional words pasted on the bottles for observers to view and think about (a grand example of bad science).  This experiment is used to show how thought can be used to manipulate matter--kind of like the bending spoons flop of an experiment on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.  We have been ""brainwashed,"" so says the narrator, through the media, religion, experience and socialization to believe we can't walk on water, therefore, we sink.  My belief is that if someone were to try to walk on water, PERHAPS after trying maybe ten to the 75 times it will work once.  The movie never goes into the numbers behind the ""infinite possibilities"" in Quantum Mechanics.

""We are all on our way to becoming gods.""

By the time a narrator mentions this line, the movie has gone way beyond science and is deep into religion.  The movie asserts:  The universe is big.  We are tiny.  Whatever we do could not possibly offend God the Creator of the Universe.  We are too insignificant.  As a scientist I have to challenge, ""Since we are so connected to each other and the universe show me the proof that we are so tiny and inoffensive.  Show me the proof that God doesn't concern himself with our issues even though I agree we may be insignificant in some respects.  In fact, show me the proof or at least the evidence that God is what the movie says he is.""

According to a narrator, God is the superposition of everything we consider spiritual.  God is this ""concept.""  Furthermore, God is neither Old Testament nor New Testament.  God is a concept far more fluid and flexible than these antiquated versions.  We are spiritual.  We can touch the divine.  Remember, we are gods in the making.

This is not a proof of God but an axiom--one that the viewer does not have to accept.  This is where the scientists overstep their bounds by becoming theologians and it is why you should buy this movie.  The movie can be thought of as ""Exhibit A"" in the heated struggle between science and religion.  It is bad science dressed up and worshipped as religion by New Age ""scientists.""

Buy this DVD to get a great understanding of how bad science generates bad religion.  It is filled with scientists that neglect the math of probablility and therefore present a concept that sounds closer to magic or religion than it is to science.

There are those that would say as a rebuttal, ""Any sufficiently advanced society will posess technology that to the same society two centuries earlier would look like magic.""

True.  But any science--past, present, or future--functions on logic and reasoning.  Hiding the logic then drawing conclusions that advance telekinesis as this movie has done, disqualifies its ""scientific"" premise.

Get it.  Watch it.  And when that twinge of disbelief hits you in the back of your brain pay attention to it.  And with an open mind explore your disbelief a little more.",1132704000,40,9028,4.837908496732026

I was so dissappointed by this film, I very nearly left before it was over.  I will not comment on the formatting or quality of the portrayal of the ideas in the film, although I found it to be tedious, repetitive, and not at all compelling.
Rather I would like to admonish the writers and producers for taking hold, as is in vogue these days, of some of the most interesting ideas of our time, (e.g. quantum theory, holism, humanism) and twisting them wrenchingly to fit the writer's or director's narrow and childishly simplified message.  The filmmakers had the opportunity and apparently the funding here to educate people with regard to the nature of the physical universe as we know it, what we know of man's place and history in it, the power of the first person perspective on the world, the illusory nature of man's first person perspective, and a host of other important fundamental ideas.

198241,2,1582704708,"What the Bleep Do We Know?! is supposed to be a movie about the human mind and the many ways in which our mind filters the information that we process. The ultimate point is that perception is not reality, and that reality is ultimately constructed by our minds. Oh, and there's some stuff about quantum theory in there, but it is a pile of misapplied and disconnected garbage that has nothing to do with scientific validity.

I've heard multiple fascinating facts from this movie from friends, like the fact that when Columbus arrived in Central America, the natives literally couldn't see the ships because a European corsair was not within their mental frame of reference. Their brains literally filtered it out. Pretty cool. I've had multiple people tell me I HAVE to see this movie, and I approached it very optimistically. For about the first twenty minutes it was fascinating. Then it just got... stupid.

I use that word literally. The concepts of mental perception that were initially presented are increasingly supplemented by all this unintelligent application as the movie goes on. Where at the beginning we first hear from Harvard physicists and quantum reality specialists, by the end of the film they are featured less and less and featured more and more are a chiropractor (Lonely Guy) and a head of an ""Enlightenment"" school named Ramtha (Crazy Lady). From the idea that perception equals reality and the scientific theory of quantum reality we suddenly leap to all of this stuff about God (WTF?!) and living to increase the divine in oneself. Um... that's great Crazy Lady, but can we get back to all the stuff that has something to do with mental perception and is, like, remotely provable?

By the end I feel like I've watched a recruitment video for a cult. Ironically, this isn't far from the truth. Turns out that the three directors of the movie are all devout followers of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment (Hence all the clips of Crazy Lady throughout the movie).

Many of the people interviewed in the film are nicely credentialed and explain their views well.  Most of the ideas are just touched upon and will make you want to go read more.  I agree with the editorial on Amazon's page, though, when he says the film would have been more powerful without Ramtha.  Most Americans are just not ready to believe in channeling.

198246,1,1582704708,"This movie is a perfect example of what Nobel Prize Winner Murray Gell-Mann calls ""Quantum Flapdoodle"", i.e. an attempt to use Quantum Theory to support a metaphysical, even mystical, view of the world. This is often the result of confusing Quantum Theory with the interpretation of Quantum Theory. The premise of the movie seems to be to prove that we create our own reality through the observation of it. What follows is a lengthy pseudo-scientific explanation of specific elements of Quantum Theory placed in a light that supports a distorted mystical view.

One of the first and most glaringly aggravating points about this movie is the editing. Many of the physicists in this movie were filmed for hours explaining Quantum Theory and the mechanics behind it, but only select pieces of the footage were used out of context to make it seem as if these experts were supporting a mystical world view, when in fact they almost universally scoff at it. Coupled with that is the fact that many of these ""experts"" actually have no physics credentials, Quantum or otherwise.

But what about the science, you ask. Unfortunately, the science in this movie is abysmal. First, as mentioned before, they confuse the theory with the interpretation. This is simply because they advocate the ""observation is reality"" idea, which isn't part of the theory. For a theory to be considered science it must be disprovable. Observation creating reality cannot be disproven simply because it would require an observer to validate, which would then invalidate the ""theory"". So from the beginning we have a faulty basis for science.

Following that, the movie then cites its ""proof"", which is also scientifically invalid. The first was the popular fable that when Columbus arrived in North America that the natives could see ""the ripples in the water"" but couldn't see the ships. Nowhere in the movie does it state that this is a fable... its actually presented as literal fact (though I should note it isn't implicitly stated in the film that this is a fact, it is certainly implied). This example fails to hold up to scientific standards for various reasons. First, its hearsay. There aren't any written records or verifiable evidence supporting the story. Its a legend, pure and simple, and as such proves nothing. Second, it fails entertain the more logical reasons, such as the ripples appearing in the water before the ships had actually arrived, a distinctly logical conclusion.

The second example illustrated the ""Maharisi Effect"". For those unfamiliar with the experiment, in 1993 four-thousand people practiced trancsendental meditation in an attempt to lower the crime rate in Washington DC. After the ""experiment"", the data was analyzed, tweaked and otherwise manipulated to reveal, amazingly, that violent crime was down 18% (though the film claims 25). This was viewed as proof of the power of group meditation and positive thinking. Sadly, this example also fails to satisfy the rigorous criteria of science. First, there was no control group, and as such no way of knowing what the crime rate would have been without the meditation. This implies that the lowered crime rate could be the result of several, unrelated factors. Also, the crime rate was only 18% lower than what was predicted by analysis of previous criminal trends in the area. Violent crime increased from the previous year, just not as much as was expected by experts. Second, the murder rate during this time actually increased, so while violent crime as a whole increased less than was predicted, more murders were being commited during this time than were predicted. Thirdly, the panel who reviewed the data created by this experiment were followers of the Maharisi and could not be counted as impartial, non-biased observers.

The third piece of ""proof"" supplied is Dr. Emoto's famous Water Tests in which he tapes words to containers of water and freezes them into crystals that, supposedly, create beautiful images when nice words like ""love"" and ""thank you"" are taped to them and horrible, ugly images when mean words like ""I hate you"" and ""I want to kill you"" are used. These words were tried in several languages and sometimes images are used as well. Unfortunately, Dr. Emoto's amazing work has never been independently recreated in a scientific setting. In fact, the James Randi Educational Foundation has offered a $1,000,000 prize to Dr. Emoto if his data can pass a double blind test, a prize which he has refused to even attempt to claim.

After this there is a long discussion about cellular peptides and how these are responsible for all observation, emotion and, in essence, reality. This was the only part of the movie that had some sound basis in reality and could be backed up with science. It is 100% true that the chemical processes in our brains can vastly effect how we view reality, which is the basis of psychiatric pharmocology. The movie then moves on to use this as proof of the power of positive thinking, i.e. ""Our brains control how we view reality so we don't need mind-altering medications to be happy!"" Yay! Except when there's something wrong with our brain and those chemicals are out of balance. I'd like to see somebody tell Charles Manson that all his insanity could be cured by the power of positive thinking!

The final straw that breaks this movie's proverbial back is the inclusion of Ramtha, the 35,000 year old Atlantian warrior spirit brought to us courtesy of a Tacoma housewife named JZ Knight (his ""channel"" in New Age circles). In a thick, Hollywood-esque Eastern European accent, Ramtha tells us about the wonders of Quantum Physics and how it is the first science to even come close to explaining magic and miracles. Okay... I don't even know where to begin with this. First of all, if this is a movie about science, why are they including the claims of a New Age cult leader who can't be verified one way or another. Also, what are this person's credentials. If its just JZ Knight pretending to be some ancient Atlantian, does she have a Quantum Physics background? Second, if she IS some ancient Atlantian warrior, what are HIS Quantum Physics credentials (which could be easily verified with a series of Doctorate level tests)?

Of course, her/his authority is never questioned, and there's a reason. It took a little digging to find, but the vast majority of the people involved in making this film are followers of Ramtha. When this came to light, I was flabbergasted. The fact that most of the movies views fall right in line with her group's New Age philosophy puts an entirely new spin on the movie. Suddenly this looks like nothing but one, big recruitment piece for Ramtha.

I gave this movie one star because it does one good thing: It gets people thinking about Quantum Physics and reality. Make no mistake, there are some valid pieces of science to be found in the film, but on the whole the representation of Quantum Physics is ridiculously distorted into some pseudo-scientific new age cult mysticism. Some people who see this movie might be interested to dig deeper into the actual science and check out John Gribbin's excellent series of books about Quantum Physics for the layman. I recommend ""In Search of Schrondinger's Cat"" most highly.

As Richard Feynman said, ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", and that sums up the major problem with this movie. It provides a view of quantum mechanics that is absurdly simple and abysmally unscientific. The beauty of particle physics is magical in and of itself, it doesn't need to be married to philosophy and New Age metaphysics to be amazing.",1130371200,820,7674,4.9464701318851825

198249,5,1582704708,"What the Bleep Do We Know?!, a New Age semi-documentary, weaves thought-provoking interviews with top scientists and mystics within a clunky fictional narrative to present a link between quantum mechanics, positive thinking, and spiritualism.

The main character, Amanda, (played by Academy Award winning actress, Marlee Matlin) is a gloomy, pill-popping wedding photographer who explores a new paradigm--a radical view of the universe which in turn changes the view of herself, and challenges the way we, the viewers, perceive the universe and ourselves.

In quantum mechanics, the microscopic world restricts the macroscopic one. In neuroscience, neuropeptides, ""molecules of emotion"" found in the nervous system and the brain, impinge on the immune system. And from a psychological point of view, our thoughts, feelings and attitudes shape ourselves and our lives--our own private reality.

On a spiritual level, the universe, perceived through our senses or with our minds, is transformed by observation in the same way that we can be transformed by ""observing"" ourselves with the help of a counselor, rabbi, pastor or friend who can help us question who we are and why. Norman Vincent Peale said it better when he said, ""Change your thoughts and you change your world.""

What the Bleep Do We Know?!, despite its ludicrous plot, does succeed in raising difficult mind-body-universe questions and affirming the power of positive thinking.

198252,2,1582704708,"Not since Trefethen's 1979 album ""Am I Stupid or Am I great?"" has there been a work with such an unintentionally apt title.  This particular piece of fluff features a cast of mystics, fringe scientists, and philosophers doing a 2-hour infomercial for the New Age movement.  Oh and there's an extensive interview with a 35,000 year old warrior from Atlantis.  The film careens through a series of sound-bites from each of these characters, interspersed with silly special effects and a pointless plotline about a deaf photographer.

Here's an immediate warning sign:  The film doesn't identify the names or credentials of any of the interviewees, even though they spend a lot of time talking about fairly technical issues, particularly quantum mechanics.  Be concerned about this.  The filmmakers are trying to convince you that there is a broad consensus between mystical gurus and professional scientists on the way the world works.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  To set the record straight on a few things:

1)  It is not true that people are unable to perceive visual objects that they are unfamiliar with.  Question:  What did the Eiffel Tower look like the first time you saw it?  Answer:  The Eiffel Tower.

2)  Quantum physics does not prove or even suggest that humans create their own reality.

3)  People cannot walk on water, no matter how hard they try.

4)  Seeing something is not the same thing as thinking about seeing something.

5)  It is not possible to change the molecular structure of water or anything else by affixing written words to containers.

6)  There is no evidence that transcendental meditation can lower a city's crime rate.

In short, the main message of the film is that the universe is constructed of material that is responsive to human thought and emotion.  This has got to be the most enduring bad idea in human history.  It's literally a child's view of the world, in which one's emotional state works its way into every aspect of reality.  Most adults learn that the real world doesn't work this way, and the ones that attain some level of science education quickly lose interest in this way of thinking.  The true nature of science is simply a lot more interesting.

It should tell you something that one of the few credible scientists interviewed in this film later complained about how his remarks were taken out of context and totally misrepresented.

This type of bunk is harmful because if you want to change the world, you have to deal with reality as it actually is (as best we can understand it at any given time), and then change it based on things that are actually possible to do. These people look at phenomena that are not fully understood, latch on to the most ridiculous and unprovable explanation possible, then decide to go with that as though it is obviously true. They do it again and again, and the anti-scientific leaps into absurdity and crackpottery get increasingly disgusting as the film drones on.

If you want to know about things that are actually real and true, try ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Green, or something by any other *actual* scientist.

198261,5,1582704708,"No, it ain't perfect, but then nobody claimed it was. Any book/film that approaches anything resembling religious philosophy will trigger people, as the varying reviews have indicated. Unlike the Harry Potter phenomenon, we haven't seen Right Wing Christians burning copies of What The Bleep yet, but it still managed to get people fired up.

Ironically, the film's biggest weakness is that it focuses far too much on the physical, with 'experts' repeatedly babbling about receptors and peptides. That's all fine and dandy, but you can't possibly hope to understand anything about the nature of the human experience without at least brushing on Bell's Theorem/Non-Locality as it relates to Eastern mysticism, The Baghavad Gita etc. The chaff factor among the various speakers is such that even though the concept of Oneness is fleetingly mentioned, it never takes center stage in the form of an open recognition of Collective Consciousness.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's a good introduction to Quantum Theory, even though it doesn't really touch on the literally dozens of Quantum Reality Theories of how and why we perceive reality, and what it even means - such as Observer Created Reality (only dealt with tangentially), whereby things theoretically only exist in the presence of Consciousness, and Bentov's theory that there is only Consciousness in the Universe.

'Experts' babble about 'creating reality' but none of the speakers get down to the nitty gritty and expand on their fleeting insights enough to give the new viewer a solid foundation.

Yet this is a highly entertaining film, with John Ross Bowie just about stealing the show as Elliott, during the Polish Wedding scenes. To my surprise, this film manages to be funny and sexy while also being informative, albeit at a very superficial level. The young guys scoping the females at the dance were very entertaining. The First Person Luster camera work, whereby the guys were evaluating the females on a Terminator-style visual overlay, was surprisingly un-PC - especially contrasting the 'FOX' evaluation for an attractive woman with the SYSTEM CRASH response to viewing an older, obese female.

At the other end of the PC spectrum, you have the Wise Male Black Kid with, guess what? A basketball.

The soundtrack is excellent, and be sure to get a DVD with the extras, which include the stunning Aeon Spoke video. Their haunting Coldplay-like song Emmanuel introduces the scene in which the beautiful Marlee Matlin is just waking up after the Night Before.

The conclusion we agreed on reflected the notion that even if there is no inherent value in such books, the effect on the individual, if the individual chooses to implement the advice, is a positive one. Which leads me into the review. And that leads me into this: it seems that there are claims floating around the internet that some of the ideas/theories/facts/etc. presented in this film are false and were known to be false prior to filming. I cannot substantiate these allegations, but I believe it is fair to keep this in mind as you read my review and hopefully watch the film.

What the Bleep Do We Know!? is not so much a movie as it is an inspirational piece of work laced with PBS-type educational/informative programming and great visuals. What you should walk away with after seeing this movie is quite simply another potential point of view on life. Even putting aside its alleged dubious facts and sources, it really does get one to think deeply about many questions we ask ourselves throughout our lives.

Also, I did not realize that Marlee Matlin was actually deaf and thought that she was simply acting as such, that is, until I read about her on the internet! In my opinion, she is a wonderful actress and really shines in this film. The visual aspects of the film are also very gratifying.

Just in case the ridiculous title wasn't enough to turn you off from the get go, the next two hours of your life will be filled with a tedious and mind numbing grade school approach to philosophy, quantum physics, and how people's attitudes and beliefs ultimately affect how their lives will unfold. If you're even looking at the ""What the bl33p..."" page here at Amazon and reading these reviews, you must have a certain degree of intelligence going for you to make you curious at all about such things. But at the same time, you should also appreciate those very same intellectual aspirations which moved you to seek out a higher understanding and instead indulge them with a little reading. Or meditation. Or clipping your toenails. Just do something, but don't try to quench your thirst for knowledge by watching this movie.

What the film fails to do is establish an interesting story or protagonist, so when it senses itself becoming weak, it falls back upon a myriad of mystical quantum physicists, whose interviews, by the way, feel as if they should be floating around in some sort of educational film reel rather than a feature-length movie. And that would be fine. IF the film had kept to that formula instead of trying to tack on an unnecessary and annoying narrative that's roughly in the same vein as oh, let's just say a really well-produced after school special.

Right from the start, we are given a deaf woman who has unnecessary flashbacks of her ex-husband's infidelity. So we have a handicapped person who has ALSO previously been cuckolded? Oh, God, the pity points are just stacking up! Isn't it just killing you! That certainly is the correct formula for a good main character; make them pathetic so that if the audience doesn't like them, they get to feel bad! That's totally not an underhanded approach or anything.

In addition, as if we weren't smart enough to pick up on insultingly blatant metaphors, there's a little African-American kid playing basketball to play the obligatory part of the ""white rabbit"". (Get it?? Basketballs go down a hoop?? Sort of like a RABBIT HOLE?? HUH? HUH? Yeahhhh!) He's chipper and grating as he explains complex logical loopholes with all of the chubby cheeked enthusiasm of a kid who has landed his first acting role on a commercial about paper towels.

Don't get me wrong-- the philosophies presented in the interview portions of the film are interesting enough, provided that you can swallow a fair amount of mystical bull crap without gagging, but they're ultimately too watered down to even come close to approaching the depths they sought to reach in the first place. It's just too mainstream an approach for something as complex as quantum physics, and while I think the filmmakers had good intentions in trying to enlighten the masses by presenting something like that in an entertaining way, I just found it rather cloying. Dare I say ""cheesy"".

If it wanted to be a story, it should have tried to be a story. If it wanted to be an educational film, it could have made a great one.

My friend went to the theater to watch this movie 7 times.  It was sold out in my hometown for 3 months straight.  And became such a cult phenomenon that director William Arntz moved to Ashland.

I still haven't figured out much of this film.  There are so many nuances that it is hard to take in all at once.  It is a movie that must be watched several times in order to get your bearings straight.  Then parts of the movie begin to stick with you.

My favorite part is about the water molecule.  In the movie they demonstrate how the molecular structure of water changes with emotional energy.  When you equate that with humans being 70 percent water, then you come to this understanding that humans also change structure with emotional energy.  Those are the things in this movie that fascinate the mind.  There are many other mysteries in this movie, too many to mention, in this review.

While there seem to be a great many detractors from the film, I have to wonder just what it is that upsets them so greatly.  I found the film beautiful, (if at times just slightly insulting in the dramatic and animated sections) and enlightening.

Certainly many are not going to want to follow the principles offered here, but for those who think quantumly - who are open to the possibilities life has to offer, this is as good a place to start as one is likely to find.

Whether or not one buys into Ramtha's 35,000 year old sage is irrelevant - Ramtha's message, at least here, however, is one of hope and finding the beauty and truth in oneself and not succumbing to perceived realities, but opening up the myriad possibilities of change.  What could possibly be wrong with that?

The film offers a truly beautiful experience, enlightening speeches by a small army of scientists, theologians, who share in very easy to understand layman's language, what the bleep they DO know.

'What The Bleep...' is a hideous production by sinister hippies trying to brainwash the masses into following their stupid, tree-hugging, recycling, nature-loving ways.  Its part fiction(starring the deaf actress...you know who I'm talking about)and part documentary(featuring dozens of unnamed new age ""experts"").  The fictional storyline follows the Deaf Lady and interspersed between her scenes are interviews with psychopathic hippies babbling about their hippie bullcrap beliefs.

The Deaf Lady is a raging alcoholic who during the course of the film is unbelievably mean to her best friend, gets schooled in basketball by some eleven year old homeboy, gets drunk at a wedding and c**kteases every dude there.  In between all these scenes are the profoundly insane interviews with the so-called ""experts"".  Now, keep in mind that these people haven't bathed, brushed their teeth with anything other than dirt and tree bark, or gotten a haircut in well over ten years.  We're talking Ted Kaczynski-crazy here.  They talk about the most inane things with the longer, more-psychopathic diatribes being set to poorly animated cartoons of the most irritating images you've ever seen.

198278,3,1582704708,"I am grateful for the premise that this documentary explored. I do not subscribe personally to any organized religion, but I do respect them, therefore there were parts that I found to be somewhat skewed and offensive.  It takes an open mind to view this film and a certain amount of wisdom and discernment in taking out the truth and the good to utilize in one's life.  Michel Ledwith's closed minded views regarding organized religion came across with undertones of anger, as well as the directors pot shots toward organized religion using the Catholic Church.

The biggest let down with this docuementary is that Ramtha was the main talker and my particular open mind just can not buy it's persona and would have much perferred the directors to have had only real scientists and/or scholars talk.  Obviously, I was not aware that the directors were followers of JZ Knight and may not have bought the DVD had I known.

As far as David Albert, phd., is concerned ... quite frankly he was my third least favorite next to Ramtha and Michel Ledwith. Other reviews state that he was the only real credible scientist and that I disagree with.  My feel from him was empty just as it was for Ramtha and Ledwith.

The rest of the scientists I absolutely loved listening to and have been inspired to look further into works they have written.  In them I seen a spark and a beautiful twinkle in their eyes.  I would have much perferred to hear more from the rest of them.

Lastly, the over use of food addiction as an illustration was insensitive.  The portrayal of the obese man and then the Polka song of ""she's too fat for me"" is incongruent with true spirituality.  I found it to be somewhat cruel in regards to those particular souls wrapped up in their particular ""four layer bio body suit"".  It was just too much.  It would have served much better to make a point regarding addiction and even food addiction and then moving on rather than coming back to it in various insensitive ways, especially with the type of camera shots.

Still, all in all there was truth in there that I have used to reinforce in the co-creation of my own day and life to the positive and to assist my personal being in living more closer to my highest light.  By reviewing and replaying certain parts of the film I have been able to use it as an extremely positive reinforcement in my life.

However, there was one notable speaker: Dr. David Albert, a philosopher of physics and professor at Columbia University, who speaks frequently throughout the movie. Strangely, he seems to support the ideas that are presented in the movie, yet according to a Popular Science article, he is ""outraged at the final product.""

The article states that Dr. Albert granted the filmmakers a near-four hour interview, which was then edited and incorporated into the film in such a way that misrepresented his views that quantum mechanics is not related to consciousness or spirituality, in fact most of his interview was to convince the filmmakers that the view they were trying to portray was incorrect. In the article, Dr. Albert also expresses his feelings of gullibility after having been ""taken"" by the filmmakers. The filmmakers issued a statement disputing Dr. Albert's claims.

On the other hand, don't be put off if you're really NOT a science-minded person, because yes, they do use SOME quite complicated concepts, but you certainly don't need to understand every concept to understand the main message of the film.

That said....

A lot of ""science"" is brought in so as to affirm the movie's assertions. Some of it was legitimate; some not so much. The most obvious example was the misuse of quantum physics to explain our universe. In brief: Physics explains how our universe of matter works. Quantum physics explains how the universe works when you're dealing, not with matter, but with the building blocks of matter. Since it's NOT matter, it doesn't function in the same way matter does. But these scientists presume to say that since quantum particles behave the way they do, maybe that applies to ALL particles in the universe, and to the way we perceive reality. It's as if I tried to explain human behavior by comparing our actions to that of our cells. It's a totally false analogy.

In another portion, the filmmakers seriously want us to believe that water crystalizes because of happy thoughts. ""If thoughts can do that to water,"" comments an unskeptical passer-by, ""what might they do to us?"" After all, WE'RE mostly water.

Here's the deal. The scientists in this movie are pulling the same stunt that you find in ""creation scientists"" -- Christians who, though scientists, believe that the universe is only 6,000 years old, and animals didn't evolve, in spite of all evidence to the contrary.

198301,3,1582704708,"""What the [bleep] do we know?"" is a very original film and very well done.

It has great graphical effects, and tackles a unique topic: the philosophical implications of Quantum Mechanics.

The film mixes the storyline of a deaf woman and her journey through emotional difficulty and liberation, with narration and comments from various scientists and philosophers who promote a world view which resembles eastern mysticism.

Though the film and its message are positive and interesting, it

unfortunately has misunderstood the physics from which it derives its message.

Specifically, the film tries to imply that since in Quantum physics we are affecting reality in our attempt to observe it, we as humans can therefore create our own reality and become masters of our own destiny.

The scientific flaw in this reasoning is the extrapolation of quantum level limitations on the microscopic level to the macroscopic human level.

Viewers should understand that scientists are limited in their ability to observe atomic level phenomena because they are limited in the size of things which they can use to observe e.g. photons.

When scientists send a photon and bounce it off another small particle, the photon affects the particle it was meant to observe. This is due to the relatively similar size of the objects.

An analogy would be to send a marble to bounce off another similarly sized marble to measure it. It is clear that we would ""affect"" the marble we are observing with our marble when we deflect off of it.

The reasoning the film promotes is essentially: since we affect marbles by observing them, we are therefore capable of creating our own ""marble reality"" and can become masters of our ""marble destiny"". This conclusion-- though interesting in its implications--has really left the realm of science.

By looking at the film's web site, one notices that many of the people associated with the film are linked with an eastern mystic movement known as ""Transcendental Meditation"", founded by guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. This film seems to promote a world view that is aligned with this movement, and one is left wondering whether this film is a really a promotional tool for this sect, a cousin of Hinduism.",1126915200,6,2222,5.043715846994536

198307,1,1582704708,"Not only is the basic theory driving the movie utterly insane, like most cults it is dangerous to the people gullible enough to buy into it.
The idea that we can manifest any reality we want just by thinking about it hard enough may sound ludicrous, but it serves as the driving force behind this psuedo-science ""documentary""( ie cult indoctrination tape.) One of their experts asserts we could walk on water if we only believed we could. The same expert goes on to say how he ""consciously"" creates his day for himself every day. Unfortunately his mansion, exotic sports cars and supermodel wife were not present in the shot, so we just have to take him on his word on that one. I could write a novel on the number of insane theories pretentiously sold to us as fact, all as equally insulting as the next.

But what I really wanted to point out was the particularly dangerous idea shared by many of these new age cults, presented here ever SO subliminally in this ""movie."" During the story that accompanies the talking heads, the main character is seen taking some unidentified prescription every time she gets frustrated by ""her reality."" Whenever something doesn't go her way, she pops a pill. Of course by the end of the movie and her enlightenment she realizes she doesn't need them anymore. Her mind has been opened. One of the final shots of the movie is her tossing the prescription bottle through the air and into the trash just like Michael Jordan.
I found this particularly disgusting and shmarmy beyond compare. It is a common thread in these new age religions (Scientology) to comdemn psychology and drugs in favor of devotion to the religion (ie. sending them all your money). I'm sure it's much easier to scam people off their meds. This stuff makes me sick, and the number of people I see here writing positive reviews makes me lose faith in humanity.

To completely understand this movie you need an IQ of 140+ and sometimes I felt really stupid for not understanding it. This is not helped by remarks of the people in the movie that they can but others can't.

Philosophically however it's a great movie. Reality, observers, religion: it's all part of it. It's also about what we can do with our minds.

The movie itself is a mix of a movie and a documentary with around 6 people talking. Good thing that we don't know until the end who they are, to keep some objectivity in us, even though objectivity doesn't really exist.

The scientific part about quantumphysics is the greatest part, as is the religion.

Where the movie gets really bad is when it goes into the real of new age, something that will scare a lot of people, including me. This isn't helped by the afwully atmospheric music.

The science has been misquoted and quoted out of context and edited in such a way as to show there was more agreement than was actually the case and the stuff about changing your reality by changing your mind has none of the philosophical rigour of the buddhist madhyamaka and is in many instances just plain demonstrably incorrect.  A quick search of the cult's website will show the real reason for putting this film out - power and MONEY.

198316,3,1582704708,"When people find out that I am a physicist and meditator, they often ask 'What do you think about the book The Tao of Physics' by Fritjof Capra? I usually say that it can stimulate thought and discussion, contains serious errors, and has a weak link between physics and religion.

This movie is no Tao of Physics. I rate it 3 stars because it, unlike many movies, it stimulated an interesting one-hour conversation. I struggle to make sense of the very uneven quality of the movie, ranging from widely accepted scientific theory and millennia-old spiritual truths to pseudo science and pop psychology.

The movie operates on many levels: information about the science of matter and the brain, animations supporting this information, authors and others giving sound bites about science and religion, a self-help guide and a drama storyline. Highlights include the choice of topics, some likable experts and high-tech animations. The rest of the movie is a confusing jumble of New-Age ideas, although trying to say it is not.

A major disappointment is how one expert denounces organized Christianity (referred to as religion), something wise religious leaders avoid doing.

The movie's link between the material and mental worlds is very weak. The study that water changes structure under mental influence is not widely accepted (if commercially successful). These movies and books would gain a lot of credibility if they said that the relationship between mind and matter is one of the world's most fascinating unsolved problems.

The most damaging aspect of the movie is, especially for people coming from a Christian background, the idea that we have a great deal of control over our physical and mental illnesses. While at first glance liberating, the idea usually leads to more illness and unhappiness from guilt over not making progress as easily as the woman in the movie's drama.

198317,1,1582704708,"This movie can be summarized to:  Quantum mechanics allows an infinite field of possibilities! Quantum mechanics allows an infinite field of possibilities!

No argument there... provided you're a subatomic particle.  The problem is we're a bit larger than that, and because of it our field of possibilites narrows down significantly, down to what all of us non-schizophrenic folks recognize as good old Reality. Sorry to break it to you, but that's what it is.

Now, jokes aside, could there be something out there that cannot be explained by the laws of science? Don't we all just know some things to be true that we can't logically prove? And, aren't there times when we manage to do something we never knew we could, as if helped by something or some One much bigger than ourselves?  Those are all very valid questions which probably most of us can answer in the affirmative, but since those are very personal and thus very subjective experiences they fall more in the realm of religion, and approaching them successfully and convincingly, in a way that doesn't sound like Sunday School, takes a very talented writer to pull it off in fiction (think Tolstoy or Graham Greene) and at least a genius in film (only Kubrick's 2001 comes to my mind).  Those things can only be communicated indirectly, very carefully, hinted at slightly, through the use of symbols and solid character development.

Needless to say this movie comes a little short in this, or better said, it doesn't even try.  Instead it pretends to be a documentary, but unlike a good documentary where we are presented with the facts, these get explained and clarified from diferent angles by proper authorities, and we are allowed to think on it for a while and eventually come to our own conclusions, here it's different.  Instead of explaining and clarifying the science of quantum mechanics it mystifies it to the point of turning it into a mystical, quasi-religious mantra; it bombards us with obfuscated terms such as ""potentials"" when the much simpler and clearer ""possibilities"" would do; we get interviews from people who look and talk like college professors and seem to be in university settings but we're not told who they are or what their field of expertise really is; and we get sketches to illustrate those points filled with terrible acting and the cheesiest dialogue.

198331,5,1582704708,"Clearly this film has polarized the views of those who watch it - the majority of reviews are 5 stars or 1 star. I will attempt to be objective in this review - by all means, take this and the film itself with a grain of salt, but I believe your expectations before seeing the film will effect what you get from watching it.

To quote another review, ""there isn't a single mainstream scientist or religious leader of merit interviewed in this film."" Fair enough. I don't believe Darwin or Newton would have been considered mainstream when they suggested the ideas of evolution and gravity respectively (among other things), so let's consider the context before we bash this film.

The structure is interesting: There is an underlying storyline, with clips of the interviews throughout. Do not worry so much about the storyline - it's not a drama. It's a teaching aid. Some of the stuff that is discussed is deep (and I reviewed parts several times before I was close to 'getting' what they were saying), so the storyline is there to help you visualise what they're trying to say.

Some of the people interviewed say some far out stuff (some of which took me completely by surprise). Consider that they also quote experiments, and that the scientific community rarely allow their own to publish experiments without 'peer review' or equivalent - meaning that you should be able to trust the results of the experiments (which in some cases are just as mind-blowing as the commentary) even if you don't want to trust the commentary.

Some of the more negative reviews focus very narrowly on specific parts of this film. Take a step back and consider the wider points these people are advocating:

They are trying to counter the effects of the 'dumbing-down' of society. They are saying that your brain is incredible, and you shouldn't take it for granted. They are saying that you shouldn't live today as if it were yesterday, and that you should consider how your emotions work - whether or not you are in control of them.

They share many points with motivational speakers (don't take things for granted, visualise your success, control your life (reality) etc), whom we might be more inclined to believe because they *don't* have science to back them up.

If this film offends you, fine. If this film makes you think, fantastic - mission accomplished. If you weren't shocked by the implications, you may have missed the point. If you were shocked that something you believed in was shaken, consider yourself a stronger person.

I believe this film was made with the intention of pushing people from their comfort zones. When the arguments proposed are so important that the only escape is through thinking, then you've seen a good film. Enjoy.",1124668800,6,2742,4.806794055201698

Of course if you believe this is true, you might as well worry about the emotions of the tomato ala L. Ron Hubbard style.  For the audience that is excited by the ""fabulous science"" contained here (there is none, if you know what science is really about), please pick up a book on science, like ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Green, or ""Out of this world"" by Stephen Webb and if you spend 2 grams of intellectual effort, you will realize that any one page of a book like that (and that is science for the layman) contains more information than the entire movie.

198341,1,1582704708,"To see the incoherence of this movie, first let's assume one of the main tenets espoused- you create your own reality.  According to this movie you create your own reality, your own day, and everyone is god. If you assume this then you have created this review yourself. In that case, since you believe this garbage, why are you calling it garbage and nonsense? In addition, think about your life for a moment. Relax; remember your history, your past. Ok, now have you ever had pain in your life? Emotional or physical pain? If your answer is anything other than 'yes' then you're a liar!  Well then, according to this theory that you create your own reality, then you perpetrated this pain on yourself. What's more, if you have ever had a loved one die, why did you do that to them? Why do you kill people? If you create reality, why have you caused a war in Iraq? If this theory is true, then GW Bush is your own creation and you are responsible for everything he has done.

Just think about this for a bit. The only way to get out of the conundrum of being responsible for other peoples actions is if other people are NOT connected to you and were are NOT all one. In this case, everyone is responsible for their own actions in the midst of an objective reality. This objective reality cannot be changed merely by thinking or meditating upon it but rather by hard work at applying the right causal forces to the right issues.

Overall, this movie is a platform for JZ Knight and her errant philosophical theology. It hides exactly who she is and claims to be by identifying her merely as 'Ramtha' and head of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. It says nothing of the fact that Ramtha is supposedly a 35,000 year old Atlantean spirit-warrior. If this doesn't get your 'baloney detector' firing, I don't know what will! The film uses some real science in regards to quantum physics and physiological psychology but uses these concepts as part of a bait and switch.  The producers confuse the audience with science then import their non-scientific metaphysical views, claiming that these views are scientific, as a means of filling the knowledge gap.

Overall, this movie is not worth the money.",1124409600,31,2196,4.6179487179487175
198342,2,1582704708,"I liked the DVD......I like sci-fi and fantasy and docu-fantasy. It's all good fun. Like all New Age/metaphysical/mind-body/holistic healing type presentations, this one also tells you that you create and control your own reality. How nice...then why is it that no one seems to be able to actually do it?

I really got a kick out of Ramtha (or should I say J.Z. Knight). She really makes you feel special with the notion that there is no good or bad, right or wrong: everyone is a god in the making. Wow.....who wouldn't want that to be the truth?!

J.Z. Knight espouses a philosophy of no accountability. Since there is no good or evil, you are free to do what you wish. Moreover, you are free to do this because you created the reality. Clearly, this twisted theology fails to take into account any kind of reality outside of yourself. The results of your actions on others does not matter because you created these others. I guess you can do to them whatever you like.

I guess that a person who is raped or murdered really wanted it to happen; after all, they created that reality. But wait...maybe you created it. Who is creating and who is the creation?

How does a pure, innocent child who knows nothing about sex, perversion or sadism manage to become a victim of a child molester? Don't tell me that they created that reality! If they didn't, then it must have been your creation. You sick bastard!

In the same vein, I guess all of those millions of people who have died from AIDS simply created that reality for themselves. In fact, it must be some type of Cosmic fad.....so many of us ""gods in the making"" are choosing that reality. I'm glad that I was never one to bow to fad or fashion!

Did you ever have a loved one die or suffer? Well, it's your fault; you created that reality. But don't worry, they were just figments of your own imagination, or in an alternate universe they are quite fine, or if they really are more than your own creation they are having a grand old time creating there own reality.

Yeesh!

I enjoyed the blend of science with metaphysics and philosophy, perhaps because there is some measure of legitimacy in taking into account both the scientific and the spiritual. In this way, all of the bases can be covered: What science can't explain, faith takes care of and vice versa. However, there's nothing new in taking this approach. It's been the stuff of great thinkers for centuries.

Call me self-aware and humble, but if I'm a god in the making, then this universe is in for a lot of trouble. Also, I found it amusing (if not disingenuous) that she stated that she cares not one iota about her physical being or appearance, just her mind. Hmmmmm.....I guess all of that makeup, hair coloring and those injected lips were the result of her self-created reality - Max Factor or Maybelline didn't play a role? Then why do I see it in my reality? My superficial reality would have made her 150 lbs. lighter and 20 years younger - without makeup or physician-enhanced facial features. I'll stop there.....

It's a lot of feel good, pie-in-the-sky psuedoscience. If there was an ounce of verifiable truth about ""the mind or intention effecting the formation of crystals in water"", it would have been replicated by scientists, but it hasn't been. In addition, the simple notion that all health (mental and physical) related problems are somehow caused by ""bad thinking"" which effects the production of various hormones which our cells then become ""addicted"" to is a bit of a stretch.

Yes, our state of mind certainly can effect the way in which our body functions, to some degree. However, I'm trying to apply this theory to things like a stroke, an embullism or a simple structural weakness or defect in the body. I guess we choose these mechanical failures as part of our ""reality"". The notion that our individual cells become ""addicted"" is silly. Cells are simply little biochemical units that perform input / output functions much like any machine. Your car engine responds to changes in spark, fuel/air mixture and temperature. It does not have awareness or knowledge of what gasoline or oxygen is. It does not ""crave"" these things. It simply reacts to the chemical reactions and conditions that are present. Likewise, the cells in your body simply respond to the biochemical reactions present within their environment. The genetic instructions within each cell dictate how that cell should function and react to a given set of conditions. To say that the cell somehow has a preference for a given substance is ridiculous. Is there a little brain inside each cell? Moreover, chemistry dictates the most favorable conditions for reactions to take place, not individual cell ""freewill"". If we experience prolonged stress or other ""negative behaviors"", we temporarily change the chemical environment of our cells, sometimes with bad effect. This is something the body does not want to maintain. There is an ideal chemical / metabolic balance that can be considered a ""best situation"". To think that our individual cells would somehow become addicted to an imbalance not only defies the laws of chemistry, but defies logic as well. Addiction is a complex, behavioral phenomena that involves brain chemistry and an extensive matrix of neurological processes. It requires consciousness, thought and motivation. My skin cells don't care, my muscle cells don't care.....""want"", ""need"" and ""desire"" are higher level processes you just don't find in any single cell - sorry.

This movie / docu-fantasy would make for either a great sci-fi movie or a typical fund raising program during PBS pledge drives....oh wait!....they already have Deepak Choprah and a whole host of other mind body magician's.

I wonder if any of these people's great insights will insulate them from medical problems? Time will certainly tell. Even if they fail to keep themselves healthy, they will certainly have the money to have real scientists and doctors intervene in their ""realities"".

Ironically, I would suggest that the title of the movie is aptly named...especially when applied in the first person to these movie participants.

Yet curiously, there is mention of the ""ultimate observer.""  So wait, are we god then or demigods?  If there is this ""ultimate observer"" thingamajig somewhere ""out there"" then how exactly am I a ""god?""

This notion is all the more suspect when heavily promoted throughout the movie is the notion of ""posibilities.""  The idea borrows from quantum mechanical notions of superpositions, which basically stated that for any physical system under investigation, it exists is this strange multi-configured sum of all states, existing in this amalgam, if you will, of everything that it can possible be.  Not until an observation is made does the system then somehow collapse into one of these possibilities.  For a small particle, for instance, before any measurement is made concerning the particle, it exists in a wave-like state, being ""smeared out,"" as it were, over both space and time.  Then a measurement is made, nd the particle somehow settles on a very definitive state, realized as a given position or particular observable state.

Thus, when something interacts with the system, through the act of measuring or observing, then this braod range of possibilites falls down to a very definitive state.

Given this, then the question is: How can we still be considered ""god"" of our own fate if there is then this ""ultimate observer"" whose observing and making all the possibilites available collapse down to a finite state for us?

There's a real logical problem here and all the silly clearly out-of-context dialogues by various men and women from science, including Dr. DAvid Alberts, a silly, pompous blow-hard physicist turn philosopher, does nothing to redress this u underlying logical incompatibility.

The bottom line is that this movie is not at all about science and the supposed intersection of it with spirituality.  If we really had this notion of creating our reality, then we'd all be living in paradise.

The reason that we don't is because we have these ""additions,"" as it is claimed to negative ways of thinking and perceiving the world.  To underline this thought, the movie recounts a supposed historical fact relating to the native indians inability to see the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria on the horizon only because no indian had ever seen a ship.

The absurd claim is that nothing exists outside the mind and if no knowledge of something is known it cannot exist unless that knowledge is passed down.

Gee, I wonder than how all those poor native indians died from the host of diseases that the Europeans brought over and which the Indians had no knowlede.  Perhpas someone gave them a crash course on microbiology and immunology?

198363,4,1582704708,"This film lives up to it's billing as being mind-blowing and thought-provoking.  It provides an explanation of quantum physics that's creative and accessible to the non-scientific public (of which I'm a part).  The film is challenging in the way it explains the nature of reality in general and human emotions and behaviors in specific.

Where this movie takes a great ""leep"" for me is when they try to connect quantum theory with religion.  The film sets up a straw man of religion as simply an authoritarian system of rules and then uses quantum mechanics to knock it down.  It's rather easy for them to do, but only because their view of the nature of a kind of traditional God is simplistic.  In questioning the nature of reality they throw out the reality of a God external to the creation.  This is a leap requiring as much or more faith than an orthodox theist.

It's entirely possible within a theistic worldview that God is, to use the language of the film, ""the ultimate observer.""  God could use quantum mechanics in the universe without dismantling every aspect of revealed religion.  In fact, in one of the lecturers discussion of addiction, it would be as easy for him to argue for an authoritarian ""religion of quantum physics"" to help people control addiction.

The final ""leep"" of the film is in the area of ethics.  Since they seek to dispel any notion at all of an external observer with any moral authority, the film presents nothing to show that good is preferable to evil, no matter how you define either term.  Using thought experiments on water crystals, the film shows how much more orderly and beautiful ice crystals are when influenced by loving thoughts, and how the reverse is also true, but cannot really convince why beautiful and orderly is really preferable in a universal sense.  In other words, if my quantum-induced addiction makes me want to torture and kill, why fight it?  It's quantum mechanics!

However, I do take umbrage with his ostensible disprespect for the professors that appeared. I am, in fact, familiar with their works, and they are, by no means, new-age dullards or naive physicists/philosophers. These individuals are actual scholars with published works of significance. I would know, I happen to have in my hand a text by David Albert published by Harvard.

The problem with this film is not with the professors, but with the addition of new-age imbeciles wielding mystical rubbish; this problem is exacerbated when the directors take advantage of the inherent ambiguities in Quantum Theory to insert meaningless, if not farcical speculation on spiritualism. The individuals to blame are the writers and directors; if they had any respect for science and its newfound discoveries, they would not have used disingenuous tactics for utilizing it to propagate their own conceptions (and I am being generous in referring to it as such).

The viewer should watch this movie with caution, and be apt to evaluate every assertion rendered both by the professors and mystics; being able to distinguish between fact and fantasy is crucial to gaining the most from this film. Obviously, given the ADD laden American population, the professors themselves are going to deliver arguments that are pellucid recreations of more abstruse conceptions. If they attempted to elaborate on what actually occurs in physics and philosophy, the preponderance of viewers would have been bombarded with, what is to them, unintelligible information.

The best part of this movie is that it is motivating; as a philosophy student, I am somewhat hesitant in approaching physics, though I would dare say that philosophy and physics are becoming more intertwined (at least in metaphysics). This film incited my curiosity to explore quantum theory, as I am now scrutinizing Albert's text, which is, by the way, exceptional.",1123372800,8,2118,5.241887905604719
198366,1,1582704708,"The answer to the question posed by this supposed documentary's title, What the #$*! Do We Know?, is apparently: We Don't Know $#!+.  That conclusion is only arrived at after nearly two hours of glib pseudo-intellectual drivel from a whole cast of ""experts"" interspersed with the painfully inane story of a photographer looking for... um, meaning, I guess.  It's hard to tell in a movie which is so inept in its construction and diseased in its intentions, a self-righteous pit of a film that uses quantum theory only as an excuse to spew nonsensical ramblings and feel-good, New Age patter at its audience who, as the credits roll, can be sure of only one thing: they have wasted two hours of their life, and no amount of positive projection or spiritual freethinking is going to help them regain it.  In short, this is very possibly the worst film I have ever seen.

Quantum physics, we learn, concerns itself with the study of subatomic particles that seem to defy everything we thought we knew about matter, energy, and the laws of nature.  It must be said that this film is not a documentary about quantum theory; there is only the most perfunctory explanation of what quantum theory even is, and after that the film really wants nothing to do with the Scientific Method, choosing instead to dazzle us with all the wonderful implications of this theory, many of which seem to be taken straight from Dr. Phil.  A researched, thoughtful film on the mysteries of quantum mechanics would have required some effort, some canniness, some mastery of film making craft and precision of thought; it may have, dare I say, resulted in a better film.  But writer-directors William Arntz, Betsy Chasse, and Mark Vicente chose instead to round up a whole ensemble of garrulous gas-bags, ahem, excuse me, ""experts,"" who specialize in gleefully flailing their arms in ignorance and uttering long-winded rants that only serve to add insult to injury.  (At one point, one of these ""professors"" helpfully intones: ""What I thought was unreal now, for me, seems in some ways to be more real than what I think to be real, which seems now more to be unreal."")

From this group of curiously anonymous mystics and supposed scientists, we learn all kinds of strange things, such as, because quantum particles seem to disappear at times, there must be other universes, parallel worlds.  (One can hope that there exists an alternate reality where this movie was never made, and that world is better for it).  And if that's the case, then, gasp, we can alter the course of our destinies by... positively projecting the events of our day.  Yes, you read right, we can invent our futures by thinking about them really really hard.  At least that's what the nice lady who thinks she's channeling a 35,000-year-old sage from Atlantis said.  Another interviewee tells us that we can walk on water, if we just believe in ourselves enough.

Meanwhile, we're subjected to the made-for-TV drama unfolding in the life of a deaf photographer named Amanda (played by Marlee Matlin) whose adventures, conceived and executed for maximum preschool appeal, in some way, shape, or form reflect whatever topic those wacky scientists are on now.  What the Bleep... is not only offensive in its idiocy, it's a sickeningly obtuse mess with a severe attention deficit that just does not know when to quit.  The film jumps from the existence of God to the function of brain cells to the importance of high self-esteem, never stopping long enough to delve seriously into any of these topics (or telling us just what they have to do with quantum theory in the first place), but never mind!  This movie is not seeking truth or to provoking thought; it sets its bar for the lowest common denominator, abandons clarity for sensation, and counts on its audience to leave the theater feeling vindicated that they just don't have a clue.  The film is a flaming love letter to ignorance that manages to combine the worst of PBS, PAX, Mr. Rogers, and Lifetime.  Did I mention the grade-Z special effects?

What the Bleep... does not achieve the banal mediocrity of your average movie of the week or even the spectacular awfulness of an Ed Wood or Tom Green product; it is an egregious disaster, a movie so flagrantly self-serious about its own magnificent importance that it fails on nearly every level: it fails as a documentary, it fails as a drama, it fails as camp.  It crashes, burns, and it sinks and you must not see it.  And if by some cruel quirk of fate you do, bring tomatoes to decorate the screen.

I love movies, and I would say that I am an open-minded person.  But no film (or book or anything posing as art for that matter) has insulted my intelligence so much and made me quite so livid as this film and its supposed ""message.""

Some of the movie is very interesting, but further research shows that there is hardly any evidence to back most of the claims made in the movie.  Further, there is a 35,000 year old person named ""Ramtha"" who is channeled through a gal named JZ Nite in the film, who ironically, gets most of the interview time in the movie.

198370,1,1582704708,"I viewed this after it was recommended to me by two friends. It starts out well enough. It goes over many of the intriguing and truly mysterious findings of quantum theory. I have long studied quantum theory and the movie was accurate about its findings - bizarre as those findings may be. Quantum theory challenges our conventional notions of reality and I have long thought that modern culture has to find a way to incorporate it into our worldview. I had hoped that this was where this movie was leading.

Unfortunately that was not the case. After the initial discussion of quantum theory the movie veers off into the totally unsupported conclusion that a person can ""create their own reality"" simply by choosing to do so. There is nothing in quantum theory that supports such a proposition. Yes, it is true that ""reality"" - from a state of superposition - can collapse into a particle or wave state depending on experimental design. That, in turn, seems to indicate that ""the reality"" that is ""out there"" has no fixed form of existence, but rather it can manifest in one form or another depending upon our interaction with it. These startling findings have fascinating implications. However, those implications were not explored in the movie. Furthermore, these findings supply no basis for concluding that a person can coerce the events of day-to-day life to conform to their will. But that, nonetheless, is exactly the conclusion the movie comes to.

In fact, at one point the movie quotes a chiropractor who - with the overdone seriousness of a ""B"" movie mystic - looks at the camera and solemnly states that each morning he plans that day's reality.

Keep that guy away from my children.

Later on there are similar - and equally far fetched - conjectures made from a smattering of legitimate findings of neurochemistry. The movie - at that point - comes to the conclusion that a person can change their emotional make up simply by changing their mind about how they feel.

Explain that feat to a parent who has lost a child or to a Vietnam veteran with post traumatic stress syndrome.

This is the problem with the movie. It takes legitimate scientific findings and then makes huge and unwarranted speculative leaps to support preordained conclusions.

If the movie was ""faith based"" that would be one thing, but it purports to be based upon science.

I don't intend to demean ""faith based"" beliefs. Everything in the final analysis is faith based in one sense or another, it just depends upon what you choose to have faith in.

However after a while it flies off on a tangent of complete fantasy which has no scientific reasoning behind it whatsoever. In fact science would totally diprove most of what is said from then on. This is worsened by the fact that the film makers treat this fantasy as if it were scientificly enforced. The talking heads who are interviewed actually range from mediocre doctors of theology or some radical subsect of physics to self proclaimed experts, one of which seems to be totally motivated by her planet sized ego. I can understand people watching this film and being totally taken in and excited by the possibility that they can walk on water and make anything happen that they desire, in the mistaken knowledge that science supports all the mentioned theories, but this is exactly why this movie is popular - the average person on the street doesn't know one way or the other.

198381,5,1582704708,"""In the beginning was the Void, teeming with infinite possibilities, of which you are one..."" So begins this fascinating and mind-boggling movie, part documentary and part acted out story starring Marlee Matlin. It's not a perfect movie, as the mixed reviews demonstrate. But I give it ""five stars"" because if you really ""get it,"" even part of it, that far outweighs any issues of what the film-makers might have done differently. All of that is a matter of individual preference. I might have preferred that the movie restricted its interviews to the scientists and skip the renowned psychic, though I agreed strongly with most everything she said. It's just that scientists do not have the credibility problem of a psychic, and the messages of this movie are vitally important. But the movie is ""perfect"" at being what it set out to be, which includes the following:
 The documentary parts interview quantum physicists, psychologists, and others to uncover many of our hidden assumptions, the things we have always taken for granted, even unconsciously, and shows how they are as wrong as the old certainty that the earth was flat. They shine light on the difference between how the world feels to us and the way it really is. The self is intangible, yet thinks it perceives a ""real"" world. But scientists like Fred Alan Wolfe, are finding, ""What I thought was unreal, now, for me, seems in some ways to be more real than what I think to be ""real,"" which seems more now to be unreal."" This is because quantum physicists have discovered that any atom is through and through intangible: it's nucleus, its electrons, all quantum particles flash in and out of existence without any hard, static, or predictable substance to to be found in them at all. There is no ""stuff "" making up anything that ""exists."" We have felt that space is empty and matter is solid, but what quantum physics has found is that there is nothing to matter either; it is ""completely insubstantial."" The most concentrated aspect of matter is ""more like a thought, a concentrated bit of information."" And at that quantum level, everything we ever thought was physical is but ""waves of possibility"" which are collapsed into ""reality"" according to the inquiries or expectations of the observer (thus, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.)

The universe acts, both at the micro or quantum level and at the macro or astronomical level, as if it is an ever manifesting form of Consciousness. And your consciousness is part of the Whole Consciousness. There is no hard reality up against which you posit your life. You are It. The ""superpositions"" of quantum particles suggests that there are many possible realities, and all possible realities existing simultaneously.
""Quantum physics,"" according to Amit Goswami (Ph. D. physicist), is ""the physics of possibility."" He later makes it explicit: ""We all have a habit of thinking that everything around us is already a thing, existing without my input, without my choice. We have to banish that kind of thinking. Instead, you really have to recognize that even the material world around us...all of these are nothing but possible movements of Consciousness. And I am choosing moment to moment out of those movements to bring my actual experience into manifestation...Instead of thinking of 'things,' we have to think of possibilities; they're all possibilities of Consciousness.""
So, why do we keep recreating the same reality in our lives, recreating the same kind of relationships, getting the same jobs over and over again?
""In an infinite sea of potentials that exist all around us, how come we keep creating the same reality? Is it possible that we're so conditioned to our daily lives, that we buy the idea that we have no control at all? We have been conditioned to believe that the external world is more real that the internal world. This new model of science says just the opposite: it says what's happening within us will create what's happening outside us.""

First, what you don't get told regarding the photos of water, is that the beautiful crystals with the kind and loving words written on the outside are from an unpolluted source, while the photos of water with angry words which show malformed and blurry crystals are from a polluted river.  This is *NEVER* talked about in the film.  I found out when I researched it myself.

Second, you aren't told until you're in the credits that along with the world famous physicists, scientists, and theologians commenting on quantum mechanics and spirituality, you have a chiropractor and a woman claiming to channel a 35,000 year old entity.

Both of these ""omissions"" by the producers were a jarring and disappointing conclusion to an otherwise remarkable film.  And, unfortunately, this disingenuousness left me wondering if the producers/directors truly believed in their own material.  It's clear they didn't believe that being completely candid would enhance rather than detract from the film.

That being said, I found the film not only fascinating, but life affirming in a way that no other book or film has ever managed to do for me.

Via a fictional story interspersed with commentary by the above mentioned scientists, etc.  The movie explores the links between quantum physics and spirituality/metaphysics in such a way that believers and skeptics alike can walk away with a huge amount of food for thought.

It's not until those ending credits that you learn that the rather strident woman in red is supposedly channeling the words of an ascended ancient warrior, Ramtha...who, by the way, sounds eerily like the serpent in Genesis who had similar things to say to the gullible Eve--and we know how well that turned out.

There is a little hard science in this movie, but most of it ranges from unsupported new age metaphysical speculation and spin to mind numbingly obvious new age deception.

Comments on the interviewees:

I especially disliked:

Ramtha (JZ Knight), the blond chick- she just irritated me, she was obsessed with addictions & sex and didn't really have much of interest to say.

Miceal Ledwith, grey haired guy with cute accent- he made such difinitive statements about God and the nature of God as if he were a close personal enemy of His.

I especially liked:

Fred Alan Wolf, balding guy with grey hair, mustache, and beard (sitting outside in San Francisco in his interviews)- brilliant, down to earth, and extremely personable.  He expresses difficult concepts with ease.

William Tiller, balding guy with white beard- great ideas, eloquent execution, interesting, and down to earth.

I warn you, dogmatic religious believers will find this movie appalling. If you have a strong, unshakeable faith in any religious belief system, don't watch it. You will not like it.

The acting by Ms. Matlin was outstanding! This is the first time I've seen her act and you can bet I'll be looking for her again. Perhaps it is the limits of her speaking ability that allows you to draw into her characters emotions, or it is simply she is just a darn good actress, but you can't help but get sucked into her crappy life and all the emotions that go with it. We've all been there, done that to some degree and Ms. Matlin presents it so flawlessly!

This piece of drivel is a travesty of smarmy pseudoscience that makes me cringe at the state of general sceientific sophistication of the American public.  But why should this be a surprise, given that the teaching of ""Intelligent Design"" is now sanctioned by law in some states?

Having read the previous reviews and seen how polarized opinions are, I went to the theatre expecting either to walk out (as I saw others do) or to stay the distance and get something for my money. I stayed, and I did!

Whatever side we take regarding this film, there is one thing we can surely agree on: it has us all talking! And isn't that a good thing? In disagreeing, are we not proving the film's main contention: that each of us creates our own reality - even when it is in response to a movie like *What the Bleep do we Know?*

This gives new meaning to the saying, ""What you see is what you get.""  For instance, I saw nothing of the ""talking heads"" referred to rather cynically by other reviewers.  What I saw were ""thought balloons"" representing the heroine's reverie on what the scientists had previously said.  A nice way to recap the salient points without getting tedious, I would have thought.  But there you are: we create our own reality!

I have recently come across a website that is devoted entirely to the denigration of this film, and it makes me wonder why they felt compelled to protest so strongly and so publicly. The film does not claim to be definitive - after all the title is a QUESTION!  I must say that the negativity of such antagonists does not inspire me to join their side, especially as they have nothing to offer me in the place of what they are condemning. No answers either for those who suffer from existential angst, as many silently do - our kids especially. On the other hand, *What the Bleep do we Know* offers us a constructive place to begin.

I didn't entirely agree with everything represented in this film.  But I liked that.  How boring if it merely confirmed what I already believe!  Instead *What the Bleep do we Know* inspired me to ask new questions and to go looking for new answers. Which was exactly the movie makers' intention, wasn't it?",1121558400,13,1975,4.467966573816156

This movie is presented in a manner closer to how Fahrenheit 9/11 presented politics instead of a lecture by Richard Faynman, While all of it's parts are scientifically true a purest or fundamentalist may question the way the collected material is presented, but while the presentation may be debatable it is presented that why to move society forward. The ideas in this movie are there to help, heal, inspire, change, and create interested on a larger scale where there is none. This film is a spiritual film based on science not simply a science film, if that's what you want there are plenty of those out there but most people don't and that's who this is for. This movie is trying to express a perspective of the world that is modern to help society understand and change so humanity can move forward and away from archaic old world beliefs that are holding humanity back by tying us to ideas that don't work in the light of scientific discoveries.

Scientists tend break things done into smaller parts and that is the way they like it but this movie is a Philosophy for life based on Science that collects Scientific ideas into a unified whole and perhaps it doesn't make sense as a world view to them because either they have found a way to unify old world religious ideas with scientific evidence or they have excepted science as absolute fact despite the realization by many that perceptions do influence findings with one example being that depending on what instruments are chosen when viewing light it either appears as a Wave or a particle, it's almost as if the light waits until we look at it before it decides how it's going to be perceived.

**Spiritual Revolution*** This movie is the REAL LIFE truth encoded in The Matrix movies. If the vilest villain saw this movie he would start to reevaluate his life and if we see it then we'll be able to understand and maybe forgive him. The World can be better then it is.

Change you're perceptions, Change who you are! This movie is Enjoyable to watch and will affect who you are for the better. If you want to Understand or just be Entertained you will be pleasantly surprised on both fronts. Can you have everything you want from life, if you believe you can it will begin The Process that makes it happen!

But.

This film is full of so much fuzzy-headed quackery and self-delusion (if not outright con-artistry), it makes the mind reel.

At least, that is what I believe the ""experts"" in mathematics and quantum physics spend most of their time trying to convince us througout the film. At least the alchemists and astrologers of the pre-modern era didn't have a four hundred year tradition of scientific empiricism behind them....

This film is a textbook example of the dangers of the ""television epistemology"" that Neil Postman warns of in ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"". It is not an ""argument"" in the classical sense of the word, in which a proposition is explicated and defended, but rather a collage of gorgeous images and half-baked ideas inexpertly brought together into one work. Would this movie be nearly as compelling to some people if they had read only the screenplay? It's the same kind of rigorous, logically sound argumentation that goes on at late night, coffee-fueled bull sessions at university dorms across the country.

Some things to ask yourself while you watch:

Why are none of the speakers, or where they teach or work, identified until the end?

If a researcher in a lab had conclusively proven that something can exist simultaneously in two places, why are you hearing it for the first time now?

Do you truly, honestly believe that taping a word to a bottle of water affects its chemical or physical properties in any way? If I tape a message in binary or classical Greek, will I get the same results? (As an aside, if you answered yes to this question, I have some water that restores lost hair to sell to you.)

Do you actually believe that physical events that you observe are contingent upon your observing them? That if you leave the room, an apple dropped by your friend may not fall to the floor but instead, perhaps, suspend itself mid-air?

Whom do you think has a better grasp of Who God is, Thomas Aquinas (""After showing that there is a First Being, whom we call God, we must enquire into the conditions of His existence. We must use the method of negative differentiation, particularly in the consideration of the divine substance. For the divine substance, by its immensity, transcends every form that our intellect can realise; and thus we cannot apprehend it by knowing what it is, but we have some sort of knowledge of it by knowing what it is not."" Summa Contra Gentiles, Book I), or the people interviewed for this film (""That I am at one with the great being that made me and brought me here and that formed the galaxies and the universes, etc.... How did that get taken out of religion? It was not hard."" ""Now we have great technology from anti-gravity magnets, magnetic fields, zero point energy, we have all that but we still have this ugly, superstitious, backwater concept of God."")

First, the storyline is quite weak:  I did not find the protagonist and her plight very sympathetic.

Second, as much as I admire the lead actress, this is not her finest moment; it's an uneven performance.

Third, the scientific and metaphysical parts of the film are very disjointed.  While some of the quantum physics is true, it's manipulated in such a way as to render its arguments impotent.

(The assertion about the Native Americans' inability to see Columbus' ships is so preposterous it's not even worth the time to criticize it.)

Fourth, I'm troubled that a person as renowned as Dr. Stuart Hameroff would make a contribution to this film.  His presence -- along with some other respected scientists -- makes me wonder whether the producers misrepresented these experts' opinions and commentaries.

There IS something, however, that you can do to make this film worthwhile.  Another reviewer stated he kept note cards on the film's relevant topics.  Not a bad idea.  Take notes and then find credible sources on the topics of interest.

I enjoyed the interviews with experts (although 'Ramtha', while intriguing, still strikes me as a bit of a crackpot), but the filmy parts with Marlee in were a little amateurish.

It is unfortunate that some of the credible science (truth) presented was so watered down and stretched that even my eight year old nephew would detect the false premises presented there.

For instance, just because the natives standing on the shore had never seen a Spanish ship before certainly does not mean that the ships would BE invisible to them, that they would only see the water parting and not the ship.  How absurd!! They would SEE something, they just may not know what it was.  This premise suggests that if we didn't know what something was, that we would not be able to see it... once again, that is crazy!!  If that was the case then how did we ever find comets, planets, or stray asteroids??  or objects that can only be seen through a microscope??  If I threw something at the producer that he or she had never seen before, are you telling me that they would not be able to see it??  I bet they would feel it.

We have all seen things we have never seen before, on a regular basis, and there is no reason why we could not percieve light reflecting off an object because we don't recognize the patterns.

198424,2,1582704708,"I am sure lots of other reviewers have talked about the exciting, uplifting, crushingly simplistic message of this movie, its specious links to real science (such as quantum physics), its stronger links to science that is itself, however, utterly specious (like photographing the impressions that thoughts somehow make on water, or the idea of being literally ""addicted"" to certain thoughts or emotions.) So I will try to say something different.

It struck me that the everybody in the movie works very hard to find some basis for their thinking about how to live life in some ideas from some other discipline, like physics or biochemistry. I wonder why they have to do that. A practical philosophy, i.e., one that talks about how to live life well, if it were any good, would not need some kind of support from outside sources. Plato or Montaigne didn't find it necessary.

Which leads me to my second thought. To me the movie, and the ridiculously positive response it got from the audience the night I watched it, reveals a desire for a simple, coherent world view that extends down to everyday individuals and actions. In earlier times the hierarchy of being created an order that began with God, continued through the King and down through the priests and nobles, the artisans, the serfs, and ended with the plants and minerals. Everything in its place, and everyone knowing their  place.

Well those days are gone. We have learned that the universe has immensely older, larger, and more complex than we thought, and that our place in it is immensely smaller, more arbitrary and more irrational than we thought. We are not even ruled by our own minds; our higher minds are layered on top of primitive functions like a modern skyscraper on mud foundations, we perceive things before we are conscious of it, our perceptions and memories are distorted by emotions and prejudice and even peer pressure. Genetically we are just a third type of chimpanzee.

And now we have this pathetic piece of wishful thinking that seeks to make it all make sense again, that doesn't stand up to the merest ray of critical thinking, that educated audiences seize upon wildly and hug like a teddy bear.

The third thought I had was that the particular philosophy espoused is extremely individualistic, even narcissistic. It gives the individual person extraordinary powers, e.g., the power to literally create the universe (which has no connection to quantum physics whatsoever, by the way.) I can see how this would be comforting, even flattering, even elf-aggrandizing, for the typical 21st Century citizen/consumer adrift in confusion and powerlessness. But it totally neglects our relationship and obligation to society and our fellow humans.

A very intelligent and educated friend of mine insisted that I watch this movie, so I eagerly attended it, alone. I watched with growing disbelief, both at the content of the movie and the increasingly excited responses of the people around me. It was nearly the most disappointing movie I have ever seen (exceeded only by Star Wars Episode I.)

I recall one particular chapter where a man declaims that he creates the world anew each morning, by perceiving it. I wondered why he didn't create a world where he wasn't so nervous that he didn't visibly sweat and gulp in front of the camera. Maybe he just prefers it that way.

On the plus side, Marlee Maitlin is a compelling actress, one who I have admired for years. The movie seems to be competently filmed, edited, recorded, etc. That... might be about it.

Even more than this movie, the overwhelmingly positive and to me, desperate reception this movie has received makes me frightened for our future. If this is what our smarter people seize upon for answers, we are in trouble.

Science is, taken as a whole, possibly the greatest single human achievement, and to me it represents the most respectful, humble, and impersonal (in the good sense) methdod of understanding the physical world. To see it reduced to slogans and painted on this toy balloon of a movie is deeply saddening.

Further, we are faced with deep, difficult moral questions: questions of what are the boundaries between individual and society, and what is owed to whom, questions of who we are, and when we cease to be who we are. Addressing these questions will require clear thinking, patience and painstaking compromise. This movie puts a set of funhouse glasses in front of our eyes, and can only get in the way.

It it possible, please, that we put aside pleasing, pretty thoughts and actually open our eyes?",1120262400,23,4574,4.909326424870466
198425,1,1582704708,"I'm know a lot of people found this movie ""eye-opening"" and ""enlightening"", but it is the most pretentious mockery of a film I have ever seen. The makers of this film completely threw philosophy and logic out the window when they decided to support the claims of the so-called experts interviewed here-in.

The first example of such woeful judgement calls is the tale of the Native Americans not being able to see Columbus' ships. The explanation is that the ships were too foreign to them, so their brains ignored them completely. Only when the shaman focused and pointed them out did the others believe and see. First of all, this is a myth hundreds of years old and from a non-credible source. Second, the logic of this story would make all new-borns blind, as the world is an alien place to them, much more so than a big ship is to an Indian. Later on in the film, the experts turn to a subject on which they do not even claim to have expertise. They begin derailing all conventional views of God. Whether they realize it or not, these include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism of any sort. In other words, all of the worlds' most cherished religions are debunked in a few moments. These are no theologians, but people who, like everyone else in the world, simply think their reasoning is the best. And what is their reasoning? They don't give any. They simply rave about how wrong and insulting it is to our pantheistic, universe-encompassing God of Spinoza's fancy that there are those who would still follow the old ways. Conflicting views are simply out of the question. When thoroughly examined, these people are some of the most close-minded I have ever beheld. No substantial logic is ever laid out, so we just have to believe that they somehow obtained extensive knowledge about a subject that has remained elusive to humanity since the beginning of time. Sounds reasonable.

The animation portion of the movie is disgusting and poorly-executed. I am a huge fan of animation, and these little ""things"" disgusted me and made me want to turn the movie off and burn it. This section alone would have caused me to want to supress the memory of this movie forever, had not so many other hideous flaws done the trick already. I do not claim to have all the answers nor to be the ultimate judge of logic or reason, but check your facts, people, and use your heads. This movie makes no sense and is designed to be appealing to those with no background in philosophy or specialized sciences.

WTBDWK is, in short, a mess.  Perhaps there is a coherent and entertaining film buried in there somewhere, but as it stands now, what we have is two hours of incoherence.  The switching between talking heads and a dramatic story featuring Marlee Matlin does not work.  Rather than complement one another, the film's two ""halves"" serve only to confuse and muddle the proceedings.  I found the Marlee Matlin scenes totally unnecessary - they neither enhanced the talking points nor were particularly entertaining.  The interviews were the most interesting aspect of the film, but the clips are too brief to be of much use.  Quantum physics is not something you can describe adequately in a one-minute sound bite.

A better approach would have been to keep the special effects (not bad) and include longer interview segments with the so-called experts (minus the Ramtha lady, whose presence delegitimizes the entire film).  Get rid of the Marlee Matlin segments, as well.

198429,1,1582704708,"Everything about this movie is a fraud.  The ""experts"" who claim to understand quantum physics spew nonsense and obviously got most of their background by reading a Dummies' Guide; or their comments were quoted out of context to support the movie's basic theme.  The whole idea of quantum theory being applicable to metaphysics is stuff and nonsense invented by people who are trying to sell hokum to the masses.  Sadly, they succeed on a regular basis, as the success of this film shows.

The idea of ""subjective reality"" is one often hawked by religious movements as a way to attract the faithful; but if we're able to generate our own reality, why would anyone choose to be poor, sick, downtrodden, or otherwise unhappy?  If all we need to do is think good thoughts and have a positive attitude in order to succeed, then we should all have the ability to be successful.  Sadly this is all feel-nice claptrap a'la the New Age movement, which is in itself based on total fantasy invented by its primary proponents.  Yes, a positive attitude is generally better than a negative one, as the former often causes the same reaction in others.  The workplace and society in general reward positive thinking.  But this cannot and should not be extrapolated into a metaphysical ""we affect our reality"" mythology since there is no objective evidence to support it.

The film and the myth surrounding it also try to convince us that objective knowledge is impossible.  Rubbish.  While it is certain that all humans filter events through their senses and perceptions, this does not translate to an absence of objective fact.  Here again we see the New Age movement's pseudoscientific bent, as it tacks made-up metaphysical nonsense onto snippets of legitimate science.

In another vein, isn't it suspicious that the ""Ramtha"" character invented by JZ Knight demands money (that he can't use, being long dead) in exchange for the alleged ""cosmic knowledge"" he has to impart?  Isn't this a convenient excuse to found a religion and pay no taxes on your income?

The West, and the US in particular, has become particularly vulnerable to hucksters selling New Age beliefs, largely due to ongoing scientific discoveries that have increasingly invalidated the dogma offered by more established religious bodies.  New Age beliefs seek to reconcile the human need for something greater than themselves with our rapidly increasing understanding of the physical world; they do this by cloaking mysticism in terms of science.  But it's all smoke and mirrors.

Save your money, buy a few real science books (which are not to be found in the ""spirituality"" section of your local Borders), and learn something useful.",1120089600,16,2692,5.008988764044944
198430,4,1582704708,"Underlying the whole film is the central epistemological question regarding our assumptions towards reality, ""What is really real?"".  Here I would like to alert readers to a great book first published in 1957, by Bernard Lonergan.  It is called Insight: A Study of  Human Understanding.  A more refined edition is included in Collected Works of Bernard Lonergan. (Cf. my reviews there.)
He makes the distinction between ""naive realism"", based on taking a look ""out there"" and ""critical realism"", based on understanding and judgement.  Naive realists,used to their belief in the real world out there, including ""God"", will have great difficulty with this film.  But if we shake our eye-glasses or press our eye-balls while looking out there, is the world out-there really shaking based on our sensory experience?  One thinks of the old Zen question, ""Is there sound when a tree falls and there is no living being around?""
  In critical realism, we seek understanding of what constitutes our experience, try to understand and arrive at insight, and verify if it is really so.  We need to be aware of these recurrent processes in ourselves and get in touch with personal and group bias and differentiate between different realms of meaning.
Not everything said in the film is necessarily true.  But the film has certainly succeeded in stimulating our own reflections.  The onus lies in our own effort to seek further understanding and verification and develop a more meaningful world-view of God, morality, objectiivity and reality.",1120089600,6,1529,5.170731707317073
198431,4,1582704708,"Over the years I'll admit that I've pored so much over texts such as Frijtof Capra's ""Tao of Physics,"" Stephen Hawking's ""Brief History of Time,"" Michio Kaku's ""Hyperspace,"" Michael Talbot's ""The Holographic Universe,"" Baba Ram Dass's ""Remember Now Be Here,"" Danah Zohar's ""The Quantum Self,"" White Eagle's ""Quiet Mind,"" Carlos Castaneda's ""The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge,"" and Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World Revisited"" that I expected it unlikely that I'd be swayed much more than I already am. Hark, good people! There is nothing in the world of ideas more challenging to ""common sense,"" which may be an over-rated, watered down take on reality in the service of conservation of energy, than the ideas presented in this relatively new field of quantum physics. It is absolutely on the cutting edge of human thinking. Genome mapping is staggering, stem cell research is provocative, yet quantum mechanics is nothing short of completely revolutionizing. And as a species on the cusp of evolving away from or remaining savage war-like baboons, I'd say a vote cast in the favor of looking into developing and expanding consciousness, a feature we share with all sentient beings, is a vote worth risking. This film is a stunning compendium of much modern thought, such as is found in a number of texts, some of which are listed above, but the ideas are also alive and well in other films such as ""Mindwalk,"" ""Run Lola Run,"" and ""Waking Life."" Shoot, even ""The Butterfly Effect"" toys with quantum physics' ideas. Is consciousness an energy without a locus? Where is it, if it's not simply a phenomenon of being flesh and blood? It's very difficult to walk around and interact with post-offices and cubicle environments and thieves and computer keyboards and everything else ""common"" and maintain that new agey sense of wonder that, ""wow, the particles that constitute me and everything else are 15 billion years old..."" It's simply impractical. But now and then could it be helpful to step back and contemplate that fact that we're spinning through a seemingly torpid galaxy that's actually rife with electromagnetic energy with relative grace upon this planet/spaceship? (Add R. Buckminster Fuller's ""Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth"" to the list.) Why not consider perhaps that the ancient forces that ramified our world into this dizzying diversity of opinion and matter are conditions perhaps not fully understood, appreciated, nor utilized?

Is consciousness an energy, a fuel source... like oil or nuclear power or solar energy or natural gas or water? What would it be like to live in a spiritual mindset on this beautiful planet before meeting with our eventual and inescapable passing? Movies like this force the viewer to reevaluate her or his everyday environment. The visual aids used here, such as can only be accomplished through the evolution of computers' complexity and user skills, are essential adjuncts in supporting a new language, painting a lexical landscape, of very alien notions: the behavior of the hypothalamus, the actual and very real interplay of a neural network, the properties of electrons and repulsion.... For instance, the basketball that ""never touches"" the court. To zoom in and slow down in order to serve the ""never touches"" concept via careful computer animation is an aide that cannot be dismissed. And to think I used to have to sit through filmstrips! ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" is well served through the use of modern computer animation techniques. I believe it's very well balanced within the film. Yes, we can read that sub-atomic particles have their own language, and the cells of an organism too have their own language, and the next quantum leap up into the macro-biological agent, i.e., a human being, offers its own language. But to couple this series of items in a sentence with a visual aide that rises out of the microscopic, generatively, until landing firmly in the familiar world of the silver screen is technology put to good pedagogical use. Ah, yes. Add ""The Global Brain"" by Peter Russell or Richard Dawkins' ""Selfish Gene"" to the list.

The movie is not perfect. The soundtrack is deliberate while the script challenges popular and ancient notions of patriarchal religions. It suggests that we are the sovereign arbiters of our every experience, and these are notions that can make anyone skeptical or even outraged. The acting is enjoyable in a fringe A-list sort of way. The subway scene and Masaru Emoto's photographs are compelling. All in all, it's likely the creators of this movie don't really mind if they've challenged comfort zones. And while the film certainly doesn't contain all of the necessary answers--nothing does; we're in process, folks--it's worth figuring out if ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" belongs in the growing canon of quality quantum physics material for the average non-theoretical physicist. At least there's nothing wrong with agreeing to suspect we don't have it all figured out. Like the natives once unable to see the hidden Clipper Ships of Christopher Columbus, have we been given the shaman's permission to see?

The concept that we make our own reality based on our frame of mind is a recurrent piece of propaganda which serves to justify oppression:  it's all in your head, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, you can do it if you try.  Well, truthfully, we are PARTLY responsible for our reality.  Yet not fully.

How does this theory address phenomenon like slavery?  The Holocaust?  I don't think you want to hear the answer, but it's easy to suppose that victims of such atrocties brought it on themselves somehow, from some past life or mindset.  Such an answer -- which I've actually heard from apologists for this film -- is a desecration to victims' memories and is the kind of suburban, new age babble that offends anyone with intelligence.

Here's a simple error in the logic of the film:  if everyone makes their own realities, how does the universe deal with a ""reality"" conflict?  If I'm projecting nothing but love and joy, I could still be hit by a car driven by someone on the edge of destruction, right?  So, how am I fully responsible for my reality?  I'm not.

The theory in this film is not just hocus pocus easily used to justify oppression, violence, and caste, it's a pathetic commercial for the Ramtha-channeling facelift maven dealing out ""enlightenment in 8 days.""  The makers of the film are reportedly Ramtha followers, and the channeler of Ramtha in the film is given the most film time, as far as I can tell.

The uplifting dimensions of the film are of course the existential triumph of getting us all to see how much we really CAN change our reality.  That's why it gets 2 stars frm me.

This is an over-done media show, scattered with snip-its of knowledge from professionals (one exception) in their scientific fields. I already know a great deal of what their talking about. Enough, at least, to know that this movie has done a horrible job of delivering its message.

From a production stand-point, this movie is unforgiveabley bad.  The graphics are greatly over done, as is the sound, making the movie almost incoherenet from an information delivery perspective.  In some scenes you can barely hear the speaker over the volume of the soundtrack.  In other words, the message almost gets totally lost in the bloody media!  The message is drowning in a sea of graphics and sound track!  I see more and more of this kind of mistake in this infantile age of hyper-media.  The whiz-bang drowns out the message, or the message takes a distant second to the hyped-up grahics and cool sound track.

Further, there's so little information offered about each subject area covered, that those who aren't already knowledgeable about the subjects get no coherent message from the movie.  That's a horrible way to introduce the fine research done in these fields.  The rest of the movie is bloody eye-candy!

As far as Ramtha goes, she has no bloody business being in this movie whatsoever.  Her presence has tainted the messages brought by those serious scientists that took the time to present their research. Ramtha, to me, is highly questionable.

If you are a diehard materialist or religious monotheist, What The Bleep is not going to change your mind about anything. On the other hand, if you already believe in such ""new age"" ideas or are at least open to them, this is an interesting, informative and mostly entertaining film. The style of mixing documentary and fictional drama was done fairly well, though at times the jumping around is a little distracting.

The scientists interviewed for the film, along with J.Z. Knight (who channels the entity known as Ramtha and was introduced to the public something like 20 years ago by Shirley Maclaine) present these ideas in an accessible way. Of course, you can't expect to learn everything there is to know about a subject in a 100 minute film, but  viewers are given lots of clues about where to search for further information.

Marlee Matlin stars in the dramatic episodes, and she was a good choice. Her character is a troubled, depressed and skeptical person who is gradually transformed by the idea that people create their own reality. What the Bleep does a good job of presenting a summary of a psychological/scientific/spiritual paradigm that has been steadily growing on the fringes of mainstream culture for the past few decades. While some of the conclusions drawn by the people interviewed are certainly debatable, many of the basic principles related to physics are difficult to argue with. You may not believe that we really create our own reality, but the fact is that the rationalist/materialist (not to mention fundamentalist religious) models that peaked in the 19th Century are all but obsolete and we definitely need to explore the new terrain.

I know for a fact that many psychologists, philosophers, and physicists have been looking in this same direction for some time.

The key words to remember from this movie are ""paradigm shift"" ... and this movie asks us to consider quite a large one: A psychological paradigm shift that results at a quantum level.  To some less-flexible minds, this is asking too much.

However, at no time does this movie tell you how to achieve anything nor does it detatch any truth from science itself, but instead it asks more fundamental human questions.

We cant all be geniuses or for that matter want or have the time to sit down and go through all the long scientific books on the subjects, when half of the time, half of so called science is well thought out opinion. Don't get me wrong im not saying we should all be lazy thinkers, its just that its movies like this that get people to look into these subjects in the first place. I found the movie to be interesting, it's the kind of stuff a lot of us have already heard or looked into, but simplified and did I say interesting. Not many movies are that anymore. Its a positive look on life, one that doesn't say we are all hear because of a big cosmic mistake and there's nothing we can do about life or that its a kill or be killed world, survival of the fittest. You know some of this is true, but has any one noticed that when you try to talk about the positive or maybe a bigger theme to life, people almost automatically shut it down. What is it Einstein said, No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.

Quantum physics is indeed wonderful and exhibits properties that are nonsensical to our everyday senses. BUT.........

That doesn't mean it has ANYTHING to do with human consciousness, alternate consciousness or the sexual ""energies"" of Ramtha and her drooling minions.

198449,4,1582704708,"As with many of the efforts to share mystical thinking in America, there's a degree of language and terms that are easily misused and misunderstood in this film. As such, the universal and (retrospectively) obvious truths that are expounded here can be lost in the trees of mumbo jumbo. And What the Bleep Do We Know!? has lots of trees. Quantum theory is tricky stuff (just ask Einstein!), and it's very nature invites multiple interpretations and explanations. The philosophical/New Age tack is hardly new, but it carries considerable linguistic baggage that What the Bleep hardly tries to surmount. The entertainment value was remarkable, as the filmmakers went after their themes with talking-head, drama, and cartoon, all at once.

Agree or disagree seems to be beyond the point here. I'm surprised by the raving as much as I am by the ranting the film elicits, as it really seems to merit neither. If we are to heed one of the central premises, that we must use our rational mind and follow the scientific method, then neither response is appropriate. Unless, of course, we are trapped by another central theme - addiction. The amount of energy put into this one topic should be a big flag to those who have fallen in love with the film, as well as to its opponents. The implications of addiction are profound, and it is probably one of the great challenges of modern times.

The film gets four stars for the ham-handed writing in the dramatic segments, but the overall effort was commendable. The DVD extras have some interesting peeks into the people behind it, their thoughts, intentions etc. Yes, this is a privately funded affair, but hey, so was Star Wars.

198450,1,1582704708,"View this movie with a guarded mind and certainly don't spend your own money.  And for goodness sakes don't take this movie seriously.  I have read some of these reviews and they are down right scary with their calls to ""open mindedness.""

We are treated to visual effects that are fairly good and somewhat reasonable messages-at first.  Like your attitude determining your situation.  These are not new messages though.

However the statements and visuals range from silly to scary.

A silly statement is from one talking head telling us that he's created the camera that is recording his image.

The underlying messages however, are not so funny and quite frankly, troublesome given the reviews I have seen.

In one scene the former Theologian tells us that the ""Height of arrogance"" is to create GOD in our own image.  In an adjacent scene Ramtha, the 35,000 year old, channeled entity (which we are not told about and we are not told that the film's makers are her/his followers) tells us that religion is ""backwater.""

During these statements we are treated to ominously lit visuals of what appears to be a Catholic Church and a priest forebodingly walking right to left in front of the camera.

In a later scene after being ""taught"" about our ability to ""control"" our environment we are told, very directly, by Ramtha that ""You Are Gods!""

Now, if the ""Height of arrogance"" is to think God created us in his image, what exactly is the level of arrogance for those who believe they are Gods?  Can you really take that seriously?

This is not the only paradox.  There is one about positive thinking being just a thin layer on a deep negative layer and ""love"" described as a chemical reaction of lust.  Then later we are shown our heroin drawing hearts (the symbol of love) on her body and relaxing in a bath thinking positive thoughts...

The one that makes me laugh is one of the talking heads is a chiropractor, that's right, a chiropractor.  He talks about the ""observer.""  He calls upon the observer to show him in some subtle way each day that he exists.

An observer, observes. Yikes!

The worst of it though is in the visual messages overlaid by voices of the talking heads.  It is how men and religious men are portrayed in this video.

*A fat man is shown gorging himself at a reception buffet

*The heroin's husband is shown cheating on her

*he is also shown scamming a girl during their vows

*A Priest is shown in the background flirting with a girl at the wedding reception

*A Priest is shown checking out a girl in the audience two different times with two different couples while the couples are sharing their vows.

*The heroin's boss is shown, in an overstated way, staring at the rear of an officemate.

*The bride's father throws the DJ across the room for not playing a polka

*Two young boys are portrayed, in an overstated way, ""scoping"" for girls at the wedding.

*The groom is shown winking at one of the bride's maids

on and on and on.

What do we get in a portrayal of women?  The only negative acts I saw were the Heroin being mean to her roommate.  But this is understandable because her husband (a man) cheated on her and this is presumably why she is in a ""funk"" to begin with.

The roommate is this very nice lady who takes the horrible treatment by her roommate in stride and even makes her a present...

The repeated ongoing male and Christian bashing in this movie is overstated and borders on hateful.  Imagine my surprise to find out the Ramtha/JZ Knight is a feminist and a religious leader trying to get recruits...

  I myself have been steeped in this type of information for over twenty years so several of the speakers were quite familiar to me. Nevertheless, they haven't been familiar to many so hopefully this movie will be a bridge to further exploration of quantum physics, higher consciousness studies, natural healing, synchonicity, spirituality in its myriad forms, and last but not least meditation. People there is a world that conventional science won't accept. Don't be deceived that because they deny it that it isn't there. May this movie be another ""Celestine Prophecy"" that can open people's minds to other ways of being that can lead to more whole and intentional living.

  This movie had two levels; that of the female character and that of the very credentialed speakers. Personally, I would have preferred there be no story line and we could have heard more from the speakers. The movie part of this could have been done much better I believe.

I love this stuff and eagerly expected to be wowed by this movie. Instead, it was like a cruel, cold hard slap across the face. Ouch. What a terrible movie. What an embarassment. And, what a surprise: the film-makers, and Ramtha-acolyte Newberg, have also read NeuroTheology, and have lifted the work of Persinger and Joseph, but then turned the theories and research of these men (and the only legitimate scientist/physicist who was tricked into appearing in this movie) into a confused and inaccurate mess (which is why said physicist has since denounced this terrible film). Certainly, children and those who have never been exposed to these ideas might be impressed with the cheesy special effects and the film-makers muddled attempts to be profound. If you know nothing about the subject, and if it doesn't bother you to see science confused with fantasy, then sure, see this silly movie. But beware. Quantum physics? Sorry, quantum fantasy.

This book is presented in a manner closer to how the Fahrenheit 9/11 tie-in presented politics instead of a book by Richard Faynman, While all of it's parts are scientifically true a purest or fundamentalist may question the way the collected material is presented, but while the presentation may be debatable it is presented that why to move society forward. The ideas in this book are there to help, heal, inspire, change, and create interested on a larger scale where there is none. This read is a spiritual book based on science not simply a science book, if that's what you want there are plenty of those out there but most people don't and that's who this is for. This book is trying to express a perspective of the world that is modern to help society understand and change so humanity can move forward and away from archaic old world beliefs that are holding humanity back by tying us to ideas that don't work in the light of scientific discoveries.

Scientists tend break things done into smaller parts and that is the way they like it but this book is a Philosophy for life based on Science that collects Scientific ideas into a unified whole and perhaps it doesn't make sense as a world view to them because either they have found a way to unify old world religious ideas with scientific evidence or they have excepted science as absolute fact despite the realization by many that perceptions do influence findings with one example being that depending on what instruments are chosen when viewing light it either appears as a Wave or a particle, it's almost as if the light waits until we look at it before it decides how it's going to be perceived.

Can you have everything you want from life, if you believe you can it will begin The Process that makes it happen!

198458,1,1582704708,"Instead of commenting on the aesthetics or acting concerning this film, I will focus the worldview it propagates, which is pantheistic monism (nondualism): all is one; all is divine; we are divine; we are unlimited; we are beyond good and evil. The supposed experts use discredited interpretations of physics, outright frauds (the water crystal revelations), and pronouncements from a purportedly channeled entity (Ramtha) to drive this outrageous point home.

However, this worldview is illogical, amoral, and dangerous. Thus, no one should believe it.

1. One expert, a theologian (!) speaks of the terrible idea that there is evil in the world. If the idea is so terrible, it would be evil. So evil would exist after all. This is a contradiction and cannot be true. Ramtha says, ""You are not good. You are not evil. You are god."" However, no one--outside of a sociopath--can live out this amoral worldview consistently. If you don't think the attack on America on September 11 was not evil, there is simply something wrong with you. If you don't think rape, child molestation, and racism is objectively evil, then you are radically out of step with reality. You need help from outside of yourself.

2. If we ""create our own reality,"" why are we so horrendously bad at it? Why does one the experts (a chiropractor, no less) struggle with his postnasal drip every time he is on camera? Why has JZ Knight (the channeler for Ramtha) aged so terribly in the past fifteen years? They are gods, for God's sake! Why are we gods such underachievers, so retarded? It simply makes no sense. What makes more sense is that we are creatures of God, east of Eden and under God.

3. The view promoted by the film is also dangerous because it uproots us from any stable sense of objective reality--morally, metaphysically, or spiritually. We do not create our own reality; although we are morally responsible for how we live our lives. We have to live in terms of the reality that has been given to us, including our finitude, fallibility, and moral failings. Our conscience may connect us with a Higher Reality, but this Reality will tell us to stop all the silly god-playing.

The idea that we needn't be victims, and that we can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and create a better life by changing our perceptions, that's worth pursuing, whether you're atheist, Christian, Ramthan (?), Buddhist, etc. Not many movies that I see that provoke any kind of discussion at all, so flawed as it may be, a nice change from the usual Hollywood fare.",1118448000,32,816,4.506756756756757

In many ways, we are God....because we are a part of God...and a part of one another. This movies explores spirituality, but not religion...and the intangible concepts of astrophysics.

The problem is, the movie presents itself as grounded in science. But in truth many of the talking heads interviewed are not even scientists at all, they're the same fringe practitioners of pseudoscience that prop that whole cottage industry up.

198462,5,1582704708,"I have studied quantum mechanics for a number of years and although in my opinion there are a few points that can be seen as a far stretch, the basis of science expressed appears to be legitimate.  Regardless of who was behind these points that were made, it shouldnt take away from the unity based thinking between science and religion, as well as the other legitimate points that were made about self responsibility and empowerment.

The bottom line is that no film is perfect and thus we have been given the ability to discern for ourselves what we feel is our truth in relation to our perceptions, whether it be your perception of this film or your perception of a cheese burger.  You have the power and ability to decide for yourself. Anything that makes us think and challenges our beliefs is inherrantly valuable.

Prior to the arrogant and egotistical response that has arisen out of some of this movies viewers, consider your reaction carefully. There have been many scientific discoveries/realizations that have come from unusual circumstances. Even if it isn't perfect or 100% credable the first time around, in many cases it sparks a creative outcome that enables a change in awareness and knowledge.

Regardless of your opinion of this movie, I applaud all of you for chosing to accept its challenge. Sometimes it is more valuable to look past the obvious details and see things for their basic intention. The basic intention is that we as sentient human beings that seem to evolve on all levels have the ability to improve our reality. We can change our reality on a collective level. We can make a difference. Collectively we could erradicate poverty, slavery, and any other major human attrocity if we chose to. Is it an easy thing to address the horrable symptoms of pain and suffering, if even just in our own lives alone? No, but it doesnt mean we shouldnt increase our awareness so that we may effect change. Change for some of us may be taking responsibility for our own behaviors and improving how we relate to the poeple around us, ie a spuse, child, etc..

I can go on & on.. but instead of critisizing the true premise of the film, lets focus on the unity based concept of self responsibility and empowerment. Lets cease as best we can any co-dependant patterns that hold us down as individuals and as a culture. Regardless of your origin, religion, etc. We all are subject to the human condition, our concept of unity is the way to effect its change and evolve as a human family.

The whole movie felt like I was watching something on the Discovery Science Channel, but with less science :) They interview some quality people, but in the end it falls incredibly short. If you want to know about the subjects they cover I recommend reading the books by the interviewees  instead of watching this movie. If you are unfamiliar with quantum physics this is not a bad introduction, but it is not the best by any means.  Gary Zukov's ""Dancing Wu-Li Masters"" is a great intro, as are Fred Alan Wolf's books (interviewed in the film). They don't even mention String Theory (M Theory) or have any meaningful discussion on spirituality (they talk about religion though). When they do talk about molecular biology they seem to contradict themselves in terms of what the implications of Quantum physics are supposed to mean for us. There are numerous intellectual inconsistencies that should be obvious to the even semi-critical viewer. If you are looking for something with spiritual or intellectual depth look elsewhere. If you have a friend or family member that has never really thought about these things, it's worth showing it to them in the hope it will perk their interest and then they can go on to some higher quality information.

In short, from a scientific, philosophical, spiritual, and metaphysical perspective, I rate this a D+. Interviewing Ramtha - a channeled Atlantlean that charges $150 to hear her talk in person - does not help their case either.  (I think she actually produced it, btw)

I also recommend these books:

The Holographic Universe - Michael Talbot

The World is Sound - Joachim Ernst Berendt

Many negative reviewers seem to be very put-out by the fact that most of the interviewees are not quantum physicists and yet have the gall to talk about quantum physics! Well, that is just elitism in my opinion. We live in a society of so-called ""experts"" and ""professionals"" in every field, from politicians to doctors, and the more specialized we get, the worse things are. We abdicate our personal responsibility to think about things for ourselves and teach ourselves about the world. We stop educating ourselves as soon as we leave school, because we don't have to any more -- no one will make us learn. We entrust our health to doctors we have vested with an almost god-like power and authority, and take whatever drugs and potions they say we need, and we are in worse shape than ever. Too many people are walking around with tunnel vision. Science is the study of what is. Every one of us starts out as a scientist. The scientific method can be employed by anyone. The fruits of science belong to everyone. Anyone can learn about quantum physics if they want to, and converse about it as intelligently as they are able with the level of knowledge they possess. Those who decry laymen discussing science need to stop trying to hoard knowledge to maintain some kind of elite power-dynamic the ""scientists"" can wield over the rest of us ignorant plebes (take a lesson from what happened to the Roman Catholic Church when the masses finally got to read the Bible in their own tongue).
There is so much more to this world than we know, and there always will be, b/c of our limited perspective. It seems to me that if we ever came to the end of our scientific investigation of what is, we would probably die out due to the frustration of our innate curiousity.

And if you did get that impression, you would almost certainly be wrong.

If you are a skeptical person with above-average knowledge of quantum physics and neuroscience, this movie will make you cringe with its clumsy language and refusal to back up any of its claims, whether factual or insane, with references to valid experimental data.

The viewer is given a boatload of intriguing data that definitely calls into question traditional notions of human perception and spirituality, and urged to consider all of the possibilities.

198476,4,1582704708,"In my experience this is a excellent educational film. I have watched it many times with many other people. Each time I see it light a wide range of people up to a new level of expanded appreciation for life, the mind, and the nature of reality.

What the bleep (WTB) is part documentary and part movie. The main character is mute and deaf (I assume). She plays her part well... which is one of a woman (perhaps late 30's) facing a crisis point in her life after a failed marriage and increasing stress levels (for which she takes pills of some kind). She starts to have various experiences that gently lead her into waking up to a new way of perceiving reality and to loving and accepting herself. That's the gist of her part in this film.

During the course of that awakening journey we get to hear informational input from a range of well respected and published scientists, which is more akin to watching a documentary. Mostly quantum physicists, but also Chandice Pert (read Molecules of Emotion) who has done pioneering work in the field of neuro-cognitive science (how our mind/emotions work and the role neuro peptides play in our lives, etc.). There is also input from Jessica Knight who is a well known channel for a being she calls Ramtha. Personally JK has never been my cup of tea and not someone I take a great deal of interest in --- although I don't disagree with much of what she teaches. She's one of the reasons I would give this DVD four stars and not five. I think JK is a discredit to the topic at hand... but if you like channelled information, then don't take this part of my review into account. I have given it five anyway, as I don't think this alone should put someone off of watching it.

I have quite a few friends that have never considered life beyond the physical/material plane of reality. They would consider themselves to be quite conventional in their thinking but they are open to discovering new things. Their comment after seeing WTB the other day was that they resisted it initially (found it too slow) but then got right in to it and now want to see it again. They realized that their finding it slow was actually that they didn't want to allow in what was being portrayed, but that what the scientist eventually touched on simply blew them away.

I think that this movie will appeal to a wide audience. From those that know little or nothing about the deeper aspects of reality and the mind, right through to those that are right into much of what the New Age is into and explores. Die-head Newtonian minded people might be an exception, because quantum physics redefines all the Newtonian models our society has come to love and rely on. There are certainly many people that will not find this movie appealing. Anyone who's world view adheres strictly to reality as maintained through Newtonian models and which is taught in most schools and colleges (the world view that much of the western world population adheres to) will more than likely NOT like this movie.

If you have any friends of family that have been sceptical about spirituality and the deeper (spiritual) dimensions of life then I recommend you buy them this DVD as a gift. It is a great way to help lead such people into seeing life in a new and more liberating way.

WTB explores the notion that there is no intrinsic reality independent of the observer of that reality. It explores the notion that, as far as quantum research can determine, there appears to just be ""one vast mind"" and we each embody and experience our own aspect of that ""one mind"". Reality as we know it really does not exist in the way that our brain tells us it does. Mystics and shaman, etc., have been aware of this for thousands of years... science has now come to the same conclusions. It does clearly point out that quantum theory can not say ""how"" or ""why"" these new discoveries are possible... yet it can say that it's discovered some things that defy what we have come to think of as so ""real"".

WTB uses a lot of great computer generated graphics to illustrate concepts and metaphysical realities that would otherwise be very hard to depict. I think this too is a real benefit for people that tend to view life in a fairly ""solid"" way (most people do). Those that have not experienced the less ""solid"" and more fluid aspects of reality (through meditation, spiritual revelation, mystical experiences, or the use of entheogenic plants) can have a hard time imagining reality in any other form. WTB does a great job of making these non-ordinary realities more tangible and imaginable.

I highly recommend this movie... to all people except perhaps those that are really strongly attached to status-quo perceptions of how the world and reality is. Although even if you are one of those people, if you feel at all open to new ways of seeing things then you too might find that this movie leaves you joyfully pondering on ""Just what the bleep did I know...""

For those that are interested in this film from a technical point of view... Strictly as a movie (for entertainment) I can't say it is particularly well constructed. The script in the movie portion is pretty simplistic and lacking the substance I would personally look for in a film. As a documentary I think it would be fair to say that it lacks the level objectivity and comprehensive depth I would expect from a well produced documentary. Yet, WTB is a combination of Doco and an entertaining movie--a different genre entirely--and in this regard it the result is something that is both entertaining and informative.

  tens of thousands to book seats with a a woman who

  apparently believes she is channeling a 30,000 year old

  Cromagnon warrior named ""Ramtha?""

A: After amassing an impressive small fortune (just like

  numerous TV evangelists do), ""Ramtha"" now has the means to

  produce his own films, promoting of course the theology of

  Ramtha.

There is one twist in this however.  The theology of this new-age nonsense isn't directly in your face.  Instead, a compliation of various prominent scientists from numerous fields spanning the gamut from quantum physics to neuroscience is presented.  In and of itself, the interviews are interesting, but they are sequenced out of context and manipulated to present the idea that we with our conscious minds shape and determine reality and our individual destinies.

How Wonderful.

Except for one thing.  What happens when my vision of the future is opposite yours or otherwise mutually incompatible?  But ""Ramtha,"" being 30,000 years back from the future does sure know alot of all this new-age science.  I didn't realize that quantum mechanics and cognitive neuroscience were part of the standard neolithic educational curriculum.  Who'd have guess, huh?

I'm surprised this warrior's name wasn't more repeatively syllabic, like Bambam, ramram, or poopoo, as I think would have been more appropriate.

The only thing more insane than a middle age woman presenting herself as a medium for a supposed Cromagnon spirit is that people are actually buying into this garbage.  P. T. Barnum was absolutely right: there's a sucker born every minute.",1116979200,18,1654,5.171102661596958

I had similar experience as what Amanda in the movie, though... the movie has drawn the character change of thought patterns/beliefs in a very dramatic process.  In reality, I know the breakdown of my thoughts and beliefs was very fast (well, because I was on the edge of either letting my life go permanently or to breakdown the entire thoughts and beliefs which causes the depressive moods), but it has always been the two steps forward and one step backward process.  And yes... I am diagnosed as clinically depressed.  I am so glad that finally someone is using arts and science to create this beautiful piece of documentary about how powerful our thoughts and beliefs can control our lives, our own world.

This whole movie merges science and spirituality to create a new reality about what thoughts and beliefs can do to our own perceptions of reality.  The first step is we become aware of our emotions, aware of our thoughts and beliefs... This awareness is like us becoming the scientist in our mind and soul.  Only when we become conscious being aware of and accepting the existence of our both positive and destructive thoughts within ourselves, can we turn/return that energy to gentle love and compassion.  The reality described in the religions forces our mind to live in the mental prison, while the truth is that religion was supposed to be the gateway towards spiritual freedom.  The best thing is that we always thought our past is going to carry to our future... Only realize it will only be true when we are stuck in the unconscious patterns of thinking...  When we learn, when we heal from the seemingly unbearable painful experience, can we truly create a new dimension of reality, a new dimension to live.

NOTES:  The only two notes are as follows:

1. Open your heart and mind... even you have the tendency to pre-judge

When watching the movie, you might want to let the movie inspire you than pre-judging what these researchers say.  These people study the quantum physics topic for years and we can only give them the credit of their work by opening up mind and heart to listen... If you decide later what they say makes absolutely no sense or you disagree, that is ok... but please open up your mind to understand and to listen... so that you get what you pay for the DVD.

2. Set realistic expectations about the change of thoughts and beliefs

Inner transformation (change of thoughts and beliefs) is a two step forward and one step back process.  Amanda's mind seemed to be healed so dramatically in the movie and it is not the reality.  I was put in a pretty life-threatening situation... and even with that push, it is still a two step forward one step back... one year long therapy to reach the state of mind that is more conscious than my last 24 years of life.  Having the intention, the persistence to change is a good start.  Having the commitment and constantly inviting love and compassion are the keys to explore the unlimited growth potential.

Many of the questions raised by those being interviewed are thought provoking, and explore the possibilities that quantum physics has brought to our universe. The theories are fascinating, as they imply that our inner world influences our outer world, rather than the commonly thought reasoning that we are creatures of our environment, but some the answers range from excellent to ludicrous. The biggest ""red flag"" entry in the nonsense category is the statement from Dr. Candace Pert, who claims that Columbus' ships were invisible to the natives because they had never encountered ships before, and were not able to see them until their shaman revealed them. It would be interesting to compare the size of the dugout canoes used by the natives, which were huge, and Columbus' ships, which were very small.

As psychiatrist Jeffrey Satinover states in his interview concerning reality, ""Anyone who spends too much time trying to explain it is likely to get lost in the rabbit hole,"" and this is what tends to happen, including many cookie cutter responses on religion, and questionable theories on morality.
The good part of this film is that it challenges the meaning of existence, and if it leads anyone who has not already done so to ask ""who am I and what am I doing with my life ?,"" and to further their knowledge of quantum physics, the film has been a great benefit, but there is a danger that the scenario of Dr. Pert's mythical natives and shaman will be repeated, wrapped up in a New Age package, with Ramtha (who is channeled by J.Z. Knight in the film) at the helm.

198486,1,1582704708,"This is one of the sorriest attempts I have seen, recently, of attempts to make a metaphysical superstition into a viable world view.

First off, people, regardless of quantum physics, the world really exists. If you don't agree, then there is no point in talking to you, as you don't exist either. I, too, like the ideas of solipcism and skepticism, but there are certain a priori acceptances that are required in order to function in this world. One is that reality exists, independently of us. If you want to play the quantum physics game, do so at the quantum level. Quantum physics was never intended to be used to describe real-world (observable) phenomena. It was intended to explain things like wave-particle dualities, and other phenomena that are invisible to the majority of us in our daily lives.

Furthermore, the research cited is, as usual, blown way out of proportion. Think Spider-Man II out of proportion. While it is true that you can shape your reality (to a certain extent), you cannot consciously control the neuropeptides that your hypothalamus releases. Nor should you, if you could. People don't realize that our bodies are finely tuned, and throwing them out of whack just causes them to throw themselves the other direction, in order to restore equilibrium.

Perhaps the most egregious example, though, is the idea that water has a memory. This is a laughable concept, as water (as a liquid) is a jumbling mass of rapidly forming and breaking hydrogen bonds between the molecules. Writing ""ANGER"" on the side of a water bottle will not alter its molecular structure. Perhaps the good doctor added a seed crystal or two to a saturated solution that INCLUDED water??

Nevertheless, this was an irritating movie, and a poor attempt to claim that quantum physics allows us to choose our reality. If we could, I would choose to survive by photosynthesis. I would like to be green colored, and become independent of my heterotrophic nature. Unfortunately, the REALITY is that I lack the genes for any type of photosynthesis, and I shall forever be relegated to eating other organisms. Too bad.

I give it one star. Further, I suggest that you swallow a fork instead of watching if, if you are that bored. Either way, you will be experiencing a significant amount of discomfort, and you won't be happy until the entire ordeal is over.

198487,1,1582704708,"IT IS one of the unlikeliest hits in cinematic history: a documentary exploring the weird world of quantum physics that confounded its subject matter to spend three months as one of America's 25 highest grossing films.

What the Bleep Do We Know!?, which opens in Britain on Thursday, is poised to overtake Super Size Me as the most successful non-fiction film not made by Michael Moore. Fans of its New Age message linking science and spirituality include Madonna and Drew Barrymore.

It also has been ridiculed by physicists and psychiatrists, who say that it hijacks science to promote dubious and even dangerous misconceptions about the nature of the Universe.

Simon Singh, the physicist, science broadcaster and author of Big Bang, said that he despised the film for twisting science to suit an agenda. ""It claims to be about quantum physics, but it makes gross distortions that would make any self-respecting scientist squirm,"" he said.

Professor Raj Persaud, a consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital in London, said that he was alarmed at one of its central suggestions: that positive thinking can replace medical treatment for disease. ""That is a very dangerous message,"" he said.

The film tells the story of Amanda, a deaf photographer played by Marlee Matlin, an Oscar-winning actress, who is depressed after a marital break-up. She gradually overcomes her anxiety through a series of bizarre encounters that prompt her to question her ideas about reality. Her spiritual journey, which ends with Amanda throwing away her medication in favour of positive thinking and drawing love hearts on her body with mascara, is interspersed with a commentary from serious-sounding academics and mystics.

These experts explain some of the odd ideas of quantum mechanics - such as particles existing in two places at once - and claim that these show perceptions of the physical world to be subjective and provide a scientific underpinning for personal spirituality.

In one sequence, Amanda views photographs of water crystals allegedly altered by messages taped to their bottles. Phrases such as ""thank you"" and ""love"" produce beautiful patterns, but ""You make me sick, I want to kill you"" generates an evil-looking mess. A bystander then supplies the film's key message: ""If thoughts can do this to water, what can thoughts do to us?""

Only at the end of the film are the identities of the talking heads revealed. One is John Hagelin, a perennial presidential candidate from the Natural Law Party. Another is J. Z. Knight, who claims to be channelling a mystic known as Ramtha, who died 35,000 years ago in Atlantis. The most authoritative physicist in the film, Professor David Albert, of Columbia University, has since distanced himself from it, saying that he spent five hours explaining to the film-makers why their ideas were wrong.

British scientists who watched a screening yesterday said that What the Bleep Do We Know!? is misleading and potentially damaging. Several passages - such as the altered water - provoked them to laugh at its implausibility.

Professor Persaud said: ""It's an attempt to hijack science. Its obvious flaw is a complete absence of data. I am particularly concerned about the scene when the lead character throws away her medicine. This New Age idea - that you can throw away your medication and think yourself better - is a very dangerous message.""

Paul Stephenson, a physicist at the University of Surrey, said: ""The film is quite a lot of fun, but it is a mix of believable and unbelievable science and it would be easy for someone to pick up the wrong ideas.""

Tim Evans, a theoretical physicist at Imperial College London, said: ""This film is dangerous because it exploits people's genuine desire to understand the big questions then gives the answers the veneer of science.""

Jim Al-Khalili, a physicist at the University of Surrey, said: ""It will get people thinking about quantum mechanics, and then they'll find out that a lot of this is a load of rubbish.""",1116374400,27,4013,5.0621212121212125

198489,5,1582704708,"this documentary answered most of my questions in an hour about where we stand in life. It explained pretty much everything. People have actually been saying the things in this film for years - anything is possible, you can achieve anything you put your mind to, you have control of your life and it's surroundings, if you believe, it will happen. the proof isn't just in this movie itself though. while watching this movie, you should listen carefully to what everybody is saying and reach your own conclusion from there with your own thought; let your mind unwind.

it also goes to tell you how your personality and emotions effect the world. example: the world today is full of hate and anger and that's why everything is so messed up these days. if you give out a smile you get one in return, right?

so many answers are here! why pets and kids see things we dont, why your friend may feel cold and everybody else is comfortable.

but the best part of this movie is how they explain that we are all one. that we are god's children, we're all equals, we all share the same soul and we're not doomed. which also holds proof to sylvia brown's beleifs.

life is what we make it to be. but just watch 'what the bleep do we know' and think for yourself.

note: if you really are religeous, you WILL find this hard to believe because it opens up a whole new aspect on reality and who god is.

if you watch this just to dismiss what we (the human race) discovered as the answers (or the facts). you're just angering yourself for no reason. just smile, live and let live. enjoy your life for what it is today.

*most examples i've said weren't in the movie. i reached my own conclusions with the knowledge passed to me from the movie. and in no way does the movie tell you to be self-centered or full of yourself. be careful not to misinteprate good advice given to you. it will just led to disaster.",1116374400,5,1895,4.3664772727272725

Oscar winner Marlee Matlin's character Amanda, an anxious photographer, illustrates how we influence our environment with our thoughts and emotions and create our own realities. The producer along with experts and authors in neurobiology, physics and JZ Knight who channels Ramtha talk about and illustrate what happens when our cells are saturated with emotions such as anger, sadness and lust and how each emotion has its own neurochemical. For example if we are mostly mad we rewire our biology and become an angry person in an angry world. Our hostile identity becomes an addiction and a magnet for anger and hostility. We create our world selecting life scenarios based on our addictions. Emotional addictions are the same as recreational and prescription drug addictions. If we decide to stop being angry we interrupt the angry neurochemicals and a new identity and habit is created.

One study showed even water shows changes in its molecular design when it is observed or blessed.

Also discussed is the nature of God, spirituality and how everything in the universe is interconnected. Most of the authors and experts agreed God is much more than a separate being that we must worship and please to avoid hell.",1116115200,8,1392,5.017316017316017

198496,4,1582704708,"What the Bleep Do we Know? is an imperfect film but it is a noble attempt to bridge the gulf between Mechanistic science and Vitalist spirituality. It is interesting how many reviews of this film have been low to bad, yet the film managed to carry over in theatres throughout the country sometimes up to an extra month, and it is being bought as a home feature at high velocity. This film initiates a new genre of spiritually-implicated films that has touched the lives of millions in a positive way. Personally speaking, I know of numerous individuals within the US who continue to speak highly of this film. It is a film often suggested to friends and family and is given frequently as a gift. All of this comes in sharp contrast to professional reviewers whose opinions we are asked to have confidence in.

This does not mean one should take every minute of this film presented at face value or accept each point as fact. The film does lack in a few key areas and could have certainly been edited more effectively. Regardless of its imperfections, it is a film that inspires much hope about the reality in which we live, ponders the profound, presents the possibility of a new paradigm and gives the viewer much food for thought.

Many hostile reviews have been waged here at amazon against The Ramtha School of Enlightenment for its involvement in the film ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"". It seems that so many reviewers pick up on its participation and discard many other potential sources of wisdom filtering through this very engaging piece. The reviewers summon cliche terms, such as New Age, or Cult, to degrade an overall noble attempt.

Before I continue, I would add and agree with others that there is a terrible flaw in how the first contact between Native Americans and Europeans is portrayed. However, the use of some reviewers to suggest racism is frivolous slander. In the film's defense, I am not sure the producer did an adequate job at conveying a good point. But he does seem to have a point about one's inability to acknowledge a radically foreign phenomena based on limited understanding. Natives had never seen such vessels as European ships, nor had encountered any human being outside of their world.  It would be much like extra-terrestrials invading our world. It is more likely we would want to think ""Air Force"" or ""Other Nation"" before we would ever dare to consider ""Alien from another realm"". The scene therefore portrays the shaman, the most open minded of the tribe, as the one to interpret what might be occurring. It is admittedly an uncomfortable scene that in the end does not necessarily advance the argument to open your mind.

There are likely two schools of people who will find this film silly at the very least or despicable and dangerous at worst, and then there is one school who will find inspiration and empowerment:

Mechanists are the first school to likely be hostile to this film, that is; scientists who lean towards atheism, chance origins, fuzzy random events that form our reality, and a universe that is in eternal expansion, eventually doomed to fizzle out into nothingness. Mechanistic Scientists will find this film ludicrous for its assertions of fate, possibility and CO-creation. They will blast the film for its mixture of science and Pantheist/Panentheist spirituality. They tend to ignore the fact that most interviewed in the film - with the exception of perhaps two individuals - are renowned and published scientists speaking openly about spiritual implications within the parameters of frontier science, Quantum Physics. Most negative reviews seem to have forgotten that even the most esteemed minds, from Albert Einstein, Steven Hawkings to Carl Sagan, have all expressed belief in a Divine Presence within reality, and have pondered without decisive conclusion, about the essence of Consciousness itself. The Mystery remains. What the Bleep Do We Know? It is better to not be arrogant. It is wise to have the discussion.

The modern Mechanistic paradigm further does not allow for the possibility that internal workings of the mind may be directly connected to that which is outside of the mind, or that the collective prism of consciousness working within all beings - human or not or terrestrial or not - creates the collage of reality in which we live. (suggested reading ""From Science to God"" by Peter Russell which demands a discussion of the nature of Consciousness and further illustrates our limited perceptions of ""universe"" based on our limited sensory abilities). But in the end, ""What the Bleep do we Know?"" It's better to not be arrogant. It's wise to have the discussion.

The second school who will find this film simply ominous are the devout Monotheists. Ironically, what most monotheists are saying about the film - about its alleged cultic influences, its mythological assertions - could be fully flipped back at its accusers. After all, a religion is nothing more than a cult with many more members. A religion asks one to take much of its long-held beliefs at face value, or in other words, rest a lot of seemingly miraculous and supernatural events on Faith.

But religions are not proven realities any more than Mechanistic science or Vitalist science for that matter. They are all possibilities to WHAT IS. Myths about the Noacian Flood to Elija's ascension into heaven on an angel-guided chariot to a vast Demonic realm headed by a demigod named Lucifer/Satan/Beelzebub is just as far-fetched as someone claiming to channel an ancient being from Atlantis. Religious zealots would quickly attack a film like this with, by now, very cliche slander of subversively promoting the transformation of human beings into god/God. But that is a feeble argument based on naivete of the philosophy of Oneness. The Judeo-Christian-Islamic model of God the Almighty separate Creator is not the same cookie as the all-inclusive Pantheistic Totality of Existence-God/dess Co-Co-Creator/Creation. In short, many of the negative reviews herein come from mythological belief itself; that the film has been influenced by a mythological being - Satan.

I personally see the use of Ramtha as a good example of a vastly accepted philosophy of Oneness taught by numerous alternative religions and paths. Ramtha's words echo much of what the Dali Lama, Deepak Chopra and the Church of Religious Science, Universalists, Pantheists and Neo-earth based or Native American paths have to say. This would be the third school of people who find inspiration and empowerment in this sort of film. This school of human beings, that tends to agree with this vision of Oneness and find excitement in the frontiers of what Quantum Physics may very well be saying, is not a trivial, cultic minority group. Instead, it most likely numbers in the billions and surrounds the entire globe.

But, after all, what the bleep do we - really - know? It is better to not be arrogant and it is more wise to be honest and have the discussion.

Interestingly enough, if one would possibly allow themselves to listen to Ramthas words rather than lash out at her use of symbolism (of Atlantis, or of ancient spirits), one might hear some sensible comments being made about reality, creation and man's apparent place in a mysterious universe. After all, Our paradigm has shifted from a flat Earth to a round planet, from the center of the universe to living on the fringes of one average galaxy amongst billions of galaxies. The next logical step, a point made by Ramtha, would be to understand that our species too is absolutely NOT the Crown of this Creation, but a small (yet important) part of a magnificent and incomprehensible reality. By sheer arithmetic alone we conclude in a stroke of faith that there is life throughout the entire Cosmos and that all things, seemingly animate and inanimate are connected as One thing at the most fundamental of levels. But in the end, what the bleep do we know? It is better to not be arrogant. It is wise to have the discussion.

I would completely recommend the review by ""arctelier"" who has thoroughly outlined the major constructive key points made in this film. There is much thought to be discerned from it if you can at all distinguish between what you already know you do not believe.

  Indians not being able to see the ships of Columbus was eurocentric, racist nonsense failing miserably to illustrate the claim that we all "" Create our own Realities.""

When the ships of Cortez arrived in Mexico, it is well documented that they were met by the natives.

  This is an attempt by the New Age movement to justify their beliefs that reality is as you create it for we are all gods.

Deliberate deception, cherry-picked notions in Quantum Physics catering to their world-view, and talking heads all belonging to a school taught, yes by A DEAD SHE-MALE FROM ATLANTIS, adorn this movie in a sad attempt at legitimacey that ultimately fails under the wait of it's own pretention.",1115856000,27,1184,4.726829268292683

198500,2,1582704708,"I rented this movie, and actually enjoyed it, most of it, anyway. I thought it curious that we didn't find out who the interviewees are until the end of the movie.  Most of them, it turns out, are scientists--MDs and PhDs--or academics of some sort, with
either degrees from or positions at prestigious universities.

But one of them is some porcine blonde who, it turns out, claims to be channeling a 35,000 year old spirit from Atlantis named Ramtha, who sees a deep metaphysical significance in the fact that men get erections merely from thinking of nekkid women (really!),  and keeps saying ""You are God.""  This is supposed to be some sort of paradigm shift.  Yeah, paradigm shift my bleep.

So naturally I'm thinking ""What the bleep?""  I was already thinking this when the filmmakers started introducing a strong anti-organized religion smear into the flick, which seemed completely gratuitous and out of place.  So I go to Amazon, and read some of the reviews--people love it, or hate because of the whole Ramtha element (a pretty good reason, in my opinion).  I notice on the DVD page, though, that you can buy it bundled with a DVD called ""Ramtha--Create Your Day.""  Well, one of the guys who appeared in the movie, a chiropractor, kept talking about creating his day.  Seemed like a helluva coincidence.

So I go the Create Your Day DVD page, and it turns out that the director of THIS dvd co-directed the What the Bleep flick.  So clearly there is something  fishy going on here.  So I start
wondering more about this Ramtha chick, and google it up.  Sure enough, there is a Ramtha School of Enlightenment, which naturally sells all sorts of stuff, including membership and retreats and enlightenment.  So it appears as if this movie is some sort of cult propaganda that was slickly marketed, and which a lot of people fell for.  Even, it seem, credible scientists, and actors like Marlee Matlin and Barry Newman.

It's an enjoyable enough movie, I guess, but the fact that these Ramtha-ites, or whatever the hell they call themselves, are trying to pull a fast one on us, is annoying, to say the least.  I have no way of judging how valid the science is as it is presented in this movie, but with Ramtha raising his (her?) ugly head all over the place, I can't help but have my doubts.  Okay, so I admit it, I'm prejudiced against Atlantisians.  Even the decent ones usually have shady relatives.  I especially don't trust the ones over 30,000.

I will say this, though:  Seeing this movie has inspired me to start my own cult.  There seems to be good money in it (check out the Ramtha website if you doubt this).  Whom should I channel, though?  A ditchdigger from Victorian London?  An extra-terrestrial from the planet Org?  A spiritually evolved giant rodent from pre-history?  I'm open to suggestions, and ready to take on partners.",1115856000,26,2849,4.706477732793522
198501,4,1582704708,"I have taken some time to read other reviews and I'm personally empathetic enough to understand where people are coming from on both ""sides"".  I too had prior knowledge of quantum physics before seeing this film.  I too am familiar with the kind of ""minimalizing"" or ""glossing over"" that some ""New Age"" thinkers seem to practice, maybe without realizing it.  Furthermore, I'm willing to agree that it's probably a good idea to consider what the true motivations might be of anyone who is going to profit financially from such an endeavor.

I was raised ""Southern Baptist"". However, my ""beliefs"" about God, and Jesus, etc., etc. have changed siginificantly over the course of my life.  That being said, I have retained a kernel of my earlier religious heritage; the answer Jesus gave to the question, ""What is the greatest commandment?""  To which he (apparently) responded, ""Love God with all your heart and mind and soul and strength and love your neighbor as yourself."" In my current belief system that makes perfect sense, especially if I understand, based on the quantum level ""unity"" of all things that ""God"" and my ""neighbor"" ARE MYSELF!

With this in mind I would like to suggest that within all that is manifested in this world there is Truth.  In fact, Reality Itself Is Truth and although our experience of it may be influenced by our beliefs, whatever Reality Is has Always Been and Will Always Be.

So I recommend staying open.  There may be a ""kernel"" of helpful information in all that we have to experience.  In the process of becoming ""self-aware"" the information that you identify with is equal in value to that which you do not identify with.  In other words, at least within the limits of the concept of individual self, part of who you ""are"" is who you ""are not"".  It may sound kind of corny, but I feel much better holding it all sacred, and blessing Both reflections to me rather than becoming overly judgmental of either.

One of the ""kernels"" that I took from this movie is that, to a great extent, I am in charge of the ""chemical pharmacy"" of my body.  As one reviewer pointed out, that may be of little consolation to a schizophrenic or clinically depressed person and I agree that it is important not to minimize the real effort involved in surviving, adapting to or ""healing"" such mental and emotional patterning.  And, yet, when it comes to those ""patterns, patterning"" if we as individuals, and especially as parents, can help each other learn the dynamics of emotional/chemical self-regulation as early as possible in our lives, then maybe those more extreme patterns might never arise.  If this movie is an inspiration to further consideration and research in this area then, so be it.

As for me, I already thoroughly understand and have experienced my ability to simply choose to Be Happy; or, to put it another (possibly) more ""enlightened"" way, to realize that ""Happiness"" is ""Always Already the Case"" and to Identify Myself With That.  To the degree that I have committed myself to ""Practicing Happiness""; i.e. learning to Be Happy in circumstances that were not inherently pleasurable or supportive of that, I have developed some pretty strong ""Happy Muscles"".  Or, in terms of the film, my neuro-nets are ""wired"" for it now and my cell receptors are adapted to whatever chemicals are associated with that particular Feeling of Being. So it has become easier, and easier for me to Be Happy.

Which brings me to the conclusion of my review and an answer to this review's ""title/question""; i.e. Why are we seeking knowledge?  I would like to suggest, that for many of us, seeking knowledge about reality is also a way of seeking Happiness.  Each time we think we've discovered a new piece of the puzzle, the ""aha"" emotional/chemical starts flowing through our bodies and our receptors are satisfied . . . for a while, and then we lose that feeling and have to start seeking again to get it.

If you are ""Already Happy"", then your life becomes an Expression of that Already Present Happiness rather than a search for it.  No matter how ""enlightened"" or ""knowledgeable"" the members of the ""cast"" of ""What the Bleep . . . "" might be, including ""Ramtha"", from my point of view, they're still ""seekers"" who have not addressed the reason underlying their seeking.  It may seem noble on the surface to seek to ""change the world"", but the bottom line is, it is still ""seeking"".  Whether or not True Enlightenment can come from that is left for each individual to discover for themselves.",1115856000,7,4514,4.776061776061776

198507,2,1582704708,"Mysticism: an attitude of awe in the face of life's mystery.

Magical Thinking: Child-like misapprehension of cause and effect resulting in beliefs that do not adequately reflect reality.

Category Error: The confusion or conflation of one category of reality with another.

A good example of massive philosophical category error is the current New Age favorite, What the Bleep... -  a very flimsy piece of work. Granted the interviews with the physicists are interesting and inspiring, and the exploration of the biochemistry of emotional patterning is fascinating, but the attempt by the film-makers to use over simplified quantum theory to prove a priori magical thinking based, reductionist spiritual beliefs is pretty problematic.

Physics gives us data about the external, measurable aspect of reality. Even quantum physics (mind boggling as it is) is still only able to tell us about the activity of molecules, not about the deep interiority of the human psyche or that grand mystery - consciousness itself. Emotions, meaning, philosophical truth and consciousness are not the domain of empirical science. They are the domain of the internal disciplines like meditation and psychotherapy.

Great quantum physicists like Nils Bohr, James Jeans and Erwin Schrodinger all knew this back in the 30's and 40's when their ideas were being born. They all got interested in mysticism precisely because they realized the inability of empiricism to tell us anything about the great mystery. In the movie this is what the scientists interviewed all share: a sense of awe at the mystery of existence, not a set of magical beliefs. Correctly presented, quantum physics shatters beliefs and leaves one in a state of awe that is a preparation for genuine mysticism. It creates more questions and uncertainty than it does answers and smugness! And genuine mysticism is not science-of-mind based magical thinking. It is based in a sense of awe, a not knowing, rather than the idea that I control reality (internal and external) with my thoughts. The makers of What the Bleep, though, seem more invested in using their thinly presented quantum ideas to imply nave magical relationships like this :

Simply remembering the questionable idea that water molecules can hold the energy of thoughts directed at them, and that the body is made up mostly of water is enough to shift someone out  of an attack of self-hating body dysmorphia and to cure them of an anxiety disorder, allowing them to toss their medication into the trash! Wow.

No mention anywhere of the process of healing, of any practices or therapies. No - just embrace these beliefs, believe in these ideas and you'll be free!

This is a fun and empowering-seeming message to anyone who doesn't actually have these problems. To someone who does have these problems, or has worked with anyone who does, it actually just plays as superficial, trivializing, insulting and alienating.

Even the very interesting discussion of how emotional patterns create hormonal cascades that then cause cells to reproduce with increased receptors for the chemical that generates a certain emotional state, did nothing to propose a way of actually working with that syndrome and left us with the implied new age superficial favorite: you are not a victim, you are creating your own sadness, you can just choose another reality if you want to.

Gee, I'll have to remember that the next time I see a schizophrenic on the street or talk to someone in immense pain over the abuse they  suffered as a child.......

The problem with these types of category errors is that they actually create what Ken Wilber calls a reductionist flatland, either way you perform them....

This is important: It is just as much an affront to a complete view of reality to reduce everything to the empirical realm as it is to reduce everything to the mental/emotional realm. It's only real if I can kick it - is just as incomplete as - Our thoughts create the Universe, which is just as incomplete as - it's all the fault of society.

What the Bleep...is fun entertainment and science lite meets spirituality lite. It might create a temporary buzz, but has little of substance to sustain an authentic spiritual journey.

198511,1,1582704708,"Leave it to Hollywood to take some of the most profound ideas of our time and make a glib study on vanity for the ADD-afflicted American. This movie opens with a stream of sound bites from unnamed scientists (and, we learn later, one channeled entity from Atlantis) speaking of quantum ideas through a grossly over-simplified, New Age filter. The film cuts quickly, never allowing the speakers to explain any of the theory behind their ideas, while bombarding the viewer with music and graphics, as if the viewer couldn't possibly pay attention to mere ideas without a whole lot of other stimulation going on. Meanwhile, in an interwoven fictional narrative, Marlee Matlin plays a moody photographer who wanders through a disjointed story meant to illustrate the film's hypothesis: we are what we think. Halfway through the film her narrative takes over. After I'd been wishing the editing would slow so I could hear more of the scientists' ideas, I found myself wishing the filmmakers would hurry up and cut away from this narrative. Matlin goes to a wedding, filled with thoughts of her ex's betrayal, where, through the lens of her unhappiness, we watch the cells of the wedding participants, portrayed in California-Raisin-style animations, as the people act on their various ""addictions."" At this point the film takes an odd and meanspirited turn: making fun of fat people. An obese man stuffs his face at a buffet, and two young men wander through the wedding crowd oggling women, ""mooing"" at large women while the soundtrack plays the lyrics, ""you're too fat for me."" Finally, Matlin goes home. In the next scene, she awakes and stands in a mirror hating herself, as her hips and thighs (thanks to oh-so-original digital imagery) balloon into those of a fat woman. After an epiphanal moment in the mirror, she realizes that she must love her body or do serious harm to it, so she draws hearts all over herself with an eyeliner pencil. You go girl.

I don't disagree with the fundamental precepts of this movie, but I wish the filmmakers had handled them with more sensitivity and complexity. I find it ironic that one of the scientists admonishes us to live in the ""mystery,"" yet this movie simplifies the ideas of quantum physics until we are left with the usual New Age mantra: you make your own fate. I think that's part of the truth, but I also think life is more complicated than that.

That bleep doesn't help things. But, then again, there is this forceful geekiness to this whole project, it is just so uncool in so many ways, kind of like seeing your parents try to wear low-cut designer jeans, that it almost becomes appealing, because how could anything truly evil and cultish really come off so silly?

As entertainment, this film scores points with me because it is just so astoundingly weird. It has created a new genre, as far as I am concerned: New Age Camp. Because that is exactly what it is. These awkward plotlines, the badly animated sequences involving amino acids, and cells that look like gummy bears, as if Fellini had directed some sort of acid-tinged toothpaste commercial, that kid with his basketballs that kind of has you wishing you really could cross over into a parallel universe just so you can kick him in the head, Marlee Matlin scowling at everyone, bowing under the weight of her oversized camera, and yes, JZ Knight, a woman who claims to be channeling a 35,000 year old sage...I mean, how could you NOT LIKE THIS?!!? It's AMAZING!

Now, look. I'm no dummy. I am sure this movie was indeed financed and created by members of a cult (The Ramtha School of Enlightenment, applications now being accepted!) but who cares really. What it has to say may not lack a shred of empirical evidence, but there's something so innocent about it, so fascinating in its use or misuse of of scientific ideas and theories, that I would say even to the most downtrodden cynic, that this film is worth checking out. And hey, if the concepts being bandied about mean something to you, then I feel that is valid, and if they don't, that too is also valid. I think it depends on the person.

The film is a pseudo-documentary that crosses Quantum Mechanics with some New Age theories in order to demonstrate that we may not fully realize our own reality. It isn't entirely successful in this respect, but then again, it can't be so easily dismissed either, and doesn't deserve some of the vitriol it's been getting on this site. There is also a sort-of-plot that wraps around these theories, that is meant to demonstrate the discission by showing an unhappy woman's cathartic realizations about herself and her reality. The core of her unfulfilled existence, really. This woman is played by Marlee Matlin, perhaps the first woman in cinema to use physics in order to feel better about her thighs.

There are various scientists interviewed who speak about how one can control one's destiny through the power of thought. In the end, you may be somewhat disappointed by the identities of some of these ""experts"", but then again, I think one is meant to detatch as much as possible, and absorb on a visceral level. That is why, I think, their resumes are reserved for the end credits. Once again, if these ideas affect you, then that's valid I think.

The power of positive thinking... An interesting idea, very popular in the Self-Help section of bookstores, but to inject all that with Quantum Theory, is at once both sort of insane, and kind of beautiful. I mean, just try it...Right? Has anyone who has lambasted this movie ever just tried to use some of these ideas in their day-to-day lives and see if it made a difference for them? Maybe it will. Maybe it can. I don't know! But the movie isn't asking for anything more than that (it's not even asking for that) nor does it disguise itself as something it's not. A lot of reviewers seem to imply that, but I disagree, I think it's all about how you, individually, see this movie.

For instance, the bit about the Water Crystals, and how emotional words affect the shape of water. And, therefore, ""if thoughts can do that to water, imagine what thoughts could do to each one of us.""  Now, maybe the movie implies rather strongly that this is a crucial scientific breakthrough. In actuality, Masaru Emoto's work was created as ART, and was never entered into a scientific journal. It was also not a ""double blind"" experiment; that is, Emoto provided the specimen as well as received the sample for analysis, providing what is known, apparently, as ""confirmation bias""--so in effect, it's not a true scientific experiment. It may be presented as such, however you look at it, but the film wants you to absorb these ideas within themselves, and not necessarily seek to prove or disprove them. So in that sense, does it really matter if it's art or science...maybe words can really affect water, and if they can, that's really cool, and what does that mean for us and our consciousness...

The film is shot on location in Portland, Oregon, which looks dreamy and sleepy, and was one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, since I am not familiar with the Pacific Northwest, and didn't know what city all this lunacy was taking place in. I say that lovingly. On a final note, I have discovered an online, up-to-the-minute, self-edited encyclopedia, Wikipedia.org, that for some reason people don't seem to know about. Anyway, on it, they have an intelligent and objective analysis of this film if you want to learn more.",1115337600,21,5268,4.724700761697497
198518,5,1582704708,"Though many notable people from many fields have noted that our understanding of things is limited by our limitations in consciousness, we really can't see those limitations because our consciousness doesn't allow us to see them. The only people that can see them are the few people who have developed their consciousness beyond conventional levels but most everyone else fail to understand what they are talking about since we cannot see those limitations. If you are knowledgeable about quantum mechanics, chaos theory and many other newer theories in science, this movie is a glitzy presentation of these types of things geared toward the general public. Nevertheless, I see two very important implications of this movie. One is that a movie like this gives more people an opportunity to be exposed to ideas beyond their conventional wisdom associated with the dominant Newtonian paradigm that exists today. Eventually, when a critical mass of individuals begin to see these things with a deeper level of consciousness, the paradigm shift will occur. So in a small way, this will later on contribute to the inevitable paradigm shift associated with a new level of consciousness that will occur in the far future. The other thing is that it highlights the importance of always paying attention and being open to new experiences and ideas. The ideas of this movie imply that our understanding is never final. There is no end point. If we think we are fully developed and do not need to learn anymore, this is when our development stops and our problems start. Contrary to popular belief, this is not when we become fulfilled. The understanding that there is more to it than what we see reinforces the idea that we should never stop looking for and appreciate new experiences, new ideas, new things. This mindset is the mindset of the person who continually grows. This is perhaps to me the most important implication of this movie. As Toru Sato in the revolutionary book ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" says, to be truly fulfilled is to always respect and pay attention to everyone and everything around you. This maximizes our chances of being one with everyone and everything else. This is the essence of the ever-transcending nature of our soul and this is the essence of fulfillment. For these reasons, I believe that this movie is well worth a look for everyone.",1115251200,8,2367,4.97979797979798

- The entrepreneur consciously creates his day of what he wants it to be.

- It's the consciousness that drives the machine; it's the ghost that observes.  When we observe, we're no longer the body-mind-emotional person that respond as if the world is automatic.

Relationship

- The height of arrogance is creating God in our own image.

- Nerve cells that fire together -> neuronet that forms long-term relationship (but can be lost).

- Emotions are DESIGNED to reinforce chemicals that define the memory.

- Addiction: because no one had taught you to dream better.

- Sign: give me a sign that there is no doubt that it comes from you.

- ""Positive thinking"": a smear of positive thinking covering a ball of negative thinking.

- Mathematics gives us the possibilities that all these movements can assume (but it's not the highest order.  It's a knowledge.)

Presence/ reality

- ""Reality"": Our eyes can see more than what our brain can consciously project.  The camera does even better, because it has no judgment.

- ""Now"": The way we act now --affect future but cannot see future, see past but cannot affect past.

- Have to be IN THE FIELD in order to play.

- A thought: a concentrated bit of information.  What make up things is an idea, a concept and information.

- When you are not looking, there are waves of possibilities.  When you are looking, there are particles of experience.

- The world being potential strips/timelines of realities -until we choose.

- Heisenberg said, ""atoms are not things, they are tendencies.""

Belief

- Modern materialism, religion and romanticism (preconceptions) strip people of the responsibility to think, understand, trust... Quantum physics (so is internet) -> the world is a very large place, it's big and mysterious, and mechanics /law is not the answer.  It's always not what you thought.

198520,1,1582704708,"Anyone wondering how Democrats lost the 2004 Presidential election would do well to watch this movie as it explains everything.  In its presentation of science-meets-psychedelia-meets-gnosticism, ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" portrays a late modern (bourgeois) liberalism at the height of its discontent, seeking parallel universes to fly to in order to escape the emotional and physical difficulties of the present moment.  The point of this flight is for humanity to reach its fullest potential: the liberal longing for ""ultimate freedom"".

So what exactly is the point of the movie?  Its non-stop barrage of scientific and New Age discussions amid psychedelic effects and computer animations will likely stir discussion among watchers; ""what IS reality?"" is a question that you are likely to hear or, perhaps, even ask.  The premise of the movie, ""everything is not as it seems"", is the premise of every great philosophy and religion, as well as those that fall far short of greatness.  After surveying a certain range of options (limited, to say the least) - quantum physics (""the science of probability""), New Age spirituality and positive thinking - we reach the movie's end.

Ironically, by arguing against certain conceptions of ""the real"" and making a certain strand of science (from the Latin ""scientia"", meaning ""having knowledge"") the lens that we are to see by, we are left in exactly same spot we started from: appearance is still reality!  The issue is what hermeneutic we use to uncover these layers; those ""in the know"", possessing this scientia/gnosis, will see that what things are isn't really what things are, and therefore see them as they really are!  Advocating the superiority of this new position necessitates putting words into other's mouths, making their viewpoint sound inferior, which only serves to validate this new point of view (which happens at the end of the movie against some very childish understandings of religion).

""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" advocates a postmodern, New Age quantum physics as the really real by which we judge everything else.  Hence, we have the basis of a worldview founded on what we...don't know.  Perhaps our collective not knowing is the reason for the constant recourse throughout the movie the quantum physics.  Not knowing necessitates a faith in probability - a faith in faith which we can have faith in..., so to speak.

But what is probability other than an attempt to do something with - an attempt to do something in the space of - an actual absence?  By making a wager on probability, we find ourselves with an unending distance between the space which we occupy and the space which the Real occupies.  What we are left experiencing is the negative infinity of calculus: ever receding and ever progressing, but never finally absent or fully present.  By putting everything in the realm of the probable, we put everything in flux.  Thus, the question is whether or not an ""everything is flux"" view - as ancient as the Sophists, to say the least - can really sustain the development of human potential once the flux the ever-present-but-momentary probabile has long since passed.  In the end, I don't think it can.

Thus, the close of the movie - Ramtha's statement that ""You are God"" - comes across as little more than laughable.  An increasingly fragmented society founded upon the individualized individual may very well hear this statement as the sine qua non of freedom, but it utterly precludes communication: the ""God"" that you are means nothing because it cannot be understood within a frame of reference that you and your neighbor share.  The absence of this shared level of understanding over a concept such as ""God"" (which, in this movie, still represents something beyond where we are even if it is who we are) will only prevent progress as no one knows who/what/where/when... the God that we are progressing to really *is*.

Perhaps what we are best left with at the movie's end is the idea that reality is...probable.",1115164800,12,4008,5.003012048192771

  A chiropractor ( Dispenza ) and defrocked child abusing theologian ( Ledwith ) speak at length on the nature of reality.

  The idea that consciousness creates reality is nothing new in religion, in fact most are based on this premise that a higher being or beings created the reality in which we operate.

In New Age theory, we are all gods creating our own realities based on conscious choices made during one's lifetime.

The fact is Im a deeply religious person, with a very open mind to spirituality and deeper meaning to life, I am highly involved in my spiritual growth, but when you use Charismatic Authority (Ramtha) and tell easily disprovable theories as ""truth"" trying to ""expand your minds"" simply leads to: ""buy more of our cults materials or maybe come to a conference or two, for the low price of......

I am not bashing all new age ideals, to every movement there is some possitivity, but when you capitalise a religion movement (in this case a cult not a new religious movement) you destroy its foundation, and it shows the true character of the leader. Ramtha is in it for the money, point blank. This movement capitalises on Women especially those of previous sexual abuse, offers help, but delivers none. Anyone who seperates you from your family, friends and loved ones, diverts your money and attention to their group, uses people for their own purposes as long as they are usefull to them, and claims to offer you something ""that you cant find anywhere else, this is the only source"".........""just pay us money to learn more now that we have you interested"" does not have your best interests in mind. Wow, I truely cry for all of you.

We live in a mixed up crazy world, and I know your all trying to find direction, or control in a world where you have little, but cults and controlling NRM's (New Religious Movements) have no true solutions, they all lead to the same place, more of the same pain. I doubt any of you who support this movie will truly internalize any of what I'm saying, but know I will be praying that after your path down the wrong road and you suffer because of it that at least you will learn a great life lesson.

Than are dreamt of in your philosophy [science].""

  --William Shakespeare (from 'Hamlet')

It's interesting to note the two overriding tones of the different reviewers for this movie:

1. You have the optimists how are in openness, awe and wonder about life and what it might mean and might hold. They are from a lineage of dreamers who saw before others: oceans as gateways to adventure, who saw men with wings lifting into the sky, who and who saw humans golfing on the moon. They don't think that truths have to come in black and white.

2. Then you have the pessimists (who call themselves ""realists,"") who share a history of whispering doubt into the ears of hopefuls and visionaries (see world history for numerous examples), who once saw the world as flat, who thought flight foolish or sinful and who see slickery, trickery and foolery where others see art, imagination and the seeds of new science. These are people who move through life with a harsh yet invisible filter on that tells them that the world is trying to get one over on them. But THEY won't be fooled; for to be open is to leave yourself vulnerable to being made a fool.

Whether ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" is based in science or fact is largely irrelevant for it tells a deeper truth about humanity and what we are a part of; it is a celebration of what it means to be alive, to be in dance with our chemicals, our environment, to be moved by our imaginations and to be swooned by the myriad possibilities of what the future might hold.

Remember that Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, said that, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Verily, for before we can create it, build it, make it, invent it or do it-we must imagine it.

Lest I fall too, into creating division here, I invite all who have not seen the movie to first have a little pow-wow with the seven year old or the eleven year old in you, the one who once gaped in awe at a lizard or at the thunder breaking sky open to rain, to watch the movie with you. For those of you who have seen the movie and not enjoyed it, then, not for me, not for us, but for you, watch it as you might Star Wars or The Lord of The Rings movies which, though fiction, tell a deeper story of human truth than yesterday's headlines.

Enter Ramtha:

  ""So how hard is it to let go of doubt when you see that you can do the impossible? If you had audience with a quantum physicist who told you about the many-worlds concept, and that you are the Observer, and you are only limited by what you know and what you are inspired to focus upon to have those experiences of time-shifting and timelines, and that you are creating reality, imagine it gets even more glorious. You speak to a geneticist who will say your DNA is prepared to keep you at thirty years old or twenty years old, or whatever age you wish, for two hundred years and beyond. It is already. So you can't deny this. It is science.""

Says Ramtha, obviously brimming over with warm, brown gifts----and in serious need of a bathroom quick!

  In addition to "" Creating Your Day,"" courses, Ramtha offers reconditioning classes for those stuck on a lower realm of enlightenment, namely homosexuality.  Some of his more interesting pronouncements: Aids was created to punish homosexuals, Twinkies hold the secrets of immortality, and when Y2k hits, the communist chinese will invade through Mexico.  As is the case with all frauds, when the predictions prove false, it is explained as being averted through the influence of multiple realities where said act may or may not have taken place.  With that kind of safety net we can all start cults tomorrow and start fleecing the public immediately.  Get on it now!

I applaud the people behind this project for making a very different type of independent movie to tap into the market of DIY metaphysicians and quacks. Great production value and the CGI animation is top-notch. My wife and I had a great time laughing over the animated cells and neurons and peptides. Best fun we had over the week.

OK. Now on to the content. This is a project that ""pretends"" to be scientific when it is the same-old New Age mumbo-jumbo that you can get for ten cents in any bargain store. It begins with Quantum Physics and tells us how the world needs to be redefined. It tells us that we live in a wild, new world of possibilities where reality itself is not static but dynamic. All fine and good. Then somewhere along the line, it suggests that the cheapo New-Age teachings of monism, metaphysical-mind-science-techniques, ""We-Are-All-Gods"", etc. are the direct applications of this same science. In fact, the movie moves seamlessly from the exposition to the application - the result is something that *seemed* to make sense on a casual viewing. But if you scrutinize it a little bit more you'll start to see that all the ""science"" here is merely a smokescreen to give the eclectic-cheapo-mix-and-match spirituality of the New Age Movement a sort of respectability and legitimacy - almost like making it a science!

198543,2,1582704708,"WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW? is an entertaining film to watch; visually, it's quite colorful and it is sort of like watching an interesting PowerPoint presentation.  However, as far as content is concerned, it is entertaining in the same way that watching televangelists is entertaining.  One can imagine throngs of followers bowing down to the spirit of this film and paying great sums of money to participate in the reality that this film creates.  Indeed, one of the film's primary speakers is JZ Knight, the famous mystic, who claims to channel Ramtha, a 35,000 year old spirit-warrior.  Oh!  I almost forgot: Ramtha is also supposedly from Atlantis.  What's the problem?  Beyond the fact that it's complete bunk, she has copyrighted Ramtha and has made millions of dollars speaking at seminars ($1000 a pop), teaching, and from her books and tapes.

But it is not just ""Ramtha's"" presence in the film that put me off as a viewer.  During the film's 90 minutes, a variety of mystical & quasi-spiritual theories are advanced under the guise of science and fact.  While much of the science in the film is accurate, it is the ""interpretation"" of that science that I found incredibly misleading.  For example, it is true that Quantum physics is the science of possibilities.  On a subatomic level, it is true that particles behave in peculiar ways and that we are grappling to understand the uncertainty and probability that seems to infuse our world.  But WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW? takes this fact about the subatomic level and brings it out to a macroscopic level.  Suddenly, my life and the world around me is a world of possibilities.  By thinking ""real hard,"" I can effectively change my life and my reality.

While I believe that our attitudes and mental states can have a powerful impact on our perception of the world, I do not believe this constitutes changing our ""reality.""  I'd like these ""scientists"" to preach their message to the disabled or the mentally challenged.  I'm not so sure that ""thinking real hard"" is going to change their reality.  Sure, it may help them put a positive spin on their condition.  But it's not going to make anyone get up out of the chair.

To hear this movie described as ""one of the most important films of all time"" just hurts my brain.  I would only recommend watching it if you are already into occult practices and extreme ""new-age"" thinking.  While I am not completely closed-minded on these topics, I believe that the conclusions drawn by WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW? are unjustified given the scientific evidence that we have.  Thus, using science to ""justify"" these conclusions is misleading and unconscionable.  Of course, there are those that will claim that the film is just meant for entertainment and that we should not take it so seriously.  Very well.  But I believe that filling the heads of people with false and misleading science is a bad thing, just as I believe that televangelists who tell people who are in debt that if they just give money to the ""Christ"" network, their debt problems will disappear is a bad thing.

Although none of the talking heads (""I'm not really a physicist, but I play one on TV"") admit it, they aren't really as interested in saying anything interesting about quantum physics as they are shilling for the ""Ramtha"" cult. AS it turns out, the latter is the sole reason for this movie's existence.

One of those talking heads is a bottle blond with the fake vaguely European/red-state accent and REALLY heavy makeup (a la Tammy Baker).  The end-credits identify her as ""Ramtha.""  Her real name is J.Z. Knight and she has claimed for a number of years to be channeling a 35,000 year old sage named ""Ramtha"" and asks her followers to pay for it.  (It's a testimony to the desert of American spirituality that so many morons actually do pay her.)  The movie makers hide this, which is telling.

And what is the lesson quantum physics has allegedly taught us?  Everybody creates his/her own reality.  Since most people know that this is nonsense, the filmakers tart the movie up with ""experts"" to deceive you into thinking this is a scientific proposition.  I guess this is so people won't walk out or throw the DVD into the garbage with a glad cry.

OKAY HEAR THIS: Individuals do not create reality; they conform to it whether they like it or not.  The whole BASIS of the scientific method depends on the first principle that reality is objective, so if I get the premise wrong the result will be wrong. In other words, if I'm doing science instead of just pretending like the ""experts"" in this movie, what I'm doing is systematically looking for an objective account of what seems to be, everywhere and always, the case.

I am a big proponent of complexity theory and the idea of the Medici Effect (see Frans Johansson), so it was interesting to note the convergence of the different scientific perspectives.

What was best about this film was the idea, not just of the ""Power of Positive Thinking,"" but how your perceptions and expectations can shape your reality. The one speaker notes that in ""positive thinking"" there is typically merely a veneer of positivness which is an overlay to the morass of negativity underneath. In my own life, I have always lived as an optimist, driving to my future, not letting the little things weigh me down. This has indeed paid off. This film reminds me to not get bent out of shape about those things over which I have no control.

Its message regarding the effect your thoughts can have on those around also resonates - having worked for many years in high-stress team environments, there is plenty of evidence supporting the idea that one person's bad attitude can be infectious. So I am also reminded to be kind to those around me, to live in harmony with self, nature, and others... the central message of many major religions.

Ultimately, whether you ""buy into"" the underlying argument of this film, the directors' primary objective was to stimulate thought and dialogue. That, I believe, this film accomplishes.

Despite what you may read in other reviews, among the experts speaking in this film are physicists, philosophers, theologans. One chiropractor. There is no mention or advertisement of Ramtha anywhere in the film, other than the end credits. If the message presented happens to coincide with that group (I have no idea if it does) it is certainly a universal message of hope and empowerment. The one thing that all the speakers have in common is a willingness to entertain and encourage thought beyond the mainstream, which is, of course where all truly creative ideas originate. This appears to frighten some people, who wish only safe middle-of-the-road concepts to be aired. For the person who doesn't know what ""Noetic Sciences"" are, that is an organization of scientists willing look beyond current paradigms, it was founded by astronaut Edgar Mitchell. This isn't a course in quantum physics, but it draws upon new ideas in physics to make its point.
The film does have some weaknesses in in some of its special effects and it does tend to drone on too much about some points. Does it infer too much from the science of quantum physics, stretching the science to fit its viewpoint? Possibly.  Did it change my life?

To know the ins and outs of how reality is dependent upon you, the beauty of interconnectedness?  You must go to the source!  Not only is Wayne Dyer a modern day prophet, but he's ALL MAN too.

 CD 1: Dyer explains what the field of intention is and what it means to be connected to it. He speaks of the necessity of getting past ego dominance in the meaning of God-realization.

CD 2: Dyer describes the feel of intention and offers a new mantra: ""I want to feel good!"" He also offers advice for bypassing obstacles so that intention can flow in your life.

CD 3: Dyer suggests: ""Contemplate yourself as surrounded by the conditions you intend to produce."" You'll hear tips for overriding the ego in order to align with your Source.

CD 4: Dyer discusses the active/inactive sides of infinity and offers action steps for moving to the active side. He relates the importance of getting past your fears to see yourself as an infinite being.

CD 5: The seven faces of intention are explained: creativity, kindness, love, beauty, expansion, abundance and receptivity. You'll learn the value of practicing nonresistance thinking and saying yes to life.

CD 6: Dyer notes your impact on others when connected to intention and then concludes with the key idea: ""Change the way you look at things and the things you look at change.""

This movie is a stolen hodge podge of Buddhist and Vedic Philosophy, misunderstood QM, and esoteric flap-doodle crapped out of an ancient hairless monkey king.  The acting is terrible, the animation laughably bad, leaving one to wonder how the bleep did they spend ten million on this?",1114214400,45,1216,4.706161137440758
198562,2,1582704708,"I thought this movie was worth the $3 to see it, so that earns 2 stars. However, I don't think it's worth all the positive hype it's getting.

Here's what the movie has going for it:

* Solid presentation of the physical processes / brain chemistry governing emotion.

* Excellent advice given on becoming the masters of our emotions, rather than the other way around.

* A bunch of the move was filmed at the Bagdad. Very surreal and cool to see it in the Bagdad!

* OK, sorry, the lead actress and the roommate character were cute.

* For this kind of movie, I thought the special effects, acting, and storytelling were quite good.

Problems:

* If someone can make a basketball float in midair with their mind, it isn't because of quantum physics. QP does not operate on the macroscopic level.

* Nothing in this movie about Quantum Physics was applicable to the basic message of the movie. They should have stuck with brain chemistry and psychology.

* Several good examples of ""scientism"" - i.e., using supposedly scientific experiments as ""proof"" of some theory. In fact, this approach is patently superstitious (hence the moniker ""scientism""). In true scientific experimentation, experiments only disprove. A positive result does not do anything but fail to disprove. Most eggregious example of this: the ""water photos"" used as evidence that our thoughts cause physical change in our environment.

* Besides the categorical problem outlined in the previous note, the presentation of experimental data did not give enough information for viewers to attempt to reproduce results. This compounds the ""scientism"" in that we are being asked to believe experts, rather than getting our own empirical data together. This is the opposite of science. On its own, this type of presentation might be excusable -- but even Carl Sagan got flak for popularizing science, and the critique he got was in some cases along the same lines, that by simplifying scientific discovery for mass consumption he actually harmed the scientific method. However, Sagan was presenting entrenched and well-tested theories. I have a suspicion that the scientist who did the ""water photos"" is the only scientist who has done those experiments, however, and if that is true, presenting the data as authoritative is a serious problem.

* It is impossible to determine whether the ""experts"" who appear in the film would ultimately agree with the message of the film, with the other experts, or with the various implications made. Some of the experts have solid credentials, and some do not. There are a few edits which make it look very much like two or more experts are in agreement on some issue, when actually they may not be. In fact, several scientists in interviews have since said that their opinions were grossly distorted in editing, to the extent that they felt their views were totally misrepresented. For example, David Albert, who said: ""I don't think it's quite right to say I was 'tricked' into appearing, but it is certainly the case that I was edited in such a way as to completely suppress my actual views about the matters the movie discusses. I am, indeed, profoundly unsympathetic to attempts at linking quantum mechanics with consciousness. Moreover, I explained all that, at great length, on camera, to the producers of the film ... Had I known that I would have been so radically misrepresented in the movie, I would certainly not have agreed to be filmed.""

In the final analysis, I think much of the content of the movie is very worthwhile. Specifically the ideas about perception and emotion, and how we fall into robotic submission to these, and how we can overcome such tendencies. Certainly I thought that the overriding Gnostic assertions, such as that each of us is God, are in line with my own beliefs. However, I was ultimately disturbed by the movie's reliance on falseness and superstition to communicate its message.

Remember, if all possible objections must be overcome, nothing would ever move forward.  I feel this movie was presented in the way it was (Disney-ish almost) BECAUSE QM is so complex.

Yes, there is a bit of New-Age Mysticism thrown in, (of which I am not a believer), and I too found the Indian Story to be poorly thought out, and conceivably a bit insulting to Native Indians, if one was looking to be insulted.

I certainly don't buy into everything in the movie, however, positive imaging and the effects of positive thinking are hardly new Age concepts and have been shown to be of use in many areas, (Cancer patients, basketball..).

That is the point of the movie, to give you ideas to think about, to start as a springboard for the quest for gaining more knowledge of noetics.

As others have said, the movie is designed to induce thought and discussion. And for those individuals in possession of an open mind, (and who are not eager to bolster their own egos at the expense of others), this movie should most certainly accomplish that end.

I found the raging debate about the movie almost as interesting as the movie!  I would like to comment on a few things in response to the criticism logged on this site:

I have heard that the movie was made on a small budget without the backing of big movie studios.  The fact that it doesn't look like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is probably an accomplishment unto itself.

Some of the graphics and style that were criticized as childish, I suspect were intentional.  The editing and narration was very much like Disney's Jiminy Cricket educational pieces we enjoyed as children.  And I would imagine is a really good way to explain ideas in a way that a common person can understand.

For those of you that imply that the movie is self serving promotion for the authors' books...ha!  The makers of this movie are probably more surprised by its wild success than you are.

Perhaps the scientists who have made comments here were offended by the the ""cavalier"" abstractions made from some of the scientific principals.  But, why not?  Don't we frequently use metaphors from one scientific discipline to lend another way of looking at another scientific discipline?  Don't these abstractions sometimes lead to discoveries... or hypotheses that can be tested in the lab?  Also, while we are talking about ""pure"" science... don't scientists debate their opposing theories all the time?

Some of the highly emotional responses here make me think about how people must have reacted to the ""world is round"" concept.

I say, lets not take life so seriously.  Pop some popcorn, watch the movie and think about the ideas proposed.  If you like chocolate, I highly recommend you add a bag of M&Ms to your freshly popped corn.  (It is not scientifically proven to be better, but I like it... and you might too)

198593,1,1582704708,"Words cannot adequately describe how absurd and mind-numbingly stupid this movie was.  I've spent the last half hour trying to will myself into a different paradigm, wherein I wouldn't have wasted 90 minutes watching this insipid drivel, but, lo and behold, it hasn't worked.  Maybe I should try to realign my aura, or reinforce the synaptic connections in the mysterious and apparently evil hippocampus, or, if I buy this crap, maybe I should eat the heart of an unborn baby and dance around in my grandmother's nightie while speaking in tongues.

Within the first few minutes, I realized that this movie would not tell me anything remotely interesting about quantum physics; I'm not an expert, but I have read several texts, and am familiar enough with the field to know that the things that aren't completely made up are taken out of context and applied in ways that make no sense within the theory.

Within the next few minutes, I realized that it wouldn't impart any knowledge in the area of psychology, either.  In fact, it treats the most basic, fundamental, well-understood mechanisms of the brain as if they were awe-inspiring puzzles understood only by top psychologists.  I understand that they may not have wanted to explain the theory behind Hebbian learning, or examine in detail the complexities of the neurotransmitter system, but they do a step less than that; they relegate neuroscience to some sort of mystical pseudoscience.

Another moment later, amid fits of hysterical laughter that anyone could possibly take this movie seriously, brought on by the ridiculous dancing computer-generated cells, which at one point are slaughtered by the red cell-killing machines produced by the hippocampus (in a scene reminiscent of a sick, disgusting parody of ""Saving Private Ryan""), I realized that this movie had absolutely nothing to offer in any arena, at all.  Gratuitous sex scenes, blatant editing incongruities (what color is the parasol in the deaf woman's alcoholic drink?  Oh, I suppose that it's existing as a superposition of pink and yellow, and depending on the camera angle, the viewer sees either one or the other.  Or perhaps, since solipsism reigns, I only think that I saw those parasols), and little interviews with 'experts' abound.  ABSOLUTELY NONE of the claims made, as far as I can determine, have any scientific basis.  For instance, one person is talking about all the wonderful, extremely unlikely things that happen to him on a day-to-day basis, saying that it is because he expects them to happen, and has focused his chi in a more harmonious direction, that they do happen, and that they wouldn't happen otherwise.  Apparently, the scientific method isn't cool enough to be included in this hip, pathetic schlockumentary.  Anyone with any background in research in the behavioral scientists should scoff at the statements this man makes, though chortling is a reasonable response as well.

I'm really running out of ways, at this point, to explain how miserable this movie is.  If you are all-powerful, Ms. Protagonist, why not restore your hearing?  You clearly are bitter about your hearing loss, along with pretty much everything else in your life, it seems.  Oh, but once you achieve oneness with the sameness of your synergizedness, everything's fine, right?  I mean, as demonstrated by Masaru Emoto, around whose 'findings' most of the movie revolves, thought has the power to effect change in the objective, physical world.  Except, wait, on Emoto's site (a pitiful little site - he should have everyone pray for it; maybe it would stop looking so crappy), the photographic 'evidence' is ambiguous, and obviously he carefully chose which pictures to present.  This isn't to discount the possibility of some sort of effect existing, but it is to say that it's hard to imagine anything less scientifically convincing than what he's done.  But again, careful experimentation and reproduction of effects by other scientists is pointless (right?), because that's actually just me feeding my addiction to feeling that sense of satisfaction I get when something makes good, logical sense.  I ought to readjust my addiction so that I gain pleasure in listening to JZ Knight, who is, apparently, an authority on... something.  Oh, right:  manipulating gullible people.

198597,5,1582704708,"'What the Bleep' is nothing short of profound; yet goes no farther than a guess.

First and foremost: Should you see this movie?  Absolutely

Should you buy this movie:  I can't really give you a good reason why you shouldn't. (I have watched it 8 times)

I would break up this film into 3 parts.

Part 1: Quantum Physics

  Now I knew absolutely nothing about Quantum Physics before seeing this movie and as a student of Social Sciences it equally baffled me as much as it entrigued me. By far the hardest part of this movie to get through. (first 20 min)

Part 2: Philosophy and Existentialism

  This is the part of the movie most people are criticizing because of its long winded claims, etc.  Things like god, religion in general, spirituality, and the nature of existence are discussed. However I must agree, they are not completely objective claims. They are statements of fact from people in white lab coats whom, as we know from studies, tend to have more natural credibility. The part about Dr. Emoto's water experiments is sooo wonderful to believe, BUT so lacking in scientific data and has yet to be replicated. Call me a sceptic if you will, but don't get me wrong, its a wonderful and fantastic thought.

  The notion of the 'observer' was covered in length. This 'ghost in the machine' that seems to operate us. It explores Descartes idea ""I think therefore I am.""  Well yes you think... but who or what is doing the thinking ? Such a jaw dropping question, I love it.

Part 3: Inside the human experience.

  This was by far my favorite part. Its very Discovery Channel special and really gets into the exploration of the chemical and microscopic worlds that operate behind the scenes of the human experience.

  The idea that we are all chemically dependant, or attached to a certain state of being is right in line with the identity theory I am presently exploring. It says something profound and honest that no one really wants to admit:  That we are all drug addicts of some sort. On the street they use artificial chemicals, inside our bodies we are addicted to our own chemical processes as a result of habit and years of pattern building. You may be thinking, well, why would I want to watch a movie that tells me I am a drug addict ?  I guess if you have an over-inflated ego and defensive walls then you will ask that. However if you are a student of life, and truly want to get to the root of your own suffering, then pondering this idea  could never hurt you, but only guide you out of self made prisons. At the end of the day, familiarity doesnt breed contempt, but instead breeds liking; even with the things we hate about our lives.

At the end of the movie they bring all 3 of those parts back together for a very 'good feeling', 'warm fuzzy' or whatever you'd like to call it, conclusion.

Summary:

  This movie makes a lot of bombastic claims. I wouldn't be an honest person if I said otherwise. However, quantum physics is currently exploring the validity of a lot of these claims and I guess we will just have to wait and see what comes of it.

  The one thing that came off as an opinion in this movie that as a social scientist, and as a human that lives and breaths in this world, I cannot possibly deny, Is that the body goes where  the mind leads.  Healthy mind, healthy body, and vice versa. Doubt, Fear, Hatred, Stess, Anxiety, Anger.. These are all chemical processes, and all destroy our minds, bodies, and lives; and this movie (through visual examples) shows us how.  Optimism, self-esteem, patience, Compassion, Wisdom, Strengh, these only aid our lives, and bring peace into the lives of others. This movie makes what I just said quite apparent. This is a thinking movie, and the point of the movie is not quantum physics. The point is to be reflexive, and to look at yourself in the proverbial mirror. The POINT Of the movie is to shake you out of the lull that is every day life and point you in a positive direction.  THATS why they made this movie, which is made apparent in the special features on the reverse side of the disk.  Buy this movie and watch it 50 times if you have to. If and when it 'clicks' with you, it will change your life.",1113523200,26,4196,4.468421052631579
198598,1,1582704708,"As an undergraduate engineer who has taken several quantum mechanics courses (and has derived the wave equation for a particle in a box in 3 dimensions), I cringed through this entire movie. They managed to pay some educated people to pervert quantum mechanics into an absurd fantasy.

I was surprised to see the credentials of some of the interviewees, until I figured out the filmmakers' strategy. They would use the professors to state the ""borderline"" BS, like stretching and distorting the statements of quantum mechanics, and use the crazy woman and the chiropractor to say the REALLY crazy stuff (""we are all gods"").

This whole film is a big rip off of the ""Nova"" episodes on string theory, and ""The Matrix"". (They aimed to emulate the profoundess of Matrix 1, but only managed to create the WTF-ness of 2 and 3).

198599,1,1582704708,"This movie represents everything as fact and science, when in fact only a small part is.  The rest of it is a ""metaphysical exploration of the meaning of life"" and that kind of thing.  Basically, people's opinions.  Which is fine - as long as it's clear that opinions are opinions. However, since the people giving their opinions have subtitles of ""Professor of Quantum Physics"" and the like, it'd be very easy for someone without a scientific background to not see where the line between fact and opinion lies.  Which makes this movie misleading.

If you're into new age mysticism, you'll probably enjoy this.  If you're unfamiliar with science and trying to find something to explain it to the lay person, this is NOT it.

An example of what I'm talking about:  one of the ""experts"" that is interviewed for this movie is a 10,000-year old shaman named Ramtha who is being channeled through the woman you see talking.  I'm not kidding.  They don't explicitly tell you that this is supposedly the case until the end credits.",1113436800,54,1024,4.767045454545454

But, this movie sucked.  It was hardly watchable. Then the special effects were a joke.  Not were they only low quality and corny, but does anybody notice the exact same graphics play over and over throughout the film?

Then there's these scholars and mystics who keep popping up and rambling on and on and on about nonsense that they've read somewhere.  The main thing people need to realize are that these are theories, not fact.  Like the theory that there are multiple realities, yes I know there are multiple futures(or paths), which means there are multiple presents.  It's a simple concept, but the way they make it out to be in the movie is that it's some kinda supernatural thing to experience if you have an open mind.  But, like I said, at least it gets people's brains working a bit.

The film does feel like some kind of cult indoctrination tool overall. I was disappointed, because I really expected something grand from the piece.

Despite the *relative* popularity (note the emphasis on ""relative"") of such books, the average person in the street has never read a science book that wasn't assigned to them in high school or college. And those books certainly weren't speculating on the nature of Life, the Universe and Everything based on the implications of quantum physics!

In my own life, awareness of the intersection of science of spirituality has given me a smidgen of additional fuel in my life of studying Christian and Eastern mysticism. So imagine my delight when I learned ""What the Bleep"" promised an exciting investigation into the cutting edge of science and spirituality. Surely there would interviews with people like Rupert Sheldrake, Freeman Dyson, and Larry Dossey!

Well, no, although most of the scientists were well-qualified to speak on the quantum concepts addressed. Strangely, the film undercut itself intellectually by not giving the names and qualifications of the speakers underneath their ""talking heads"" but only at the end. Regarding spiritual speculations, I find Capra, Sheldrake, and Dossey have more depth when it comes to this sort of thought, but the opinions shared may be eye-opening for many viewers who have never considered the inter-connectedness of mind, the universe, and God.

""What the bleep"" has a beautiful visual style, exciting graphic effects, and also gets out of typical documentary mode by creating a small story of a deaf woman photographer's frustrations with life. The ""Polish Wedding"" sequence is hilarious, and might actually have you rolling in the aisles, as it did me!

The disappointment comes, oddly enough from the ""Spiritual Teachers, Mystics, and Scholars"" used. Sounds impressive right? There were only two. One was ""Miceal"" Ledwith, (elsewhere spelled Micheal), former member of the Catholic International Theological Commission, (who retired from Maynooth College in Ireland about the same time he made a private settlement regarding sexual abuse of a minor--see the Irish Times article of June 1 2002). The other was--get ready--RAMTHA! Yes, Ramtha, the absurd ""Neolithic entity"" supposedly channeled by JZ Knight.

Both Ledwith and Ramtha seemed to only be used to bash conventional religion with ""the shackles of restrictive doctrine,"" and in Ramtha's case, assure us all that we are God. Yippee! No need to worry about meditation, service, or denying the ego. Why, I wondered, would someone go to the trouble of sharing the scientific plausibility of mysticism only to undercut it with the bitter statements of a former Catholic priest and the laughingstock of New-Age kookiness?

Perhaps it's because, according to Wikipedia.org, all three filmmakers are students of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. Ultimately this was a long, entertaining commercial. Ramtha will see you now. Keep your ego, but bring your checkbook.",1113264000,53,3005,5.342494714587738

Lots of judgments have been made on this movie by many people.  I don't think a review can do it justice.  I can only recommend for you to give it 30 minutes.  If you like it, stick with it.  If not, turn it off and save yourself the time.

I have purchased the product and intend on watching it regularly just to stay open to the possibilities.  I love the concepts and ideas presented in this movie.  It's been a long time coming.  I can't imagine where we might be in the realms of conciousness 20 years from now.  :-)

198609,1,1582704708,"I thought this movie would be a thoughtful discussion of the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. But as  the movie progressed I had began to have a sinking filling that I was listening to some sort of pseudo scientific flimflam and worse yet cult mumbo jumbo.

Then we get to ""Dr"" Masaru Emoto and his manipulation of water crystals through emotions, whom I have heard of before. I'm sorry but MR. Emoto's ""doctorate"" in alternative medicine from a highly questionable university does not make him the most credible of authorities. Nor does his ""experiments"" failure to observe empirical method help his case. His water test failed to meet double blind standards, repeatability or even impartial witnessing.

But all this got me to thinking about everything else in the film. I did some research on the two other most suspicious aspects of the film the meditation study and a rather frightening women who I only later learned was named J Z Knight.

The meditation study claimed a 18% reduction of crime in D.C. when psychics meditated on the issue. In the case of the study I discovered that the crime rate throughout the study was 15% higher then average despite the studies claim that the rate was reduced. The study is an example of just plain erroneous science and falsification of data.

Before I get too what I later discovered was the heart of the film I wish to note that one of the scientists in the film, Dr. David Albert, has stated that through editing it was made to look like he endorsed these highly questionable claims, when he in fact did not.

now on the the heart of the matter...

Why did I look up J Z Knight you ask. Through out the movie she seemed out of place. A persons work can acutely alter the way they talk. Knight did not sound like a scientist. Scientists have a odd cautious and deliberate tone. Knight sounded confidant and overzealous in her claims, this was coupled with a more careful storyteller's gift for charismatic speech. In short, she sounded like one of those charlatans so often debunked by the James Randi institute. Sure enough at the end of the movie we discover she's a cult leader, well it's not said she's a cult leader but when you've become rich making highly dubious claims about channeling ancient warriors... well you get the point.

A little research turns up that the films creators are member's of said cult as were many of the ""experts"". This is nothing more than a propaganda film for the cult of Ramtha.

198611,2,1582704708,"As a film (or ""info-tainment vehicle"" or ""docu-drama,"" take your pick) ""What the BLEEP?"" is a highly successful product. Whoa! Stop! I've probably offended some people already, but I hope you'll at least stick with me to the end of these musings before clicking ""not helpful.""

Why do I call it successful? It succeeds, better than most vehicles of its ilk, in initializing DEBATE about what in the universe may be ""real"" and what is not, and it takes the idea of Quantum Physics out of the realm of a few isolated intellectual and spiritual think-tanks and puts it before a much broader audience. Just look at the 100's of reviews (and growing) that appear here-- doesn't matter whether you ""love it"" or ""hate it,"" your brain cells were tweaked into ACTION. If you like thinking, and debate, this IS a worthwhile movie-- however, note that I said ""worthwhile,"" not ""good."" However....

That said, the strong-to-extreme reactions by the reviewers here are no more surprising than the extreme responses to Mel Gibson's recent ""The Passion of the Christ."" The material, and the way it is presented ""provokes."" If you perceive yourself as a soft-hearted, new-agey, spiritual bliss-ninny in search of a beautiful existence of enlightenment, you will resonate with the film's premise that you're able to affect your world and ""create your reality"" merely by how you think.... and you will most likely finish viewing it with a nice golden-cloud transcendent feeling coursing through your system. On the other hand, if you perceive yourself to be a rational, practical, down-to-earth, logical, if-I-can't-see-it-or-prove-it-it's-not-real skeptic and scientist, you'll experience this as an agonizing crock of shyghte with not even the flimsiest basis in ""real"" science. Regardless of which side you fall on, guess what? You've been provoked! What was the last film you saw that was genuinely able to do that? What was the last book you read, or film you saw, that provoked you into opening an amazon account JUST to write two sentences to say ""I HATE it!"" or ""It was BRILLIANT!"" (as quite a few reviewers here have done)

A couple of SUGGESTIONS: First, it helps to be able to not be offended by the ""messenger,"" because otherwise you'll be distracted from the ""message."" 35,000-year old oracles have a nasty habit if ""diverting"" attention, a bit like illusionists in Las Vegas. Second, I think it helps to approach ""What the BLEEP?"" with a realistic notion of what you're about to view. This is not a film about FACT, it's a film about POSSIBILITIES. If you're expecting an objective hard-science documentary about Quantum Physics, you're barking up the wrong tree-- in fact, you're not even anywhere close to the forest. If that's what you're looking for, go rent ""The Elegant Universe"" or read Paul Halpern's ""The Great Beyond."" On the other hand, if you're a spiritual seeker, odds are you'll like it and get a nice warm fuzzy feeling and feel validated after watching it.

In either case, please be aware that-- while fascinating and possibly ""enlightening"" OR ""disgusting dreck,""-- WHAT you're watching is basically a well-packaged promotion piece for ONE GROUP'S take on what loosely amounts to ""Noetic Sciences"" and Nonduality. I don't think you have to worry about it being the work of a ""cult,"" exactly; after all, ""CULT-ure"" is little more than the ""cult of the majority paradigm""-- with just as much power to ""hypnotize"" supporters OR dismiss and ostracize those who don't embrace its views as any outlandish tiny specialized group.

I wish I had the option to give this film a ""no rating"" response, because how I want to rate it depends entirely on my approach. I have no investment in whether it is ""good"" or ""bad,"" nor do I care whether anyone else ""loves it"" or ""hates it."" That said, I AM really glad I saw it, and I am recommending it IN THE CONTEXT that it has the power to trigger (most) people into examining their *existing* paradigms and their reasons supporting such a paradigm; as well as the ability (even if only momentarily) to make us ponder if things, perhaps, are NOT entirely as they seem. If we remove the distracting overlay supplied by Ramtha & Co. and look at what is actually BENEATH... we're left with such questions as why BILLIONS of seemingly rational people pray every day and swear that ""it works."" What makes it ""work?"" Where do ""science"" and ""spirituality"" begin and end?

Final thoughts: I give ""What the BLEEP?"" 1/2 star for ""scientific concepts,"" I give it 3 stars as a ""New Age/Spiritual"" primer, and I give it 5 stars for its ability to inspire thinking and generate lively discussion... discussion of a topic we don't often get a chance to talk about, namely ""What is reality?""

198612,2,1582704708,"I don't hate this movie. Actually I admire its intentions, which I believe were to increase happiness and spirituality. They're not such bad intentions, really.

I have the same problems with this film that many others have already written: it is full of bad science, verging on deliberately misleading representations of scientific theory. The filmmakers interwove bits of real quantum theory with huge chunks of metaphysical elaboration on similar themes. This movie should have a disclaimer warning viewers that it is a metaphorical lesson on the power of positive thinking and that it isn't pure science - I kept wondering how many of the speakers believed what they were saying was pure science and how many were speaking metaphorically.

The lesson is that if you decide you're happy and that you're going to have a great day, you'll be happy and have a great day. This is true for so many good reasons that I am surprised the filmmakers felt they had to try proving it using quantum mechanics and a whole trailer full of misleading pseudo-science. For those that don't know: quantum theory applies to subatomic mechanics only, and while it does attempt to explain that an observer will always influence any quantum particles observed, it most certainly does not infer that an observer's ""intention"" alone has any influence on any scale of reality.

The one element of this movie that really hooked me was a brief discussion of perception and reality and how unique each person's individual reality can be. The filters our mind puts on our observation of reality makes my perception of a thing different than yours. My mind can't fully process an observation of something I don't already understand and believe, but once that understanding is realized the observation becomes obvious and clear. The allegory of the island natives being unable to see the fantastic clipper ships on the horizon because they had no previous experience with such things is a perfect example of what's mixed up about this movie: They treat the metaphor as reality. The idea that the islanders could only see the ripples caused by the ships, but not the ships themselves, until they could wrap their minds around the IDEA of a ship is obviously a metaphor. Yet why does the filmmaker insist that it is literally true?

It is true that you can't see what you don't believe. Seeing is believing, but even more truly you can say believing is seeing. But your perception is just between you and your mind, and it doesn't influence my reality until we interact. Sure, an island native seeing a clipper ship for the first time may not understand it. He may think it is some kind of animal, or perhaps just dismiss it and refuse to see it out of disbelief, but it wouldn't be invisible. Our personal experience of reality may vary a great deal from person to person, which is a psychological topic I found fascinating, but unfortunately the film touches on it very briefly as some sort of proof that your observation ""makes"" reality, and then moves on to less interesting topics.

But like I said, I don't hate this movie. In a very real way it is probably helping many people out there improve their lives. Love yourself and be lovable. Believe things are good and they are. Let go of those addictive vices, the drugs AND the drama, and you will experience a better life. All of these lessons are true, and if someone believes every word of this movie they will most likely live a better and happier life for it, regardless of the bad science.

The fact is that it will probably be the most outrageous ideas this movie takes seriously that will propel it above a cult foray into physics vs metaphysics. Da Vinci Code, Celestine Prophecy, Deepak Chopra, and now What The Bleep. If it just said positive thinking will make you happier nobody would be interested, but suggest that physicists all over the world have stumbled upon proof of spirituality but you just haven't heard the news yet, and all of the sudden everybody is talking about your movie.

But don't take it too seriously. People want to believe in things, and this is just another religion. The friend who told me I ""absolutely HAVE to see this movie"" because it changed her life will have something else to hope is real next year, and another the year after that.

This movie is all that and worse.

I don't know where to begin explaining on how many levels this movie fails, is amateurish, transparent, and jaw-droppingly simple.  But I'll try.

The casual viewer, or even the discriminating viewer who bothers to watch the final credits, would not be blamed for failing to realize that this a propaganda piece... nay, a publicity kit in movie form, for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment.  One must spend a few minutes Googling this quagmire to learn that. Every one - EVERY ONE - of the talking heads in this film is shown without credits, curriculum vitae, title, nothing.  At the end, in the credits, we see some sketchy resumes.

Go online ([...]) and you will see that each of the people portrayed as uncredentialed experts in this film are ALL shills for the Institute for Noetic Sciences, which itself is a front for a woman named J.Z. Knight who, although having a name more suited to that of an east coast rapper, is the current physical embodiment of an Atlantean warrior, some 35000 years old, named Ramtha.  Naturally...

And I can't help but forget to point out that the hand-wringing chiropractor so often featured as a talking head in this film, one ""Doctor"" Joseph Dispenza, utters the word ""mediocricy"" which is, in fact, not a word.  At least not in English.  I assume he meant ""mediocrity."" He was speaking to the subject of how we empower and enrich our lives through positive thought and visualization, and that he sees so much evidence in his day-to-day life that reinforces the fact that what he believes and thinks manifests itself in his reality.  Apparently, he doesn't visualize proper diction and grammar.

To call the followers of Ramtha and the Institute for Noetic Sciences a cult would be to do a disservice to genuine hardworking cult members.  I have absolutely no use for these people and their tripe.  At its best, ""What the Bleep"" is a distilled, dumbed-down version of a few really good episodes of PBS's ""Nova"" and at its worst (which is most of the time) it is pretentious infomercial drivel dressed up as hifalutin' philosophy.

It just goes to show that anybody with a story (no matter how utterly preposterous) presented with flowery language and an authoritative voice will not only find listeners, but suckers who will turn into full-on believers.  Provide some flashy graphics and flattering language, and anything is acceptable.

I had to shut it off after 45 minutes and asked for a refund from the video store (and got it).  This thing only gets one star because I can't rate it with zero stars.

I do enjoy a good scientific documentary when one comes along, but let's not confuse things, this isn't a science documentary. Not even a little. It's really nothing more than a New Age propaganda film, with ""pop scientist"" there to throw about serious theories of Quantum Relativity as if they're part of some greater explanation for the mechanics of our consciousness. Not only is that a dangerous area to wade into in the normal world, it's even more so when discussing the Quantum universe.

Quantum mechanics isn't a pseudo-science, but watching this film, one would think it was. In fact, Quantum Physics sprang into existence to try and explain the fundamental anomalies we found, when Einstein stood up and said, ""this is relativity, deal with that.""

Over the past twenty years, writers and philosophers have attempted to catch up with the theories that science is putting down at a phenomenal rate, giving rise to no end of New Age pseudo-science ""self help"" books.  Pardon the pun, but this film is the logical conclusion for those groupies of ""Quantum philosophy.""

And yet, what about those ""empty spaces"" between the drops? Between the H and the O? Little doors that open to other realities...doors that open to other doors, to other dimensions... Death may be another dimension? Angels and ""ghosts"" may live in other dimensions. The Kennedy's may have never been assassinated and Hitler may have won the war in dozens of parallel dimensions... But I digress, for in actuality, in this reality, this film never touched upon these issues.

Here's what I think:  Ramtha is indeed a real spiritual entity.  But he doesn't want to lead you somewhere wonderful, he wants to lead you to eternal separation from your Creator.  His quote about it being ""arrogant"" to assume that it would be possible to sin against God is a pretty impressive display of deceitful genius:

""God must be greater than the greatest of human weaknesses and, indeed, the greatest of human skill. God must even transcend our most remarkable-to emulate nature in its absolute splendor. How can any man or woman sin against such greatness of mind? How can one little carbon unit on Earth-in the backwaters of the Milky Way, the boondocks-betray God almighty? That is impossible. The height of arrogance is the height of control of those who create God in their own image."" - Ramtha

My advice: be careful.  Keep an open mind about Ramtha, just as this film recommends that you keep an open mind about other things.  Skeptics:  are you sure he doesn't exist?  New-agers:  are you sure he has your best interests in mind?",1112659200,10,1311,4.623376623376624

We've eventually come to understand that the Earth is round and not the center of the universe. Time to challenge current conceptions of reality [not to mention God] and evolve again! Galileo is a hero, Columbus wasn't a nutter, and string theory might have something to it after all.

What is being presented in this movie isn't exactly new information. Divergent, yet relative theories are being presented  with the understanding that you, the viewer, have the last word. It is NOT simply the power of positive thinking. It is, however, an invitation to live with the understanding that you can influence your existence and you should start exercising that power. It is a presentation of an expanded view of 'reality.'

People are not very open to ideas that run contrary to their view of reality. The film does an excellent job of that.

However, if you've ever wondered ""there's got to be more to it than this,"" then this is where you start to explore that possibility.

I do not claim to know everything about this topic (as there is so much to learn), but I know the difference between science and pseudoscience.

This movie felt like one long introduction for a movie about Quantum physics--""experts"" kept explaining how amazing and weird quantum physics is without ever actually explaining it!  There was no mention of the double-slit experiments, Schrdinger's cat, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, etc.

As a university student of psychology and physics, if I wanted to explore these theories on that level I would read up on it or take class on it. It makes no sense to me for reviewers who are familiar with this science to put the movie down because it is dummed down for an audience who isn't familiar with physics or psychology. If it weren't generalized as it was, it would only appeal to the minority of science students; and if it were more developed(as some suggested it should be) it would probably have to be at least 12hrs long. The science in the movie may be generalized, but it is accurate enough for beginners of these topics. Maybe not completely accurate to scholars, but again, to appeal to those who are unfamiliar with this science it must be general. I wouldn't explain these theories to a high-school freshman in their most complex form; instead, the theories must be necessarily generalized to give them a sense of the topic. This movie gives that sense, and I think it captures the humbling experience and sense of mysticism related to learning about advanced physics and psychology (as I have experienced them again and again). Those academics who expressed a dislike this movie because it is below their level of knowledge remind me of several Phd's I know who have practiced criticism to such an extent that it is like breathing to them. I agree with the statements in the movie that indicate that imagination does not need to be an enemy to scientific inquiry. May I remind all those overly-critical scientists out there that every scientific theory or model is incorrect and never all-encompassing. Every good scientific theory must be falsifiable, and will be falsified as time goes by. You would think that these alleged scientists would know that, as it is learned on day one of any introductory science class. Again, maybe these intellectuals have heard the word 'falsifiable' so many times, that they have forgotten what heck it means.  I am sure that even the greatest scientists have had to revise their schemas of how the world works as they evolved through their understanding of science.  In fact, this is the very nature of scientific inquiry as it has evolved over time!  (for some reason, it also seems natural for rigid scientists to overly criticize any ideas that are not widely accepted, instead of presenting their own ideas; if any)

I liked this movie.  I am not stupid, and I happen to be well-educated by a scholar's standards.  I don't think movies are supposed to teach us anything we don't already know.

198645,2,1582704708,"""What the Bleep Do We Know"" is almost tragic. Slick and modern-looking, the film's stylish trappings are completely undone by its meandering theme, that both science and religion seek to provide an answer to the meaning-of-life question. That their central hypothesis is true doesn't stand in the way of the directors (plural, always a bad sign) and their guests who, in that confident, wide-eyed new-agey way, do everything they can to obfuscate the message along the way.

And what guests. No namecards nor job titles are provided until the end, and you're left to wonder ""oh, this guy's a Quantum Physicist. Oh wait, no, he's an endocrinologist. Wait, no he's a relationship therapist."" Sooner or later this becomes ""aaahh bogus, he's a LIFE COACH???"" Actually the whole film works this way - it's promoed a bit like the Quantum Physicist's rebuff to Nova's excellent ""The Elegant Universe"", professor Brian Green's intro to String Theory which has its own tendency for flash and tongue-in-cheek. But before long you realize that ""What The Bleep"" has a LOT more fish to fry. Poorly.

Not that everything it does is done poorly. The first third in particular has some highly impactful moments, like the story of the Indians who couldn't see ships approaching their New World, because such a sight was beyond comprehension. The film makes good points about the relative emptyness of the universe, and about the tendency in Quantum Mechanics for particles to appear and disappear (Steven Hawking's ""annihilating particles""). Without even naming it, nor adequately explaining it, the film does manage to gloss over Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the basis of much of the film's suppositions.

So what the bleep is this movie, anyway? A science movie, a dramady? A self-help guide? A new-age manifesto? Really hard to tell. It's not a complete waste of time but can't really be taken seriously on its face. ""The Elegant Universe"" is a much better choice if you want an introduction on how Strings and Quantum Mechanics affect the chaotic subatomic world. Steven Hawking frequently makes the argument that science and religion seek to explain the same fundamental mysteries in ""A Brief History Of Time"". And there's real science in there too.

Organized religion should be debunked and reworked for innumerable reasons.

198655,3,1582704708,"Newagers take aim at an easy target: the equivocal, ambiguous, and mysterious quantum mechanics.

Film takes advantage of the layman to try to pass off ridiculous ideas such as water-ice crystallization responding to written words and a 35,000 year old being with misplaced hope in humanity, channeled through a blond chick who has bad grammar.

Ad hominem, ok, scratch the latter.

Some of this whacko's ideas are interesting, but nothing profound, and nothing short of faith in humanity as gods rather than the faith in humanity's gods that she dismisses. So what's the difference anyway?

As for the former, no evidence or satisfactory explanation is presented for the case of the ""reading water,"" and the following ""fact"" is misused in this scene.

Blood is 90 percent water, not your body as stated in the film. Your body, by weight, is 60-70 percent water. If they can't get their stats correct, who knows what other stats they are twisting?

In fact, I've read a few critiques, which, not surprisingly, claim that interviews were heavily edited to suit the film's theme.

Talks on quantum mechanics are grossly underdeveloped, leading me to believe they were mainly placed in the film for appeal and scientific authority.

Quantum mechanics doesn't give us hope in life's meaning just because it's a science that can't be conquered. It should make us feel stupid, but these film-makers spin it their own way.

As a college physics student, the subjects brought up in this movie highly interested me, but they didn't convince me that science is anything more than just something to do to quench our curiosity while we're alive. Really, quantum mechanics is not feeding the hungry or curing the sick. One day, maybe a unified field theory will unite humanity in a greater understanding and compassion, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Ultimately, this film attempts to convince viewers that the meaning of life, enlightenment, and the secrets of levitation and  manipulating the world around you are hidden somewhere between quantum theory and philosophy, meanwhile admitting that we don't have any evidence that there is meaning and that there is no God.

Yes, we're scientists, and there doesn't appear to be a meaning to us. We're hopeful, but let's not get pathetic.

After all, one of the film's themes is the counter productiveness of materialism and emotional addiction; but that's just what the film seems to be encouraging - the insatiable desire for continuity.

Well, don't we all just want to be all-powerful gods? Our 35,000 year old Ramtha says we are!

Lingering ideas include the Indians' inability to see Columbus' ships on the horizon, because they couldn't comprehend the idea of these ships. An interesting analogy, even if it isn't true, for human thought processes.

Also of interest is the idea that our negative thoughts produce chemical proteins that bombard cell receptors and cause daughter cells to become more receptive to negative-thought produced proteins and less receptive to needed nutrients. Whether or not this is true I haven't been able to deduce.

For these thought-provoking ideas, even if the truth was manipulated to do so, and the trippy wedding scene, the film gets a rating of 3/5 stars.

For its ridiculous ideas, twisted facts, and total disregard of the real connections between quantum mechanics and existence, I fart in its general direction.

If you must have hope, have on. Sorry I'm so negative.

I'm content in my doubt; that I might be wrong. You, content that you might be right.

Half full, half empty. We're still all only half of a whole that we may or may not ever achieve.

I'm leaning toward not.

Your emotions affect the growth of crystals? (Heck, just writing negative words on the glass gets them to grow funny. Do the crystals speak just Japanese and English? What if a computer prints the negative word?)

And the water purification through meditation prayer - this is probably the most important part of the film as the premise is testable in any home or lab by a third grader.  The swami can purify water and/or change its molecular composition with his meditation/prayer eh?  A friend of mine asked me to visit his web site after the asian tsumani to help purify the water of the victims.

198660,5,1582704708,"Dear Reader,

This is the most awesome film in the history of religion and science thus far.

It opens doors to the infinitely small,to the past, present, and future alive all at once, that we can change the Earth (our part of the Universe) more by intention and attention than by bombs and bullets.

It is a film of hope.

It is understandable, even enjoyable to people with no science backgrounds.

It sings a song to our souls.

It may change your view of God, religion, and spirituality forever. This is not light stuff. If you are safe in yesterday, do not see this movie. It will upset yesterday and do more harm than good to your soul. If you are a seeker of the truth, this renders the glass a little less darkly. Does it have most of the answers to the what, why, and where questions? Probably not. But it is the best start in scores, if not hundreds of years.

I hope other poets, songwriters, and filmmakers take up the thread to weave a rich story for all humanity, a story that transcends religious divides and gives hope that we see a divine energy in  the earth, in the stars, sun, and moon, in the galaxy, in the Universe, known and unknown.

Take courage. See it. See it again. Wonder about it. Go beyond the film to all creatures who possess that same divine spark in diverse measures down to the particle/waves that now drive us crazy because of what they do and how unpredictable they are.

This is the beginning of a Great Age that will turn our human understanding on its head.

Go for it. Love it.",1112140800,11,1520,4.3546099290780145
198661,5,1582704708,"That 50,000 people viewed this film in ONE theater within two months of its opening, aided by virtually no advertising, ought to tell the naysayers that something unusual was in the works.  Word of mouth alone, by far the best advertising, is driving the huge success of this film.  People are seeing it four, five, six times..and more.  I've seen it four times and will screen it again today.  Each time I pick out more things to ponder.  And that, stated by the three director/producers, is precisely the point of the film.

Don't get sidelined by those who tell you to ""take a pass"" or, worse, degrade and impugn the minds and intelligence of those who liked the film.  A Ph. D does *not* make you an expert on anything!

I won't get into the details of the film since that has been done extremely well by others.  I just suggest you see the film with as open a mind as possible.  Let the information simply flow in.  Then go home and think about it.  Or talk it over with others who've seen it.  (You will probably, as have I, want to get the DVD since there is an immense amount of data packed into this film.  The interviews, on the reverse side of the DVD, are also well worth watching.)

This is a truly ground breaking film which opens things like quantum physics to the general audience, making it understandable.  Countless people have written to the makers of the film stating, ""This film changed my life.""  That's reason enough, I think, to explore its possibilities.",1112140800,10,1480,4.503759398496241
198662,5,1582704708,"Before writing a review on this film, I read others. And I realized that, 1) you either love it OR hate it; 2) you have either an open, inquisitive mind, OR a closed, stagnant one; 3) you are an intelligent, thoughtful being who knows there is something more ""out there,"" OR a being--intelligent or otherwise--with absolutely no clue as to the power of (your) `mind over matter' and your world, and/or 4) you are excited and interested in new possibilities, OR your are fearful... dreadfully fearful... of any kind of change or things quantum or metaphysical!

""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" is a brilliant, amazing film.  It moves science out of the oblique and obtuse into the realm of a layperson's understanding... IF you're not afraid of change, or at least of entertaining the possibility of change, and are intrigued by the notion that `thought' itself may be the key of determining just what is possible, this film is a eye-opening mind blower.

I've read reviews calling it intelligent, amazing, and magnificent.  And I've read one calling it insipid, stupid, ridiculous and absurd (that, from a `man of science' mind you, who seems intent on insulting those who might find the film intriguing).

I've learned that when one lowers themselves by bashing someone's intelligence merely because their opinions differ, it is generally fear-based.  Otherwise, why accuse someone of having ""an IQ of a frog"" simply because they enjoy a film?  Since one has to understand a thing to enjoy it (this Mensan not only understood and enjoyed the film), could it be that the angry medicine man didn't enjoy it because he couldn't get through the `understand' part?

As one reviewer recommends, it's wise not to take anyone's opinion as your own.  Because until you experience a thing for yourself, anything you `learn' is just hearsay.

I recommend you watch this film for yourself.  Then, take what you want/need from the film, discard what you don't like/doesn't fit.  Your mind will open just enough to let more light in and you, too, may begin to 'grow' your future just the way you like.

If you are the new-age type, you'll probably love this flick. In my own opinion (and I am not the new-age type), this movie plays a sort of ""three-card monte"" with the viewer by beginning with some really nice science, and then jumping into a religious realm that is basically pure speculation. The transition is subtle; it is not until the end of the movie that you learn one of the speakers is not a speaker at all, but the spirit of some dead dude(!) being channeled through that speaker.

The film does, however, demonstrate that there are scientists out there that retain their religious beliefs despite being a scientist, I suppose that could be good for some viewers (but not this atheist!).

So- if you have a surplus of quartz crystals around the house, this movie is for you. If your Myers-Briggs test came back INTP, however, I would stear clear (LOL).

At least 20 minutes is wasted on a surreal wedding scene which wedded biochemistry, theoretical physics, some drunken Polish folks and a new sort of Super Positivism. And all the while the real meat of Quantum Mechanics and theoretical physics was merely hinted at.

198665,5,1582704708,"I've been a documentary fan for much of my life and have to say that this film is a rare gem.  It ranks among my all time favorite documentaries.  It's informative and keeps your attention and the visual effects were excellent.

The first part of the film delves into the world of Quantum Physics without showing a single mathematical equation!  The first questions in the film revolve around how one defines reality, why we are here, the nature of matter and how we fit into the whole scheme of things.  I was reminded of some of the things I learned in my Physics courses in school such as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Priciple, the notion that atoms are not things but tendencies and some other ideas from quantum mechanics.  When I was taking Physics as a Math major, I focused more on the mathematical theory and solving problems than the external ideas such as those presented in this film.  This film really showed me that one doesn't have to know an ounce of Math to love, appreciate and learn a great deal of high level Physics.  The next part of the film focuses more on biology... the mind, thoughts and how they shape us and our reality.  The notion that the mind doesn't know the difference between what the eyes see and what one imagines is a very fascinating fact to me.  This has so many interesting ramifications!  Matter is simply a moment of consciousness, hence the phrase ""mind over matter"".  The part about emotions being holographically imprinted chemicals which are addictive was the most impressive part of the film to me.  If you are skeptical about emotions being addictive, consider this: the drug heroin uses the same receptor mechanizms on the cells that our emotional chemicals use.  So emotions are not just psychological but bio-chemical.  I've got to read more into this fascinating subject!

The thing that I really like about this film is the fact that it underscores the notion that we are our own greatest enemies.  If we want to be successful in anything in life (i.e. our jobs, relationships, families, money, etc.) we must start from within each of us.",1112054400,10,2089,4.726519337016574
198666,1,1582704708,"Ok. I think I've got it. Happy people are healthy people. Quantum physics and metaphysics have something to do with each other, at least according to neohippie types who work for Maharishi University or channel a spirit being named Ramtha. And Marlee Matlin is desperate for work.

""What The *%&$^ Do We Know?"" wants to be a profound, life-changing film. But then it goes and does things like cast a videogame-ish red blob (let's call him Mister Hormone) in a Robert Palmer-esque ""Addicted to Love"" video. It wants to be an intellectual and scientific exploration of Big Questions, like ""Is There A God?"" But then it smacks you in the face with inexplicable scenes like Marlee squeezing toothpaste on her bathroom mirror screaming ""I hate you."" (What the &%^#@ was that?) It wants to dabble in phenomenology, ontology, epistemology, and be taken seriously. But then it implies that if we could all just change how we think and live in an emotional isolation tank, we'd never ever get old, and we'd never ever die. Because aging is, like, you know, a cellular thing, and cellular things are small, and small things have particles, and particles don't really exist, at least not in one place at one time, so time is an illusion, and age is a function of time, which doesn't exist.

Or something.

""What The Bleep Do We Know? is part advocacy (although what exactly it's advocating remains a mystery to me), part sophomore health class filmstrip (with better special effects), part interview compilation (with a few folks who seem to have recently escaped earth's orbit), and part Leonard Nimoy's classically kitschy 70s series ""In Search Of...""

This, er, documentary (a term I shall apply loosely, because hey, all matter is mostly empty space anyway, so it's gotta be loose, right?) tries hard. What Marlee Matlin has to do with it all? Less than clear. But sure as I'm sitting here (wait, am I really sitting here? Aren't my electrons zinging in and out of existence into another universe?) there she is, the Oscar(r) Winner, gamely delivering her lines, shooting baskets with an other-dimensional inner city kid and photos at a wedding full of lecherous men. Meanwhile, her life crises are explained (sort of) by a series of talking heads with one thing in common; a penchant for using multisyllabic terms to avoid actually saying anything sensible.

Chemical clouds, cellular memory, tendencies/probabilities, neurons...frustrated viewers who want a more coherent, cogent exploration of the same themes would do well to find a copy of the 1990 film ""Mindwalk"" which transforms many of the same principles into a three-way dialectical conversation based on the  philosophical work of Fritjof Capra (sort of ""My Dinner With Fritjof"").

Where I come from, when heads start talking in a documentary, they are promptly and properly identified. After all, audiences like to know the credentials of the ""experts"" they're being asked to trust for two hours, and I've never seen a film that flouted this convention--until ""What the Bleep."" If you stay (awake) through the end credits, you'll figure out why. The most quoted ""scientist"" in this film turns out to be...wait for it...a chiropractor. Sitting in front of a fire. Not that there's anything wrong with chiropractors. Or fires. Heck, I like a good neck cracking as much as the next girl. But. Still.

Yet another head sits in front of books; it teaches (?) at Maharishi International University, an institution founded by the Beatles' guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi for the purpose of advancing the cause of Transcendental Meditation (and, one might speculate, the accumulation of cash in the Maharishi's coffers).

Yet another head sits in front of cacti; I don't recall where he teaches, or claims to.

But the most impressive head of all (really!) is ""Ramtha"" (credited as ""Himself"" at the end of the film). Who, exactly, is Ramtha? ""Ramtha the Enlightened One, Lord of the Wind, lived once as a human being 35,000 years ago in the long-gone continent of Lemuria...in that lifetime he addressed the great questions about human existence and the meaning of life...When he decided to finally leave this world he ascended in front of his people, which numbered two million, promising them he would return. Remnants of his life and teachings exist in various archaeological artifacts from India and Egypt, as well as ancient Hindu literature."" (For all this and the opportunity to buy his Autobiography, Google up Ramtha and JZ.)

For this film, Ramtha seems to have borrowed a head to do his talking from JZ Knight, a psychic who channels him. (Note to self: Check to see if JZ Knight and Tammy Faye Bakker have ever been sighted in the same room; possible they are same person...)

One of my grad school professors--I apologize, I don't remember which one--once insisted that quantum physics should never, EVER be invoked outside of a particle physics classroom. In retrospect, s/he was right.

It's hard to fault some of the general feelgood new-agey conclusions of the film. Don't live your life a pissed-off emotional mess; it'll hurt you. Eat right, exercise, and don't get addicted to anything. (The entire lexicon of ""Addiction,"" as used in this film, is a bit shaky, but that's another topic entirely.) The mind can hurt the body; it can also help to heal the body.

But these are things that most people, no matter what long-dead ascended master they revere, already believe. Where's the life transformation in that?

Final verdict: A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and a little knowledge plus a 35,000-year-old lemurian ascended master is a recipe for bad late-night television. Which is precisely where this film will doubtless one day find a permanent home.",1111968000,65,5726,4.993704092339979

(Yeah i know it's bad enough to be fiction, yet hey never explain this fact to you while you watch her go off about love and spirituality, you have to do research to find his out.) Anyway, this woman claiming to be ramtha paid the filmakers to make this film based on the findings and studies at her or I mean his school of enlightenment.

I went into this not knowing that is what it was, until i did research.  Still not knowing this I did not like the film.  It's a quasi doc with a bunch of interviews (from people we know nothing about until the end credits when we are given their titles and why Ramtha believes they are important.)  The interviews are intertwined with a shallow little story of a woman played by Matlin who is a photographer depressed with her life, and her story is basically just used to illustrate the points they are making about meta-physics and existentialism.  They also include really bad computer animation as well, which comes to a crashing hault during a horrifically bad wedding  scene that is so bad it made me cringe.

Overall this is a trite contrived piece for people looking to fill their meaningless existence with make beileve stories of ancient ressurected Yogi's possessing the bodies of heavy women sharing their ""knowledge"" of Nothing.

It was actually way above any expectations that I had about it. I was told that it is a documentary on Quantum Physics, which it is, but it goes way beyond that with a story line and animation to get the point across to those of us who need visual reinforcement.

The flip side of the DVD is really great also with interviews of the Producer, Writers, Directors, Actors. Really interesting info on the making of the film. I have never seen Marlee Maitlan so animated and alive as she was in this interview.

I hear people gritchin about this and gritchin about that ie they didn't define quantum physics good enough, gritch, gritch, gritch.  Well guess what?

198669,3,1582704708,"If you're looking to have your mind blown for an hour and 48 minutes, check out ""What the #$*! Do We Know?,"" a documentary about, of all things, Quantum Physics, the place where science and New Age mysticism meet and find common ground.  Quantum Physics, the study of what occurs at the level of sub-atomic particles, deals with such issues as what is reality, what is matter, what is time and space.  The film addresses these topics mainly through interviews with top scientists and thinkers, who manage to keep the discussion reasonably coherent for even scientifically illiterate persons like myself.  They discuss in lengthy detail the existence and nature of God, the structure of the universe, and the ways in which the elements that make up the human mind and body create the feelings and emotions we experience on a daily basis.  It's all very ""out there,"" but fun as a brain teaser, if you go in for that sort of thing.

The film itself is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of its overall quality.  It is at its best when it focuses on the scientific and philosophical complexities and ambiguities of its subject matter, and at its worst in the scenes involving Marlee Matlin as a professional photographer looking for meaning and answers in the world around her.  These segments are not only, on the whole, poorly acted, but end up reducing the far more interesting hard science to feel-good New Ageism.  Meanwhile, directors William Arntz, Betty Chasse and Matthew Hoffman flood the screen with computer-generated graphics - of wormholes and psychedelic doodads and thingamabobs - that are exactly what one would expect from a film on this subject.

Still, despite its shortcomings, ""What the #$*! Do We Know?"" provides some food for thought and a bit of nourishment for the soul...not a bad little smorgasbord at that.",1111795200,15,1826,4.826923076923077

About a year ago on a visit to the US to The Monroe Institute, my friend implored me to go the cinema with him and see this film. He raved about it, saying it was one of the best film/documentaries he had seen in his life. With a recommendation like that, who in his right mind refuses?

Sure enough, by the end of the week I'd seen the film three times...

So, what's all the fuss about?

What The Bleep!? is one of the first films to reach a 'mainstream' cinematic audience with the new message - science and religion are coming together as mankind continues with its quest to answer the riddle of the universe. The refreshing change is that science is opening up its perviously firmly-held doors and letting in a few old 'enemies' - spirituality and religion. This new paradigm has been predicted by many including Nostradamus, and is happening around us as you read this. Anyone who picks up copies of Nature, Scientific American or Time will indeed see it for themselves, and those who note the success of novels such as The Da Vinci Code will see that the worm is turning..

.

Back to the story-at-hand, this feature-length film cleverly presents a docu-drama story of a mute photographer (played expertly by oscar-winner Marlee Matlin), who gradually questions her own existence, judgements and view of 'reality', with mixed-in narrative from some of the worlds most cutting-edge scientists, physicists and biologists. These eminent experts shed light on 'what the bleep is going on' at various points of the story from the viewpoint of 'science,' taking the viewer on a clever journey of understanding and realisation.

The combination is very powerful, and the whole film has a multi-facted approach of fact, premise, humour and contemplation. It not only keeps you engrossed, it also really, really makes you think... And then think some more... One of my favourite narrators in the movie is  J.Z. Knight, a lady who (purpotedly) channels an ancient Atlantean being who goes by the name of Ramtha. People may scoff at 'channellers' but the words of wisdom that are shared will make you think on a different level. People who still scoff would do well to investigate this lady more and open up their minds. Thought-provoking and challenging. Great stuff!

The experts hit you hard from many angles, and (without spoiling the content of the film) they gradually build up a picture of what they surmise is 'going on' based upon their own professional expertise and that of the greater scientific establishment. Joyfully absent from this movie are the 'flat earth' scientists who can be so frustrating to today's wisdom and knowledge seekers (whom these days are so much more intellectually advanced and better informed) - these people are movers and shakers in their respective fields, the books produced between them easily able to fill a bookshelf or two in ground-breaking reading!

This is a great movie. Not perfect by any means, but a real visionary prod into the Ether from the brave filmmaker Willian Arntz who kept to his guns like a dog with a bone in order to get this film out to the public.

Get this movie.

Watch it lots of times.

Do your own research into the many threads it will show you ,and build upon your wisdom and understanding.

Show your friends. Show your neighbours. Get them to buy it too and spread the word.

As anyone who is keeping up to date with today's scientific 'breakthroughs' knows, Newtonian physics, Darwinism and many of the ingrained scientific precepts that we were taught in school are now being eroded away, and replaced with a new paradigm.

All is not what it seems at first, and this film is a great start to help people understand that humanity is really not quite as right as it thinks it is....",1111622400,14,3780,4.765696784073507

Yeah, yeah. I know all about the metaphysics of truth and certainty. I know about chaos theory. I know about quantum theory and its implications on our perceptions of reality. I've read it all before. This movie was far from mind blowing.

Quantum physics is the physics of possibilities....in quantum physics, there is a .00000001% chance that you can walk on water, but you would have to try for an eternity to achive it.....in quantum physics anything is possible, but many possible realities aren't probable.....

Also, light is both a wave and a particle....which means our reality is waves of possibilities until we examine it with our eyes and find it to be particles....

Lots of scientific concepts are taken to an abstact level in this movie, and with a basic knowlege of physics it makes for a very fun journey....

I found Ramtha to be the least knowledgeable speaker by leaps and bounds....but she does have a basic knowledge of physics and human biology that she uses in conjunction with new age concepts....but sometimes she just babbles and tries to sound profound.

It covers too many concepts at too rapid of a pace to discuss specific concepts....",1111449600,20,1066,4.861878453038674

198676,1,1582704708,"I have always liked Marlee Matlin, so it was a bit of a disappointment to see her appearing in this foolish New Age clunker.  The film's philosophical themes are presented in a superficial, ""Gee whiz, isn't this impressive?"" style without presenting any of the topics in a way that would encourage substantial thought, or even a genuine sense of wonder, on the part of the viewer.  Especially confusing are the frequent references to ""quantum physics,"" because even though they keep repeating this as if it were some kind of mantra, at no time do they ever say anything ABOUT quantum physics, or explain why quantum physics would be relevant to the subjects of this film!  They just keep mentioning the phrase ""quantum physics"" for no good reason that I can discern.  A confusing diversity of topics is presented with little or no attempt to relate them to each other or to provide a unifying theme for the whole.  The plot of the story involving Matlin seems to touch on the philosophical interviews in only the most tangential way, so that nothing in this film seems to have much to do with anything else!  The philosophical commentators are mostly physicists and medical scientists, though why in the world such scientific credentials would be relevant to philosophical discussions of the nature of consciousness and reality is unclear.  The most ridiculous thing by far is the inclusion of J.Z. Knight.  It is impossible to take seriously any philosophical discussions that involve a woman who claims to be channeling a 35000 year old mystic from Atlantis.  I mean, really.  And the commentators are given to making hieratic pronouncements instead of trying to cultivate a spirit of inquiry and humility in the face of great mysteries.  These fools may think that they have it all figured out but I really doubt that they do.  Much of the philosophical discussion consists of impossibly extravagant generalizations, such as the claim that nothing exists except our own perceptions, etc.  Adoloescents may find such ideas to be engaging, but adults who are sincerely interested in deep inquiry, and in transcending conventional perceptions and conventional ways of thinking should avoid this cheap New Age knockoff and look for something more substantial.",1111449600,81,2258,5.053908355795148

As they say after the movie on the DVD they are only looking at questions regarding this issue.

I don't take much stock in some of the other reviewers that rate this movie really bad.  I think the bad reviewers are of the science or very religious nature for obvious reasons if you see the movie.  Besides, all of the research I have done on quantum physics states that it is without question, different from regular physics but that they can't even measure it because they don't have the means to measure the effect on atomic anything, so how can someone of science say it cant be true.  And to the people that condemn the Ramtha School of Enlightenment, how you would know about that school unless you had been there or have some other type of agenda.

198681,2,1582704708,"What a personal disappointment! This movie had very little to do with what I was expecting when I walked into the theater. I was looking forward to a big summary of the latest findings of quantum physics as relating to alternate universes and the nature of our reality. What I got was a routine New Age snow job. When New Agers refer to science to justify their ideas, there is a fundamental misconception they love to use. They take the uncertainties of quantum physics on a subatomic level, with it's well known interaction of the observer and the particle observed, and apply it to our macroscopic world. Just as the observer affects the subatomic particle being observed, so can we affect the macroscopic world around us by the way we observe it and believe it to be. NO!!! The physics principles of the subatomic world DO NOT apply to our macroscopic world. But the New Agers love to delude themselves and us into thinking they do. Thus, the premise of this movie falls apart.

There is another angle this movie takes. It points out how our perception of the world around us depends on our physical perception mechanisms, the physical wiring of our brains' synapses and our brain chemistry. They seem to imply that alterations in any of those things alter the reality around us. NO!!! They present these brain facts as if they're profound new revelations, but this is very old material to people in the scientific, medical and psychological world. Only the people in the uninformed general public are blown away by this stuff.

This movie does seem to have it's own agenda. I trust you've already heard about its close connection to J. Z. Knight and her Ramtha. Other reviewers have dealt with this connection well. Read their reviews.

This movie will appeal to people whose brain wiring innately craves an alternative to our present rotten reality, and who crave much more power over our reality than they currently have. I can't blame them. But the sad fact is, it WON'T happen! You can't mix the subatomic and macroscopic worlds.

This movie is full of amazing information that is uplifting, and empowering to the human mind and spirit. I found it to be somewhat complicted and confusing with the main theme(quantum physics), maybe that's why this is the kind of film that needs to be seen more than once to be fully  educated by it. This movie covers a wide range of studies including science, the mind, human behaviors, God and religions,and spirituality.

In this documentary style film, Marlee Matlin plays a photographer dealing with frustration and self-loathing, because her past is still making her depressed most of her waking moments. She encounters people that triggers her emotions and how she learn to become a better observer rather than to judge a situation directly. Throughout this film, various professionals were interviewed on science, quantum physics, and philosophy. I particularly can relate to the causes of depression, emotional malfunction which causes a person to be self-destructive. It's really true that how we think inside can change how we look on the outside. It will definitely be helpful to anyone who had lost a grip of their true selves and regain the best of their body, mind, and spirit.

Marlee Matlin is very impressive and mesmerizing at times. She had endured quite a transformation emtionally and spiritually. I also thought Ramtha's interview on spirituality and God was profoundly wise and enlightening.",1111276800,9,1636,5.029520295202952

They repeated the same opinion over and over. I expected this to have some explaination of quantum physics (like Elegant Universe), followed by at least a connecting and cohesive point of view derived from quantum physics. Instead, the producers made the science seem too incomprehensible for ordinary people to understand it, so they didn't explain it.

  Personally, I found that to be a far more intriguing question than any other raised in the movie.  I rented this, based on some of the more positive reviews here, and expected to be provided with thought-provoking science.  In actuality, the movie provides just enough scientific buzzwords for the new-age ""experts"" to tie into their dribble and make it appear as fact.  That said, they weren't all bad...a brief review of the panel (forgive my not going back to research their names):

  Best ""Expert"":  The guy that reminds me a little of Richard Dreyfuss and sits in front of all the library books.
  Best Runner-Up:  The Indian fellow.
  Worst ""Expert"" (by far):  The lady that looks like Sally Struthers wearing some sort of bandleader uniform, with an accent (from Ancient Atlantis, I guess???) that seems to come and go.
  Worst Runner-Up:  The guy that looks a bit like George Carlin, and makes loose proclamations.

  So, at this point, you are probably thinking that I am a closed-minded fact-hunter.  Nope.  I am a spiritual person, but the spritual and religious aspects of the film actually offended me more than the rest, specifically these viewpoints that it presented: A) if you think that Jesus and/or God are better than you, you are wrong; B) If you think that God has a personality, or any opinions whatsoever, again, Wrong!

  So, based on the film, I guess the real question is ""Do *you* think Marlee Matlin has a cell phone?""  Or does *she* think she does?  Or maybe she both does and does not, in billions of parallel realities.  Oh, Who The Bleep Cares?!?!?!",1111104000,28,1747,4.75503355704698

It was refreshing that these ideas are translated into terminology that is acessable to Western psychology and modern science.

The presentation had many favorable elements to it. I like CGI as much as anyone does; and modern cinematic styles are wonderful vehicles for artistic expression.

However, the movie did go too far in some parts. The dance number that arose from the alcoholic Bacchanalia the protagonist found herself in was irritating and ridiculous. At times, the movie's pacing went too fast, or lingered in places that seemed to overemphasis ideas to the point of irrelevance.

They misunderstand and misinterpret tonnes of physics ideals and ideas. Schroedinger's Cat takes a bow, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle also is wildly misconstrued...

I found the entire movie an amorphous mass if ideas with no one coherent and cogent argument one way or the other. I found myself wincing at the misrepresentations of Quantum Physics more then concentrating on what the muddled vertex of the presentation might have been.

Is it another 'pro religion' piece, an agnostic tale or a cleverly hidden atheistic work is apparently open to discussion.

Its a hybird film, part documentary, part science lesson and part not so believable angst ridden photographer's story. The story script is over acted and the ""Mary Poppins"" like personality of the photographer's rather surreal roomie is a bit over the top.  JZ Knight's channeling of Ramtha is also a bit of an annoyance, especially when She drifts in and out of his British accent.

Its also about time that science and spirituality join forces and transcend the age old conflict where the likes of Galileo, Martin Luther, Charles Darwin, and others disturb the religious order with their thought provoking questions that religion can't answer yet science strives towards.  This film presents many complex ideas in easy to understand language, using often humourous animation to illustrate their points (my personal favorite being the cells that are personified in a way similar to the 1990s Disney remake ""Flubber"").  I do agree with most of the ideas presented, most notably that what we think determines our outer reality.  For me, a profound moment while watching the film was seeing the animated illustration that if we change our thinking, we break the chain of thought from being built in our minds that our past experiences will be endlessly repeated.  They don't have to be, if we recognize it for what it is...a learning hurdle.  Until we move past it, we are doomed to repeat past experiences.  Amazingly simple.

What I don't like about the film is that it looks like it was made by people with Attention Deficit Disorder for people with ADD.  There is too much ""busyness"" on the screen, and quick cuts from image to image in split seconds, which I found very distracting, as my attention can stay focused for a long time.  Such editing style made me antsy watching this film, and I couldn't relax.  The music accompaniment wasn't any better, as it was new agey trance music (the pop songs were smartly chosen, however), that sometimes played too loud to hear the person speaking, and distracting from what he/she was saying.

So, for this film, I would say that the ideas presented and the intention of the filmmakers, I'd give 5 stars, but the presentation, I would give 2 stars.  I liked that Portland Oregon was the backdrop in the story segment, but I found the acting on the amateurish side.  The scenes at the wedding were the funniest bits in this film and great illustrations of the points they are trying to make with this film.  The rest of the acting parts were a bit lame for me, though I did love the final ten minutes of this film.

I'm inclined to give this film a mediocre 3 stars, but what really makes this dvd worth seeing and possibly owning are the special features, which include an outstanding Q&A session with the film's three directors at various discussion halls (though it only comes to 30 minutes, which I found too short), and interviews with the three directors and some cast members.  It's terrific to hear all the people's insights in how they came to make this film, and how this film evolved from the original conception, and what the filmmakers ""intention"" for this film is (to be seen by 100 million people worldwide, which I hope they succeed because our world really needs a serious shift in consciousness).  Watching all of that, all I can say is that I wanted to hear more about the ideas presented.  Perhaps a sequel might be in the future?  If there is, I certainly hope the filmmakers will make their next film less ""ADD"" for those whose attention span can focus on an image or idea for longer than 30 seconds, a minute, ten minutes.  There are people out there who don't need all the distractions and can take the message straight, without flashing lights and blowing whistles.",1111017600,8,3518,4.762767710049423

Sloppy marketing and bizarre 'capsules' about the film placed in the media did not entice viewers to see this film, reducing the fascinating content to perplexing, head-scratching moments of trying to decide what the film was about - religion?, insanity?, anime?, silliness with animation?.

Those fortunate enough to have friends who took a chance on it most certainly subsequently saw the movie when it was in the theatres.  Now that the film is on DVD perhaps it will hopefully be 'accidentally' picked out of the current dearth of available films being released - and what a pleasure that will provide to those lucky grab-baggers!  Now that there is a full resource of reviews on Amazon.com, hopefully more people will find their way into the  mental gymnastics contained in this immensely interesting foray into Quantum Physics.

Not to belabor the content, this is an amalgam of commentaries from physicists, physicians, writers, theorists, and yes, even channelers! (David Albert, Amit Goswani, John Hagelin, Candace Perth, Ramtha, William Tiller, Fred Allen Wolf) all of whom provide the most understandable, digestible explanation of Quantum Physics (the realm of probabilities and possibilities resulting from the fact that since we are all minute particles/subatoms that interact actively with everything else in the universe, we control our own reality, etc).  To pull these myriad facts together in a recognizable (key word, it turns out!) form, the three writer directors have elected to 'demonstrate' the thoughts of these bright thinkers by using Marlee Maitlin as a photographer at odds with her past and present and future and we watch as concepts of quantum physics are introduced to her by a young basketball player, by animation rides through synapses and the universe, by split images through her own lens, by her kookie radical delightful roommate (Elaine Hendrix).

To say more would disturb the excitement of the journey this film provides.  How refreshing that the creators of this little epic have the courage to combine science and 'religion' in a manner that makes thinking about the progenitor of all existence a warm wholly integrated part of ourselves!  The 'take home' message (or at least one of the many) is that we can determine our own reality and thus we are empowered to create a life and world and cosmos that has endless possibilities for positive directions.  Some naysayers condemn this film as a propaganda piece for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment, saying that it is just another scientific religious cult like Scientology.  You be the judge of that premise.

Remember the excitement, the 'a-ha! moments, in college when knowledge became near tangible portions of our minds?  Well, here it is all over again.  This is a film to savour and see repeatedly. It makes me want to find probing books on Quantum Physics just to enhance the pleasure of a couple of hours' stimulation!  Grady Harp, March 05",1111017600,6,3057,5.096192384769539

If you are already very familiar with these types of ideas it like this I was, it will mostly sound like old hat.

STYLE: this is where the film fell flat on its face for me...I felt like I was watching some slick and cheesy training/orientation video that many corporations have new employees watch on their first day.  Cloying and manipulative would be two good descriptions.  Mary Matalin was awesome in ""Children of a Lesser God"" but here I often felt embarassed for her as she struggled to make the best of the hopelessly corny script, it felt so transparently didactic that it reminded me of some PBS late afternoon children's programming.  The cutesy partial animation was especially hard to stomach...ugh!

For a truly enlightening review of this movie, I recommed John Gorenfeld's 9/16/2004 article in Salon.com entitled ""Bleep of Faith"" wherein he exposes a lot of the shaky science the movie is based on (some of the ""scientific experts"" quoted in the film subsequently distanced themselves from it after seeing how their words were taken out of context and distorted) and the shady, cult-like group called the Ramtha School of Enlightenment (on par with L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology for hokiness) which funded this $5M project.

Overall though, I am glad that this film was made and so many people had a chance to see it---it's a shame it was not released in the multiplexes more widely, since it's the people who usually eat up Hollywood mass movie glop who would get the most out of it, rather than the already-converted art/alternative film crowd.

Given a choice between mindless religious fundamentalism and mindless materialistic dogmatism, Ramtha doesn't look all that bad...LOL!",1110844800,15,2382,5.118556701030927

First, there is a meandering narrative starring Marlee Matlin, who is just the cloyingly inane star among a passel of inept performers in a horribly threadbare miniplay. Then, among the directors is a computer graphics geek who renders animated depictions of quantum physics suitable only for a 6-yr-old. Lastly, there's the movie this should've been: a documentary featuring several talking heads on the subject. 2 of those 10 heads are very interesting, but alas they have to share screen time with the rest of this cacophony of ideas.

Heck, don't take my word for it. The Washington Post called it ""strange - and strangely inept""; the New York Times called it ""part misguided educational film, part goofy New Age recruitment effort"", and even TV Guide says that it ""quickly tumbles down a rabbit hole of annoying psychobabble, dubious science and embarrassingly silly animation.""

BLEEP takes the viewer on a thrilling tour of the boundaries of what we know, while introducing us to some of the newest concepts in the field of consciousness. Is it possible that words and ideas can change the very quality of physical matter? Do we really have an infinite range of choices available to us at any given moment? Is it possible that there are things right in front of us that are invisible to us until other people start to see them? BLEEP raises these questions and many more, and provides scintillating answers that raise even more intriguing questions. Indeed, the best way for us to learn what is really going on is to ask better questions... and watching ""What the #$*! Do We Know?"" is one of the best ways to start asking better questions.

""What the #$*! Do We Know?""  tells the story of Amanda, played by Oscar-winning actress Marlee Matlin, who feels like her whole world as she knew it is coming undone, to be replaced by something strange, unknown, and new. Amanda's attitudes and assumptions expand dramatically through extraordinary dreams and remarkable encounters in waking life. Interwoven in the story of Amanda's awakening to fuller realization are documentary clips with fourteen mystics and scientists. These interviews provide a delightful counterpoint to what is happening to Amanda as she considers how she is more in charge of her life and better connected to everyone and everything else than she previously would have believed. When Amanda is given a photographic assignment that requires her to face painful memories from her past, she discovers new ways to view her experiences and a bigger sense of herself that allows her to gain strength, courage and inspiration at a time when she might otherwise have felt sad, small, and defeated. Amanda brings us on our own journey of self-discovery, as we wonder how we might reframe painful memories into life stories that reflect our more heroic, loving nature.

""What the #$*! Do We Know?"" brings about positive life changes for viewers, because it presents a framework for how to reclaim mental, physical and spiritual health even in the most difficult times.

If I could give only one movie to every person in the world, it would be a ground-breaking quantum fable titled What the Bleep Do We Know!?.

Part documentary, part narrative drama, and part visual hallucinogen, this is a film that blows the door off the metaphysical closet. Everyday folks are realizing that they are not alone in contemplating the nature of reality, exploring the convergence of science and spirituality, and yearning for something more to the human experience. In fact, What the Bleep filmmaker William Arntz felt that there were ""millions of closet metaphysicians in America, just hungering for a movie like this."" Movie industry insiders told him there wasn't a market for this kind of innovation, saying that he was committing ""financial suicide"". Fortunately for us, Arntz ignored their discouraging pronouncements-and this gem of a movie ended up becoming a box office phenomenon, largely by overwhelmingly positive word-of-mouth.

What the Bleep Do We Know!? blends interviews with scientists, neurobiologists, quantum physicists, and a 35,000 year old being with live action and wondrous special effects. Oscar winner Marlee Matlin plays a jaded photographer named Amanda who falls down a metaphysical rabbit hole. Through a series of mind-bending events, Amanda is forced to confront what she thought was reality-as well as the source of her boredom, anxiety, and self-contempt.

In light of quantum physics (which, in a nutshell, is the physics of probabilities), the filmmakers explore the concept of multiple realities existing at once. While parallel, alternate universes are the stuff of Star Trek, this concept isn't so far fetched considering scientists have produced a particle of light that exists in two places at the same time. Not only that, electrons and the nuclei of atoms completely disappear and reappear all the time. Where do they go? If this happens on an atomic level, what does this mean for the macro level?

Rather than reality happening to us, as the old model assumed, we are happening to reality. The act of observation...or ""locking into"" something...actually changes the nature of what is observed. The act of choice eliminates all other probabilities. If this is true at the quantum level, how do our choices affect-and indeed, change-reality?

Everything ""out there"" is a projection of our mind's elaborate theater, which is often the result of complex neurobiology that happens ""in here"". With vibrant computer animation and lucid scientific explanations, we are shown what happens when cells are consistently bathed in neurochemicals produced by habitual emotions: emotional addiction. ""If we can be addicted to heroin, we can be addicted to any neuropeptide (emotion)"", says one scientist. Another scientist asserts: ""Who is in the driver's seat when we control our emotions or respond to emotions? We know physiologically that nerve cells that fire together rewire together. If you practice something over and over, those nerve cells have a long-term relationship."" In other words, if you get angry on a daily basis...or feel like a victim...you are literally re-wiring your neural net to the point of creating an ""identity"". The good news is that ""every time we interrupt the thought process that produces a chemical response in the body, they start breaking the long-term relationship.""

So what does this have to do with the nature of reality? It comes back to choice. We create scenarios that meet our emotional needs. This is why many fall into the same type of relationships and dramas: there is a chemical addiction to rejection, conflict, seduction, and so on. One scientist remarked: ""An awful lot of problems that get labeled as psychological really amount to people making rotten choices..."" What is thought of as ""reality just happening to us"" is really a result of consistent choices producing specific chemicals which result in specific emotions that have become a habit. Instead of ""people always sabotage my happiness"", it becomes a matter of chemical addiction to sabotaging scenarios. We draw in from the ""quantum field"" according to our intention, expectation, and (in this case) emotional addiction.

If this is true of the individual, what of the assumptions of a culture? Every generation has many hidden assumptions that history ahs proven to be untrue (such as the idea that the Earth is flat). Many of these assumptions are so ingrained, we take them for granted as ""the truth"".

Asking questions like ""Why am I here? Where am I going? Who am I? What happens when I die?""-the questioning of reality and how things ""have always been done""-help us to interrupt the neural nets. Becoming the ""observer"" (as opposed to an unconscious reactionary) can result in paradigm shifts, ""aha!"" moments, and personal change.

Contemplating a new way of thinking or seeing is tricky, however. A fascinating story that's demonstrated in What the Bleep is that of Christopher Columbus visiting the indigenous people of South America. Because clipper ships were totally out of the realm of their reality, these people could not see the ships on the horizon. One day, the tribal shaman realized there were ripples coming towards shore. He knew that something must be causing those ripples...but what? Day after day he strained to see, until one day, he finally saw the ships approaching. His people couldn't see them, until he described to them what he saw. Because they trusted him, they could now see the ships with their own eyes.

This story illustrates the principle that we can only see in our brain what we're able to see. In fact, we only see what we believe is possible. Perhaps this explains why mystics can see angels and other realities: for them, believing is seeing. Biologically, the brain processes 400 billion bits of information per second, but is only aware of 2,000 bits at any one time-usually information about our environment, body, and time. Just what is the brain perceiving that we are not ""seeing"" or integrating?

In addition to the science of perception and reality, a theologian, Ramtha (an ancient being channeled by J.Z. Knight), and other scientists discuss the nature of God, spirituality, and the interconnection of all things. One of the problems of religion, according to one theologian, is that God has been made into a distinct, separate entity to which we must offer worship, humor, and please-all in the hopes to get a reward at the end of life (not to mention avoiding the frying pan). According to this man, ""this is not what God is. That is blasphemy.""

Ramtha echoes this sentiment with my favorite quote from the movie:

""God must be greater than the greatest of human weaknesses and, indeed, the greatest of human skill. God must even transcend our most remarkable-to emulate nature in its absolute splendor. How can any man or woman sin against such greatness of mind? How can one little carbon unit on Earth-in the backwaters of the Milky Way, the boondocks-betray God almighty? That is impossible. The height of arrogance is the height of control of those who create God in their own image.""

Whether you agree with the ideas presented in the movie is not the point. If individuals at least contemplate an alternative perspective-then this movie will have succeeded. What the Bleep Do We Know!? doesn't tell you what to think, but simply offers ideas and theories for your consideration. At the very least, it opens up a dialogue between people. And, perhaps, if people start talking to one another-especially about concepts like reality, God, spirituality, choice, and human potential-there will be enough cracks in individual and collective assumptions to make way for ideas never before considered as possible.",1108944000,,7834,5.128526645768025

I noticed that most people who have reviewed the movie either love or hate it. It is a sure sign of a very outstanding film, either in the positive or negative way. I have no intention to judge what the review of this movie 'should' be. Frankly speaking, what the bleep do I know, really? So go find it out yourself. One film, 2 extremely different outcomes. Isn't it an interesting phenomenan worth investigating? Our perception determind our reality. I can't help but agree with what the film suggested. And each and every of us, no matter how apart we stand, is RIGHT! ...^_^... Isn't it amazing? How we have been conditioned to think, ""when I am right, you have to be wrong if you don't agree with me.""

I happended to have read 'A Brief History of Time' and 'The Universe In A Nutshell' by Stephen Hawkin a couple years ago. I have just finished 'The Field - the quest for the secret force of the universe' by Lynne McTaggart, one of books recommended by WhatTheBleep movie website. And I have also read many many so-called New Age stuff. Being a Chinese from Hong Kong, I've been exposed to Eastern philosophies. It seems to me that the Newtonian world view, which served the human race well a couple centuries back, has fulfilled its historical purpose. Isn't it time to ask questions about the missing link between the seeming separateness of physical matter and the interdependent nature of quantum particles that are the very foundation of matter?

My personal experience has been: if I am serious about learning, I'm better off being open-minded and let the knowledge be revealed to me. If I just want to prove myself right, no matter which direction I look, there are moutains of evdience to support my point of view. Given its provoking nature, What The Bleep is an excellent mirror to reflect our state of mind. Just for that, I think $8 and less than 2 hours are very reasonable investment to gauge where you stand. It is very useful information to yourself.

Even with the imperfect executions, What The Bleep has accomplished what a movie needs to fulfill. A pebble has been thrown into the water. The rest is up to you.

Did I enjoy the movie?

Yes, a lot. It is an audio book and need to be 'read' many times.

Will I recommend it to others?

Definitely to anyone.

Is there any pseudo-science involed?

From someone who came with an open mind and a ignorance to JZ Knight or her cult, the message was still very clear, very profound, and very thought provoking. It made you think about the world around you and how you interact to it.

It definitely had a huge dose of humor; I found myself laughing to the point of tears. But, most importantly, the documentary tied science and spirituality into a very neat, non trite package that everyone will understand and might actually want to study up on on their own.

I think this is one hell of a movie.  I have had the pleasure (pain?) of being strongly indoctrinated by several different powerful groups in my life:

!) Catholicism - youth

2) Scientism - twenties through graduate school

3) Materialism - throughout my life, anyone who lives in our culture is totally indoctrinated after several years of watching TV alone.

I have examined carefully the tenants of each different group.  With an open mind, I have determined that ALL points of view have some degree of truth in them.  The trick is to approach all relative points of view with an open mind.  I have experienced some of the phenomena that the movie describes.  These experiences plus rational thought allow me to accept some of the basic tenets of the presentation as being ""true"" for me.  It is no small truth that some of the greatest scientists of all time are spiritually minded people who could easily be labelled ""New Agers"" if you were to read their philosophical ideas.  For example: Einstein, Huxley, Descartes and the list goes on and on.  Small minded scientists with small ideas proudly and plentifully pontificate on a plethora of concepts for which they have no experiential and no philosophical nor intellectual capacity to judge the concomitant ""truthfulness"".

I agree that it's pure cack to believe that JZ Knight channels a 35,000 year old spirit, and I know that there is a direct link to the Ramtha group (which they openly state on the website). But, uh, nobody is forcing you to join the ""cult"". Rather than wax (pseudo-) intellectual on how much you know about quantum physics, or slam the entire message because you don't like the messenger, you might want to listen to some of the core themes of the movie.

Anything that touches on the infinite or spirituality will get a rise out of people. And certainly anything that tries to tie spirituality to science will no doubt get those on BOTH sides in a nice lather. So I suppose it's no surprise to see some negative reactions.

Don't like the filmmakers? Fine by me. Think it was a poorly made film? Hey, cool and the gang! But some of the core themes in the movie include treating ourselves and others with respect, understanding that, in some way, we are all connected to each other, and that the universe is a benevolent place. Wow, that's some pretty scary cult-speak, isn't it?

Believe nothing without scrutinizing it first; discount nothing without having on open mind first. I thought the film was excellent, and I haven't moved to Yelm, WA yet.

198727,3,1582704708,"I have seen the film multiple times. The discussion about addiction, emotion, the hypothalmus, and chemical messages sent to our cells is right on. This mind/body connection is very important for everyone to understand, and the filmmakers have done an excellent job -- through interviews and a fictional story -- to get that point across. In short, I recommend this film.

On the other hand, the attempts to somehow link those topics to quantum physics is an utter train wreck. There is lots of innuendo of a link, but no rigorous explanation is ever provided. And, if you watch closely, you'll see that it was the Chiropractic who makes the assertions about ""infecting the quantum wave"" (whatever the heck that means) -- not the physicists.

I also think it's telling that there is absolutely nothing in the movie -- or on the website -- explaining the fundamentals of quantum physics. The dual-slit experiment is not that hard to understand; I have explained it to many people in 10-15 minutes. With animation, the film could have done it easily in 2-3 minutes. Anyone with a high school science explanation can understand the basics. And while the mathematics of Feynman Diagrams is pretty atrocious, the concept that they convey is quite comprehensible by civilians. And John Gribbin's books -- ""In Search of Schrodinger's Cat"", etc. -- are all quite competent in their explanations. Why are none of these books listed in the bibliography on the website?

I come to the grim conclusion: the filmmakers really don't want people to understand quantum physics. They'd rather have people think it's this big ugly *mysterious* thing. Note the nervous giggles that permeate the theater when one of the physicists says he's the author of the current Grand Unification Theory. But do the producers go to any effort to explain what this means -- even on the website? No!

In short, I think the filmmakers have an addiction to the mysterious. They flirt with the science -- they infect the title of the film with mathematical symbols -- but don't have the guts to acknowledge that their ""examples"" really have noting to do with science. And they never take the first step to explain how quantum physics must be part of the picture that they are presenting (to coin a phrase).

Why does this stuff have to have an aura of mystery? What if the connection between our emotions and our body chemistry was simple and comprehendable? What if our paths to causing the miraculous in the world don't have to have an air of mystery at their core?",1106006400,27,2530,4.833718244803695
198728,1,1582704708,"The movie introduces you to concepts of quantum physics and their connection to eastern and western mysticism.

At some point the movie degenerates and you feel that you are watching an infomercial. Further googling reveals that it IS an infomercial for a cult led by J. Z. Knight (interviewed many times through the film) who believes she is channeling a Seer of Atlantis.

Yes, hyper-rationalism is killing our planet, Yes, we need a new paradigm that admits and gives reverence to the wholeness of reality. Yes, there are deep connections between mysticism and the new physics, but to abuse and over-extend these connections gives a bad name and hurts further developments on this important field.

This movie profits from the general lack of knowledge about quantum physics and distorts its findings and implications through mediocre science and pseudo-science (Like Masaru Emoto's water crystals).

Many of my new age friends loved the movie and thought it was very profound and they are right; the implications of quantum physics are profound; they shake the grounds of the traditional materialistic world-view, but... this doesn't mean that there are telepathic communications with dead people from Atlantis.

Anyway, the movie is interesting and will put you to think; it's better than the average junk that Hollywood produces. Just keep in mind that THERE IS A HIDDEN AGENDA BEHIND IT.",1106006400,31,1394,5.205357142857143
198729,1,1582704708,"What a hugely disappointing film this was.  After seeing the previews and several of the clips, I was ready to see the world from a new perspective and perhaps build some insight into the world of quantum physics.  After watching the entire film, I discovered that loonies and crackpots speak as if they rule this world because of the knowledge that they contain.  Instead of giving us leading people to guide us through this uncharted world of quantum physics, the directors of this documentary used a chiropractor and a woman named Ramtha along with a couple other people that seemed crazier and crazier as the film progressed.  Now, I want to make it clear that these subjects were actually crazy, not because of the topic they were discussing, but because of the way they spoke about it.  I think this is what lead to the incoherent mess of the film.

Our topics jumped from place to place, hardly spending enough time on any one to fully grasp the intentions of the film.  The only subject that our guides seemed most excited about was the entire ""sex-capade"" at the wedding.  Suddenly, the tone of the lecture changed and this NR rated film suddenly went to PG-13 as if the directors wanted to reach a younger audience.  The choice of computer graphics and song had nobody in my theater laughing, in fact some left early.  It just didn't seem to fit with what we were learning earlier.  This was a complete 180 from the early part of the film, and it did not brood well.  Marlee Matlin didn't even seem comfortable with what she was doing on screen.  Suddenly, the party is over and we are left with a conversation about God.  This was not what a film about science needed.  It was as if we had gone from bad to even worse.  I felt the directors were trying to suddenly justify their reasoning for the ill-fated wedding scene prior.  Either way, it bombed and ended up blowing this film into a million pieces.

In the mess of all this film, there were one or two good points that left you with something to ponder, like the Indians and not being able to see Columbus' ships for the first time.  The idea behind the path of choices as well as the effect of emotion on water was a very interesting study, but these were very small elements to a very large destructive picture.  For me this film mainly did not work because the people trying to educate us about quantum physics were not trying to explain it to us in a entertaining way, they were literally speaking over us forcing me, as well as others in the audience, to remember life back in Physics 101 and the quality of naps.  I continually felt that after leaving the theater there would be people meeting me at the door asking me if I would like to drink their punch.  These guides were not talking to me about quantum physics, but instead talking above me.  They knew they were better, and the arrogance shined through the silver screen.  I blame the directors for their choices because a better choice could have altered the mood of the film altogether.

Overall, I was very misinformed and uneducated after I left this theater.  The film was a bomb and I am constantly surprised by how much it has grossed already (though it has been playing for just about a year). The structure of the film coupled with the annoying ""specialists"" only helped debunk the whole premise.  The non-documentary aspect of this film also failed, constantly having me wonder why Marlee Matlin was chosen to do this project.  Nothing seemed to work in this film except for the ability to cause me a massive headache.  For those hoping for a purely scientific film, I think you will be very disappointed.  This film proves that sex and science (if not properly introduced) do not match. What the #$*! Do We Know? tried to incorporate too much into too little of a space.  The topics were too broad and the direction was poor.  Skip this one at all cost.

The good take on him is that one has to sift out the good views a person has from the potentially damaging ones. The bad take on him, is his book, Homosexuality and the politics of truth. Judging from the anti-gay reviewers who praise the book, for its supposed ""fair"" assessment of the gay condition and, ahem, recommended cures, it seems odd to include Satinover in a group of very accepting & supportive thinkers & theorists. I still plan to read his ""The Quantum Brain"" book & if I'm feeling very upbeat, the potentially alarming homosexuality book, but, priority goes to Ms. Pert & her life-affirming & positivity-as-a-way-of-life ""Molecules of Emotion.""

This is a special movie though it could have been improved by better marketing & editing. The computer graphics were amusing at one point & very little else as I wanted more meat than enteratainment with wiggly blobs & retro-rock anthems.

198732,1,1582704708,"This is a bad movie on many points. It begins abruptly and ends abruptly. They could have begun the film anywhere and it would have made as much sense. Despite the fact that it has no story or plot or direction or point that it introduces and explains to a conclusion, the purpose of the film does becomes clear.

The interweaving of a short story of Amanda played by Marlee Matlin, as an illustration of the films points doesn't help. The computerized 1970s graphics make things worse.

It might be making an intriguing point regarding the interconnection of science and religion, except for the language it uses. It's full if clichs and nonsensical speech. The basic dialog of the film is repeated over and over again as if they couldn't think of anything else to say, so they just repeated it, maybe with a little variation. Others have made similar points and observations with much greater success.

One possible reason (though it may not be the only explaination) they use such language is that the film makers think we film goers are so dumb they needed to use a child like speech so as not to confuse us with their superior and magnificent scientific knowledge.

The worst of them is JZ Knight (AKA Ramtha). She is a person who claims Ramtha (a great warrior of Atlantis who was later to become ""Rama"" of the Hindu religion) who ""chose to speak through JZ Knight"". (According to her website). Others speak in complete sentences and seem to make sense, until you listen closely, but JZ doesn't even pretend to make sense. She goes on and on like so many television psychics.

I felt like I was witnessing a congregation of the Tower of Babel.

The uncertainty principle and other poorly understood phenomena such as entanglement aren't magic generators of whatever reality we dream up. More importantly, quantum mechanics in and of itself is not a self consistent theory or the Universe. For that matter it isn't clear that its extension via quantum field theory and quantum chromodynamics result in a consistent theory since they are intrinsically perturbative. In other words, using the precursor to the currently accepted theories in physics as some argument to explain one of the fields of our experience that science by definition cannot explain is stupid. Science is a tool for studying the physical world. If there is some scientific connection between the physical world and what we may refer to as the spiritual world, it certainly hasn't been found using quantum mechanics.

I don't claim to be an expert on spirituality. I don't have certain conclusions on the existance of a god or any of the other questions this field aims to explore.
