However having made this confession,i still gave this movie 5 star because of the brilliant directional debut of shyalmalan.

I am watching The Sixth Sense for the first time in 2017. There are at least hundreds of thousands of movies to see, many of which are praised-- idk what percentage of people have never seen this one, but I think it's one not to miss. Not sure if I'll want to watch it again, now that I know the ending, but SD movie was 4.99 USD so, great. Nice to have it if I ever want to be sobbing again",1508544000,,651,4.336065573770492

1064010,5,630573240X,"""I see dead people.""

Excellent! More of a suspense-thriller than a horror movie. After you've seen it once, you may want to go back and watch it again to see what you missed! (Or to see that you didn't see what you thought you saw the first time) It reminds me a bit of ""The Shining"" (1980) starring Jack Nicholson, though that's considerably darker, the unedited version rated R.

Is that really Donnie Wahlberg (""Marky Mark"", ""New Kids On The Block"", ""Saw"" (2-5) and ""Blue Bloods"" (CBS)) as the disturbed young man early on? Yes it is. In an extra on ""The Cast"", M. Night Shyamalan explains that Wahlberg lost 43 pounds for the part.

The car scene between Lynn Sear (Toni Collette) and her son Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is quite moving.

Why no Academy Award nomination for Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe? His part required him to portray a number of emotions with just facial expressions. Was he snubbed because he was a mega-star?

I missed a lot of the Catholic imagery when I first saw the movie in 2000, but noticed it much more on seeing it in 2017. Early on, Dr. Crowe (Willis) follows Cole (Osment) into a beautiful Catholic Church in Philadelphia whose impressive exterior is scanned. Many Catholics (and some non-Catholics) seek refuge in quiet Catholic churches during the day, where Catholics believe Jesus Christ is Truly Present in the Holy Eucharist, the Most Blessed Sacrament. They go there to find peace. As Dr. Crowe is looking at information about young Cole before following him into the church, we see that Cole, living with his single mother, is described as having ""acute anxiety,"" is ""socially isolated,"" and has a possible ""mood disorder.""

Inside the church, Cole says to Dr. Crowe, ""De profundis clamavi ad te Domine"" (""Out of the depths I cry to you O LORD"" - Psalm 130:1), as he first attempts to explain to Willis' character, his torment.

Before leaving the church, Cole steals a little figure of the Sacred Heart (Jesus). A little later in the movie, we see Osment's charcter run into a homemade shrine behind red curtains, close to the floor. Cole quickly retreats there when he becomes troubled while in the apartment with his mother. Inside is the stolen Sacred Heart figure. I thought I also might have seen the Infant of Prague. I saw a figure of a female saint I thought was either St. Rose, St. Catherine of Siena, or St. Rita.",1508112000,,2373,4.676258992805756

1064016,5,630573240X,This is a good example of what C. S. Lewis was in part trying to teach in his book The Great Divorce.  My son and wife both have this gift. My son has had some pretty scary moments but with the gifts comes the wisdom to deal with it.  A couple of times the earthbound's were not good energy but he was inspired to know what to do.  You will have to watch a couple of times at least to really understand beginning from the end. If you like this movie you would like The Fountain with Hugh Jackman one of my favorite movies. And if you're really up for it read the Gita. This was Gandhi's book of scripture.  It has helped me more than any other book to understand the New Testament.,1505433600,,681,4.059701492537314

1064548,4,630573240X,"I had never seen THE SIXTH SENSE. . .but for many years I knew the ""secret"" of the disturbing ending.  Recently I came across this film on late-night cable (thank you, insomnia), so I gave it a viewing.  Yes, this movie is very, very good, well crafted (one of M. Night Shyamalan's best), and creepy and eerie--but the film practically telegraphs the surprise twist.

Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Dr. Malcom Crowe, a mental professional haunted by being shot months earlier by a former patient.  Haley Joel Osment plays 9-year-old Cole Sear, a boy who has trouble fitting in anywhere.  Dr. Crowe begins having sessions with Cole--only his frustration grows as Cole seems to be getting worse and worse over time.  This film is primarily between Dr. Crowe and Cole--with the doctor being found meeting Cole in church, at a school play, at a parent session with Cole's principle (that's pretty transparent telegraphing); outside of the former patient, Dr. Crowe is not seen with any other patient.  Only when the surprise ""twist"" dawns on Dr. Crowe does he realize what's transpired all along. . .and why his wife (Olivia Williams is superb) seems so damaged and haunted, and virtually ignores her husband.

Willis gives a solid performance, but kudos to young Osment; his performance is as exceptional as it is disturbing.  Toni Collette never phones in a role, and in THE SIXTH SENSE she doesn't disappoint playing Cole's distraught and nerve-frazzled mother.  Overall this is a must-see film, yet the movie's most famous line gives the plot of THE SIXTH SENSE away.  For another Shyamalan film that is just as eerie--with several twists coming out of nowhere--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devil/dp/B003Y5H4SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devil</a>&nbsp;is very much recommended.

Even knowing the ending, the film remains intriguing, not just for those ""in the know"" scenes that you look for, once you know the final revelation of the film, but simply for the excellent film-making at work here. M. Night Shyamalan really succeeds in creating a remarkable suspenseful horror film that remains terrifying without necessarily resorting to gore and jump-scares (although there is a degree of blood and gore, it's minimal, with the suggestion of horror and creepiness being the main device throughout the film.) Of course there are a couple times I found myself questioning certain places, like (semi-spoiler) can ghosts slam doors and break glass?

At first it seamed like a pretty normal movie about a boy who can see the dead, and his therapist trying to juggle his marriage and his work. But even though it looked that way it still kept me on the edge of my seat. (so much so it was hard for me to get up and use the bathroom). It may seem normal but its not, you have to watch the whole movie to truly feel what the move was made to make you feel.

At the time this movie was so unique it probably ruined M Night Shyamalan's career because ever since he's been trying to put a reveal at the end of every movie, which frankly is fun once in a while but not all the time. In this movie, not only does it work but it excels. Haley Joel Osment is terrific. What I like most about this movie is that it's a horror movie until you get the reveal in which case, it turns out the hero is doing the right thing morally in these supernatural circumstances.

1065614,4,630573240X,"I think the movie was well done and inventive but I, unfortunately, figured out the twist about 40 minutes into it. That didn't ruin the movie for me I just thought it was really obvious. Some people might not like this movie because it has a very indie film feel to it for such a big budget movie. It really relies a lot on visual cues and uncomfortable silences mixed with the perfect amount of tension.  I think Hitchcock fans will like this. Without the amazing cinematography I'm not sure this film could of held itself together. It's almost entirely conversations with very few actors and almost no action. I'm sure you're reading this and getting very confused about why this movie is worth watching, for me the twist at the end is really not what i think is the draw. It's the intense conversations and wonderful placement of the clues that give away the twist at the end, if you pay attention.  The dialogue we'll draw you in and the camera work will put you on the edge of your seat.",1469059200,,993,4.450549450549451

1065687,5,630573240X,"This may be classified as a horror movie, but, as is typical for Shyamalan's films, it was actually created to uplift, and, in my opinion, succeeds. This, in fact, would probably be best described as a family movie, despite the fact that the realistic death-related gore and the intense feelings expressed by the assorted angry, terrified, and depressed spirits seen in the film would be far too intense for small children to watch.

Watch this with your teenage and adult kids! It has a beautiful ending that makes all the dark and scary stuff worth it.",1468627200,,554,4.770833333333333

A young boy with the ability to see and talk to the deceased is as much of a spiritual mentor to Bruce Willis (his therapist) as the therapist guides the boy.  It is a journey where both come to terms with their gifts and their life's journeys.  The young boy is profoundly wise beyond his years.  If you love spiritual and/or paranormal films this is for you I promise.  The young boy grows to accept his gifts ultimately realizing that he can use his abilities to help others rather than seeing it as a ""curse"".  His therapist, on the other hand, views the world through the lens of both the living and the dead (I cannot say more without being a ""spoiler"".)

I know it's hard to be around them when they're vomiting in your tent, or bleeding on you carpet from a massive head wound, or yelling at you, or always just hanging around at your school, but I have learned that they have bad days, and heartbreaks and Munchhausen moms just like you or me.",1452038400,,596,4.201754385964913

1067064,5,630573240X,"This is one of the most memorable movies ever made.  When I first saw this movie in 1999 on videotape on a home rental I had to rewatch again immediately afterwards.  My family watched this again over 15 years later recently.  My teenage son had never seen it.  After it was over he wanted to watch it immediately again, too.  This is the most mind bending movie and the plot line is unique.  (Yes, we did fast forward through the ""boring"" parts the second time.)  The directing of and the acting of the boy actor Osment is powerful.  You can't really describe the plot without damaging the experience so I'll spare the narrative except to note that this is a good tale about a psychologist who wants to help a gifted and haunted child and they end of helping each other in a way you probably can't imagine.  This is okay for kids 14 and older.  Not recommended for younger children because of depictions of illness, violence and mayhem, but it is tame compared to much of today's movie fare.  Language was okay; I can't recall any shocking profanity other than an insult, ""cheese dick"".  I am looking for another movie that surprized me as much as this one did over 15 years ago, but haven't found one as good as this yet.",1438387200,,1223,4.434977578475336

Good acting from Bruce Willis who takes it down a notch from his usual fast paced action to do a melodrama.  And the only good movie Haley Osmond has ever done who played the boy.  Even the small bit character roles did well, no one stood out as needing to be recast.

1067578,5,630573240X,I watched this movie when it first came out and it was great then and it's still a great movie. I purposely rented again even though I had seen it before. That's how excellent it is. This movie features a young Bruce Willis and a new to the screen(I think) Haley Joel Osment. The littel boy Osment portrays who's name is Cole can see ghosts. At first the ghosts/spirits/entities had cause him bodily harm with scratches and cuts. His mother thought he was 'strange' but not in a mean or bad way. She loves her son and tries to help him and protect him. Bruce Willis playes a child mental health doctor. He seems to always be with or very near to 'Cole' through out the movie. Until the end when he realizes the truth about himself. Can't say much more or else I will give away the plot line.,1431475200,,791,4.28

The entire cast shines, especially Willis and HJ Osment.

1068253,5,630573240X,"The Sixth Sense is one of the finest examples of a suspenseful mystery movie. It could be considered horror but the intrigue far outweighs the eerie. Masterfully directed, expertly acted, and perfectly paced, The Sixth Sense should be used in film school to teach the next generation of film students how to craft suspense.

Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is an awkward child with a big secret, Cole just wants a normal life and to fix his relationship with his mother, Lynn (Toni Collette). Cole doesn't share his secret with anyone until he meets a disheartened child psychologist. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) was once awarded for his work with troubled children had a case go wrong in the worst way. Since then his confidence has been shaken. He sees a lot of the patient he failed in young Cole and is determined to help him, even after finding out his hard to believe secret.

The Sixth Sense grabs audiences from the very premise. An innocent looking child has the ability to see the dead. Not only that but the dead interact with him, and don't realize that they are dead. The added element of a praised child psychologist who loses his way after a case goes terribly wrong brings a new angle of intrigue to the story. As the mystery slowly unravels the suspense is ramped up. The lack of special effects make the film timeless as well as grounded in reality. The audience can grasp the subtle but well done practical effects more than they would be able to ghosts or animated visages, no matter how convincingly they were done.

Cole is constantly frightened and Haley Joel Osment portrayed the character with such expertise he was at the height of his career at eleven years old. That statement isn't meant as a slight against the actor, but praise at his ability to command the screen at such a young age. Especially while acting against a star as huge as Bruce Willis. Willis drops his tough guy persona to play the soft spoken child psychologist. He is excellent in scenes with his wife as a caring husband who wants nothing more than to close the emotional gap that worked its way into his marriage. He is even more impressive as a relatable doctor who can get into the mind of an eleven year old child and talk to him as an equal.

The direction of the film is outstanding. The framing, tone, and score add just as much to the drama as the high caliber acting. The way the camera is placed draws the audience into the movie in such a way that even though this film doesn't have big action, big set pieces, or Michael Bay level explosions, this is a film that deserves the full on cinema experience. The camera placement and staging is even more noticeable, and appreciated, on multiple viewings of the movie. The film is low lit, dull, somewhat depressing for the most part. This is done intentionally to help with the tone. The movie is tense throughout. Brief moments of levity are expertly placed throughout so the audience doesn't collectively develop ulcers.

The Sixth Sense is worth anyone's time. Whether a fan of horror or not, since it can't exactly be labeled as horror. Especially not the lazy buckets of karo syrup and loud noises over quality writing that horror has become. At the time of this writing it is difficult to find someone who hasn't seen this movie. Given that information this movie is worth a rewatch.",1414627200,,3348,4.62016806722689

1068258,4,630573240X,"This is probably the best offering to date by M. Night Shyamalan, who certainly has the ability to throw some twists and drama into a story (he's had less success with some of this later films though)

The story opens with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) who is a child psychologist returning home to his wife (Olivia Williams) only to find a former patient in his house Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg). Crowe tries to calm Vincent down but is shot by him, before Vincent turns the gun on himself. This opening sequence is revealed to be far more important that you might imagine later on in the film.

Time moves forward quite a bit and we now see Dr. Malcolm Crowe taking on a new case with troubled child Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), almost the entire screen play thereafter is devoted to the lives of Crowe and Cole showing their interactions and daily life. There are small clues to the real meaning and story throughout though, the ""ghosts"" Cole sees regularly, Dr Crowe has a normal routine with his Wife but she takes little notice of him in the scenes they share.

It's quite a simple and well thought out story, with an pretty strong M. Night Shyamalan ""gotcha"" moment where everything is not as it seems, in fact it's been slapping us in the face all the way through the film but the last part of the film is quite effective in rapid cut scenes showing us what we should have seen since the start of the film. It works, though as ever films like this can only hold their maximum impact on the first viewing.

Cast is good, Bruce Willis in on form here and Haley Joel Osment is about as good as you can get for a child actor performance in his role. Shyamalan directs with confidence and the film works on many levels with a story that you won't forget.

In some ways it's deserving of a higher score (whilst it takes repeated views well you will know the story and the impact can't hold over multiple viewings), it's not an easy task to make a supernatural thriller that works for the viewer. I think this is the best we've seen from the Shyamalan inspired story telling book, a few others have been worth a watch this is really his best work to date.",1413849600,,2164,4.413533834586466
1068259,5,630573240X,"The pinnacle of M. Night Shyammalans film making abilities!
Seeing ghosts, the dead, or the impact of these occurances shouldn't be saddled onto this young man, but it is.
Enter Bruce Willis, Psychologist for the young, award winner, and still has his own fears...not being able to help all his patients.
Together he helps this young man who is mature beyond his age, to see beyond his fears to see who needs help, and maybe how to communicate to the living how the dead feel, or how they got that way.
This film Doesn't have too much of an eerie sensation, but still delivers a powerful punch throughout the film.
Encountering the ghosts/dead is scary enough, being the messenger to the living is liberating, and in some cases, heart rending.

1068396,5,630573240X,"Bruce Willis is at his best as he plays the role of a distinguished child psychologist(Dr. Malcolm Crowe), who meets and helps a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who is Cole Sear in this thrilling story, as Cole shares with the doctor about the horror of seeing dead people. The doctor is not prepared to face the true facts, as to what haunts the young boy. Cole is different from his peers, who have made fun of him, leaving him in desperate need for a loyal, trusting friendship. Even his own mom is confused and terrified of what her son is going through, but is convinced as she faces the truth later on, after Cole described in the car about the dead victim in an accident, leaving his mom in total shock.

Cole's sixth sense leads the doctor and Cole to mysterious, chilling places that neither one of them will ever forget. The acting performance of the eight-year-old boy is as mesmerizing, as the role that Bruce Willis plays. Of all the ghost stories I have viewed, this is one of the best, where you sit on the edge of your seat, waiting for unexpected haunting surprises. The riveting story grabs your attention in the very beginning, and keeps you there until the end. This thrilling movie well deserved to be Nominated for 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. One of the best films I have seen with Bruce Willis in an unforgettable, ghost story that sends chills up your spine. Highly recommended!",1407456000,,1414,4.58893280632411

1068592,4,630573240X,"I watched this movie with a couple of friends last summer.  I remembered the movie, but I hadn't watched it since the year 2000.  Although, I did go through a couple of scenes.  It had been awhile since I had seen it, since I mostly remembered the movie as being depressing.  Sometimes, depressing movies can make you feel more bad for the characters rather than entertained.  I remembered it being depressing because it's about a boy named Cole who doesn't lives alone with his mother and doesn't really have friends.  He is also meeting with a psychologist and he has problems that can't seem to go away even with the help of the psychologist.
So, while I remember it as depressing and decided to watch it with my friends I ended up really enjoying the movie more than I thought I would, and it's not quite as depressing as I remember, even if it can be a little depressing.  There are a couple of scenes with Cole smiling making the movie less depressing, and where things seem to go well.  It also has a great plot of seeing dead people that aren't even aware they're dead and have unfinished business.
I also seriously can not believe how long ago this film came out.  Man, time really does fly.  It had even been a long time since I had seen it, and this film is sure to entertain you as much now as it would 15 years ago.  It's a great film you might want to see if friends are over looking for a spooky yet thriller kind of movie.
I give it a 4/5 as yeah I like it, but this probably isn't a film I'd want to watch over and over again.  Not one of my favorite movies, but at least entertaining.",1397865600,,1602,4.250825082508251

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Bruce Willis.  But I thought, regardless of how much I like Bruce Willis, most thrillier/suspense movies have been done, if not overdone.
  Well I was wrong on this count.  This was an extreamly well done & thought provoking movie.  With a well thought out story/plotline, excellent acting, & an extreamely excellent ending twist.  The acting was great.  And Shamala's directitorial debut was a massive smash hit.  I mean most directors take about 2 to 3 movies before they at least start to make a good movie.  Not in this case.  Although I daresay his other movies haven't quit been up to parr.  But in all fairness, it hard to compare with an excellent movie like this one.

1068811,5,630573240X,"Over the years M. Night Shyamalan has directed some very good films. ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" are just some of those. Of all Shyamalan's films however the one that stands out as his masterpiece has to be ""The Sixth Sense"". One of the most suspenseful films of all time to be made ""The Sixth Sense"" is well crafted in playing on the viewers emotions as it draws them into the story. It all leads to a surprise ending that the viewer doesn't see coming.

The acting is excellent lead by Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe a child psychologist who is trying to help a 9 year old boy, Cole Sear played by Haley Joel Osment, with emotional issues. Everyone including Sear's mother thinks it is some kind of social issues he has but as Dr. Crowe digs deeper into what is bothering Cole it is revealed that Cole can see and talk to dead people. For one so young Haley Joel Osment gives an equally excellent performance that plays well off of Bruce Willis part.

Then of course there is M. Night Shyamalan who wrote as well as directed ""The Sixth Sense"". The story itself is well told. Easy to follow while keeping you in suspense what will happen next with a scene or two thrown in that will make you jump. The directing is masterful as well and no doubt that Shyamalan was on his game as he was making this movie. It is no wonder that many who have seen ""The Sixth Sense"" rate this both as one of their all time favorite movies and also Shyamalan's best work. If you haven't seen this film you have GOT to watch ""The Sixth Sense"". I promise you will get caught up in the story and especially the ending. If you have seen it before, even with knowing the surprise ending, the film still stands up and is still captivating to watch. It is certainly for me one film I never tire of watching and is worthy of being in anyone's video library.",1383091200,,1846,4.3478260869565215

With equally amazing films, like American Beauty, The Cider House Rules, The Green Mile, I'd say The Sixth Sense is one of MANY great films of 1999. Let's not forget that 1999 was also the year of Fight Club and The Matrix. And, hell, for a great B-movie, I'd say Galaxy Quest really put a cap on the fact that 1999 was one of the greatest years for movies, period.",1382918400,,456,4.134831460674158

The picture quality is average but the audio is fairly good. The Blu-ray edition of The Sixth Sense includes all of the special features from its previous DVD releases (in SD). My only complaint is the lack of a director's commentary (Shyamalan refuses to provide it much like Spielberg). There is about 2 hours of bonus material provided but no exclusive content. The Sixth Sense was followed by Unbreakable which was an interesting superhero film.

1068994,3,630573240X,"Sixth Sense is a good film, but I found it very overrated. Everyone and their mother praises this film as being not only one of M. Night Shyamalan's best films but one of the best films period. So when I finally saw the film I was quite underwhelmed. I found it to be a decent suspense/horror film. The acting was fine. Bruce Willis does a good job in the film. However, I do not see it as the masterpiece that everyone thinks it is.

Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist named Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Crowe meets a Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Cole claims to be able to see dead people wherever he goes.

People say that this is one of the scariest movies they've ever seen. I saw the film and was not scared in the least. If I were five I'd probably be scared. However, I've far scarier films. The twist at the end you could see coming judging from the beginning of the film.

Bruce Willis and Haley do a fine job acting wise. I did like these two characters. I thought they were both likable and had energy, which is more than I can say for the character in Shyamalan's latest works. The story was competent as well.

Overall I liked the Sixth Sense, but I do not think it is as good a people make it out to be. If this film did not have as much hype around it, then I might have liked it more. I went in expecting a flawless masterpiece, and I felt a little underwhelmed.",1367971200,,1384,4.1722846441947565

1068998,5,630573240X,"Blu-ray transfer is excellent, both video and audio. Blu-ray contains quite a few extras regarding the film's production and includes selected scenes the director felt were excellent but were cut during editing as they didn't contribute to or detracted from the flow and pace of the film. If you haven't seen the film, do NOT watch any of the ""extras"" before viewing the film as they will spoil it (and the ending in particular). That said, the extras on the Blu-ray were enlightening about what the director and others were thinking as they produced the film. Well worth watching, including the deleted scenes, AFTER watching the film the first time.

This is NOT a ""horror"" film. It is a mystery/thriller along the lines of a modern ""Hitchcock"" tale with unexpected twists and turns including a major one at the very end. Film content has already been extensively reviewed by many others and I won't put any spoilers here to ruin the ending -- its box office success and lasting popularity speaks for itself. If you haven't seen this film, don't look up the ending (or skip to it) as you'll utterly spoil the experience. A great contrast for Bruce Willis compared to the typical action roles he's played. He does extremely well in this film, as does the young boy who plays the role of his patient.

1069054,5,630573240X,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Sixth Sense"" (Collector's Edition Series DVD - 1999) starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment. It's the story of a troubled little boy (Osment) and his psychologist (Willis). It's a bit of a creepy and suspenseful movie, if you can get caught up in the story. Try, it's worth it. Personally, I have a lot of problems with stories that go into such subjects as ghosts, seeing the dead and most things having to do with the supernatural and sixth senses. Okay, having said this, I still find ""The Sixth Sense"" to be an engaging and interesting movie. Here and there it's startling and, here and there it has great emotional impact. It's the kind of movie that makes me wish I could drift off into the supernatural realm as so many other people are freely able to  do.

The movie is very well done in every way. Actor Osment is convincing as a troubled little boy. He comes across as real, not some talented child actor. Willis is excellent also, but I have come to expect that of him. I might add that it's  good to see him in a PG-rated movie now and then. All of the supporting cast are excellent. The direction, the filming, the musical background and everything else is first rate and I couldn't help but wondering if the movie hadn't received any awards, but I haven't looked it up. No matter, it just caused me to wonder. The movie lost me again and again because of my inability to go along with the supernatural explanations, but then if repeatedly grabbed me back and the somewhat surprising  ending shook me up. It was an engaging, thought provoking and even somewhat thrilling movie. Relax and enjoy it, if you can.

1069056,5,630573240X,"In an era of cinema filled with stupidity, trashiness, violence, and cruelty, The Sixth Sense manages to stand out, for it's own time and even more so today, as a stunning example of serious cinema at it's finest. The Sixth Sense, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan back in his prime as a director, is a psychological horror/drama which focuses on a troubled 9 year old boy named Cole Sear, played exquisitely by Haley Joel Osment, who is able to see and interact with dead people, and his relationship with an equally troubled child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, played by Bruce Willis. While this film is often advertised as a horror movie in reality it's more of a supernatural drama with elements of psychological horror, or to put it more specifically, a drama film with some scary scenes thrown in. Just as there are comedy-dramas or tragicomedies, films which are basically dramas with some extra humor added in to lighten the overall mood, The Sixth Sense is a drama film with some horror added in to demonstrate fully to the viewer the terrible effect Cole's ""sixth sense"" has had on his life, rendering him a tortured soul with no one to turn to for guidance or consolation since many people don't even believe ghosts exist let alone have the ability to see and interact with them! While there are in fact many thoroughly frightening scenes in this film, this film had me crying more than it had me frightened, and I can't remember the last time a ""horror"" movie did that. So even if this film had some cliched scares as one person said in a Youtube review I saw, it still succeeds as a powerful, tragic drama focusing on common human fears and concerns such as our fear of death and the unknown, most people don't understand Cole, they label him as a freak and would probably call him that even more if he told them about his sixth sense. Malcolm, who's having problems of his own, in addition to having a young boy telling him that he can see ghosts, now has added anxiety to deal with as he slowly starts to believe that Cole may be telling the truth after all when he looks back over some old audio recordings of his old patient Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg), as a child, he realizes that he may have been afflicted with the same ability that Cole has, which is why he ""failed"" him and why he broke into Malcolm's house and shot him in the opening scene. Overall, The Sixth Sense is a gripping, suspenseful, emotional, dramatic, and scary film that is much more than a simply ghost story, it's a film that asks the question of whether we truly ever die and what happens to us and the people we love after we die, do we truly ""die"" or does some part of us live on, possibly to suffer and linger from unfinished business on the earthly plane, or simply unable to move out of the darkness and into the light.",1363910400,,2826,4.5

1069174,5,630573240X,"Normally I stay away from supernatural thrillers - I admit that they tend to give me nightmares. When I was barely twelve years old, I somehow managed to see The Exorcist and The Shining. I'm pretty sure the scars are still carved into my psyche :). So when The Sixth Sense came out, as intriguing as it seemed, I stayed away. But when it earned its way onto the #89 spot of the revised AFI Top 100 listing, I knew I'd have to get through it somehow. So I curled up with a blanket, my boyfriend, a glass of wine, and watched.

There were definitely some ""jump"" scenes in there, but by and large the movie is beautifully crafted with psychological, not gory, intrigue. Haley Joel Osment proves that a child actor can be superb. As a fan of Philip K. Dick stories, I adored the twists and turns, the unexpected and the layers. Bruce Willis shines as a man with issues.

It's definitely a movie that you want to avoid all previews of, so that you don't know what is coming. A key part of the movie is watching the story unravel and make more sense as time goes on. It's also a movie that gets better with each re-watching, where you can appreciate the use of light, the use of color, and the fine acting.

It's a bit disappointing that even in modern times that movies often seem to be all about men in a man's world. Yes, there's the mother who adores her son and just wants to help him. But she's pretty much the only woman in the entire movie. The only time two women talk to each other in the entire film, except one brief moment at a birthday party, is when a mom briefly talks with her daughter about going outside to play. That's it. Apparently the rest of the population of our world is made up of silent females and quite talkative males.

Still, I suppose it's better than other movies on the AFI Top 100 like Patton and 12 Angry Men which literally have zero speaking females at all :).

Highly recommended, even if you don't normally watch thrillers. This is one that well deserves its AFI spot.",1346716800,,2004,4.319148936170213
1069175,5,630573240X,"Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) has a new patient; a young man named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Malcolm is a child psychologist and Cole claims that he can see dead people. They are all around him and they are attracted to Cole due to his psychic power. Not only can he see them but some can follow him and talk to him.

Malcolm feels that Cole is hallucinating. Malcolm soon begins to believe Cole and realizes that Cole and a former patient, who had the same issues, may really have some special ability that no one else can perceive. He convinces Cole to reach out and speak to the dead to see what they really want from him. This leads to some interesting confrontations and revelations.....

I really liked this movie and at some times it can really be creepy. M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed this movie and it was one of three hit movies that he directed in a row. (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs) The storyline was excellent and the acting was superb. It is a very good ghost story movie and well worth watching. Just don't watch it alone!

I recommend it to you as a very good movie!",1344384000,,1110,4.404878048780488

1069177,5,630573240X,"M. Night Shyamalan hit a towering home-run with this movie. In a year (1999) noted for some good films this one stood head and shoulders above the rest. I won't delve into any of the film's specifics since so much has already been written about it, and I don't want to ruin anything for someone who might actually have missed this flick (incredible as it might seem). I simply want to echo the sentiments of so many others who feel, as I do, that this is one of the all time great creepy films and can stand its own against just about any of them. This movie overshadowed another eerie thriller that year, ""Stir of Echoes"", which is very much worth a viewing as well. Unfortunately Mr. Shyamalan has not been able to recreate the success of this movie although he has given it quite an effort. ""Signs"", ""Unbreakable"", ""The Village"", are all okay movies, but none come close to ""The Sixth Sense"". I also own this movie in the two-disc Special Edition DVD version and wanted to see it in higher-def. For the current price levels you may as well opt for Blu-Ray since it is a bit better quality, but the movie stands on its own and is a good view even in VHS if that's what you have. I certainly recommend this movie to anyone wanting a three-dimensional experience (sight, sound, and feeling the hairs on your arms stand on end and prickle!)",1340582400,,1339,4.4471544715447155

Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist who has just received an award from the Mayor of Philadelphia (Shyamalan lives in the wealthy Main Line near Philadelphia) for his work with troubled children. But one of his former patients shows up in his apartment accusing him of failing him. He shoots Dr. Crowe and then himself.

Later, Dr. Crowe is still trying to make sense of how he failed that patient, and starts treating young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, one of my favorite child actors) for a condition very similar to the one that shot him and then himself. After several rather bizarre situations, Cole eventually tells Dr. Crowe his secret: he sees dead people. Dr. Crowe suggests that perhaps the reason is they want him to do something for them.

You'll probably see the ending coming a mile away. I did because someone had done a spoiler on it for me. But that does not reduce the value of the movie one whit. And while is it a thriller and there are some scary, bloody parts, they are not really gross. Well, I guess the little girl who vomits as profusely as Linda Blair ever did is pretty gross, but it's only because I'm a real wimp about horror movies.

1069366,4,630573240X,"When I'm considering purchasing a movie from Amazon, the only things I'm interested in are the picture/audio quality and supplemental features of the actual product.  Instead what I see is 5,000 subjective reviews of the movie itself.  First off, if I'm considering buying a movie to begin with, chances are pretty good that I've already seen it, which means I liked it enough to consider spending my hard-earned money to buy it. I think that applies to most people. So I could care less what your personal take is on the movie.  If I really wanted to know that, I could just hop over to Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb.

It's the same thing as buying a baseball glove and in your review only talking about how baseball is a better sport than football, or buying your kid clothes with Dora the Explorer on them and giving it 5 stars just because it's such a great cartoon show.  That's worthless, because I want to know about the actual quality of the item I'm purchasing. The same goes with Blu-Rays (and DVDs).

In case that still confuses you, I want to know how is the picture quality (DNR, artifacting, banding, aliasing, black levels, etc), the audio quality (lossless/compressed, sound levels, surround activity, dynamic range, dialogue clarity, etc), and content/quality of extras.  The unfortunate reality is most of these reviewers probably have no idea about such things, and are the same people who don't see a different between SD and HD programming and are happy as long as they get some sound and a picture on their screen.

That's fine, I don't expect everyone to be an expert, but your subjective movie review is still pointless from a product review standpoint.  So in the future, please just refrain from being the 5,001st person to post your movie review here so those of us who want a more objective critique of the actual product can more easily see the helpful reviews, and instead post your movie review on a site like Rotten Tomatoes that is intended for that specific purpose.

1069369,5,630573240X,"I remember the first time i ever saw this moive, before M Knight became the (legend) he is. I remember being shocked as crap when the ending came, and thought wow this movie is going to go down as a classic. Since then since 1998 it has started a Psychological Horror revolution. Now we've had movies like The Others, The Ring, The Grudge, The Uninvited, The Messenger, Omen 666 and so on and so forth. The scary child movies have taken over and people really love it, or hate it. I for one am a huge fan of these types of movies and would take them over hack and slash films any day.

Bruce Willis is very good, and i guess he must have made an impression on Mr. M, when he casted him in his other film Unbreakable directly afterwards. The i see dead people theme has been copied in film after film with pretty good success, but few have had the impact The Sixth Sense had. I'm not sure what happened to Haley Joel Osmand but he was a fine little actor. I wish he would star in more films such as this. This is arguably Shamylans best film and he has made nothing like it since, and i doubt he will. Probably another film closest to the level of this one is The Others which was very similar, but different as well. This movie is slow paced, yet effective in frights and giving you the willies over all. I remember hearing that this was an extremely low budget film and it didn't cost much of anything to make. Matter a fact the behind the scenes were very funny and show cased Shamylans artistic directing work when he was young, which was less than impressive, yet fun to behold. When the dead people were around i thought it was very original having the temperature drop and seeing the cold breath come from young coles mouth. Another great performance should go to Tony Collette who was great in this and continues to be great in all of her recent films.

So yes this was a revolutionary movie without really even meaning to be, but it changed a whole generation of Psychological horror, and is definitely a classic. Even if u know the ending which about 90% of the population do, its still a great watch, even more than once. Unfortunately you can't say that about many horror films. So keep this in your collection, it's well worth it. Here are how i rate some of my other favorite movies in this same genre that i highly recommend.

The Ring-10/10
The Grudge-10/10
The Others-10/10
The Uninvited-8/10
The Messengers-7/10

1069372,5,630573240X,"In my opinion The Sixth Sense(released Aug/99)is director M.Night Shayamalan's best effort to date. This movie combines wonderfully effective narrative ""trickery"" which sets the viewer up for a shocking,unexpected and powerful one-two punch of an ending.
The films stars Bruce Willis as Dr Crowe,a renowned psychiatrist who lives in Philadelphia,PA.Having just received a prestigious award from the Mayor he and his wife are celebrating upstairs when an intruder is discovered. Dressed in all but his underwear the intruder continuously yells that the doctor let him down. What little Dr Crowe can glean is that this man in his youth was a former patient of his. As he switches into doctor mode trying to calm him,he pulls a gun out and shoots Crowe in the stomach.
The scene next switches to the home of the Sears;single mom Lynn(Toni Collette) and her only son Cole(Haley Joel Osmont).Cole is a shy,picked on and bullied nine year old who is very troubled. He is carrying his pent up frustrations and thoughts around with him and keeping them all from everyone,including his poor mother. Dr Crowe enters the picture and decides to take little Cole on and try to help him with his dilemma. Over time and with patience Dr Crowe is let into Cole's world who admits to him that his secret is that he""sees dead people"".At first Dr Crowe is incredulous but over time he comes to believe Cole is actually seeing these things.
One day at a party he and his mother attend,some bullies lock Cole in a small cubicle at the top of a winding staircase. His mother rescues him but he is taken to the hospital unconscious. The doctors find marks on his back and think his mother has abused Cole. It is these marks and other indications that Cole gives to Dr Crowe that makes the doctor think the ghosts may be trying to communicate something to him. When one night a small girl appears to Cole she tells him to go to her home,to her room and retrieve a small box. Cole,accompanied by Dr Crowe go to her home where her wake is in progress. Going to her room the girl gives Cole the box which he takes to the father. Inside is a tape which reveals that the wife had deliberately poisoned/murdered the poor girl. Dr Crowe and Cole have come to the realization that all these entities ever wanted was someone to listen to them.
On the way home the next day Cole is with his mother in their car. An accident has occurred up ahead and the traffic is backed up. While waiting for it to clear Cole finally lets his feelings and his secret out to his mother. He tells her that someone got killed in the accident ahead because the person is standing next to his window. Then he reveals he can talk to ghosts and tells his mother that his grandmother often appears to him. In fact he imparts a message,from the Grandmother,to her only she could have ever known about. In tears both hug.
Dr Crowe and Cole come to a parting of the ways as he has done all he can for Cole. The doctor's wife and he however appear to have become estranged and he pays a visit to his home. His wife is asleep on the couch and he sits beside her. Suddenly his wedding ring falls from her hands and he suddenly realizes he hasn't been wearing it. He thinks back to what Cole said that ghosts sometimes ""see only what they want to see"".Dr Crowe never survived the shot at the beginning of the movie! A video of their wedding is playing on the TV and he tells his wife he must go,letting her move on with her life and telling her he loves and misses her.
The impact of that final moment cannot be understated. It is like getting a sledge hammer between the eyes. The director skillfully
weaved the story in such a way using every narrative trick in the book to throw us off the scent and he succeeded in spades. It brings two concurrent plots into alignment and successfully resolves  each characters dilemmas;each divergent character helping the other in their own way. Wonderful film,beautifully written and executed.
Technically the film has been transferred well into its' 1:85:1 a/r. Extras include:storyboard to film comparison,,cast info,music and sound design,a look at the ""rules and clues"" in the movie,deleted scenes with an alternate and extended ending,interview and intros by the director,filmmaker and cast bios and a bit on publicity for the film.
This top notch edge of your seat film includes many elements such as drama,love,thrills and pathos all wrapped around the subject of ghosts. Its' famous ending will leave you gasping and its' stars Colletee,Osment and Willis all turn in Oscar caliber performances throughout. This is highly recommended.",1286841600,,4618,4.673218673218673

Bruce Willis is a pediatric psychologist,  Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who is haunted by the sudden reappearance and then a dramatic suicide of a former patient.  He was planning on spending a romantic evening with his wife, in celebration of his recent civic honor as a upstanding Child Psychologist.

Months later we see Dr. Crowe meeting a 6 year old boy,  Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment).  He has been withdrawn and has some mental issues.  He is also has issues very similar to his earlier patient.

Dr. Crowe then begins to talk with Cole, for both to gain peace in their lives. The issues with Cole are complicated and Dr. Crowe struggles to figure out what Cole is not telling him or his single mother.  It seems during the counseling he has focused on Cole and left his wife out emotionally.  The relationship with his wife seems odd and distant.

A riveting scene where Cole finally tells Dr. Crowe about his frightening supernatural secret is exquisitely engrossing.

1069451,5,630573240X,"For those who haven't seen this film, don't worry. This review has no plot spoilers.

There's an old saw that everyone has one big novel or story in them. Unfortunately for M Night Shyamalan, ""The Sixth Sense"" was it. Its tremendous success encouraged him to make similar films, which have been increasingly dumb and dumber. ""The Last Airbender"" is about to be released, and unless it's an unusually good film, it will be renamed with the obvious vulgarity and quickly go to video.

But ""The Sixth Sense"" is a classic. Bruce Willis is a child psychologist trying to help Haley Joel Osment, a disturbed pre-teen who ""sees dead people"". Willis thinks Osment might be schizophrenic, and is about to give up the case, when he discovers that the child /might/ be telling the truth, and finds a way to help the boy come to grips with the situation, regardless of whether he's sane or psychotic. In a following scene between Osment and his mother (Toni Collette), we learn whether he really does ""see dead people"". And then comes The Big Reveal... *

Forget that ""The Sixth Sense"" is a psychological thriller. It's worth seeing for Shyamalan's subtle direction and Willis's and Osment's beautiful performances. The latter is one of the great child performances in movie history.

I am bothered by a recent reviewer who says that he didn't find this film ""entertaining"". It appears we have reached a point anyone born after ""Star Wars"" cannot appreciate dramas. That's pathetic and disturbing. If nothing else, ""The Sixth Sense"" is entertaining in the literal meaning of the word -- it holds our attention from start to finish.

The transfer is typical Disney -- richly colored, with extreme detail and sharpness. It's close to demo quality.

* Despite Syamalan's claim that he doesn't ""cheat"", there's at least one poorly structured (and retroactively implausible) scene that keeps the audience from seeing what's actually going on.",1267315200,,1925,4.981308411214953

I'm not crazy about it because the movie is incredibly disturbing and almost tragic. Personally, I hate watching bad things happen to good people and there is no better man than the one and only Bruce Willis. It's almost like a story within a story within a story. But it moves very slowly and if you're like me the first time you watch it you'll need to go back and watch some parts again because it just didn't jive. As always Bruce was exceptional (the man has never given a less than excellent performance) in this movie, playing Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child social worker. He conveyed so many different emotions and was completely believable. But overall, the movie wasn't entertaining or even educational or enlightening. Instead, as I have stated, it was very complicated. The movie does take a couple of twists and turns, most notably during the end. I didn't see what any of this had to do with the overall story though. What I thought the movie was trying to say is that death is very important and how we treat people after they pass away directly affects what happens in the present.

Shyamalan does a great job of setting up the tension using lighting on otherwise inanimate objects, like statues on buildings, as well as odd shots, like high above entrances, which at once create both a distance and tension.  Bruce Willis plays a psychiatrist who is attempting to redeem himself by helping a young boy, Haley Joel Osment, who seems beyond help.  Osment is very intelligent and holds a dark secret which Willis attempts to bring out.  The story-line, cinematography, characters, and site locations all work together to the surprising climax and final revelation.  This is a film that justly bolstered the directors and actors reputations.",1264982400,,741,5.19327731092437
1069524,5,630573240X,"8-year-old Cole Sear is haunted by a dark secret: he is visited by ghosts. A reluctant channel, Cole is frightened by visitations from those with unresolved problems who appear from the shadows. Confused by his paranormal powers, Cole is too young to understand his purpose and too afraid to tell anyone aout his anguish, except child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the ominous truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something harrowing--and unexplainable.  A movie that at first glance seems like a horror film with many chills, turns into a unexpectedly moving drama with a surprising ending.

I just watched it again and was amazed by how well rendered the entire  movie is and how Shyamalan plays totally fair with his ""surprise"".  I just hope he can recapture this magic of SIXTH SENSE in the future as his other films have been very disappointing.  I'm not usually a fan of Bruce Willis in his action roles but he is just perfect playing Malcom in this much quieter movie.  Child actor Haley Joel Osmont is nothing short of remarkable in his role as the ""disturbed"" Cole.  Philadelphia, a city I never think much about, comes alive and I now want to visit it and see the historic sites.  And there is really a pretty nice spiritual message for a ""ghost"" story.

Altho' I always know the outcome, the excellent acting of (then) young Haley Joel Osment, and the palpable chemistry between him & both his mother (played by Toni Collette) and his therapist (played by Bruce Willis) make this movie a viewing pleasure time and again.  My favorite scene is at the end of the movie when he & his mother are in the car, and he's ""ready to talk about his secrets.""  I would highly recommend seeing this film, as there is a little bit of something for everyone - humor, suspense, drama, lost love, and reconciliation.",1254096000,,632,4.431034482758621
1069528,5,630573240X,"This is one of my all-time favourite movies for a number of reasons and it's nice to see that even after a decade, this film ages so well and is still fun to watch.  I watched ""Silence of the Lambs"" again recently and it hasn't aged as well for me.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is more than just a scary movie as it has themes of redemption in trying to make things right, the difficulty of single parenthood and the tremendous impact it has on the innocent child's life both then and in the future and of course the obvious life after death/spirit world issues.  The unexpected twist is a key reason for what makes this film work so well and yet unlike ""Silence ..."" even when you know the ending, the excellent treatment of the various other themes mentioned earlier makes it still watchable.  With ""Silence ..."" I get the feeling I already know the final score of the basketball game and so a massive amount of future enjoyment value is lost with repeated viewings.  Each time I watch ""The Sixth Sense"" though, I still find myself rediscovering elements that I'd somehow missed earlier.  This film like a true classic rewards repeated viewings very well.

This Collector's Edition dvd is also a treat as it comes in very good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound quality and the picture quality is for the most part very good.  The Special Features includes very good making-of documentary, deleted scenes and interviews with the cast and especially with the director/screenwriter himself.  As far as standard format discs go this is very good and it only makes me wonder how much better the Blu-ray version can possibly be.  Just like the child character in the film, the inability of adults to take the insights of children seriously enough is the only way I can explain why Haley Joel Osment didn't get the best actor Oscar for his performance here.  I guess he's just too young for the academy to take him seriously?  Bruce Willis has done some of his best work on this film too.  Classic films like this are a one off and it's unlikely M. Night will reach the same heights of quality as he does here again although he does come close with ""Unbreakable.""

This is an excellent film that ages well and should be in every film-buff's library.

1069532,5,630573240X,"Among the best ghost stories ever told, The Sixth Sense succeeds mightily as a horror movie, a relationship drama, and a spiritual thriller.  In arguably his best role, Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a dedicated psychologist still haunted by his inability to help a disturbed patient who later took his own life.  Years later, he's in for the challenge of his career when he meets a deeply frightened and disturbed little boy named Cole (Haley Joel Osment, in an award-worthy vituoso performance) who seems at first to be plagued by the same kind of mental problems that hounded Crowe's former (later suicidal) patient.  Part of his determination to help Cole is to try and redeem himself for what he perceives as his failure in the other case, but most of it is that he just puts his all into it for every case, and Willis is great at projecting the compassion and fear he feels for his new young patient who continues to spiral deeper, while Osment is just magnificent as a lovable little child who's scared out of his wits by forces beyond his understanding, and not knowing who to trust, or who's ever going to believe him.  Both actors elicit tremendous empathy for their characters, and the supporting cast shines pretty brightly too.

  The doctor bit by bit learns more about the nature of the boy's delusions, carefully prying little hints and pieces of information out of his scared charge without forcing it and driving him deeper into his shell.  But Dr. Crowe may be in for far more than he ever bargained for, as he begins - almost against his will - to have to consider the fact that Cole's fears may not be delusions at all.  The scene in which Cole finally confides the truth of what he 'sees' with his special sense to the doctor is an absolute classic.  As Crowe tries to help him - and tries to figure out exactly where he stands on what he's beginning to suspect (which is everything his training has told him not to put stock into), Cole begins to sense a purpose behind his experiences and begins trying to understand what's behind the whole phenomenon, and what his 'role' in it is.

  Excellent from start to finish, and if you're one of the few people on the planet not to already know the genuinely shocking twist ending, that's all the more reason to get it and see it as soon as possible.  A+",1242345600,,2328,4.551558752997602

1069658,5,630573240X,"I saw this originally at the movies, and was amazed at the incredibly believable performance by young Haley Joel Osment who plays a child terrified for too long on the verge of losing his fragile young mind. Just before the end of the story I was very frustrated feeling that the Director had cheated on the mystery of the story, until it did actually end, then of course it was ""Oh, I see!"", my wife who left at the beginning to call the kids at home was very angry, and feeling cheated until I explained it to her.

Later when we got to see this on DVD and saw the extra features that let you see how the director not only didn't cheat you, but gave a clue in every scene, I almost felt dumb for not getting it in the first place.

Now, I would like to address some of the other criticism leveled at this film; specifically that only Cole's character is three dimensional. The story is Cole's story; the other major characters are unaware of anything that is going on in Cole's story, so for them to be full fleshed as it were would take away from the actual story line, and take you away from the destination of the plot.

When child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) offers his assistance to the troubled youth the two embark on a journey of self discovery that is totally unexpected for both the psychologist and the viewing audience.

1069736,5,630573240X,"""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion.

But with subsequent viewing(s) the fear factor diminishes and you become aware that this is not a ghost story so much as it is a film about grief; particularly the grief than comes from regret. With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme. The object of the film is far more than just giving the audience a scare although it does a first-class job of doing just that. It can also alter your perception of the process of both living and dying.

The spirits that seek out young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) do so because there is something they regret doing or not doing during their lives; something that will ease the grief of their passing (for both them and their loved ones). You have Krya's little sister asking Cole if Krya will come back and Cole answering ""not anymore"", after he has helped Krya.

And then you have the grieving Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his grieving wife Anna (Olivia Williams): ""Once upon a time there was this person named Malcolm. He worked with children. He loved it. He loved it more than anything else. And then one night, he found out that he made a mistake with one of them. He couldn't help that one. And he can't stop thinking about it, he can't forget. Ever since then, things have been different. He's not the same person that he used to be. And his wife doesn't like the person that he's become. They barely speak anymore, they're like strangers. And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy. Reminds him a lot of the other one. And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy. 'Cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it would be like helping that other one too.""

The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all-time best.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1209340800,,2370,4.567058823529412
1069737,5,630573240X,"The Sixth Sense was the first film M. Night Shyamalan directed where I learned of his name. The film was especially intriguing, in my opinion, because it focused on the nature of fear rather than just being afraid.  Some who love ""horror"" films may tend to treat them as if though they are action films, where they enjoy seeing the victim run away from a seemingly indestructible foe bent on mass murder with no cause behind it.  We laugh and say how stupid that person is for tripping while trying to get away rather than making it past the door entirely, so to speak.  Others may just want to be scared out their theater seats.  This effect may not be what Shyamalan is trying to achieve with this film.

The fear in this film is not being projected towards us, the viewers, but towards the characters themselves.  The troubled protaganist, Cole Sear (played impressively by a young Haley Joel Osment), is being forced to deal with his fear in solitude since it is a form of it that not everyone can express.  This key point is what drives this impressive film.  The nature of fear is different for everyone, and through Cole's visions, we get a glimspe of what it is that truly scares him.  Not to give away anything specific, Cole sees something beyond ghosts.  He sees violence, pain, suffering, and most importantly, despair.  Each ghost he sees met its end in either a violent, painful, sufferable, or despairing way.  What Cole fears is actually the most deprecating aspects of human society: mankind's unwillingness to live  a peaceful life.  The only peace and stillness that Cole receives comes in the guise of Malcolm Crowe (another impressive turn for Bruce Willis).

Like Cole, Malcolm has his own fears that he struggles with.  He fears the failure of his professional career, the seemingly impending failure of his marriage, and the possible failure of what type of man he seeks to be.  He buries this fear, letting no one see what it is that plagues him.  It is not until Malcolm and Cole establish their uneasy relationship where both individuals are able to seek some type of solace from their fears, an act that neither one could have accomplished on his own.  Just as love, hate, envy, jealousy, and other emotions can connect people with one another, fear can be just as powerful a bond as the others.  Fear essentially is the gravitas of this film.  People do not always need a saviour or hero to show them the way.  Simply sharing your differences and finding the common element between them can do just the trick.

Other reviewers have used words like ""boring,"" ""ridiculous,"" and ""overrated"" when looking at this film.  Everyone has a right to his or her opinion.  However, where one person sees something boring, I see something insightful; where one person sees something ridiculous, I see something ever-presently intelligent; and where one person sees something overrated, I see something that is brave in its undertaking.  Make no mistake, I am not a film critic.  I could attempt to make some informed judgement on acting abilities, casting, plot, setting, and the likes.  But I respect the film industry enough to know that I am in no way qualified to make such judgments on a work of art, even if it is a movie.  Still, what I seek to communicate here is that sometimes, visionary directors want viewers to move past the surface and dig deeper, as archaeologists do, for the hidden meaning of things.  Shyamalan, I think, made a similar challenge in this film.  He may be saying that to be afraid is one thing, but more can come from it.  Anyone can be scared by any number of things, whether it is a dead man in a hockey mask hacking at teenagers with a machete, or a creature that was created or from outer space eating people to survive, or a serial killer with an omnipresent message of what it truly means to live who carves his powerful viewpoint on uncaring victims.  But to share your fear, and see how it too connects you to that unspoken realm of human existence is just as appealing and enlightening as knowing when to duck, run, and head for cover when something insane passes by with a malicious desire for murder in mind.",1208131200,,4168,4.658002735978112

Malcolm is an award-winning and recognized child psychologist.  After being shot by a former mentally-unstable client, Malcolm is determined to make sure that none of his clients ""fall through the cracks"".

In comes Cole, a scared 9-year-old boy.  His mother has tried everything to help alleviate his fears but has not had any luck.  In the midst of their sessions and diagnoses, Cole reveals to Malcolm that he can see dead people.

From there, we start to see from Cole's perspectives.  Indeed, he sees them but remains frightened of them.  Through the help of Malcolm, he realizes that the dead just simply want to communicate.  With his first mission being successful, Cole realizes that this is his purpose in life.  (In addition, I believe that this is where ""The Ghost Whisperer"" got their idea.)

I didn't see it for a few years afterward, on tape and now on DVD. It was very good but I didn't find it as ""the greatest movie ever"" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.

I enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in ""Unbreakable,"" to name another fairly-recent movie)  Osment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.

This isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film.",1189900800,,1429,4.422053231939164

Why it caught on in terms of popularity across the United States back in the late 90's is totally beyond me.  When I first watched this movie, the first thing that went through my mind was ""Oh no, this movie is going to kill the horror genre"".  Luckily not every single horror movie ripped off the ideas of this film to make the entire genre worthless (unlike say, Van Halen, whose influence made listening to guitar solos in a rock song a chore from that point on, but that's a different subject for a different time).

I was never *ever* scared while watching the Sixth Sense.  Not even once.  Nothing even came close to giving me goosebumps.  Everything came across so ordinary, almost like a dream from a childs point of view.  No, not a nightmare- just a regular dream.  I was completely unsatisfied with the acting as well.  The little boy from Thunder Alley was the worst possible choice- he wasn't convincing at all.  I didn't feel his emotions (which were overbearingly exaggerated most of the time).  The whole ""I see dead people"" thing was about the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  Watching him walk around and say things like ""There's a dead guy over there"" didn't have me convinced a dead spirit was around him at all.  Guess what everyone?  There's a dead guy standing next to me while I type this review for amazon.  I'm scared, shaking and very nervous right now.  Are you scared?  Of course not.

Going to high school when this movie came out, I can't believe so many of my classmates were scared of this story and actually went around saying the new hot expression ""I see dead people"".  How horrible.  Then again, maybe they were making fun of it.  I hope so.

Malcolm Crowe is a child psychologist tormented by the one patient he couldn't save. It's been a year since he had to confront that awful truth, and in that time, his confidence and his marraige have undergone a slow and steady crumble that has finally reached the breaking point. Enter Cole Sear, an eight year old child of a single mother with a decidedly nasty neurosis: he believes he sees the dead.

If Crowe (Bruce Willis) can help the boy (Oscar-nominee Haley Joel Osment), he may just redeem himself; but the effort he spends in doing so continues to erode his relationship with his wife, and a nagging suspicion that Cole is NOT delusional threatens Crowe's fundamental understanding of the universe.

This is a terrific thriller-ghost-story-drama that would suffer from any further explanation. Great acting and subtle direction (note the selective usage of the color red), along with an absolutely killer storyline, make THE SIXTH SENSE probably the best movie of 1996. Eleven years later, it still holds up.

""I see dead people.""

M. Night Shyamalan made a household name for himself no matter how difficult the pronunciation with this `Grade-A' supernatural thriller about a young boy troubled by his unique gift.  The film opens with a tragic event involving Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who has just received an award in his honor.  But before the celebrations can truly begin he's confronted by an ex-patient of his who it seems Crowe was never able to help.  The aftershocks of that evening ring throughout the remainder of the film as Crowe's relationship with his wife becomes more and more strained.  But as that relationship slowly dies he forms a bond with his new patient Cole Sear.  Cole has a problem that is presents itself almost too familiar with Crowe.  It appears that Cole can communicate with the dead.

Both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are outstanding in this brilliant film.  Some have claimed Willis to be too reserved and reclusive and thus leaving the entire film on the shoulders of the very capable Osment, but in my eyes both of these actors contribute exactly what they needed in order to make this film work.  Willis wears the confusion of his situation on his face with earnest honesty and that adds layers to his character.  Osment shines so brightly here and should have walked away with the Oscar that night, but alas, he'll have his day again I'm sure.  He gives Cole so much charm and charisma.  He's able to create a believable nine-year-old boy without playing the complexity of his character down at all.  He adds so much believable maturity.  It's truly astounding to watch.

The star of this film though is Shyamalan who instills a deep-rooted fear into the audience from the very beginning.  It's this very asset that sets `The Sixth Sense' apart from all the Hollywood cheap imitations that seemed to swarm the theaters shortly after `The Sixth Sense' made a killing and set the bar.  Sure, there are a few that followed that were worth the price of admission (the Nicole Kidman vehicle `The Others' was one of them), but for the most part nothing since has even touched the surface of the effortless brilliance that was and is `The Sixth Sense'.  The lighting, the music, the atmosphere, set designs, script and acting all add so much originality and suspense to this one of a kind experience.

There's hardly a fault to be found with this multi-Academy Award nominated film.  The entire cast (I should make mention of the amazing Toni Collette who is just fascinating as Cole's frustrated mother) delivers down to the bone and makes this a film to watch again and again and again.",1185494400,,2899,4.731075697211155

1069955,5,630573240X,"M. Night Shyamalan's debut as the masterful storyteller/director began with this most mysterious and heartfelt film, The Sixth Sense. The last time I saw The Sixth Sense was over six years ago and it was as though I enjoyed it even more now than I did the first time I saw it in theatres. Shyamalan's script is woven so beautifully and with such great care that the viewer will be yearning to find answers to the many questions this film forces one to develop.

The Sixth Sense starts out with a bang (with probably the best performance by Donnie Wahlberg I've ever seen on the big screen) and leaves the audience almost trembling. As the story begins after this shocking introduction, we see Bruce Willis a year later after his career has been somewhat destroyed by the terrible events that occurred a year prior. Willis plays a child psychologist, and begins treatment through brief clinical sessions with a young boy (played memorably by Haley Joel Osment). Osment seems terribly disturbed and Willis appears determined to solve this troubled boy's problems. But as the story begins to unfold and the audience learns of Osment's nightmarish ailment, Willis finds that helping this boy will take far more effort than he could have ever imagined.

It is hard to capture the beauty of The Sixth Sense in a few paragraphs, but the simplicity of its execution is enough to show that original films can still grab an audience better than any mind-blowing special effect. The Sixth Sense manages to keep the crowd attentive without a single special effect for almost two hours. This movie is not only a good thriller, but its dramatic elements will sometimes grasp at you without letting you go.

An excellent and unforgettable performance by Toni Collette and one of the greatest ghost stories ever told. If you are not a fan of horror, do not fret; this is not a horror film. But there are definitely a few good jumps to be enjoyed. This movie can be seen over and over again and will one day be known as a classic work of film-making. This is by far the most superior M.

The intruder was one of Willis' patients who had asked Willis for help but apparently Willis never listened.  Willis tries to reason with him but he shoots Willis in the stomach before taking his own life.

The next scenes follow Willis as he is assigned to help a troubled you boy who is about 10.  We suspect it is sometime after he was shot but we are not really sure until later in the movie.  The boy (Cole) has been doing strange things at school like drawing pictures of dead people and telling the teacher that the government used to hang people in the schoolhouse.  Things like this set Cole apart from all the other kids who treat him as an outcast.

Willis first encounters Cole in a church and lets Cole know that he is there to try to help him.  Cole is distrustful of Willis at first but pretty soon Willis is able to convince Cole that he is there to help him.

The picture moves at a slow pace with a few snippets of Cole's weird behavior coming through.  It is only through about halfway through the movie that Cole tells Willis why he acts the way he does.  Willis thinks that Cole's explanation is that of a sick mind but later on he will be convinced otherwise.

There are some heartwarming scenes between Cole and his mother (something strange throughout is that Cole's mother and Willis never talk about Cole - this is explained much later) and the weird way that Willis' wife seems to be treating him.  Spoiler below:

By the end of the movie Cole will come to grips with his problem and Willis and Cole's mother will come to new realizations about themselves.

In the movie, the sense is manifested in a child's ability to see ""ghosts,"" the ability to see undead people whose souls are not at rest, still troubled by what they perceive are mistakes in their past.  Many children and adults are gifted with the ability to ""see"" what other people cannot see, the ability to see what is read between the lines of the 5 normal senses.

The 6th sense is a sensory skill that can be improved through effort and education.  It is often learned best by watching socially intelligent women who have suffered greatly and have decided to try to find ways to understand and care for those hurting around them.  The 6th sense is empathy.

If a tree falls in the woods, and no one is around, it is still heard by empathetic people.  For those of us who understand the grief of losing someone, the pains do not diminish after they pass away prematurely.  Time passing does not ease the pain.  Intoxicants do not kill the pain.  We never stop remembering their light, their humor, their hopes, and our loss of connection.  Like ghosts, in the best sense of the term, we see them regularly revisit us.

To describe anything more than a bare-bones rendering of the plot would be irresponsible, but here it goes... Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) celebrates with his wife a recent award achieved helping counsel disturbed children.  Soon he meets up with the weaknesses of his past and must suffer the consequences.  For the rest of the movie he has to make it all up with a new client, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) and balance his desire to make his wife his main priority.  The juggle isn't easy, and he falters, but is honest, in both attempts to make up mistakes for his past.  The causality of another dimension presented is disturbing, yet fascinating.

The tension of the story is counterbalanced with a heart that makes more than one plot accessible and enthralling.  The performances are superb with arguably Willis' best ever.  Osment, for his part, plays a prodigy as a prodigy in what has to be one of the best (if not ""the"" best) childhood performances on film.  The supporting cast is remarkable as well.  Perhaps critics have given 'The Sixth Sense' grudging praise, for it means to unveil the supernatural in a way that is meant to mirror the real world in an unflattering way.

I first saw The Sixth Sense long after its theatrical release and so was quite removed from all the hype; I just remembered that many reviewers had described it as an intelligent psychological thriller. I was disappointed.

The so-called ""twist"" involving the Bruce Willis character was no surprise at all. In fact, it was fairly obvious almost in the very beginning, and later the director used so many awkward techniques to maintain his ""illusion"" that it became glaringly so. Try re-watching the scenes when he interacts with the boy's mother, or when he meets his wife for dinner. These are done very clumsily. Anyone remotely familiar with this type of storyline can't help but realize what is going on. Part of the problem is that the film is built around this Twilight Zone twist but as a full length movie it has to struggle to maintain the illusions far longer than a 30 minute TV episode, and ultimately fails. Another part of teh problem is that the ""twist"" itself is

so hackneyed. I can't remember all of the various stories and films that use this device, there have been so many.

That having been said, there are positive points to the film. Bruce Willis, who has a very limited range as an actor and no depth, does a descent job here, for him. Don't avoid just because of past experience with Willis. The troubled boy is played spookily well. Some of the scenes are genuinely unsettling, though the director steals a lot of the scariest more atmospheric moments from Kubrick's The Shining. The subplot surrounding the murdered girl was more interesting than the movie itself, if a bit syrupy towards the end.

Overall, if you are an experienced movie-goer, this one might hold your interest for an evening after work, if you can get past the annoyingly clumsy handling of the ""twist"" scenes. If you are younger and looking for a spooky night and maybe some new-to-you twists, enjoy!",1154044800,,2225,4.724226804123711

1070476,5,630573240X,"Much fuss is made about M. Night's killer twist at the end of this movie. And it's warranted fuss. The ending is a jaw-dropping shocker that will leave you babbling and reconstructing the movie long into the night.

But no one should be mislead into believing ""The Sixth Sense"" relies on that final revelation. The movie succeeds just fine the way the story develops before that final scene.

The magic of the movie is that it defies classical description. It's a horror movie, sure. There are moments in the film that will inspire genuine unease in even the most hardened horror fanatic. There are moments that bring you right out of your seat. There is no doubt that ""The Sixth Sense"" is a scary movie. Any place populated by the unsettled dead is going to be an uncomfortable spot to reside.

Yet, none of the spooks in the movie are added gratuitously. The appearance of each new dead man, woman or child is a natural development as the story unfolds. There is fright on the screen because the little boy's world is filled with a day-to-day horrors with whom few adults could ever cope.

Haley Joel Osment shows genius well beyond his years in this performance. You love the kid from the start because he is small, and vulnerable and seeking only the most basic sense of safety and comfort. Yet, it soon becomes apparent that there is a giant strength to the boy, as he goes to bed each night faced with a gift that bring terrors to him so unspeakable, the average person could not bear it. The average person would be carried away shrieking and insane to spend his days and nights sedated in a well-padded room. The boy's plight and his unbearable sensitivities result in scenes that are as touching and sad as they are frightening.

The concept of this movie is so unique, it seems unfair to call it a variation of the classic ghost-medium story. The boy sees dead people, it's true. But the heart of the story is in the discovery of why that is so. And that discovery causes great distress for the movie watcher, who wants to slap Bruce Willis around a few times, shake him, and scream at him to listen to the boy.

Willis' character is, of course, flawed himself. He has to battle with his own shortcomings and self-doubts before he can open himself up completely to the boy. The chillingly whispered line: ""I see dead people"" is not enough to convince a career psychologist that dead people are, in fact, afoot.

This is a movie that is firmly placed in the top three of my all-time favorites. Another viewing or two, and it could handily topple the rest and stand at number one.

From start to finish, ""The Sixth Sense"" is an amazing movie on almost every level. Filming, mood and acting are all there in near perfection. The story itself transcends the rest of it. The twist at the end? Beautiful, but mere gravy.",1146009600,,2824,4.5452755905511815

This film follows the ""reality"" of those with psychic abilities, and what they are reported to actually experience.

The music builds suspence, and Bruce Willis' journey from skepticism to belief is a nice touch.

Some flaws would be the ""disjointed"" feel the film has. It seems to meander without a real direction. Another flaw would be the ""secret""... by the time the boy says ""... I see dead people,"" most of the viewing audience is saying ""Well... duh!""

While this build up and confession is unfulfilling, the curve ball ending will make us go ""Whaaattt? How could I had missed this?"" Thus the misleading ""secret"" of the film will make us believe the script is simplistic... and the end will make us say ""sooo... this wasn't a simple story after all!""

1070562,4,630573240X,"""The #1 Thriller of all time!"" is how the movie, The Sixth Sense, is advertised.  But is ""thriller"" the best way to describe this story?  Certainly there are many shocking, startling scenes.  However, the story seems to be more of a psychological journey, colored with melancholy and sadness than most thrillers.  Granted, The Sixth Sense has many scenes that employ ""scary graphics"".  But these graphics look like they were designed by a seven-year-old.  And does the movie fit within the thriller genre when it does not have chase scenes?  The closest scene would be Malcolm walking after Cole when he had missed an appointment!  Not exactly startling or thrilling.

Although we have had this movie for a couple of years, I had not watched it until October 29, 2005 because my little brother kept telling me how terrifying it was.  I found it intriguing, but was surprised that it did not frighten me more.  I even watched it again on Sunday the 30th so that I could go through and look for slip-ups on the whole ""Malcolm is a Ghost"" idea.

The over-riding idea within this movie of Malcolm not knowing he is a ghost carried a solid emotional punch.  I found myself afraid that Malcolm's wife, Anna, was cheating on him and no longer loved him.  The director, M. Night Shymalyan, did an excellent job of masking what the truth was and because of this, when it all became clear at the end, it was even more tragic.  Throughout the movie Malcolm was under the impression that his wife was leaving him, but in fact he was the one to have left her!  He had displayed all of the symptoms of a ghost throughout the movie, but because he had been presented as a living therapist, him being a ghost was not evident.  The clues were not something that the viewer would focus on until the end of the movie when Malcolm remembers what had happened the night that he was shot.

I love the scene where he realizes that it was never his wife's fault that she was not talking to him, but that she was in fact still very devoted to him.  She repeatedly watched the video of their wedding, and went back to the restaurant he had proposed to her in.  It is a powerful scene when Malcolm comes to understand that the loneliness that he feels is about a hundred times worse for Anna because she cannot see, hear, or smell his presence any more.  She just gets cold when he is angry.

The graphics in this movie were simplistic and unimpressive.  Scary scenes were often blurred and bloody wounds were lavishly covered in fake blood.  For instance when Malcolm is shot, the camera zooms in on a clean bullet hole through the his shirt and then a growing blood stain on his back - not exactly high tech.  It was evident that a hole punch was used for the shirt, with an extreme close-up to make it look bigger than it actually was, and then fake blood from a pump was used to make it look like progressive bleeding.  In the scene where Vincent kills himself, they simply move him out of the range of the camera!  All that is heard is a gunshot and icky, squishy sounds.  And then there is the makeup used for each of the ghosts to show bruises and wounds that looked fake.  When the back of the young boys head was blown off it looked like strawberry jelly slathered in his hair.  And when the little girl ghost was throwing up it looked like oatmeal with yellow food coloring in it.  The graphics seemed absurd and predictable to me and therefore, not very scary.

Unlike most thrillers, this movie carries sweet over-tones.  The child, Cole, who has the sixth sense, is successful at maintaining his innocence no matter how horrific the ghost scenes are.  And when Cole finally tells his mother his big secret, that he sees dead people, it does not make her look at him any differently.  She loves him just the same as she always has.

Although I believe that the genre this movie was placed in was ill suited, it is still on my small list of favorite movies.  It contains messages of love and the need to understand others within the context of their lives.  Because of this, I will watch it over and over.",1134691200,,4089,4.460916442048518
1070563,4,630573240X,"In The Sixth Sense, the color red represents sanctuary and a sense of feeling safe, as well as a sign of fear because the use of red with Cole signifies his wanting to be safe from the ghosts, and because the red also shows the first signs of ghosts and fear. Furthermore, the use of red throughout the movie gives certain hints to the fact that something happened.

 Being a young boy who sees ghosts can be terrifying. The sense of feeling safe could be extremely hard to find, especially if the ghosts appear at anytime. Cole, the boy, is left with only his mother after his parent's divorce. This seems to be the main problem, but later on in the movie, we realize that it's not that at all. Cole sees dead people. These ghosts scare him so he finds places where he feels safe. He often goes into the church, which has bright red doors. In the church, he plays by himself and stays there as often as he can. He also steals a small statue of Jesus, who is wearing a red robe. This stands out because the Jesus is the only statue wearing red. He then takes it back to his house, where he has a red fort in his room made out of blankets. Inside the tent, he has many figurines of Jesus and crucifixes. He feels that the fort is his sanctuary from the ghosts.

 Dr. Crow, played by Bruce Willis, is a child psychologist who tries to help Cole through his problems. Once a bond is formed between Cole and Dr. Crow, Cole tells him his secret of seeing ghosts. Dr. Crow is skeptical of this, of course, but later finds similarities between Cole and an old patient of his. He finds that not only is Cole telling the truth, but his past patient also had the ""sixth sense"" of seeing the dead. Dr. Crow finds his sanctuary in the basement of his house. In the basement, he holds all this past records of old patients, and does research in order to help Cole. Oddly enough, the door to the basement is all white, but the doorknob is red. This stands out against the white and shows that the basement is where he feels safe and where he can find some answers.

 Even though red symbolizes the feeling of being safe, it also shows fear and the first signs of ghosts. Cole doesn't fit in and he realizes this. He dreads going to school everyday. The school is painted red, and shows his fear of not fitting in, and also shows that maybe something happened earlier there. Later on, Cole tells us that the school used to be an old courthouse where they hung people. He knows this because he sees ghosts hanging from the ceiling. Dr. Crow talks to Cole about his problems and asks him if he ever writes upset words. These are words that come randomly that one just writes downs without knowing what they are writing. Cole has done this, and it shows the writings that he did, which are in red ink. Throughout the movie, Anna, Dr. Crow's wife, seems very distant from him. He finds pills in the bathroom that are for depression. He has no idea what is going on, but the pills are red, which can symbolize her inner fear of losing him. Red can either show fear or sanctuary.

 The use of red also shows that something happened that the audience isn't aware of. For instance, a young girl visits Cole and wants to tell him to give her father a box. Cole and Dr. Crow went to the girl's funeral to find that the mother of the girl was keeping her sick. When the mother is first shown, she is wearing a bright red dress at a funeral. She stands out against all the black. This shows that there is something going on that the audience doesn't know about.

 The Sixth Sense is a great movie that has plenty of twists and turns that keeps the audience hooked from the opening scene. If you're a person who wants to be able to sit there and think about everything you just saw when the movie is over, then The Sixth Sense is the right movie for you.",1134518400,,3826,4.27939142461964

First off, it was extremely difficult for me to watch because I understood exactly what the character Cole was going through and his fear is exactly what I've gone through. No, folks, I don't see dead people. If they're strong enough, I feel them. That unwanted ability makes me relate all the more to Cole's  fear of actually seeing dead people. Until I saw the rules and clues section of the DVD I had no clue that Bruce Willis' character was dead. It was an ingenious plot twist that I'll never tire of. Do I scoff at the other tricks some people might perceive the filmakers' playing on you? No. It happens. Those with open minds can enjoy this film. Those with preconceived expections that aren't met because of a closed mind look for things wrong. The key here is freeing yourself of preconceived notions about a very real topic.

The second time you'll notice more. This is a very intelligent film, and it ""gets"" those more who have had experiences with paranormal, death, loss, and grief, and even fear. I wouldnt say it's just a horror, but it's creepy enough to be called that, but it's also a drama, because at times haley joel osment's acting is so terrific that it's touching, espeically when he cries. I've never seen a more genuine actor at his age. He has alot of talent. And the parts where he was acting ""terrified"" was more realistic than i've ever seen in any movie.

Haley And Bruce were great together in this film. This movie is perfect in my opinion. No flaws as far as i am concerned.

There are probably many life lessons you haven't learned yet. Watch this movie in 5 years and if you still hate it, i almost feel bad for you.

Poltergeist, exoricist. Certain movies, bring a certain kind of energy, and to people who are involved in the making of these kind of movies. I think that, to make a good movie, you have to kind of live it, live the role, breathe, eat and sleep, the role you are given. You almost become that person you play in the movie, and by doing that you open your mind to things  you wouldnt normally. So it makes sense that some spirit activity occured, and some paranormal activity was reported to have happened on the set.

I, Jameson Thottam, waited an extra month to see this movie. With all the hype, I, Jameson Thottam, was set up to be disappointed! I, Jameson Thottam, wasn't! Cool movie! I, Jameson Thottam, was interested all the way through, and loved the ending!

The kid in this move was perfect for the part. His Mom was believable! I, for one, get tired of all the ""perfect 10"" Hollywood versions of Mom! This Mom was a real one; hard working, loving, divorced single parent. The kid had a right to be screwed up....but he wasn't!

Bruce was convincing as a child psychiatrist. He only slips back into the Bruce Willis we all know and love once, when he calls a friend of his wife ""Cheesedick"". (What a name! What kind of cheese, I wonder?)

He is compassionate, thorough and very psychiatrist-like, except for his need to look up stuff in the dictionary. Oh well, no one said he was a BRILLIANT psychiatrist. Maybe he was dyslexic. In any case, it is hard to fault the structure and theme of this movie; it was tight, with very few loose ends (trust me, it will all make even six levels of sense at the end!)

My natural tendency is to compare the flick with ""A Stir of Echoes"", which has a similar story and features Kevin Bacon. I like Kevin Bacon's role, as well as the movie, but I think ""Sixth Sense"" is a better movie, mainly because of the better writing. I, Jameson Thottam, recommend watching it, even 2 or 3 times.

Now if you know me, Jameson Thottam, you know I have to add a ""but"" to this review. Granted my hearing is't what it used to be, but I kept having to turn the volume up just to hear what was being said. Hey, you sound guys need to help here! I didn't think Bruce's wife did much acting, although none was required. This was pretty much a two-person show. There were some emotional sequences in the kid's dialogue that didn't make much sense to me, but they didn't ask for my help directing so let it be merely my opinion.

I, Jameson Thottam, kind of wish we had a few more examples of this kid's seeing ""dead people"" but the movie stays interesting without it.

If that's a masterpiece, you better start picking up trash and framing it because I just saw the Mona Lisa roll by in the form of a slightly crushed pepsi can. And if this is original, I just saw a xerox copy machine create the most innovative work to date (Jacob's Ladder did this 15 years ago people).

I've seen Unbreakable and Signs too, both the same formula as this film. All Shyamalan's movies are typical sappy Hollywood dramas 99.9% of the time then he comes up with the stupid endings. Pretty much his movies are essentially nothing but an excuse to show some gimmicky twist at the end so the general public (because no true horror fan is eating this stuff up) could pat themselves on the back and say ""I am not close-minded, I like all genres of movies such as horror"", the same way so many clueless pre-packaged cultured fools think they're into ""sophisitcated music"" when they watch VH1. The ending sure was the best part, not because it was shocking, but because at that point I knew this atrocity was over.

When I brought the movie home to watch it, I guess it has its scary moments, but overall it's NOT a scary movie, I mean, how can it be counted as a scary movie when the message of the movie is NOT meant to scare you: Ghosts can be just as lost as anybody and sometimes need help, so you shouldn't be afraid of them. Tell you the truth, I am a very easily scared person, *Seriously I am*, I have been avoiding horror movies ever since I was seven because I watched this movie which I thought of now is kinda ridiculous but it scared the crap outta me, but The Sixth Sense did not scare me at all, I don't even think it should be qualified as a scary movie, it's pretty much in the same category as those ghost-inserted action movie but without the action.

1070731,5,630573240X,"This is a film that has withstood the test of time. Despite viewing this haunting tale many times, and knowing its surprise ending, the story continues to intrigue, and still manages to reveal little nuances, details about the plot, that was missed during prior viewings. It is that type of picture, which should be studied, as it is a near perfect film.

The Sixth Sense launched M. Night Shyamalan as a major writer and director with his own particular style of filmmaking. The Sixth Sense, fortunately, was not a one off, as Shyamalan has gone on to make further excellent films such as Unbreakable, Signs and The Village. This talented young man seems to have an innate gift for creating suspense and those subtle and not so subtle aspects of life that can cause us deep fear, things that truly frighten, without having to shove it in our faces. There are too many directors out there who feel they have to explode and shock, CGI-ing their audiences to death, in order to somehow keep us interested. These kinds of films have their place, however, the truly frightening films, like The Sixth Sense, rivets us to our chairs with subtle twists and turns, long suspenseful silences and the unexpected.

A good example of this subtlety is right at the beginning of the film. The psychologist and his wife are having a celebration in their home. The doctor has won an award from the mayor and they're getting seriously stuck into the wine. Finishing a bottle, she goes down stairs to the cellar alone to retrieve another. The camera is placed behind the wine rack, as we view her reaching for a bottle, giving the distinct impression or perception, that we are in the room with her. She appears to hear something, voices, and her once joyful expression subtlety changes to one of fear. As the audience, we feel something terrible is about to happen, but we don't know exactly when or how.

Another example is the many surprise manifestations of the dead that we see through the little boy's eyes. One of the more disturbing scenes is the woman in the dressing gown that he mistakes for his mother. He walks into the kitchen and the woman turns around revealing a battered face and fresh scars on her wrist from an attempted suicide. ""See what you've done to me!"" she screams. ""Look what I have to put up with!"" as the little boy runs to his room to hide in his tent, which he has made as a makeshift chapel, his sanctuary, away from the dead.

We all enjoy the occasional scare, and there's nothing like a good ghost story to do it. What I find incredible about this film, though, is despite seeing it several times, knowing the story and its many surprises, it still manages to hold my attention and continues to create that feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. The word ""classic"" has been bandied around a lot and attributed to films that don't deserve the label, but The Sixth Sense, in my opinion, deserves to be called a true classic of the genre, as it will continue to be appreciated for years to come.",1115683200,,3014,4.575925925925926

Everything just works to perfection here from the direction, scripting, casting, and the technical attributes.  Director M. Night Shyamalan was totally on his game with this film.  His story works not on just a psychological level but also on a supernatural one.  The film is augmented by the eerie camerawork of Tak Fujimoto that give locations in Philadelphia that I'm familiar with a creepy feel that I otherwise would not attribute to them.  Bruce Willis has never been better as Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who is recovering from physical as well as psychological wounds.  Haley Joel Osment is a complete revelation as Cole Sear, a troubled youth suffering from the recent divorce of his parents and visions that are inhabiting his imagination.  Toni Collette gives a heatbreaking turn as Cole's mother.  Olivia Williams is also effective as Crowe's wife who he feels distant from because of recent events.  This film is, of course, remembered primarily for it's twist ending which I will not divulge here for the few who haven't seen this film.  This film is so effective that it would work even without it.  In my mind I think Shyamalan was spoiled by the success of this film.  In subsequent films he has has been trying to capture lightning in a jar by succumbing to audience expectations only to disappoint to some degree.  He should realize that what made ""The Sixth Sense"" such a success was good story and good characterization.  He seems to be writing the endings first and then building the story around it.

I already had a general idea of the plot of ""The Sixth Sense,"" but I didn't actually expect to be lured in and blown away a second time. And that's exactly what happened.

As with ""Signs,"" the resolution of ""The Sixth Sense"" caught me completely off-guard and had quite an impact. I'd heard about an unexpected twist at the end, but that's all. Fortunately, I'd managed to avoid all spoilers. (Whew.)

I sometimes joke that ""Signs"" is the first ""alien"" movie that's ever moved me to tears (call me sappy, but it's true). Now I can joke that ""The Sixth Sense"" is the first ""ghost"" movie that's induced me to start bawling like a little kid - not because I'm scared, but because I genuinely feel for the characters and what they're going through. Both of these movies resonate with me as few films have.

I watched ""The Sixth Sense"" with the intent of not trying to figure anything out and just letting it take me where it wanted me to go. What a payoff I got.

I realize that M. Night's style isn't for everyone, but to me, his approach to filmmaking is a welcome throwback to a time before we had pull-out-all-the-stops blockbuster movies bursting at the seams with CGI and other high-tech special effects. He shows us ""ordinary"" people in extraordinary situations and we get to see how they react -- while at the same time, we are kept off-balance by things we *don't* see.

""The Sixth Sense"" moves slowly and deliberately. Some folks might find the pace plodding or boring, but I don't. In fact, the relatively low-key atmosphere of the film makes the story seem more real to me.

Haley Joel Osment is an amazing actor. His abilities go way beyond his young years, making ""The Sixth Sense"" much more than a ""cute little kid in peril"" story. Bruce Willis' performance is skillfully nuanced and understated -- a far cry from his ""Die Hard"" days (although I like him in those kinds of movies, too). The supporting cast, including a virtually unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg, is top-notch.

The DVD includes some great extras. There are four deleted scenes, a conversation with M. Night, an interesting piece called ""Rules and Clues"" about the conventions followed throughout the movie and the subtle hints about what's really going on, as well as other goodies.

I hope M. Night keeps doing what he's doing for a long time to come. I think he's an incredibly talented filmmaker, and I think ""The Sixth Sense"" is a first-rate movie. This is a DVD that I know I'll be watching again and again.",1093478400,,2700,4.631799163179917

Heck ? the investigation of the supernatural has become a billion dollar business for ?psychics? like John Edwards who have legions of fans buying their books, attending their shows, and buying into their ridiculous mumbo-jumbo ? but why do we do it? Is it natural curiosity into the concept of death? Is it the fear of something beyond our comprehension? Is it our natural insecurity and the paranoia that we not alone? There are no direct answers to those questions, and there may never be, but as long as Hollywood keeps making the focus of their films, we will come.

The story centers on a boy who believes he can see ghosts and a psychiatrist who must find a way to help this child cope with his special ability that may unravel a mysterious truth not only for the boy but for himself as well. Dr. Malcolm Crowe is one of the best child psychiatrists in the city of Philadelphia. In fact, he was awarded a special honor by the mayor of Philadelphia himself ? the very same night a former patient of his named Vincent Grey breaks into his home. At first Malcolm struggles to remember him but as Vincent rambles on about details of the counseling, he begins to recall a young boy who shy, quiet, well behaved, and what he believed at the time was an inability to coup with the divorce of his parents. But Vincent believes that he has been cursed and Dr. Crowe has failed in promise to help the boy. Clearly at the end of his rope, Vincent Grey decides to end his life by shooting himself in the head but not before he gets one shot out on Dr. Crowe. Time passes and Malcolm Crowe returns to his job, though he has yet to fully recover mentally from the strange encounter. He is visiting a young boy by the name of Cole Sear ? an unusual little boy who hides out in a church and speaks Latin while playing with tiny soldier figures in between the benches. Cole?s mother who is separated from her husband is at her wits end. Not only does she have to balance two jobs to keep the small household supported but Cole?s alarming behavior has taken a huge toll on her ability to go about a normal routine with a calm mind. And don?t believe that Malcolm?s life is any less hectic ? not only is he desperately trying to redeem himself for the failure over Vincent Grey with young Cole but his marriage is failing and he is doing everything possible to help reconcile with his wife. But when young Cole reveals his secret that his has the ability to see ghosts, who want him to do things for them, Malcolm is reminded of Vincent Grey and that he will do anything he can to prevent Cole from meeting the same end. The story of The Sixth Sense stands alone as one of the best super-natural thrillers in years, if not of all time. Shymalan, who before this film was not known for this type of genre, truly makes a name for himself with this thought-provoking and riveting script. The ending is not quite as shocking to those who pay attention to the little bits and pieces Shyamalan places throughout the film to clue audiences into what is to come, but none the less it was disappointing either and that?s all that matters.

The cast for the film, though large in a sense when considering the numerous amount of characters with screen-time less then two minutes, is small in scale, especially when one considers that the film mainly centers on the actions of Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis. Haley Joel Osment, who is best known for his small appearance in the Academy Award-winning Forrest Gump, showcases his uncanny ability for acting by successfully pulling off one of the most challenging performances a director can give a child of his age, let alone any actor with as less experience as he has on screen. By taking on the role of Cole Sear, Osment not only has to play the victim in the sense that he wants Dr. Crowe to make the ghosts go away, but he switches roles continually throughout the film from the victim to that of an encouraging hero. Along with that, the way he and Bruce Willis act off of each other is so natural that the audience becomes attached to these characters and becomes deeply involved into what happens around them. Bruce Willis, more known for his adrenaline powered roles in such action-dramas as the Die Hard series then films of this nature, proves to audiences once again, as he did in Quentin Tarantino?s Pulp Fiction, that can slip into the more emotionally charged roles with losing any of the masculine mystic that you find so blatantly his action films. And, borrowing a page from Alfred Hitchcock?s directing book, M. Night Shyamalan makes an appearance in the film as Dr. Hill, the doctor who examines Cole after he is trapped in a closet. It?s not a whole lot of screen-time but it?s a wonderful surprise for those who know what they are looking for.

Overall, The Sixth Sense, despite lacking the exhilarating punch that had been promised as the film?s ending (if you paid attention to clues, it was kind of obvious), wipes the floor of its predecessors and redefines the genre that had been typically by mindless slasher flicks for far too long. This is not to say that the film?s ending is not a surprise ? to some it may be but for those who pay attention reasonably close to the clues placed throughout the film, it may come as a bit of a let down but not one that will ruin the entire film for you. Don?t go into this film with all the built-up hype the media and fellow movie-goers have place in your head. If you go into this film with a clear mind, not expecting anything more then an entertaining and intelligent thriller, then you will have a better appreciation for M. Night Shyamalan?s work then some people may have. Everything comes together so brilliantly in this film that is hard to find a film in the past few years that matches the exact effect The Sixth Sense is able to pull off ? the chilling musical score, brilliant performances, complex dialogue, intricate script, and clever direction, all of which work together and never seem to outbalance one another. If there anything to complain about this is that does tend to drag a little near the end but this is minor complaint that doesn?t match up exceedingly with the good that is presented in this film. The Sixth Sense is not strictly warranted to those who only believe in the concept of ghosts, but for those who enjoy the idea of being scared out of their seats even by a concept they themselves don?t believe in.",1090454400,,6760,4.507742461287694

 Not so much scary as it is just plain creepy (far worse in my opinion), this movie goes for a couple of big ""jump out of your seat"" moments, which usually happen after long periods of creepy, suspenseful build up. For several nights after I saw this movie I had to make sure that the lights were on in whatever room I was in. As a die-hard horror/thriller fan, it takes a LOT to spook me like this one did.

 The acting is pretty good, although I don't think it was the Oscar-calliber that the movie's hype led me to expect.

Staring Bruce Willis as child psychologist Malcolm Crowe and Haley Osment and the disturb child Cole Sear, The Sixth Sense is both a psychological thriller and a horror movie at the same time.  Terrifying visions of dead people haunts the child, Cole. He has learned to repress what he sees for fear of being called insane.  So at first, we see it as a psychological thriller.  Later, we learn that the visions are real, so perhaps we are watching a horror flick, but as the move progresses it never degenerates into a silly horror movie, but keeps its psychological edge.
Although Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors, I am afraid that I have underestimated his acting ability.  This is an outstanding movie that grabs your attention and does not let go until the final credits roll.  And the ending, oh yes, it was a surprise- I did not see it coming.  If you have not seen this movie, rent it now.  You will want to watch it several times.  It is that good.  Not a movie for the faint of heart or your wee ones- it will give them nightmares for a week; but if you are looking for a first rate psychological thriller you may want to add this to your DVD collection.",1088899200,,1399,4.285171102661597
1070985,5,630573240X,"M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE has ranked high on my list of favorite films ever since its 1999 theatrical release.
First of all, it hits close to home.  Why?  First off, Shyamalan graduated from Waldron Mercy Academy, my private Catholic school, back when it was Waldron Academy and all-boys.  Today, the nationally renowned school is coed.  Second, THE SIXTH SENSE is filmed in the bustling city of Philadelphia, PA, very close to where I lived.  I recognized most, if not all of the places shown in Shyamalan's thriller.
That said, it didn't necessarily mean I was going to automatically enjoy the film.  At the age of 11, I was hasty to see it.  But my Daddy, as usual, bribed me into it, assuring me I wouldn't regret seeing the movie.
""Whatever,"" I muttered as he dragged me to the neighborhood cinema.
I had set my standards low.  I arrived in the theatre, expecting a Pepsi, a Hershey bar, and a nap.
I was pleasantly surprised.  In fact, I was elated!
The talented Bruce Willis takes on the role of psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, very distinguished in his profession.  Haley Joel Osment, newcomer to the big screen, plays Cole Sear, a disturbed 8 year-old.  His mother, up in arms about what to do with her withdrawn and unhappy son, calls Dr. Crowe to help sort out the situation.  Mrs. Sear, a single parent, is wonderfully played by Toni Colette, who brings life and significance to her character, giving off a near immaculate 3-dimensional performance.
Cole is blessed.  Or is he cursed?  You decide.  He has been bestowed/cursed with the power of the sixth sense, a skill both ugly and horrible, in a sense.  Cole, with this magical skill, can help others.  Yet at the same time, his sixth sense haunts him to the point of insanity.  ""I see dead people,"" he eventually explains to Dr. Crowe.  Indeed, young Cole speaks the harrowing truth.  He sees ghostly apparations that haunt him by night and show themselves by day, terrifying and confusing him to no end.  Alas, Dr. Crowe is unprepared when Cole enlightens him with this information.
Yet this new knowledge is a beginning for various journeys.  Together, the doctor and his young patient travel to places previously unbeknownst to them.  Their adventures lead them to both saddening truths and irrevocable consequences.
THE SIXH SENSE proves to a fickle audience, namely America, that special effects aren't required to make a superb and memorable horror film.  M. Night Shyamalan's unforgettable effort (not his first, FYI) is bone chilling, dazzling, and beautiful, with performances that either launched careers or furthered them.  This film is a masterpiece, no matter how you try to look at it, and it deserved all 6 of its Oscar nods.  Yes, it broke my heart when it didn't win any...

1070988,5,630573240X,"The Sixth Sense
The Sixth Sense (1997) directed by M. Night Shyamalan, which he wrote and plays the part of Dr. Hill, a psychiatrist, is a timely masterpiece.  The late 90's was a time for increased and renewed spiritually.  Many individuals were and are still seeking answers to what happens after we die.  Shyamalan was born in India where belief in reincarnation is very strong.  While he was born in India he grew up in the United States in Philadelphia.  There is a quality of ""other world ness"" or ""wholly unknown"" that he brings to the screen.  What some have only imagined or ""wholly sensed"" he brings to life on film.  His works include Signs (2002) and currently he is in post production of The Village (2004).  What he and fellow director Jerry Zucker (Ghost, 1990) both portray through the genres of drama, mystery, and thriller is: Unfinished business keeps you around after you die.
Unfinished business is what keeps Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist around for a while.  Despite the fact that his grieving wife has not been able to let him completely go- she plays home movies to keep him close, for a while.  Individuals do sense sometimes their loved ones who have passed on are right beside them.  This could be in the role of protector, as in Ghost, where Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) tries to protect his girlfriend Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) from harm, or as a guardian angel.  One theme within both films is that of coming to terms with oneself and to be at peace.  This was accomplished for Sam when he was able to communicate his message through Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), thus saving Molly from certain death.  In The Sixth Sense Crowe feels guilty about not being able to help is de-ranged ex-client.  To do penance for that he tries to help, and succeeds in doing so, Cole.  Cole for his part learns to face his fears, and works with his gift instead of against it.  He helps the dead girl communicate a message to her father about her death.  Through the process Crowe walks with Cole, afterwards he is able to let go, but first he whispers into his wife's ear how much he loves her.
What makes this film and others like it so interesting is that our society has within it a sub-culture of those who believe in the supernatural.  The popularity of Crossing Over with Jonathan Edwards attests to this fact, as well as It's a Miracle.  People want answers and will go to almost any length to get them.  Many individuals have testified that they have either sensed or seen deceased family members at one time or another.  The Sixth Sense is a great film for those of us with imagination and also for those without imagination.",1086134400,,2656,4.59447983014862

Cast:  Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Haley Joel Osment, Glenn Fitzgerald.
Running Time:  108 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for ghastly scenes, violence, and mild language.
""The Sixth Sense"" is M. Night Shyamalan's first major studio directorial production, yet a rookie mistake is not present in this masterful ghost thriller that has become one of the most prestigous and talked-about horror-dramas of all time.  The film begins with an up-and-coming child psychologist (Bruce Willis, in his most exceptional role to date) celebrating his new-found success with his wife (played by Olivia Williams).  The night is going splendidly; however, a failed child of the psychologist takes his frustration out, shooting him before taking his own life.
A year transpires after this horrific event, with Willis's character still trying to piece back the puzzle that was lost on that night.  The psychologist meets a troubled youngster played by the Oscar-nominated Osment, who happens to have a special sense that allows him to see and speak to ghosts.  At first terrifyed of the ghouls, Willis instructs the child to help the ""dead people"" instead of being afraid.
The film is brilliantly directed and scripted, twisting and turning until the much-heralded resolution.  While Willis and Osment's performances are hauntingly special, Toni Collette's role as the tormented mother of Osment is the shining star of the film, delivering a powerful performance.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is a deep, terrifying look into the world of the supernatural, but unfolds into a film about faith, love, and unbridled second chances.  A soulful masterpiece that will send chills up spines.",1085184000,,1695,5.390151515151516

I love this movie and watch it regularly just like Shyamalan's other film ""Signs"". I love Shyamalan's work. His movies are emotional and of course scary and you really get into the movie. I can't wait to see his new film ""The Village"". But BUY THIS DVD if you haven't yet. It's an AWESOME movie and will spook the hell out of you.",1084838400,,506,4.173469387755102
1070991,4,630573240X,"The first time you watch this film, you'll be shocked. The second time, you'll learn to look for all the clues. If you watch it more than twice, you'll spot pretend clues, and wonder if they mean anything. And eventually, you will know the film back to front.
For first time watchers, this movie is terrific. It's almost terrifying to watch, and horrible to try and work out what exactly is happening to Cole, and also, the lovely Bruce Willis.
If you watch carefully, you'll notice the colour red plays a big part in this movie, particularly when something's about to happen, or is happening. Although, after a while, you start noticing things that are red, that have nothing to do with danger (the mum quite often has red nail varnish and wears a red top in the last couple of scenes and there are red candles in the house). But just watching for these clues again had something to the movie that it didn't have the first time watching.
Some people say that the film was so predictable, cos they knew from the opening scenes what was going to happen (when Malcolm, Bruce Willis' character, got shot). Well, it wasn't so obvious to me the very first time I watched it. However, films that are too predictable, are rubbish. I would have hated to have known all along what the ending was.
Both Bruce & Haley (Joel Osment) are so cute in this movie. Don't know what it is about Brucie in this, he looks kinda rough sometimes, but it just adds to the whole loveliness of him!
This is a movie that will stay with you for ages afterwards. Whether it was the constant emails, particularly after the Queen Mother died, with her picture in stills from the movie, or its repeats on TV - you'll be reminded of this great movie constantly.

The thing I had trouble understanding when I viewed this film at the theater was his being able to interact with the child if he were dead.  I kept wanting him to be alive and well.  Apparently, the little boy was the only person to be able to see and talk with him.
The strange things which continued to happen to the psychic kid were unusual to say the least.  His acting was not juvenile but more on the adult level.  He is a good little trouper.
Dealing with the psychiatric deviants as this character had done in his professional life turned out to be dangerous and deadly.  The director seems to delve into the inner workings of the minds of non-average misfits, and turns out a suspenseful and powerful story with a message.",1082937600,,950,4.514619883040936

Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is starting to doubt himself after getting shot by a failed pshycology patient. But when he meets little Cole (Haley Joel Osment) he knows he can't fail another patientor he'll never forgive himself. Meanwhile, Cole is having problems of his own. He is beginning to see things that are there, but aren't there to people who still exist. They're all dead. This is known to Cole as the Sixth sense. For him, he just wants to get rid of it, so he'll have to just talk it out with them. They just want to talk. Maybe it just might help him, and them.

1071058,3,630573240X,"This movie depends on two things. How much you figure out before it ends and how much you have invested yourself in this movie. The two go hand in hand. The truth is that many people figured out the ending within the first few minutes on the bases that they simply ""heard"" it had a great twist. It is actually not that hard to figure out even if you just hear the plot alone and couple that with the fact it has a twist. If you view this film without having heard anything beforehand you are in a much better position to enjoy it, but there is a margin out there who will get it and will only enjoy it because other people did not get it and there is some fun to be had in knowing that other people where played with. Do not believe for a moment that people who say they got it are lying about that. I know plenty of people who got it and the film thus did not have the desired impact that it retains throughout the whole slow affair for that final manipulation of the audience.
The truth be told that the whole weight of this somewhat low-budget film is based on the twist. The actual production values are somewhat minimal. You can see that the producers of this flick had trimmed as much as they could on the budget knowing that the impact of the final reel would more than makeup for putting this flick out on the cost that it was made on. There was no risk involved in doing that but obviously it was a financial strategy that worked out for everybody involved. You can see that everyone was happy with the gamble and it paid off. Could you imagine if this film had a bunk ending or a twist that was not very good? The whole film then looks like Bruce Willis just hooked up with a film student for the hell of it.
The actual acting on display here is not cutting edge but Haley Joel Osment does walk circles around everyone including Willis. Osment is a very important casting decision here. Without him it would loose some impact. The film's pace is dreadfully slow and it does stall at times. However if you are looking for a payoff then you will get a whooper of a payoff here, unless you fall into the marginal category who have got it and then must sit out the rest of this slow journey until your suspicions are finally unmasked.
This is a great twist of a movie, but not such a great movie. Again the premise, plot and structure is based on that ending, a small gamble because of the strength of the twist, but still it leaves the vast majority of this movie somewhere around mediocre with limitations that do show themselves now and again. Sometimes the acting is actually not very good and is a little on the experimental ""new"" side which does not suite having an A-list actor at the helm.
So the verdict here is five stars if you are oblivious to everything until the end but only three stars if you get it and must watch through the whole slow affair.",1073606400,,2867,4.252747252747253
1071138,5,630573240X,"I am always skeptical of overly hyped films and directors. Prior to seeing ""The Sixth Sense"", I would have described both the movie and Shyamalan as being over-hyped.
Now that I've seen it, I have to admit that the bang-to-hype ratio is surprisingly high. This is an outstanding movie!
What must it be like to be a small boy who ""sees dead people""? As a former kid-with-an-overly-active-imagination who had a staircase to the attic in my bedroom closet, I never saw dead people, but I sure had my share of sleepless nights imaging to closet door opening on its own. I thought Haley Joel Osment's performance was extraordinary.
I already knew the ""big twist"" before I saw ""The Sixth Sense"", but I found that it didn't matter. I was able to enjoy the story and the performances on their own merits.
With very little graphic gore and few jump-out-and-get-you moments, Shyamalan is able to keep the suspense level very high. Unlike most of the horror/suspense movies made today, which rely on a lot of technology, stunts, and effects, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a throwback. It could easily have been made in the 40s or 50s, given the level of technology required to pull it off. This is a movie-maker's movie, not a technologist's. I found it refreshing and all the more enjoyable for that.
Shyamalan has a ways to go before he earns the title of ""The Next Spielberg"", but he's well on his way to the top of the field.

Only Cole sees him, not his mother, so she couldn't have let him in, and he wouldn't have just walked in either, since he doesn't know that he's dead. How did he get in there?

  The heart of soul of the film is Cole Sear, a disturbed nine year-old who hides his run-ins with ghosts from everyone around him, including his mother. Actor Haley Joel Osment gives a stunningly mature and good performance, especially judging from the fact that he was not yet a teenager at the time. He is uniformly believable, and his character is very real--he is not one of those movie characters that makes you sick and eager to get the movie over with.
  Bruce Willis, playing the child phsychologist Malcolm Crowe, gives a very quiet performance, but still with plenty of feeling. He is not at all dry.
  You can tell from the get-go that M. Night Shyamalan is a master at his craft. The entire feel of the movie is perfect. From the silent views of doors inside a house, to an angry voice shouting from behind a door, he keeps up a very expectant suspense.

1071185,5,630573240X,"This is my taste in horror movies.  Some people go for the gore-fests, some go for films that are just shocking and disturbing.  Nothing wrong with that.  I myself just prefer something with a little more depth to it than most of the films in that category.
The Sixth Sense, from writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, is fully satisfactory.  This is possibly Bruce Willis' best role to date.  The movie itself will probably remain one of my favorites for years to come.
Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist.  It goes badly one night when one of his former patients now grown up takes a gun to the doctor in his own home, claiming that Crowe never helped him.  Fast-forward several months, to see Crowe trying to help young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who is affected by the same symptoms as the patient who shot Malcolm before committing suicide.
Malcolm is determined to try and save Cole from himself, but learns that Cole is the unwilling bearer of a strange and macabre gift: the ability to see and communicate with the dead.  At first, Crowe is unwilling to believe it, but as the film progresses, he begins to believe Cole and helps him to overcome his fear of the ghosts, instead speaking with them to try and bring them to a resolution that allows them to move on to the next life.  In other words, Cole is given the duty, the destiny, of putting restless spirits at ease.
The eventual twist ending was quite a shocker, though many of you have probably already heard it from friends yammering about how either they never saw it coming, or lying and said they knew it the whole time.  These twist endings are sort of a trademark for Shyamalan, as are his directing techniques.
One thing I particularly liked about his style, was his usage of symbolism and atmosphere.  Throughout the film, doors and windows always symbolize something significant.  It isn't until you see the whole film that you understand this, though.  Another subtlety in the film is the usage of the color red.  All of the other colors seem muted, but red stands out.  And it's so well-executed, you don't even realize it unless you're actively looking for it.
In addition to the creepy psychological facets of the film, there were also a few shocking moments carefully placed throughout to create a greater sense of tension and dread.  There were also a couple disturbing aspects touched upon to give the film a heavier atmosphere.  These moments are made all the more disturbing by the fact that some of the acts people commit in the film are based on real mental illnesses.
Overall, I give The Sixth Sense 5 stars.  Bruce Willis turns in a much better performance than some of his other recent works, Haley Joel Osment is refreshing in his incredible talent for someone his age, and Shyamalan provides a compelling story with memorable characters and some of the finest, most innovative directing approaches I've seen in a while.
This is all, of course, just one man's opinion.  I'm not going to tell you that you will or will not like it, but if you enjoy the sort of stuff I've described above, it's at least worth giving a shot, right?",1065139200,,3133,4.653357531760435
1071186,3,630573240X,"This is a very interesting movie. The characters are beautifully played. The plot is certainly an interesting one. It's really more like a mystery than a thriller. You spend a lot of time trying to figure out why the dead are bothering this kid. You go through the same efforts that the psychologist does to figure out how to help him.
Also, this DVD release includes some very cool deleted scenes. Often, the deleted scenes are deleted because they didn't add anything to the movie, but these were deleted basically because they added too much. They were cut for time, or because they ""gave away too much"".  The director's commentary is also great.  I give the special features of this movie Five stars.
The downside to this movie is that once you've seen the ending or figured it out, it doesn't have much rewatch value. You may go back once or twice to find all of the ""clues"", but once you've done that, you probably won't want to watch it again.",1062979200,,950,4.549707602339181

This is the movie's stand-out quote.  It shows M. Night Shamayalan's brilliance as a producer, director, and writer.  He incorporated one of his childhood fantasies into ""The Sixth Sense"" and added some of his own ideas giving it a brilliant storyline.  The symbolisms(ex. the color red) give it that added uniqueness.  Shamayalan proves that he'll become the next Steven Spielberg someday.
Haley Joel Osment deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role of Cole Sear.  He expresses Sear's fears and trials much better than most other 11-year old actors are capable.  This powerful performance excites many to discover his performances while he's growing up and as an adult.
The rest of the cast is amazing: Toni Collette, Bruce Willis, Trevor Morgan, Olivia Williams, etc.  Everybody, including Osment, has that special chemistry amongst one another.  They provoke their emotions into their audience.  When a character fears, the audience fears.  When a character rages, the audience rages.  These define the meaning of ""The Sixth Sense's"" storyline and environment.  They force the audience think about the story elements rather than revealing them bluntly.  This allows the audience to constantly watch it and learn new elements everytime.  One may constantly whisper to their friends, ""I see dead people"" due to the movie addiction.",1059091200,,1380,5.328703703703703

1071194,5,630573240X,"What surprised me most about The Sixth Sense is how cerebral it is considering that after all, it is a horror film.  It is not exactly a horror film, because obviously, there are no unrealistically macabre sequences and the ""dead people"" aren't menacing or sinister, whose unfinished business is to kill and destroy, but to serve as guides of compassion.  However, The Sixth Sense is a horror film, in that it grips you psychologically, that leaves you with an unsettling feeling in your stomach.
The Sixth Sense is a story that is founded on the relationship of Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a highly acclaimed child psychologist and Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a disturbed nine year-old of whom is bestowed the gift and or the curse of communicating with the spirits of the deceased.  The story starts off with Malcolm and his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams resting comfortably at home.  Their peace is interrupted, when an intruder, who turns out to be one of Malcolm's former child patients by the name of Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg), breaks into the couple's bathroom.  Now as an adult, Gray is distraught and suicidal and he exacts a measure of revenge on Malcolm before taking his own life.  Bouncing back a year later, Malcolm encounters the extremely sensitive, troubled Cole, who is an unhappy outcast amongst his peers because of his paranormal psychic ability.  Looking to dispatch the lingering emotional pain of watching and ""causing"" Vincent Gray's suicide and its effect on his life, especially his marriage, Malcolm urges Cole to confront these spirits and to pick up on what they want.  Meanwhile, Malcolm attempts to mend his marriage with Anna, because she simply would not talk to him and in the mouth-dropping climax which is quite reminiscent of the Ambrose Bierce short story, ""An Occurrence on Owl Creek Bridge"", he discovers the shocking truth on why.
Even though The Sixth Sense boasts outstanding performances turned in by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, M. Night Shyamalan's exquisite directing and storytelling is what makes The Sixth Sense stand out as one of the best films in 1999 and in the horror film genre.  What is even more effective to the purpose of the film is the thought-provoking conclusion.  If you have not carefully observed the film, scene by scene, the movie invites you to re-evaluate and reconceptualize the story and its events and it demands you to watch the film over and over to attain a deep understanding of its concept, without losing its awesomeness and splendor simultaneously.  All in all, The Sixth Sense is not horrifically gory and much more cerebral.  If you crave the intellectually challenging thriller flick and a much more macabre presentation, then I highly recommend Seven.  Either way, The Sixth Sense is a well-rounded, must-see flick which does not stop provoking thought and providing chills.",1055808000,,2875,5.014705882352941

The Sixth Sense is a movie that's surprise ending could ultimately be decimated by a single careless reviewer. Fortunately, few of this movie's reviewers are dumb enough to blatantly reveal the ending, but some came precariously close to it. This widely acclaimed phsycological, supernatural, etc. thriller, as it has been called, is really a movie about faith. Although it is designed for people of philosophic values, it also uses suspense and chilling sequences to attract a wide range of viewers. If you are the kind of person who watches a movie and takes the whole thing literally, you can enjoy it but not even begin to grasp the subtle, hidden values about life, afterlife and making choices. I previously stated the movie was about faith. And it is. Not any specific faith or religion, but faith in your self as well. It could be enterpreted many ways. Here is how I interpreted it: The Sixth Sense seperates all people into to classes; those with faith and those without. Those with faith usually come out strong in times of crisis. This is also the underlying theme in Shamalyan's other film, Signs. I was dissapointed that the other reviewers seemingly failed to grasp the movie's underlying values. But now maybe you will. And if you like the Sixth Sense, I'd advise you against buying the Others, as it is a cheap rip-off of the Sixth Sense without the subtle messages.

1071225,5,630573240X,"The ""psychological thriller"" has always been my favorite genre of film making.  Such films are more challenging in that it takes a special cohesiveness between a director, screenwriter, and cast to craft a story that will get inside the viewer's head and stay there days - even weeks - after having seen the film.  Though heavy on the suspense (naturally), all of the ""scary stuff"" is implied, which I feel has a much stronger effect on the audience than the average run-of-the-mill fright flick.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of only two films that I have seen in my lifetime that pulls this off successfully (""The Silence of the Lambs"" being the first).
I had never heard of writer-director M. Night Shyamalan before seeing this film, but I knew afterwards that this guy was indeed a gifted film maker/storyteller, cut from the ""Hitchcock mold,"" with a long and prosperous career ahead of him.  It didn't hurt that ""Sense"" went on to earn almost $300 million in box office sales in North America from its August 6-8, 1999 opening.  Yes, Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, and pint-sized powerhouse Haley Joel Osment all made for a fantastic cast, but it was Shyamalan's masterful directing and storytelling that made this one of the best suspense films of all time.",1049414400,,1274,4.852534562211981

1071227,5,630573240X,"If you were coming to this film expecting a horror film, then your disappointment is understandable.  I watched Mr. Shyamalan's work backwards chronologically: first SIGNS, then UNBREAKABLE, and now THE SIXTH SENSE.  So in a way I approached this movie understanding that the premise - ""I see dead people"" - is not the theme, but merely a vehicle for the theme (in the same way that the alien invasion of SIGNS was not the theme).
This is clearly one of the best pieces of filmmaking to come out of the Hollywood Slums in a long time.  It transcends many of the cliches that have gripped Tinseltown.  Shyamalan's technical brilliance and power of vision are so refreshing.  He is a filmmaker to watch, the only filmmaker since The Master - Hitchcock - to wear the mantle.
The performances are stunning.  Willis and Osmet are brilliant together, as is Osmet's mother.  The depth with which they portray their roles is evident in their eyes; each is willing to give the other the space they need to develop their characters, and the director skilfully moves them forward.
This film isn't about ghosts, or gothic horror, or the undead, or anything else like that.  It's about forgiveness.  Well, I suppose that's the simple answer.  But, it's a credit to Shymalan's genius that he is able to deal with such deeply human themes in the context of a ghost story, without falling prey to the typical Hollywood cliches (like ""Ghost"").
Night is becomming one of my favorits directors.  His work transcends film and becomes art of a type wholly distinct, much like Hitchcock and Kubrick before him.  It will be fun to follow his career!

You'd think that if your marriage was falling apart, you'd try to talk to the person, touch the person to get his/her attention, etc.  Nope.

1071271,5,630573240X,"When I first saw The Sixth Sense way back in January 2000, I remember being absolutely amazed and stunned by the excellence of this film. I'd never seen a film that - while being slow paced - gripped me for the entire time I watched it. The Sixth Sense was THE film of 1999, and went on to become the most successful horror movie in the history of recorded film - grossing $679.4 million worldwide by April 2000. There were a number of highly successful horror films of the 1990's such as The Blair Witch Project, The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill and the Scream trilogy. This doesn't mean to say they were any good. The Sixth Sense is a rare film that deals with ghosts and psychic ability in such a realistic manner, that was a welcome change from all the silly slasher-type films - and a perfect one to round off the decade...

The Sixth Sense revolves around two main characters; Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Malcolm is an award-winning child psychologist who is happily married to his considerably younger wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). They are relaxing one night at their home, when Malcolm is shot by one of his former, now-adult patients, Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg). The film continues months later. Malcolm has apparently recovered from the shooting and becomes involved with a new patient, nine-year-old Cole Sear. Cole's parents are divorced and he has no close friends - infact, his closest friend ""hates him."" Cole's mother, Lynn (Toni Collette) begins to notice that her son isn't happy, and that maybe something's going on in which he won't tell her - like finding cuts and bruises on Cole's back. A while into the film, Cole confides in Malcolm that he sees dead people - walking around like ordinary people. And that he sees them ""all the time."" Malcolm isn't sure whether to believe him or not, but stumbles across a recorded tape way back when he was involved with Vincent Grey. On the tape, Malcolm leaves the room with only Vincent is in there. It's clear from the tape (when Malcolm increases the volume) that someone else is in there with Vincent. Malcolm comes up with the suggestion that Cole must face his fears and communicate with these dead people - see what they want, and why the keep following him around. In return, Cole helps Malcolm with problems that he's experiencing with his wife - she won't talk to him, and he doesn't know why. Malcolm's discovery in the end has to be one of the best and most shocking twists in cinematic history.

The factor that makes The Sixth Sense so superb is the extraordinary acting skills of Haley Joel Osment. I have seen quite a lot of movies, and the acting of Osment in The Sixth Sense is absolutely amazing. After each major scene in which something truly gripping occurs, the screen fades to black - giving it a touch to it that makes it unique. I remember watching this film last night on terrestrial TV, and (now a few years down the line after it's initial release) realising that a wide variety of scenes in The Sixth Sense have already reached classic status. The one where the dead girl grabs Cole's leg from underneath her bed is a perfect example of this - the expression on Cole's face making it all the more iconic. The scene with the girl being sick in Cole's red tent is another (the tent constantly being used as a metaphor by children as a means of protection), along with the hospital bed scene which sparked a worldwide catchphrase; ""I see dead people!"" Director M. Night Shyamalan is superb, and with classic films such as The Sixth Sense and the superb Signs, is definitely on his way to becoming the new Spielberg. I have seen a lot of films in which Bruce Willis stars, and I have to say this is one of the best. He takes a backseat to his macho stereotype, and the effects are very rewarding. Willis is very believable as a softer, more gentle character in the form of Malcolm. Toni Collette plays the confused single mother image extremely well. At first it's difficult to distinguish whether she is protective or abusive towards Cole - but as the film picks up momentum, it's obviously the former.

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

The Sixth Sense is officially the highest-grossing horror film in history, which surprises me a little. The film received hardly any publicity until after its success at awards ceremonies. I have now seen The Sixth Sense about 10 times, and never tire of watching it. Of course, the film cannot be viewed day after day (as this would just be too repetitive), but once every three or four months still manages to thrill you in a way no other film did before it, or any film that will in the future.",1044230400,,4656,4.606024096385542

1071275,4,630573240X,"Instead of raving about how good this film is, I believe people should watch it and be their own judge of its worth. However I would like to clarify some of the arguments from those people who denied The Sixth Sense in the previous reviews:
(1) Unless you can identify with the little boy, you will not be 'scared' by The Sixth Sense. Because it does not 'TRY' to scare you. It is simply a supernatural DRAMA that tells a story of a little boy, and what HE sees is scary to him. Put you into his shoes - eight years old, seeing dead people walking around in the house - wouldn't that be scary if it was you? Or maybe you have been drinking so much since then that all your brain cells have been killed so you cannot remember your childhood imagination? Want to be scared till your pants drop? Want to see large amount of blood only the blood bank of the county hospital can supply? Then go back to watch your B-grade slasher flick. ""Sixth Sense"" is not for you.
(2) People who claimed that they have guessed the ending from the first ten minutes because it was so 'pathetically obvious', how exactly did you do that? Simply by 'he got shot -> the next fall when he was sitting on the bench', and all the secrets revealed? It's either you are a psychic, or you are amazingly simple-minded. Or even you have seen it before and just trying to show off how clever you are. The fact is, boast about how easy it is for you to guess the ending does not make you a more intelligent audience, but more superficial. If you are so smart, why aren't you making one of the biggest box-office hit last year?
(3) Some claimed that it is unreasonable for the ghosts not to know that they are dead, and spite the story to be stupid. But, how many ghosts do you know? How do you know what the ghosts know and don't know? You don't even know whether there are ghosts or not and yet you made yourself to be the representative of the nether world? This is a story that is being told like it has never been. Since you think the idea is absurd, then there is no way you would be able to tell a story like this, ever. Consequence? See (2) above. By the way, how many films DO make sense? 'Scream To The Infinity'? 'I Know What You Did On My Grandmother's Birthday Party'?
(4) As for the DVD itself, there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DISC!! All the problem that occurs is because of your DVD player, either the setup or player function. Read your player manual before you throw all your blames onto a quality disc.
(5) One reviewer said that the 'deleted scenes' are 'cut out' from the theatrical release... PLEASE!!! They are NOT. They are the scenes that never surfaced in cinema and put back by the director into the disc as an extra, he also explained why they were left out. One other said that the 'Storyboard-Film comparison' was not there, how come? They are on the top of the list of the bonus features!
Despite the few negative reactions of the lesser some about this movie, I saw this film with respect and expectation toward the filmmakers' creativity and the actors performances, and damned if I did not enjoy the 100 minutes, again and again.",1041120000,,3129,4.3231292517006805
1071276,1,630573240X,"I hate movies that are overrated; especially if I can't see what the big deal is. Why is 'The Sixth Sense' so ridiculously overrated? Is it money? I don't understand. I read 5-stars reviews everywhere saying this is simply a masterpiece, and that Haley Joel Osment-kid is being hailed as being the most brilliant actor walking around on the face of this earth. Well, let me tell you that all ain't right. A few important points.
  1: Let's get rid of the silly rumour that this movie is scary. It isn't scary... at all. The ghosts that you see are just plain people with sometimes a head-injury of pale face, nothing scary about that. The things that happen, like drawers and cupboards opening up by themselves, isn't scary at all either; how different that was in 'Poltergeist', where the scene with the chairs suddenly standing on the kitchentable gave the viewer an eerie feeling... ""what's more to come?"", I thought then. With the similar scene in ""The Sixth Sense"" all I did was be annoyed by that Haley Joel Osment-kid with his terrible overacting.
  2: That brings me to point nr. 2. Haley Joel Osment. A good actor? Well, maybe if you enjoy looking at a snotty face and wet eyes for 2 hours. But it didn't work for me. You almost hear the director saying to him: ""More emotion Haley, more emotion!""
  3: The bad plot. Bruce Willis is a ghost himself, how incredibly shocking and original. He didn't know that himself? His wife doesn't look at him, doesn't speak to him (because he's dead) but he assumes that it's ""bad communication"". Well, quite silly if you ask me. He's with that Haley Joel-kid's mom, still thinking he's just a living human being, and they sit across of eachother. Did he just think it was normal that the mother didn't speak to him? Doesn't that ring a bell? Very, very badly done.
  'The Sixth Sense' doesn't live up to it's hype, and that's an understatement. It isn't scary, it isn't moving (well, maybe in a shallow way if you're into that), and I wouldn't give this just one star if it wasn't considered as being one of the best movies of 1999. Let's say it keeps you fairly entertained for two hours, but after that it's a cold shower. With avoiding this you're missing out on nothing.",1040083200,,2221,4.562814070351759
1071277,5,630573240X,"Bruce Willis stars as Malcom Crowe a very well known and accomplished child psychologist who has everything: a beautiful wife and a amazing career, but a visit from a disturbed patient of Malcom when he was a child makes Malcom realize that although he was able to help so many people there were a few like this patient that he could not reach. Then with one pull of the trigger Malcom's patient kills him and then kills himself. Then Malcom returns to earth and there he meets a special boy named Cole Sears played so intelligently by Haley Joel Osmont who has a special power, he can see dead people. Malcom is determined to help this boy and that maybe in befriending this boy he can help him before it is too late. This movie does not have all that gore like most scary movies, it is a very chilling and intelligent movie, it really makes you think, and every time you watch it there is always something I guarantee that you might have missed like a piece of clothing, an object, and so on. This movie incorporates suspense into drama, and even some comedy. There are also some great supporting performances by Olivia Williams as Malcom's wife, Toni Collette as Cole's mom and there is even a small cameo by director M.

With this and his more recent ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"", M. Night Shyamalan has taught us to be more sophisticated in our viewing, revived our sense of cinematic wonder, demonstrated that thrillers and `family values' movies need not be mutually exclusive, and, more simply, given us three ripping yarns.  Like the best novels, his films are utterly riveting, beautifully crafted and, at their heart, have something important to say.  What more could you possibly ask?

1071331,5,630573240X,"Director M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough film is one of my all-time favorite creepfests. Haley Joel Osment (""A.I."") plays a boy with the power to see ghosts -- and he sees them everywhere. Bruce Willis (""Armageddon"") is the psychiatrist who at first tries to help the boy with what he thinks are delusions, but soon grows to believe in.
Shyamalan's ""Signs"" is another great scary flick, and for a simple reason: Shyamalan knows the secret to horror. It's all about the quick, fleeting glances of the darkness. It's all about building up the proper, terrified state of mind. I've never considered slasher flicks like ""Halloween"" or the endless ""Friday the 13th"" sequels to be even remotely scary.  Shyamalan knows that what you imagine is scarier than what he can show you, and he uses it.
""The Sixth Sense"" pulls you in and makes you feel for these characters before the resolution, followed by what has become one of the most famous twists in recent cinema history.
This Vista Series DVD is a great presentation, as well. Special features include a featurette about religion and the afterlife in movies and a cool look at Shyamalan's storyboarding process... but why still no commentary?

Shyamalan's taut direction makes this one an amazing and thrilling film with that now-famous shocker ending (Even though you probably know what happens). The stunning cinematography and some terrific scenes with Osment talking to Willis about his ""gift"" are fantastic. Add a creepy musical score, some inventive camerawork and a sharp script and you have one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.
The DVD extras are good, with a ""Making-Of"" Documentary, deleted Scenes and Extended Ending, storyboard to Film Comparisons, an interview with director M. Night Shyamalan, music and sound design, the doco ""Reaching the Audience & Rules and Clues"", trailers and TV spots.

1071333,1,630573240X,"After all the hype this movie got, I can't believe how utterly horrible it was.  The story of a boy who can see dead people?  That much, at least, makes sense, but that is about where the sense stops.
The surprise ending of this movie is extremely lame.  It doesn't even fit.  For example, in one scene Willis is sitting opposite Cole's mom in their living room when Cole comes home from school.  So how did he get in there?  Well, an intelligent person would think he would have talked to the mom before just barging in and sitting down.  Did he do this?  No.  According to the ""surprise"" ending, he actually let himself in the house, sat down across from Cole's mom, said nothing, and just sat there, not paying any attention to the fact that she didn't notice him.
This movie is incredibly stupid.  If you watch the interview with the director after the film, he can't stop talking about what a genius he is for making this movie.  I was expecting a surprise ending, what I got was some lame twist in the plot that left a gaping hole in the entire story.  Stay away from this one.",1033689600,,1083,4.333333333333333

1071335,1,630573240X,"THE 6TH SENSE = a deeply weak movie, so glitzy & faux that it actually damages eager-to-be-insulted audience directly. Which is unusual? Kitsch normally just diverts money away from honest effort, is the layer of commercial scum obscuring the nice roots of anything: Hank Williams Jr. instead of his more sincerely pitiful whining father. Or whatever will happen when marketably witless ghostly sentimentality prevails?
M. Night can't script. No real story/plot/characterization, just cinema atmosphere, a nice vogue look, lovely disconnected bits? A pre-robotic Haley Joel Osment is cute, professional, denatured/stiff, a pint-sized sensitive New Age adult. He's TOO good? His performance is exquisite, rings precocious/false, Culkinized, the polar opposite of Mary Badham's Scout Finch (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD). Could have been an audition for AI? Bruce Willis is miscast, tones himself down nicely to no purpose: the whole project strains credulity past exaggerated action/adventure. The kid's mother is NOT a bit part but is never honestly built? What little IS suggested fully excuses her son's father for leaving or, if necessary, dying? None of the other players has much to do. Nothing connects in a sensible (or parasensible?) way, but everything that can be done is done FOR or well done or perhaps overcooked. Idiot-proofing? Works like Windows when Windows works? M. Night Shyamalan is Spielberg minus Steven's occasional bursts of humor &/or interest in substantial subject matter. His belief that he can/should write seems likely to lead to a string of very empty very popular movies.
In order to earn directly damaging, a lowest-common-denominator flick has to be soma-like. No heart, red or black or gold, no fable. Dumb & dumber stuff. Enquiring minds? The indirect damage is typical & simple. Dollars churning around in the M. Night movie economy are unavailable for making/buying more interesting/curious art of any sort.

I felt this was one of the better movies I've seen in a long, long time. It is rare to find a ""scary"" movie that actually does just that. That's because it takes psychological manipulation of an audience, not just screeching jumping creatures or oodles of blood. This is a unique story, uniquely told. Many films promise a ""twist"", that'll  ""knock you off your feet""...etc, and you usually end up saying ""THAT""S the big surprise ??"" (Like you didn't know immediatley that the character in ""The Crying Game"" was really a man... HELLO ???) But, I must say, this film really delivers. I am, admittedly, usually prejudiced (sometimes unfairly so) against newer flicks as, they are more often than not, dissapointments. This film took me totally by surprise. Not only is the acting great, but the subtle unfolding of the story has just the right pacing and rhythym  to make the hairs stand up on your neck. Haley Joel Osmet is a wonder as ""Cole"", the little boy being tortured by his secret. His performance is the main reason this film is so credible. And, though I always felt that Bruce Willis had a quality that made him stand out above most of his contemporaries, his performance in this film, as the psychologist who seems to need to help himself through helping this troubled little boy,  is filled with depth, he is simply terrific. And I found the actress who played ""Coles"" mom, to be very effective at portraying the stressed out single mom, who needs two jobs to support her son, doesn't know how to help her little boy,  (and, has bad taste in clothes.) While I did figure out the ""twist"" of the film about half way through, it wasn't because I'm so brilliant. It was because of something that the little boy said, that I was really just half listening to, but it struck me a moment later, when I said out loud in the theater ""I know what the secret is !!"", whereupon my companion told me to shut the hell up. I've just watched this film again, and it is just as powerful, moving, and chilling as on the first viewing. The fact that you know the plot twist from the initial viewing in no way takes away from the feeling of having had the rug pulled out from under you. People get different reactions from the same film, that's what makes an ""opinion"" an opinion. But I'm not one of those who says things like ""that film you just saw was in actuality NOT about Becky Sues & Billy Bobs tumultuous love life, in reality, that was a metaphor for the Arab-Israeli conflict..."" Call me shallow, but I like to be swept up in the experience of what I'm actually seeing. This film totally succeeds, not only in entertaining you, but in making you think, scaring the heck out of you, and moving you emotionally. Several films tried to incorporate the special plot twist that this film originated, but, for me, they fell flat. (See: (or don't) ""The Others"".)

After my first viewing, with my expectations lowered, I decided to wait a while to watch it a second time. I think it was a year before I actually bought the DVD (Not the Vista Series), and watched it again. And this time, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoyed it for its depth, heart, and it's minimal -- yet effective -- scares. M. Night Shyamalan is a very creative and intelligent director, putting heart into his design. The use of the color red was a very unique touch. The main cast -- Haley Joel Osment (Cole), Bruce Willis (Malcolm), and Toni Collette (Lynn) -- were all superb. The relationships between Osment with both of the leads were great. Especially that of his and Collette (Cole's mother). Scenes with them were near tear-jerking at times.

Osment, was great playing the role of the young kid with the talent to see ""dead people"".

Each viewing reveals a new facet of the story, deepens the appreciation of the writing and, above all, amazes with the subtle and intricate performances of all the actors.
Of course the first time the big surprise is the ending (although I must admit I had picked the actual ending as one of three early on, BUT each subsequent viewing has brought more and better surprises). Bruce Willis (until this film one of my least favorite actors but after this and ""Whole Nine Yards"" a favorite)creates a wonderful character with not one false note - deep, meaningful and brillant. Haley Joel Osment overwhelms you the first time you see the film and with each subsequent viewing your appreciation for his work grows more intense. No other child actor has ever come close to his accomplishments and few adults have either. This wasn't the work of the director, it comes from within this remarkable person.
Even the story gets better with subsequent viewings. Little things that might have been missed previously will hit you and expand the pleasure. This is an excellent script, beautifully produced.

However, the movie could have had more ghosts. There weren't many ghosts shown in the movie. This isn't one of those scary movies like Exorcist or Nighmare on Elm Street. It scares the viewers by surprises of the ghost and the frightening music.",1017705600,,451,4.580246913580247
1071853,5,630573240X,"The Sixth Sense is not my favorite ghost story on film, but it ranks third behind Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, and a 1980 Canadian treat with George C. Scott called The Changeling. Did it deserve to get six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture? Heaven knows! I have recently begun an in-depth study of the Academy Awards, and my initial conclusion is that what wins and what's nominated is based primarily on the voters' collective mood in any given year. Especially their collective political mood. This translates to what we thought all along. The five nominees in a category are not necessarily the best in their field that year. So you must decide for yourself.
Take the best acting categories. Toni Colette and Haley Joel Osment were among the nominees in the supporting category. Bruce Willis was, as always, omitted. Maybe Willis is unpopular among his peers. I'm sure he used to be. He was nominated for an Emmy for Moonlighting three years in a row, and won once. He certainly is one of the public's favorites. The Blockbuster Entertainment Awards manumitted him in 1998, 1999 and 2000. He won in 1999. He also took home the prize at the 2000 People's Choice Award. This ranks him above even Tom Hanks in the opinion of the people who pay to see movies. I am writing this because I think he is the most underrated actor of our times. He is understated and has a dignity that is rare. Without him, The Sixth Sense, Pulp Fiction, Twelve Monkeys, Die Hard, The Verdict and a dozen other movies would not have been the same.
Willis is Malcolm Crowe in The Sixth Sense. He's a respected child psychologist. In a confrontation with a former patient, Crowe is shot. He realizes that he utterly failed this man. A few months later, he meets a young boy with problems very similar to the ex-patient. The boy is Cole Sear [Haley Joel Osment]. He is withdrawn, quiet, and scared of his own shadow. His Mother, Lynn [Toni Colette] helps him in the only way she knows how - with love. As Crowe gets to know Cole, he increasingly feels he can't help him, but something urges him not to give up. At the same time, Crowe fears that his spending so much time with his new patient is a main reason his once loving wife has grown distant. He suspects her of having an affair. The only other thing about the plot I'll tell you is that what makes Cole so fearful is that he thinks he sees dead people. If you don't know the story by now, you'll ruin much of the fun and suspense if you ask others to tell you more. You've been warned!
Toni Colette gives her best performance since Muriel's Wedding, a nifty Australian comedy that I highly recommend. Still, it is eleven-year old Osment who is so amazing. There have been many great child actors, but if there has been one better than this kid, I can't think who it might be. He's so good, he's a bit spooky himself. I've seen a dozen interviews with him, and in every one, it's like watching and listening to a miniature thirty-year old. If there are others in his generation similar to him, then we are in for a movie renaissance in ten years or so. And Willis? This supposedly conceited star aids and abets Osment's performance. The usual route when dealing with a precocious child actor is to be condescending. At no time does Willis do this. He is, as always, dignified, and as a result of the way he interprets Malcolm Crowe, he gives us his finest performance to date.
There is something quite telling about the public's reaction to The Sixth Sense. There could have been lavish special effects here, but director M. Night Shyamalan chose to avoid all but the simplest of them. Instead, he concentrates on the story. He lets his actors act. He assumes the audience is, on the whole, intelligent. That audience made it one of the highest grossing movies of all time.",1016496000,,3837,4.570391872278665
1071854,3,630573240X,"So, without being a spoiler, let me just say that this movie has some serious plot holes -- ones big enough to drive a truck through.  Its big gimmic -- the plot twist at the end -- doesn't work out as well as the director would have us believe (review his comments on the DVD).  Without giving anything away, let me phrase it like this: many of the scenes involving Bruce Willis cut directly to his already having entered the room in which the seen takes place.  If the plot twist is to be believed, Willis either magically appeared in these places and didn't realize that he hadn't arrived by normal means, or there's something really wrong with the plot.  IOW, not only is the audience unaware of his situation, neither is he himself, which makes no sense given the mechanics of getting a person into and out of a room.
I don't want to spoil it, so I won't get any more specific.  Watch the DVD and see if you don't agree.  You may have to watch it twice to see what I mean.  The most glaring problems are when Willis is sitting in the living room with the boy's mother, when he joins his wife for dinner, and when he attends the funernal and the play near the end of the movie.",1016323200,,1181,4.245535714285714

But this was one  s-l-o-w moving flick (although not nearly as bad as Unbreakable.)  If you like ghost movies, movies by directors that are way too full of themselves, or good old Bruce, then get it.  It's NOT one that you'll watch over and over again.

Watching the extras just ticked me off.  Our ego-driven director grabbed credit for so many ""original ideas"" - even though most were ""borrowed"" from Hitchcock or Anime.",1016236800,,546,4.625
1071925,5,630573240X,"This creepy little horror movie is actually a good deal better than the genre suggests.  Next to all those vacuous teen horror films it is a real gem.  The story follows child psychologist Willis as he tries to unearth the traumas of a small boy called Cole (Osmont) who claims to see dead people whilst he himself has troubles at home with wife Olivia Williams.
What's crucial is that Shyamalan hasn't just created a horror shocker but has intensely studied human loss.  Indeed, it is this rather than the ghosts themselves that is the real horror.  Plus, it's a rare horror movie that doesn't only scare its audience but also move them, both of which `The Sixth Sense' manages to do.  The scares are also a lot more to do with tricky camerawork that will make you jump out of your seat than gut-wrenching horror.  This is itself makes it rise above all the other soulless movies that preceded it.
Much has been made of Osmont's performance as the haunted child Cole.  Basically, all of the hype is correct, he perfectly judges the character and his performance is of the kind that etches itself on its audience's psyche.  Yet this certainly doesn't mean that the other talent on show here should go unnoticed.  Willis turns in his best ever performance in an understated, quietly touching role and Toni Collette makes you forget all about her brassy role in `Muriel's Wedding'.
Perhaps what makes the movie so good though is the fact that it is a distinctly adult horror that genuinely frightens and moves its audience.",1016236800,,1521,4.709433962264151
1071926,5,630573240X,"The sixth sense had clues that would trigger you to know what was happening and one of them was the color red, this is for those of you who haven't seen the talk after the movie with M. Night. Whenever any strong emotion was about to occur there would always the color red somewhere in the scene, the doorknob, the balloon, the wife's sweater, etc. Just a bit of trivia to know before you watch the movie. If you have not heard of the ending to this movie, be prepared for a surprise! This movie twists back and forth, making pretty good sense along the way. The only thing I didn't much care for, is how they made Osmet's character into the popular kid at the end and the popular kid the dork, it just seemed to cliched and not realistic. I don't understand how a kid who was in a commercial and was ego-ridden, not Osmet's character but the popular kid character could act so awful in the school play at the end. This did not seem feasible and did not match the tone of the rest of the movie which was intelligent and fit together quite nicely. Maybe Night had an experience with this and wrote from that place when he wrote the play scene near the end of the movie. The acting is really good, especially Toni Collete. I could watch her again and again, she is a great actress. She plays alot of quirky offbeat roles, I've seen her in a few that are not available or if so, not easy to find, one is Boys and the other was Hotel ??? Forgot the name, saw it at a film fest and really liked it, very bizzare. The movie is a must see! As M. Night said it was a cultural phenomenan, it affected alot of people, just that alone may prompt you to see it. The scary parts aren't that bad, the suspense can be difficult, but it is nothing like the Exorcist has a good theme tied in with the side most people would assume to be dark, watch it and see!

1071931,5,630573240X,"That's what you'll be saying when you finish watching ""The Sixth Sense"".
However, when you watch it again, you'll say that alot more often.
M. Night Shyamalan, director-writer of ""The Sixth Sense"" (later Unbreakable, Signs) is a genius. Night (as he likes to be called), set up this movie as a thriller in what seemed to be the wake of Blair Witch, which is why I personally didn't go see it in theatres. I'm not a big horror fan. Later when I saw it on TV it absolutly blew me away.
The movie really isn't a horror movie. It's much more of a deep, thoughtful psychological thriller. And I love deep movies. The movies opening ten minutes are a rush, and then the next half hour moves quite slowly. I got extremely bored watching this section the first time, but trust me, its all worth it. As the story progresses the last hour is excellent.
And the final five minutes... Check the bold print above.
This movie is 2 movies in one. It's one movie your first viewing, and a second the second time you see it. It's a movie you invite everyone who hasn't seen it over to see their expressions when it ends. And its a fine, fine DVD.
DVD:
The video quality on this DVD is pretty much flawless. Once and a while a single frame will have a white spec on it. The sound is also beautiful for non-surround sound + surround sound alike.
The movie is slightly widescreened on a normal TV, but not to the extent of ""Pearl Harbor"".
The Case: The case is unique to say the least. It's got an outer cover, that you pull out the case from. This case opens up into about 6 pages, with the 2 DVDs in the middle, and to the far right some drawings of the storyboards and a booklet explaining the special features + chapters.
The Trailers: There are 3 trailers included. 2 TV Spots, The 15 second one shows the 5 senses and the 6th sense as the kid. The 30 second one is a bunch of short clips of the infamous scenes from the movie. The Theatrical trailer is the best of the bunch, it makes out the movie to be a horror movie, and made famous the ""I see dead people"" line.
Reflections From The Set: One of the largest segments, about 40 minutes long. Well done interviewing Producers, Directors, and Actor/Actresses. I was amazed to see that the two female leads (Crowe's Wife + Cole's Mother) both had English and Australian accents respectively. I couldn't tell the least bit in the movie. This like most of the other features gives away the ending. I loved the Bruce Willis + (Vincent Gray Actor?) segments telling how they prepared for their roles.
Paranormal Special: I was expecting a ""Sightings""-esque feature, but it turned out to be much deeper including interviews with Night, the writer of ""The Exorsist"" and my favorite interviewee The writer of ""Ghost"". It was very intresting to hear how the writer of ""Ghost"" developed the idea for his movie, and why he chose to write from the side of the ghost (Patrick Swayze).
Storyboarding: This segment shows how Night, unlike other writer/directors chose to draw out the entire movie on storyboards before actually taping it, saving him perhaps millions of dollars, but adding 12 - 16 weeks of writing time. It was intresting to see after the movie.
Music/Sound: This segment was actually one of the most intresting on the disk. I was surprised how many human ""voices"" they had put in the movie backround. Several of the scenes they took upcoming dialouge and played it backwords slightly before the actor said it. The more I listened to this, the creeper the movie actually got, while at the same time it increased the effort I saw being put in. It also explains why some scenes (namely the Cole tells Mom scene) don't have any music in the backround.
Hints/Clues/Rules: If you've seen the movie, you should know what this is talking about. If you haven't, watch the movie at least twice before viewing this excellent segment.
Reaching The Audience: This segment has the five or six producers + Night talking about how unexpected the 2 week #1 spot run + subsequent #10 grossing of all time was. It was hillarious to hear that the studio thought the movie would be a flop when no one clapped at the end of the inital screening (apparently, they were all still in shock with their jaws on the floor).
Deleted Scenes: all of these scenes were magnificantly done. Each is introduced by Night, explaining the scene, where in the movie it was located, and why it was taken out. Most were to stop the ruining of the ending, or stop confusion to the audience. I agree with Night's assesment of cutting the ""Extended"" ending to its current version, so it ends as a shocker and not a sobber.
Complaints:
1) No Director's Commentary
2) My 2 fav trailers before seeing this movie were the Pearl Harbor Trailers. This movie contains one that is superior to the 2 on the Pearl Harbor DVD, and yet once you view it at the beginning of the disk, there is no way to review it. Bah.

What impressed me about this movie was simply the fact that time was taken to invest in the characters and their problems (and that's not called ""slow-paced"" in my view, it's called ""character development"").  This is one of those ghost stories that goes beyond a run-of-the-mill thriller, both visually and emotionally.  The DVD special edition here has pretty much what was available on the previous release (which was pretty good in itself), including three new documentaries on the film.

1071933,5,630573240X,"Frankly, I have never seen a movie so misinterpreted by critics.  That is, in part, the fault of its writer/direct M. Night Shamalyan.  The Sixth Sense is a movie of separate, yet self-contained and authentic levels.  On the surface, it is an effective ghost story in the truest sense, drawing on a long tradition of tales and with an ending that is both rewardingly unique and also of a kind with some of classic tales of haunting.  (The Others, with Nicole Kidman, tries to pull off a similar effect, but falls woefully short.  The Others is a nice enough film, but nothing more.  In comparison, The Sixth Sense is as well-realized a film as I have ever seen.)  Okay, then, so what is the other layer of this film?  In my view, the power of this film is in its less obvious message:  it is a haunting, evocative, and cautionary tale about middle age.  About how easily we become the walking dead.  In our work.  In our relationships.  Bound as we are in routine and rote, we see only what we want to see.  We neglect those that are closest to us.  We sleepwalk through life.  And when those we care about truly die, we awaken just long enough to be filled with regret.  This emotional undercurrent builds and builds and finds its release in several key moments.  You'll know them by the uncharacteristically powerful emotions they evoke--the depth of which could only be achieved by this striking psychological tale so nicely concealed in a story of the supernatural.

Searching for something different to watch on a lonely Monday, I spotted THE PACKAGING of ""Sixth Sense"" in a local store -- that's why I picked it up.  I only knew that the movie was quite popular, and I had purchased and watched ""Unbreakable"" several months earlier.
I was skeptical about the child actor when I bought this DVD.  As it turns out, the movie is quite remarkable and the Director: M. Night Shyamalan does a superb job.  His movies are quite different and tasteful.  Often the reviews or advertising compare him or this film to Alfred Hitchcock -- I think that's insulting to both of them.  There's nothing truly exciting in ""Sixth Sense"" but it's such a fine film that you will want to watch it again soon.  In fact, I plan to watch ""Unbreakable"" right away and then re-visit ""Sixth Sense"" to really get a feel for the director.
Is it really a thriller or high drama?  I don't know; that's for you to conclude.  I will say that the taste and skill of Director: M. Night Shyamalan probably will leave one groping for words, and that's what sets an artist apart from everyone else.

1072012,2,630573240X,"- Whaddaya think I am: stoopid???
Bruce Willis' line as John McClane in ""Die Hard"" echoes the question I'd like to ask Mr Shyamalan concerning his highly overrated ""The Sixth Sense"".
In his effort to cross all the ""t""s and dot all the ""i""s, telling the viewer exactly what to think about the existence of ghosts, and leaving no room whatsoever for doubt, Shyamalan generates a script whose middle name is ""Plot-Hole"".
The basic premise is that ghosts, being disembodied and from the Beyond, labor under certain limitations: they can't enter churches, manipulate solid objects etc etc. They have unfinished business among the living, for which they need the help of a specially-gifted human, the eight-year-old Cole Sear, who in turn is able occasionally to find sanctuary from them.
Enter Mr Superghost. He looks perfectly at ease in a church, is able to change clothes, open doors and throw rocks... Why him and not the rest? We don't know. But, just like other ghosts, he ""doesn't know that he is dead"" -  i.e. he doesn't notice that he all of a sudden doesn't eat, can't get service in a store or buy a bus ticket, and doesn't need to go to the bathroom. Huh???
Personally, the idea that Crowe was dead occurred to me early on, but I dismissed it with a  ""Nah, it can't be _that_ dumb!""
And yet the cinematography, the acting, the well-crafted overall mood would suffice to compensate for the hole-ridden plot and the offensively obvious ""symbols"" (Yes, the color RED has a special significance, yes, clever girl has been paying good attention to Teacher Shyamalan and figured it all out!) if we were granted a sceptic's escape hatch, the benefit of a doubt, the right to assume an alternative interpretation where Crowe is simply a burned-out psychologist who helps Cole to deal with the bogeymen in his mind. Letting Crowe walk down the school stairs after Cole's theatre performance and ending the film there would have saved the day.
But ambiguity is a Bad Thing to the good Mr Shyamalan. He has to spell it all out while drowning the entire dish in sentimental syrup.
The extatic reception that ""The Sixth Sense"" has received says something about the sad current state of the entertainment industry. In all, the film is a bad waste of good talent.",1012521600,,2255,4.764705882352941

These are generally excellent and worth buying the movie over again, especially since you get everything that was on the original version as well. With one notable exception. The segment from Night's first horror film, which I found amusing, is missing. Why oh why are ""deluxe"" editions put out that don't contain all the extras of the regular edition?

1072014,5,630573240X,"""The Sixth Sense,"" written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is one of those films that has enjoyed both great critical acclaim and tremendous popular success. And it deserves them both: this is, simply, a great film. Shyamalan tells the story of Cole Sear (played by Haley Joel Osment), a little boy with a terrifying supernatural ability. He lives with his mother, a single parent (Toni Colette). Child psychiatrist Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) attempts to help the boy deal with the disturbing ramifications of his ""gift.""
""The Sixth Sense"" is a horror film that doesn't rely on monsters and gore: the horror here is largely psychological in nature. But the film ultimately transcends the horror genre; it is also a serious family drama that is told with intelligence and compassion. It is as much about love and communication as it is about fear.
All the performances in the film are first rate. If you only know Bruce Willis as the star of hyperactive action flicks, be prepared for a revelation. He delivers a performance that is restrained, yet rich with emotional texture. Toni Colette is heartbreaking as the struggling mother.
And then there's Haley Joel Osment. He is absolutely extraordinary in a performance that ultimately holds the whole film together. Although he was nominated for a supporting Oscar, I consider this a lead role in terms of screen time and centrality to the film. His chemistry with both Colette and Willis is absolutely electrifying; this kid is one of the best actors of any age group. Osment will frighten you, break your heart, and uplift your spirit in this role; his performance alone makes this film worth watching.
The ingenious script has its own inner logic; Shyamalan creates an intimate mythos which is consistent and compelling. He uses a brilliant combination of low-tech effects and production details to enhance his story. And James Newton Howard's excellent score complements the film as a whole.
""The Sixth Sense"" is one of those great films that rewards repeated viewings. Actually, I believe that a second viewing is absolutely essential. All in all, a deeply moving piece of cinematic art.",1010188800,,2145,5.02808988764045

1072016,4,630573240X,"M. Night Shyamalan accomplished something really great with this frightening chiller. He created a scary horror film that was just that. Scary. No over the top effects, no gratuitous gore with no reason for being there, and so on. It's an old fashioned ghost story meant to give you the chills. Probably a few willies here and there too. Bruce Willis stars as child Psychologist Malcolm Crowe. He's helping a 9 year old boy named Cole Sear(brilliantly played by Haley Joel Osment)who seems to have the gift of seeing ghostly visions. Of actually seeing and hearing spirits. The case is especially significant to Dr. Crowe. A patient of his had broken into the doctor's house a few months earlier and shot him. The guy then turned the gun on himself and pulled the trigger. He definitley doesn't want another patient to turn out like that. His marriage to his wife(played by Olivia Williams), hasn't been the same since. Shyamalan knows how to set the mood. There are dark colors, ghostly effects, and just some moody looking shots. Very eerie. Shyamaln has crafted the film together so brilliantly. It's clever and imaginative. I guarantee that you will be watching the film a few more times afterwards to piece everything all together. Bruce Willis is really good. He's not just the ""Die Hard"" guy. He's a real actor, and a good one at that too. Then there's young Osment. He delivers a shockingly magnificent portrayal as Cole. Never have I seen such a mesmerizing performance from a young actor in all my life. He was nominated for the Oscar and he deserved it. He really could have won. Toni Collette, as his mother, was fabulous as well. Shyamalan is a creative and imaginative director/writer. He really is a talent to watch. He followed this up with the darker ""Unbreakable"". It wasn't as good, but very interesting nonetheless. The Sixth Sense is a classic film that will live on for ages.",1009324800,,1897,4.786585365853658

1072020,2,630573240X,"Yeah, it does seem an exercise in futility to write the 949th review, but at least I'll be at the top of the list for awhile.
First, I'll say that I saw this movie only because I was in the theatre after seeing something else, and when my first film got out, it was pouring rain, so my husband and I sneaked into Sixth Sense, even though we had promised one another not to see it when we saw the trailer. By the way, since then, whenever we see a trailer of a film that looks just gawd-awful, one of us will lean over and whisper ""I see dead people.""
Yeah, this film was gawd-awful; the reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that Haley Joel Osmant is one of the few watchable child actors working right now.
Frankly, I knew Bruce Willis was dead from watching the trailer; I went into the film knowing that from the beginning, and assuming that everyone knew that. It was about twenty-five minutes into that film before I realized that Dr. Mal didn't know he was dead. About fifteen more after that, until it dawned on me that that might be the point of the movie, and then I understood why the film didn't seem to have a plot. I whispered to my husband ""Do you think the director thinks we don't know that Bruce Willis is dead?"" He just shrugged.
At least we got plenty of use out of our refillable popcorn tub and drink cups.
I know this film has been getting rave reviews, and I also know that people have dwelt long and eloquently on the film's lack of gore and perceived style.
I wonder if audiences are so starved for suspense films (or any films) without dissected teenagers or car-crashing, armor-piercing bullet fests, that anything with a hint of elegance is caught up like pennies tossed to urchins. We've seen people naked, filthy, bloody, mauled by dinosaurs, eaten by each other. Ho-hum. Style, finery, manners, with or without substance is the new hook. It's not that we've suddenly become sqeamish; I leaned forward with everyone to see what was in that rag of Josh's shirt in Blair Witch Project. We're just getting tired of special effects and make-up techs playing ""who's got the sausage?""
This would also explain The English Patient. (""I see dead people."")",1004918400,,2183,4.473684210526316
1072109,4,630573240X,"Was this film a surprise? Was the ending a surprise really? Personally I felt, as I watched the film, that there was something missing. Certainly a real dialogue between all other characters but Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis was missing, but that was not blatantly obvious. Willis's oblivious behaviour toward his wife also left some unanswered questions. How is it that he could really not know he was dead if there were all these things going on in his wife's life that he knew nothing about? (She was taking antidepressants, was starting to see other people)? I suppose it is possible to be living with someone who becomes virtually a stranger to you as circumstances change. However, the most obvious problem was simply that there was no real segu into his life after he had been shot. We see no ambulances, no recovery, nothing. This always makes me suspicious. We just see him lying there bleeding, and the next thing we know he is meeting a little boy. How would he have time, after all, to devote all this time to one case if he were indeed alive? Also Haley Joel Osment probably does not choose to tell Willis he sees dead people because Willis is his counselor but because Willis manages to make contact and communicate with him, unlike all the other dead people who have just scared him.  I guess I felt prepared for the ending only because I have seen similar things. For example, in Jacob's Ladder, with Tim Robbins, his character hallucinates an entire life after Vietnam, but it turns out that he never left Vietnam. He died in combat. Granted, The Sixth Sense was superior with its story, its stylistics and its suspense. Perhaps it appears that I am complaining, but far from it. Willis's performance was understated and skillful. I am not a fan of Haley Joel Osment, but his performance was commendable, particularly for someone of his age. I was highly impressed also with Australian actress Toni Collette as Osment's frustrated but loving and protective mother. The Sixth Sense had clues in it, but it was not clear-cut. It was not obvious how it would end. It was well crafted, suspenseful, and completely unexpected in the cinema when it appeared... unexpected but welcome.",1004832000,,2200,4.774278215223097

It was the only logical conclusion I could come to after seeing all those ""I see dead people"" commercials for the movie.  When I got to the end of the movie and found out that I had of course been right about what the ""big surprise"" was I have to say that I was very dissapointed.  However, the movie itself is good.  The only problem I have is that the ending leaves you dissapointed.  M. Night should have made it less obvious.  Anyway, the movie is great.

That answer, when you strip away the twist ending everybody just had to see, was in the subtext of families being healed after a traumatic loss.  Just substitute in divorce instead of death and the resonance becomes clearer, much the same way many parents empathized with the discarded and forgotten toys of Toy Story 2.  All through the movie we see Willis's character, a fallen and broken man, continually trying to reconnect with his apparently estranged wife and his young patient, a surrogate son of sorts.  That the ghosts the boy sees are primarily victims of domestic abuse or simple neglect only further the subtext of a needed healing.  Whether you find the film 'scary' or not is a non-issue with me, for The Sixth Sense shows how rich, intelligent, and textured supernaturally themed drama can be.

Apparently, in the universe that Mr. M. Night Shyamalayan (what a spooky name, huh?) comes from, this concept is far too bizarre to comprehend. Here on the planet Earth, we human beings tend to communicate with people we are in close contact with.

I've only seen one movie in my entire life that is more insulting to my intelligence than this piece of garbage, and that is ""The Game"". If you liked the way that the ridiculous plot holes in this movie tricked you, then you'll love ""The Game"" too.
The worst thing about movies like this is that any great acting or superb visuals are ruined for me. ""The Sixth Sense"" definitely has both of these qualities, but in my opinion they are completely ruined by the impossible plot. It's a shame that you don't know how truly BAD this movie is, until it is over. I know that doesn't seem possible, but that's how this movie works. I'll never figure some things out. Do yourself a favor, and don't try to figure this movie out either. Just stare like a good little zombie at your TV, and be amazed by the ending.

Full of unexpected twists and turns it's very clear that the director was inspired by Serling and the Twilight Zone. Although most of the scenes are well scripted and structured, there is an amateurish quality to some of the interactions between Willis and the kid. That isn't a criticism. That amateurish quality manages to stifle any ""pretense"". This is a good old fashion thriller with a number of memorable scenes.
Willis gives a subdued performance (which he duplicates in Unbreakable a riskier film that doesn't quite pay off as well as 6th Sense does), and Haley Joel Oswald gives a heartfelt performance. The O'Henry twists are pretty well hidden (although I thought it was pretty obivious by the last third what was going on).

1072212,5,630573240X,"August is typically the month chosen for studios to dump films considered too poor to compete against the bigger summer vehicles and too weak to war with fall releases.  The irony of The Sixth Sense being released during this month is all the more peculiar when one hears of its $8 million triumph on opening day, not to mention curtailing a $30 million mark its first weekend.  Screening amidst blockbusters like Runaway Bride, The Iron Giant and the much-discussed horror mockumentary The Blair Witch Project, the success of The Sixth Sense surprised not only its skeptical audiences but its humble filmmakers as well.
Action buff Bruce Willis stars as the unruffled child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, a man who has spent the last ten years devoting his life to the mental health of Philadelphias troubled children.  After ogling a plaque of commendation given to him by the citys mayor for his painstaking services, he and his wife Anna (Williams) retire to their bedroom, drunk on wine and ready for a romantic tryst.  To their surprise, they find their window shattered and their phone beeping urgently off the hook.  A half-naked intruder lurks in their adjoined bathroom, a gleaming handgun lying dormant in the sink.  The intruder tearfully reveals himself as Vincent Grey, a former patient who never found peace.  Malcolm desperately tries to placate the hysterical young man but Vincent fires a round through his abdomen before turning the gun on himself.
The story leaps to the following year, the incident having irrevocably damaged Malcolm and Annas marriage.  Unable to repair the breach in their stunted communication, Malcolm busies himself with a new client, one whose traits are eerily parallel to that of Vincent.  The enigmatic youngster this time round is Cole Sear (Osment), an oft-morose elementary-schooler whose permeable eyes disclose the terror and mysteries of the netherworld.  Not only is Cole oddly intuitive but he also has the power to see and communicate with restless phantoms, entities that consistently make their presences known in the dusky apartment that he and his mother Lynn (Colette) share.  Both Malcolm and Lynn assume Coles behavior is rooted in the emotional pangs of his parents divorce, but they are sorely mistaken and one day the terrified tot exhales I see dead people to the stone-faced shrink, a rivulet of tears cascading down his porcelain cheeks.  It is at this point that Shyamalan grabs us by our shirt collars and pulls us closer towards the portico of restless spirits, revealing to us their many macabre but misunderstood worlds.
This subdued paranormal yarn literally became a theatrical juggernaut overnight and many people were compelled to see it a second or third time just to spot director M. Night Shyamalans clues to the gasp-inducing denouement.  I remember sitting in the theater with my husband and hearing him incredulously whisper Holy s**t! as the last five minutes of SS unfolded, hitting the audiences collective realization like a sledgehammer.  Like the rest of the world, I was mesmerized by 11-year-old Osments unbelievably mature performance and I admit I was a little disappointed when he didn't even receive an Academy Award nomination for his flawless work. However, I didn't overlook the rest of the casts efforts and I was very pleased by the performances from both Die Hard trilogy star Bruce Willis and his Australian co-star Toni Collette (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress).  Willis had ventured into chancy territory before undertaking the complicated role of Malcolm Crowe, choosing character roles like high-strung mortician Ernest Menville in the black comedy Death Becomes Her and quirky car salesman Dwayne Hoover in the Kurt Vonnegut-adapted Breakfast Of Champions.  Collette had a shorter but nevertheless impressive resume, Shyamalan having enjoyed her as Muriel Heslop in the 1994 comedy Muriels Wedding.  Olivia Williams hopped onto the project after starring in the Costner flop The Postman and the independent comedy Rushmore.  The biggest casting surprise however was former New Kids On The Block member Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Grey, the ex-singer-turned-actor barely recognizable due to his emaciated physique (he shed a dangerous total of 45 lbs. for the part).
Some people complained about knowing the secret only halfway through, saying Shymalan made it too easy to guess what was going on and/or gave too much away.  Only the people who allowed themselves to be consumed by the directors languid but intriguing style and the riveting performance from Osment were shocked, but they were pleasantly surprised as well by how carefully he concealed the truth.  So to the critics who pieced together the theoretically palpable puzzle: good for you.  Just don't ruin it for the rest of us who would prefer to enjoy the film for its imagination and talent rather than embarking on a rabid search for its technical flaws.",998524800,,4939,5.1796482412060305

1072217,5,630573240X,"In my humble opinion, THE SIXTH SENSE was the last great horror movie of the cinema in the 20th century.
I say this for a number of reasons.  First of all, writer/director M. Night Shayamalan must be credited with having made a horror film that is genuinely frightening and unsettling without resorting to undue blood, gore, or nudity (thus the 'PG-13' rating).  Second, his handling of the relationship between psychologist Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) and the troubled boy Cole Seer (Haley Joel Osment) is one of the more psychologically satistfying things I've seen in the cinema in years.  Third, and last (but not least), is the twist ending that occurs--and, contrary to what anyone else might believe, I did NOT see it coming.  This twist is perhaps the greatest sting-in-the-tail ending the cinema had seen since the coda of the original PLANET OF THE APES in 1968.  I have the feeling that Rod Serling, no stranger to sting-in-the-tail endings (see ""The Twilight Zone"" and APES), would have found a lot to admire about THE SIXTH SENSE.
Shayamalan weaves elements of such great horror movies as CARRIE, THE SHINING, and POLTERGEIST into his film; and yet, THE SIXTH SENSE does not seem too terribly derivative--it's paying homage.  Willis and Osment, as well as Toni Collette's performance as Osment's equally troubled mother, are at the center of this intriguing thriller.

The surprise ending is both logical and intelligent, and I didn't come close to guessing this conclusion beforehand.  The surprise conclusion significantly helps in elevating the film.

The celebration upstairs is due to the awarding by the mayor to her husband, a renowned child psychologist.  After an altercation with an intruder and a gunshot, we are taken from this bizzare opening to a park bench, the same psychologist, and a small boy. As of this moment we have no idea what this first scene means, and we're off to solve the mystery.
""I see dead people""  This line has become a staple of modern cinema.  This, the main plotline to the movie is essential to the enigma.  Are the ghosts harmful?  We're certainly led to believe so, with such terror in the heart of our child lead, Cole- played with excellent skill and soul by Haley Joel Osment.  But this plot actually becomes second to the silent conflict between Cole and Malcolm (the psychologist, played by Willis).  Why is Cole hesitant to ask for help?
Watch this movie for the genuine thrills, the awesome acting, the visual inspiration, and the conflict.

1072274,5,630573240X,"Whereas Unbreakable was a study of how a superhero might develop in a real world setting, The Sixth Sense delves into the possibility that those we consider to be insane may not necessarily be.
Consider a youth so tormented by ""mysterious voices"" SUPPOSEDLY coming from the dead that he is eventually driven insane. Insane to the point that he comes back to murder the child psychiatrist (played by Bruce Willis) who tried to help him. And later, this same psychiatrist attempts to help another child (Haley Joel Osment) whom he comes to realize has the same problem.
Consider, then, what happens in a real world setting when someone DOES actually hear voices from the dead? How do we treat these individuals? This movie is a perfect rendition of this; we would normally be compelled to believe that someone is mentally unstable...who truly knows in the end?
This movie is rich in its depth and breadth of character and humanity. For it takes someone who IS dead to realize that a child CAN listen to the dead--and it is extremely ironic to think that a psychiatrist, armed with this knowledge, is unable to share this information with the world. However, the movie shines a hopeful light since he is now capable of helping this child!
Granted, on a base level of story, this one is a ripping good yarn with a wonderful surprise ending, but it's also stunning if one sits back and realizes the complexity of issues surrounding those we label ""insane.""",994896000,,1451,4.761904761904762
1072275,3,630573240X,"Osment performed very well.  I liked the sets, and the lighting created the appropriate mood.  This could have been an outstanding movie, but alas, too many plot-holes, and too many unanswered questions.  Not the good kind of unanswered--the kind of unanswered that shows that the creators of the movie couldn't think in a straight line.
Why did Cole know Latin?  Why did he know his teacher used to stutter?  Why did Malcolm never wonder why he doesn't eat, shower, or sleep?  Why would Cole's mother's grandmother leave the bumblebee pendant in Cole's bureau drawer?  Where's the sense in that?  Why did the dead people, hung by their necks, NOT KNOW THEY WERE DEAD?!  And all three of them?  What a co-ink-ee-dink!
And Malcom's wife could NOT talk to him in her sleep.  You cannot speak or hear when you're in the deepest stage of sleep, and if she had been in a stage light enough to hear Malcolm and speak to him, she would have startled awake from the freezing cold, his voice, or from hearing herself speak aloud.
""Clues"" could have been handled more delicately.  It's just silly to have ""insight"" presented to us through Malcolm's flamboyant circling of script in his textbooks.
I really liked how the two noxious kids who locked Cole in the closet didn't even get questioned or scolded for either a) locking him in there or b) standing there stupidly while he screamed and spazzed out.
Also, this flick just wasn't that scary.  I jumped once, and that's because I had the volume too darned loud.  I'd expected a real spine-tingler.
Too much sentimental stuff.  Resonance is good in a movie--Cole going on about great-grandma seeing his mother's recital is not.
This movie had some strong points, but the weak points kept nagging at me throughout the entire film.  I had expected near-perfection considering the hype this movie got AND the Oscar nominations, to boot. :(
However, it is kind of spooky to imagine that the reason we feel fear when we're alone is that there really ARE ghosts lurking in our midst.  But then again, isn't hocus-pocus superstition what usually prompts fear in the first place?  So I guess that speculation isn't too ingenious......

There are some genuine ""made you jump!"" scenes, but the horror here is mostly psychological.  My favorite scene:  the camera holding steady on Willis's face as Osment reveals more and more of his secret and watching the terror sink in.  It's not hard to see why this is one of the biggest box-office hits ever.  Willis, never my favorite actor, is solid, and avoids the smarminess that sometimes defeats his natural charm, and of course Osment is at times heartbreakingly earnest in his portrayal of the boy.

He managed to make him accept his solitude but he locked him up in it. When that child became an adult this solitude became unbearable. But why ? In this solitude he is in contact with dead people who are asking him to do things, but he is frightened so he does not listen to them. This patient kills the psychiatrist who gets in touch with another patient of his who has the same problem, or is it the old patient, and is it a trip into the past ? Impossible. The patient has killed himself. And he discovers that this young child is able to see and hence communicate with the dead. And he, the psychiatrist, is dead. He discovers that the child has to listen to the dead, and ask them what they want him to do, and to do it. And when he does it, he is able to find some peace with these dead people who have chosen him because he is able to see them, to listen to them. He just has to bring to the living the necessary messages, which can be gruesome or hopeful. And little by little the psychiatrist realizes that he is dead himself and that he has to go back to his wife and say goodbye, which he finally does when the child has found the strength to speak to his own mother and to make his mother accept this simple fact, this simple special power. And he says goodbye to his wife, and she responds, in her sleep, as if it were a dream, and he can get on his road to his new life, because being dead is to live a new life. It is thus a deep reflection on life and death and the channels of communication between the two. It is also the assumption that some people can see and communicate with the dead and that this power gives them a responsibility that is so hard to accept that it makes them crazy : the words used are delusions, schizophrenia, and some others. Society refuses those special powers. They frighten people. That's why this film is interesting : the deep humaneness of such a recognition.

Although I'm hardly ever scared when it comes to horror films, I'd say this is one film that will freak out and terrify most people. But even though this film didn't scare me, I still really loved it.
THE SIXTH SENSE is about a child pycholost (did I spell that right?) named Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). Malcolm cares for his patients, but when he fails one patient, a tragedy occurs. A few years later, Malcolm moves to Philideliphia and has a new patient: a 9-year-old boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who has the sixth sense - the ability to see ""dead people"" or ""spirits"" and communicate with them. Cole lives with his single young mother, and is frightened by the ghosts he sees because they ""make him do stuff"". He wants them to go away, and Malcolm must help him make them go away because he doesn't want to screw up like he did with his last patient.
THE SIXTH SENSE is an amazing film with awesome special effects and a strong, solid storyline and well-written screenplay. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely flawless and serpurb. Haley Joel Osment is definitely one of the best child actors I've seen since Macualey Culkin, and Bruce Willis gives off one of his greatest performances ever.
I still feel THE SIXTH SENSE should have won some of the Oscars it had been nominated for, and it definitely should have won Best Picture and Haley Joel Osment should have won Best Supporting Actor. AMERICAN BEAUTY is long-forgotten by now, but THE SIXTH SENSE is still popular and excellent.

Spare us the talk about making a cultural impact with this film because of the box office draw and people quoting the line ""I see dead people"".  It worries me about the future of filmmaking.  I wonder what other ""great"" films are going to be created by ""ball-playing, Big Mac-eating"" kids that spent their youth hanging out in malls.",985996800,,1679,4.480263157894737
1072511,5,630573240X,"Here comes a thriller which is smart and uniquely chilling, unpredictable and starkly original. ""The Sixth Sense"" falls into an enjoyable but very tricky genre of filmmaking: thrillers which succeed in balancing suspense and tension with an equal level of emotion. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan does so much with this story, his third feature, yet he keeps the plot twists on the down-low so that the movie speaks to us in such a way that our only choice is to follow it through to the final, gut wrenching climax. Through a combination of subtly effective cinematography and a powerful cast, ""The Sixth Sense"" rises up to become one of the best movies of 1999.
Setting itself up quite nicely with an eerie opening credits scene, the movie introduces us to Malcolm Crowe, who has just one a prestigious award from the city of Philadelphia for his work as a child psychologist. That same night, upon going upstairs to their bedroom, he and his wife Anna find a strange man in the bathroom, claiming to be a former patient of Crowe's who feels his bedside manner was less than helpful. After a lengthy ""session"" of trying to calm him down, Malcolm is shot in the stomach, and the intruder commits suicide.
Skip ahead a year, in the fall season, and we find Malcolm embarking on another assignment: helping a small child named Cole deal with visions of ghosts that permeate his thoughts and come to him in reality, leaving visible scars on his body and causing his severe fright. The child is at first reluctant to reveal these apparitions, but once he knows he can trust Malcolm, he tells all. Malcolm, whose life has taken a bit of a nose dive (his wife barely speaks to him anymore, and he suspects that she's having an affair), is not about to stop helping Cole, who wants more than anything to be rid of the terrifying ""sixth sense"" he has been given.
The film's story structure and plot machinations are completely unique and possess zero predictability factor, keeping the story moving at a slow, easy pace which allows us to take in everything that's important. What is really nice about this movie is its attitude towards it audience: it knows exactly what we want to see, and it gives us that in an ultra-creepy form without falling into any of the clichs or pitfalls of other thrillers. Visions of ghosts are nothing new, but the reasons for which they haunt Cole are completely new and fascinating, providing for some incredibly taut twists and surprises as the story rounds itself out to absolution.
Suspense and intensity are evident in the plot as well, yet are not the in-your-face types we are so used to from mainstream thrillers. Shyamalan substitutes hardcore scare tactics for sinister, eerie instances that rarely last more than a second. The effects are never gory or bloody, which softens the senses while throttling the mind with twists that need attention in order to grasp the final impact the film will have. There is a lot to miss in this movie if you do not keep yourself focused on it, but the final climax is worth all the attention you give it.
Countering the suspense and tension is an equal amount of emotional feeling and intensity, which has a great impact, even on cynics. It's impressive to watch Cole handling the situations he finds himself in; he is truly frightened, but finds the courage to try and solve the problem, with some help, of course. His relationship with his mother provides heartwarming moments of love and devotion. His mother truly does love him, and through their struggles and happy times, we believe it because it is totally convincing.
Cinematography plays a big role in this film as well, aiding the movie in its quest to break away from the regular methods and tactics used in filmmaking. Throughout the movie, cinematographer Tak Fujimoto conveys an atmosphere that is cold and, at times, dismal. Flesh tones and an overall casting of shadow on many shots, as well as the setting itself, all add to the sense of eeriness and the unknown. This is some pretty effective material here, all of which gives us the creeps without ever totally sending us off the deep end.
Characterization and acting bring a lot to this movie, and is the key element in bringing it to life. Bruce Willis gets a chance here to play a role that's a little out of his league from the action blockbusters and high-speed films of his career, taking a more quieter and gentle approach with his acting as Malcolm Crowe. This is his best work to date, and marks him as a very talented actor for his ability to play it rough in action films and totally segue into this area of acting with ease and effect. The main star of this movie, whom all the action and plot centers around, is Cole, played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment, a small boy with eyes that speak when his mouth does not. Cole is portrayed as being wise beyond his years, and his fear and emotions are brought out wonderfully under Osment's incredible performance. Toni Collette is Cole's mother, Lynn, who does a fine job of playing out her confusion and fright over her son's actions and conditions.
""The Sixth Sense"" is a landmark piece of filmmaking, one of those movies that stays in the mind long after it is seen. You need to keep close attention fixated on the film, but the movie does such a tremendous job of bringing you into its story and suspense that your attention will do anything but hinder. The performances are intriguing, the material is brilliant and intense, and the overall effect the movie has in the end, along with being a superb surprise, is one of refreshment and satisfaction.",985737600,,5607,4.693401015228426

1072513,3,630573240X,"Prior to viewing this movie I had read many articles and reviews praising it's subtle spookiness, quality of acting and general atmosphere (not to mention the hoopla made about the so called twist ending).Perhaps it was all of this hype that was responsible for my dissapontment with ""The Sixth Sense"". I don't mean to slight the performances in the film - Haley Joel Osment is exceptional as the boy troubled by visions of the dead and Bruce Willis is suitably poignant in his role as the troubled psychologist. Also, I must commend director Shyamalan for his restraint in regards to ""horror effects"". In this age of slash and bleed crap like ""Scream"" (1, 2 and 3 ad nauseum)any horror movie which goes a thoughtful, psychological route is to be applauded.
So, ""The Sixth Sense"" is well acted and reasonably intelligent. Why then did it leave me cold? Maybe, as I say, It was simply the mountains of hype. More likely it is simply that despite all efforts to tell a good story, ""The Sixth Sense"" suffers from too much style and not enough substance - feeling in the end like a Hollywood product and not a work of art. . .
. . . And speaking of the end. . . The ""surprise"" ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" is something we have seen before (and better)in at least three films I can pull off the top of my head - ""Carnival of Souls"" (1962), ""Siesta"" (1987) and ""Jacob's Ladder"" (1990). But who's counting?
""The Sixth Sense"" is a passable evenings entertainment, not a great film and certainly not a great ghost story. This is only my opinion, of course. Who am I to disgree with the hundreds here who have heaped so much adulation upon this movie?
P.S. ""A Stir of Echoes"", starring Kevin Bacon and based on a novel by Richard Matheson, came and went in the overblown shadow of ""The Sixth Sense"" back in 1999. Pick it up if you would like to see a ghost story done right.",985305600,,1863,4.4662756598240465

The supernatural aspect of the story is much more subtle than anything recently released under the moniker of a horror movie.  Absolutely no one dies in any kind of bloody way over the course of the movie, which is truly original in this day and age.  This movie is inventive and scary and I defy anyone that says that you'd only want to watch it once.

As time wore on and the public accolades pilled up my initial acceptance erroded as this supernatural TV movie was propelled by it's ending twist to ""excellent"" status and an Oscar nod for Best Picture, pushing out superior films (""Cider House"" did that too, but not so much). The most blatent loser in all of this is the overlooking of the true best movie of 1999- David Fincher's mindblowing ""Fight Club"". Politics of both films aside each's biggest selling point is there remarkably similar reality-redefining twists and it's at even this point in which ""Fight Club"" comes up resoundingly superior. In terms of sheer deception (but with plenty of clues along the way to make you feel stupid) it buries ""Sixth Sense"" in ambitousness and even sheer length. Fincher not only perfectly intigrates his twist into the story, but it also perfectly coincides with the self denial of the character and the spirit of Chuck Palahiuk's novel. The difference is Fincher's twist is intrigal to the effect and overall message of the story, while ""Sixth Sense"" is meerly a nifty trick. A second viewing of ""Sense"" is a different side of the same coin, while ""Fight Club"" is almost a whole different movie whose double meanings and manipulation make ""Sense"" look even childish.",984268800,,1385,4.897872340425532

I cannot view this movie as an entertainment piece. I see it as a query creator. Mr. Night has a talent for generating internal queries from the viewers of his films. When we see a film like this, we cannot help but ask important life questions regarding deeply held unsolved mysteries that effect every one of us. I am referring to our internal selves our spiritual selves.

What I like about this movie is that when I watch it I am compelled to experience more of that part of life that I feel. Less of my experience from what I see, hear, smell, taste, or feel externally. I am drawn internally. I am queried spiritually from the unknown. Did you feel like the spirit world was showing you something through this film? I certainly did. The film spoke to me and I can explain it only one way. From the mysterious; not so much ""what or who am I?"" But more so ""why am I here?"" What am I here to learn? From this film, from life.

The Sixth Sense most definately did, and I'm not just saying that to be like everybody else. Haley Joel Osment is an excellent young actor, and Willis is in top form in this flick. He handled an intelligent, sensitive role better than I ever thought possible, and Haley, well... Haley is already an icon of precocious youth. Because these actors were well-suited to their roles, the film is smooth and progresses naturally, without feeling rushed or pushed. I also liked the fact that Shyamalan didn't overuse the gore and ghosts aspect of the movie, for that would've quickly desensitized me. Instead, he placed the ghosts sparingly, at parts in the movie when they would create the most uproar amongst the audience. James Newton Howard is also an excellent composer and the score of Sense is haunting and lilting without being jolting.

1072594,5,630573240X,"...This question is asked of child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) by 10 year old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), somewhere mid relationship. It's very important to Cole because he wants to trust, and to tell his secret. Malcolm's answer ""I got an award once, from the mayor"" would seem to be a yes, but he's not so sure himself anymore.
About a year earlier, Malcolm and his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) were at home celebrating his receiving the award when an ex-patient Vincent, no longer a child and violently disturbed - having broken in, surprises them from where he had been hiding in their bedroom. He is scared, inconsolable and very angry with Malcolm for having failed him. In a fit of anguish he shoots Malcolm and kills himself.
Now a year later, Malcolm has concerns. Cole is exhibiting some of the same neuroses and signs of abnormal behavior reminiscent of Vincent. On top of that, he and Anna have grown distant, he can't seem to connect with her and he's definitely not helping Cole. But Cole, having come to trust Malcolm and encouraged by his gentleness and patience, is now ready to tell his secret... ""I see dead people. Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead"". Ghosts! Not nightmares, he's not sleeping - Cole sees them all the time.
At the mention of Ghosts some of us may be instantly turned off, especially if we do not much care for the use of Ghosts in movies - either for horror, as a gag or as a statement about the life beyond. Especially true if we don't believe in ghosts. The use of Ghosts here though, does not fall into any of these categories, and much more importantly it does not affect the plausibility or watchability of the movie in the least bit. We are drawn elsewhere. The action is with Cole and Malcolm and what is happening in their minds, psyches and relationships. Is Cole's mind slipping away into a state similar to Vincent's? Is Anna's love for Malcolm already gone? and back to where we began - Is the good doctor no longer any good, has he lost the ability to reach out and help? We know he has a gift - the mayor gave him an award. Malcolm is frustrated, puzzled, confused even. Why are things the way they are?
The answers come in a rush of awareness. Sudden, stunning clarity for Malcolm, and for us. An understanding of who was helping who. A conclusion that simply staggered me and made me want to watch the movie again to see what slipped by me before.",982713600,,2514,4.515350877192983

1072598,5,630573240X,"One of the few movies I have ever seen that was so respected and admired that no one ever told anyone else what happened at the end. Rare, to say the least. At the heart of this exceptional film is a moving performance by Hollywood action star Bruce Willis (of all people) as a child psychologist trying to help a young boy who seems to be haunted by visions of ghosts. The film unfolds slowly, picking up pace after a half an hour or so and then seems to end all too quickly, with a surprise twist at then end that will leave your jaw hanging on the floor. What director M. Night Shyamalan has done here is nothing short of amazing. An involving, emotional, and frightening film that recalls the days when vile special effects were not needed to terrify the audience. Instead, Shyamalan juxtaposes between subtle visual suggestion and bold, striking images to constantly calm and then shock the viewer and it's a strategy that works beautifully. I have never been so frightened by the turning of a doorknob as I have been during this film. But as terrifying as it is, THE SIXTH SENSE is also a film about loss and redemption and love and it will easily move you to tears. Haley Joel Osment is superb in the role of Cole Sear, the small child haunted for reasons he doesn't fully understand. Child stars like this don't come along very often and here he gives a performance that is both heartbreaking and assuring. His growth in both character and understanding during the course of the movie never seems 'acted'... it is such a strong performance that we believe every word he says even when the characters on the screen beside him don't. He is remarkable. As is Toni Collette as his hard-working mother, a woman at a loss to explain what's happening to her son. But the key performance in the film, the one that sets the story down it's unforgettable path comes from a most unlikely source: ex- New Kids On The Block singer Donnie Wahlberg, who lost a lot of weight to play a bitter and terrified ex-patient of Willis's. It is an amazing bit of acting that not only sets up the story but also defines it.

It's no where near as good as it's made out to be nor is it scary. The ending is really predictable, I can't believe no one saw it coming. The movie has some good points, a few good sub plots involving a dead girl tring to call Cole for help.

Not very scary but it's amazing how good the story is and it keeps you glued to your chair. I don't why Michael Caine deserved to win but Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear) was amazing and he stole every scene he was in. Bruce Willis is phenomenal as Dr. Malcolm Crowe he nearly dominates the movie. A performance by Toni Collette as Cole's mother was great and in a way deserved an academy award if only she had more screen time. This was one of the best movies and people liked it but Ignored it. In my opinion this film deserved Best Picture. It was a touching story and not a murderous tale like American Beauty. It is very sad too.

Willis' portrayal as the tormented child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is sensitive and compassionate, a beautifully realized, complete performance. And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has ""the sixth sense"" is astonishing--in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in ""The Miracle Worker"". The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save.  Brilliant, disturbing, evoking laughter, tears, chills, and a great deal of thought, this is great film making.

1072706,5,630573240X,"After an increasingly tiresome decade of ironic, self-satisfied and self-referential slashers (of exponentially decreasing quality since Scream), The Sixth Sense comes as manna from heaven (or hell!) for those of us who grew up revering The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Omen and the like. Like these great movies - which are its undeniable genre antecedents - The Sixth Sense plays it straight and unembarrassed with its classical horror themes of ghosts, clairvoyance and redemption beyond the grave. Given the brilliance, complexity and intelligence of Night Shyamalan's screenplay and direction, the movie needs no cheap eye-winking gimmicks to capture your attention and hold you riveted until its explosive revelation at the end. This is what going to the movies ought to be about - a compelling combination of intelligence and escapism and - for horror fans - some genuine shivers that far surpass the best of what the teenie-sequels can ever dream of offering. Bruce Willis is admirably low key in a performance of quiet confidence and power, and Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) proves she's no one note wonder with a performance of the same power and conviction as that of Ellen Burstyn's classic turn in The Exorcist. Haley Joel Osment is surely the best child actor to ever grace the screen and delivers a performance of such maturity, depth and intelligence that its scary in and of itself to think how much this boy actually knows at his age to hit all the right notes so accurately with such adult material (although, here too, The Exorcist provides precedent through Linda Blair). But the accolades of all horror fans will surely go first and foremost to writer-director M. Night Shyamalan who has single-handedly saved the genre from been swallowed up by the sensibilities of the teen horror marketplace. This is - along with the usual suspects in this regard - one of the five best horror movies ever made and a proud asset to my own horror shelf. For classical horror fans wondering whether anything of comparable seriousness and intelligence has been out there during the slasher years, please make a point of also checking out Lewis Gilbert's criminally ignored Haunted (with Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale) on DVD as well - it's everything Jan de Bont's Haunting tried to be but wasn't.",980208000,,2310,5.049738219895288

Anyway, the point is, I can't comment on the shock-value of the ending revelation, because I personally wasn't shocked; but I can and will comment on the quality and plausibility of the production.
  As you can see by my 4-star rating, I liked it. I was afraid it might be a gore-fest, full of gross, just-killed-looking ghosts, but that's far from the main theme of the picture. It's about a scared, ostracized little boy, and a troubled man who wants to help him, but isn't sure just what is real. I didn't find the basic premise or the ending TOO ridiculous or far-fetched, but there are still a couple of ""iffy"" points I wish I could talk over with the makers, asking exactly what they conceived to have been really happening. When I watched the film (on a premium movie channel), there was some commentary from them (the writer and the director(?)) played over the lead-out, which was interesting - I assume it's also included here.

 Boy, it was difficult to write much without giving any spoilers, but I hope this helped you decide.

It is so masterfully done with many layers, metaphysical, psychological, emotional, fabulous character and plot developments, that it lends itself quite well to viewing over and over again. Night Shyamalan, much like Quentin Tarantino did in ""Pulp Fiction"" has evoked a stellar performance from Bruce Willis, who is quite the underrated actor.  Pair him up with a child-genius actor as honest and believable as Haley Joel Osment (can you believe he was actually on the Jeff Foxworthy show at one point?!) and you've got an amazing acting ping-pong exchange of energy.  Toni Collette also delivers a wrenching portrayal of a mother at her wits end with her disturbed child. The film is chock-full of imagery and symbols, seemingly telling you one thing when in fact you've jumped to an erroneously conclusion, hence the much touted surprise twist at the end.

Haley Joel Osment, who plays the little boy who can see dead people, gives an incredible emotional performance. And this has to be Bruce Willis' finest performance to date.

See the film again, then watch the director (our Alfred Hitchcock) talk you through the thought process that resulted in this amazing story (he wrote the story, directed the picture, and played a cameo role).  See scenes that were cut from the movie...not just snippets, but full tangents to the main story line.  Hear how the musical score was constructed to complement the unusual story line.  Hear M. Night Shamalyn tell you how he was certain everyone would figure out what was going on and utter his amazement that his dream worked.  Hear how Donnie Walberg lost over 50 pounds to prepare for his short, but very important role.  Hear how this story started as a seed in the mind of a boy and grew into one of the best ghost stories of all time.
Be careful what reviews you read in Amazon.com...if you have not yet seen the 6th Sense, many reviews will spoil the entire movie. And it only takes two words to do so.

Perhaps this goes without saying for many of you, but I have this vision of all these people unwrapping their shiny new Christmas DVD players, and saying to themselves, ""I gotta try this thing out, but I don't have two hours for the movie... hmm... maybe the storyboards will give me a quick clue."" Don't do it for any DVD, and especially don't do it here. The Sixth Sense has a fantastic surprise ending (I flatly disagree with the reviewer who said anyone could see it coming), and if you watch the storyboard feature, you'll find out what it is in the first two minutes.
Other reviewers have covered the movie itself quite nicely (plot, casting, and so on), but I haven't seen any detailed commentary on the bonus DVD material. The items included here are a pretty good Hollywood 101 assembly. If you want to learn how the director, the producer, the editor, the cast, and all the other folks who put these films together do it, watch the special-feature stuff. I haven't seen the whole process laid out any better than this, although some of the individual ""how we made it"" elements are better in other DVDs.
I suggest watching the special features in the order they're listed on the case's back cover (I think-but I'm not sure-they're in the same order on the DVD menu: Storyboarding -> cast -> music & sound design -> reaching the audience -> rules and clues (this one's great!) -> deleted scenes -> conversation with Shyamalin (like most ""conversations w/the director"", this is kinda bloated--but still interesting) -> publicity. The sequence is logical, although not quite chronological; and you'll learn a lot about how the hit-making machinery meshes with art. It doesn't always work, but in the Sixth Sense it does. In sum, it's a good look at how they made a movie in the twilight of the 20th Century.
One note about the film itself: I'm not a Bruce Willis fan by any means, but I will give the man credit: he understands the role of his character completely. Other reviewers mentioned that Willis stood back and let Osment occupy front and center. I'm inclined to give Osment and Shyamalin more credit for that than Willis, but it would've been easy for Willis to let his character dominate the scenes.

1072937,1,630573240X,"In August of 1999, ""The Sixth Sense"" opened worldwide and, since then, has been established as one of the more successful psychological thrillers in our time. Critics said it had everything anyone could want in a flick, and noone dared to give it anything but five stars. When I saw this from an entertainment standpoint, I could not figure out whether the slow-motion button on my remote was jammed or if ""The Sixth Sense"" was an incredibly dull film that moved unbelievably slowly, and ended up nowhere. I eventually realized that the latter of the two answered my question. Yes, it is boring. No, it is not scary or entertaining in any way, shape or form. I would rather drop the gloves with Tie Domi than watch this pile of garbage movie again. But, I didn't hate it just because it was dull. There were plenty of other reasons why this movie is, in my honest opinion, the worst ever. Through the eyes of a critic, here are some mistakes that the critic's didn't catch. First of all, why is Cole a freak? He is only 8 years old and he walks and talks like the common person his age. Does it really make him that weird if he says that people were hung in what is now his elementary school? This is only bizarre if the person claiming it's truth is an adult. No disrepect to young boys like the one Haley Joel Osment portrays, but is it that uncommon for an 8-year old to say irrelevant things like he did? Next, why did he see visions of dead people? There are many twisted psychopath's in our society, but a common 8-year old who never hurt anyone would never have these kinds of hallucinations. In addition, the trailer for ""The Sixth Sense"" always shows the part where Cole tells Bruce Willis that the corpses want him(Cole) to do things for them(deceased). Put plain and simple, NO THEY DON'T! Sometimes, they talk to him, but they never ask or demand him to do one thing. Finally, does an 8-year old really NEED psychological help? No, he does not need help. He may be a slightly pessimistic child, but does he really need psychological assistance? NO. After the movie is over, ask yourself, did Bruce Willis do anything to help Cole? What I'm saying is that Bruce Willis' character isn't even needed at all for this motion picture. WHAT IS HE, A SIDEKICK? Some of the reviews on Amazon just warn you that a movie is bad and advise you to avoid it. But, I wanted to provide a good explanation as to why I hated ""The Sixth Sense"".

1072942,5,630573240X,"As a person who has actually, and intentionally, stayed in a haunted location and photographed real ghosts (yes, I've experienced the real thing) I was impressed with this movie's accurate portrayal of the discarnate and of ghostly phenomena.
The story starts as young Cole (Haley Joel Osment) begins to experience frightening encounters with ghosts, and begins to withdraw from the world around him because he is frightened.  An award-winning child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) attempts to council Cole, believing that his problem is one of unchecked childhood fantasy, or mild schitzophrenia.
Dr. Crowe realizes that Cole's symptoms are remarkably similar to those of a former patient, and reviews tapes of that patients sessions.  What he hears changes his mind about Cole... his previous patient wasn't imagining ghostly voices, they were real, and could be heard faintly in the background of the tape.
Now being aware of the reality of Cole's condition, and that what was assumed to be mental illness is really uncontrolled mediumistic ability, Dr. Crowe assists the young boy in communicating with the spirits to determine what they want.
The real twist to the story comes as Dr. Crowe realizes that he, too, is dead (killed by his first mediumistic patient) and only Cole can communicate with him.
The realism of this movie is what makes it so frightening.  For instance, the accurate depiction of the temperature dropping in the presence of a ghoist... something most parapsychological authorities agree on.  Or the ability to capture ghostly images on film, and voices on audio tape.
Thank you, M. Night Shyamalan (director) for not resulting to the usual special effects, or groaning chain-rattling depictions of ghosts.  This movie is sure to become a classic for all fans of supernatural horror, and those familiar with the real thing.",977097600,,1865,5.224080267558528
1072943,3,630573240X,"No point in belaboring the plot of  *The Sixth Sense*; just want to weigh in a year and a half later.
The movie has a truly surprise ending, making you want to sit through it a second time.  The question is, of course, is the movie worth a second viewing?  It's arguable.  I watched it a second time not because of the ending but rather because of M. Night Shyamalan's surprisingly sure-handed direction  (it's only his second movie!).  The scene composition, art direction, lighting, and measured pace  (very pleasing, that)  are almost wonders to behold in this day and age of racking noise, ""kinetic""  camerawork, and other excesses.  With a movie about ghosts, we've come to expect over-the-top shenanigans and scares that mainly come from sudden bleats of violins and synthesizers at 50-decibel volume in your typical Dolby-sound theater.  Shyamalan dares to take the genre pretty seriously, and he generates several legitimate scares.  The scares work because he's earned it.  The director has paid due attention to story and character development, and once the ghosts begin their visitations, we find ourselves concerned about the characters and really wishing that they don't come to harm.  (Typical slasher movies don't scare because we don't care -- about the characters, the story, the villain.)
Along that vein, Shyamalan wrings excellent performances from his cast.  Joel Haley Osment has to be one of the discoveries of the decade, Toni Collette is, as always, great, and Bruce Willis has been restrained to the point where he actually stays in character.
Not quite on the level of  ""great"", *The Sixth Sense*  is nevertheless very promising work from a director I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of.",977097600,,1716,5.028368794326241
1073046,4,630573240X,"Last year's ""The Sixth Sense"" is a very unique film in that it's both a very scary supernatural tale and a sublime story of friendship.  The film stars Bruce Willis as a childpsychologist with a traumatic past who decides to counsel a disturbed little boy named Cole Sear who is played by Haley Joel Osment.  Cole has a special gift that most adults wouldn't want; he can see and hear ghosts.  Willis then tries to help young Cole to cope with his ability and live a normal life.
This film has a very interesting premise, but more than that perhaps it's strongest asset are the strong performances by Haley Joel Osment and the underrated Bruce Willis.  Osment gives a star making performance showing an almost scary amount of maturity for a young child.  As for Willis, he gives his most earnest and best performance to date showing what a fine talent he really is.  While most of the story centers around Cole's performance, Willis doesn't try to outshine his young co-star.  Instead he shows the younger actor much respect by reacting and listening to him instead of out-act him.  Much recognition should go to Willis for Osment's performance, and for his own as well.
Another great ability Willis has is having complete trust from the audience.  He has always utilized this talent in his ""Die Hard"" films and other action adventures, but it has never been so useful than in ""The Sixth Sense"".  We react to his humanity has he tries to heal this sad little boy, and we sympathize for him has he desparately tries to mend his marriage.  Being as huge and important a star as Willis is, he shows restraint from turning this performance into a star vehicle.
One more wonderful thing about ""The Sixth Sense"" is the writing by director M. Night Shyamalan.  This isn't a trendy thriller with 90's gimmicks and one liners.  However, this film has undoubtedly become a trend setter.  Many of the films wonderful plot turns come naturally and are done with great care as to show the audience that these aren't artificial scares and suprises.
""The Sixth Sense"" is a film like ""Ghost"", an emotional supernatural tale with a suprisingly sweet heart.  There are emotional responses from the audience ranging from genuine fright to overwhelming suprise and delight.  It is because of these wonderful suprises and performances that ""The Sixth Sense"" may reaffirm your belief in movies.",976665600,,2372,4.805418719211823

But then, I have to remind myself that the film was made by a young filmmaker who grew up watching films like ""Poltergeist"" and Steven Spielberg kitschathons. Bruce Willis (not one of my favorite performers) was good in the film, nice and understated, and Haley Joel Osment is a talented little boy-although I found his performance not always sympathetic-sometimes downright annoying, especially the ""Stuttering Stanley"" scene, which reminded me of another annoying child performance-the ""Redrum"" mishigas from ""The Shining"" (another overrated, silly film directed by the once-great Stanley Kubrick).

Everyone had been talking about the movie and its knockout ending, but it became apparent almost immediately what was about to ensue.  The sad truth is that this film is a complete rehash of the earlier film ""Jacob's Ladder"", from which is steals its structure and its 'knockout ending'.
Granted, Tak Fujimoto has done a superb job with the cinematography, and the look and feel of the film are superb.  There are no over-the-top special effects, and everything that creeps you out is done in a very subtle and subversive manner.
My biggest problem with this movie is that I just can't give it credit for being a copy-cat film.  It's one thing to re-engineer another film, but to do it and not give credit where credit's due is bang out of order.  I bet Adrian Lynne (the director of Jacob's ladder) is fuming.  Besides, could you really walk around for a whole year and not notice you're not getting served at restaurants and that no one is talking to you?  Also, if cold air only comes out of people's mouths when the dead people are angry, then why does it come out of Willis' wife at the end?? Well apparently the director of this movie didn't pay too much attention to these plot holes, because he had built his film on the structure and ending of another, and that is all he was probably concerned about.

1073052,5,630573240X,"""The Sixth Sense"" is probably the best film of 1999.  It's a movie that tells the story of Cole Sear (beautifully played by Haley Joel Osment), a child with an unusual -and definitely scary -ability of seeing dead people that don't accept that they are not among the living anymore.  As psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis plays someone who goes beyond his ""Die Hard"" character.  The relationship between these two gives one of the strong points of this film.
Another strong point -and I believe Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of it -is the twist at the end of the movie.  It is very unexpected.  Don't let anybody tell you.  All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the film, even though you may be in for some chills.
And since I am reviewing this movie on the DVD format, I've got to tell you that the extras on this edition are terrific, with deleted scenes, and some behind-the-scenes featurettes.  Personally I like the interview to composer James Newton Howard regarding how he created the music to fit in the scary environment of the movie.

Cole keeps this fact very secretive and well-hidden, but when Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) comes along, Cole believes that he can help him. Can Crowe help him? Or is Cole stuck with this horrible trauma?
The Sixth Sense is a pure, fresh breath of air for horror movies. It is directed and written brilliantly by M. Night Shamalyn. Bruce Willis plays the main character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, and his performance was rudely underrated. But, it is Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette who manage to shine the most. Osment is brilliant as the confused kiddo Cole, he deserved an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Toni Collette shone like a superstar, her performance as the terrified mother was a very effective turn for her career. Go and see this now.

He was amazing, his fear seeming genuine, from the perfect delivery of his dialogue to the subtle facial movements that sold the scene. Perhaps the only thing more surprising than the kid's performance was his being robbed of the Oscar he so richly deserved. Bruce Willis broke his steretypical one-line warrior role and made us believe that he could be more than a tough guy, like say, a sensitive and intelligent psychiatrist. Toni Collette showed us just how amazing her voice-talent is and how real her emotions can be as the mother of the frightened boy. Olivia Williams was convincing as Dr. Crowe's wife, wether she was being playful, loving, scared, or cold.  I could mention the writing and the directing. M. Night Shyamalan proved just how great he can be with his first true success. From the scene set-ups to the incredible camera angles, his on-screen vision is without parallel in the suspense genre.

1073130,5,630573240X,"There are so many things right with this film it is hard to know where to start. First the acting is the best I have seen in any kind of suspense/supernatural thriller/horror film since ""The Exorcist."" Bruce Willis turns in his fine performance on the level with his performances in ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""12 Monkeys."" He is an intense, loving husband, and caring helper. Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment finish out the main trio of actors, both turning in Oscar-worthy performances that suspend disbelief and bring you into to the wide range of emotions used on the director's and screenwriter's palette.
Then there is the story. There are layers and layers to this story, yet the director carefully unravels them to a climactic ending that in the hands of a lesser director could have ended up being one big mess. M. Night Shyamalan lets us feel Cole's pain and torment without resorting to the sappy music and emotional manipulation used by many other popular directors. He develops the relationship of Cole and his mother, essentially a subplot, and weaves it seamlessly into the main plot where you can hardly tell the two apart. The delicate relationship between Malcolm and his wife gives the audience insight into the vulnerabilities of Willis' character. Scary with a heart.
The soundtrack is understated but extremely effective. Eerie and chilling. And the DVD version has more special features than 95% of the new releases on the current market. You will understand more about how this movie was made after seeing the special features from storyboarding to marketing. Since special effects weren't too important in this film, there isn't an hour-and-a-half special effects documentary like the one included in ""The Mummy.""

Every single actor plays an amazing role in this movie. Willis is said to be at his best. Osment and Collette were nominated for Academy Awards from this particular film.

1073132,5,630573240X,"This movie definitely surpassed my expectations.  Granted, my expectations weren't too high- I saw a matinee, just wanted it to be mildly entertaining. I had seen BWP a few weeks before at the time and had friends who said they almost cried BWP scared them so bad. Well, there's one of many moments in this (there's so many that just made every hair on my body stand on end, my skin crawl, and made me actually gasp- and I can say that I can probably only name 10 or scary movies that have 1 or 2 moments like that). I won't give the end of it away, but the moment that starts out with the kid appearing to Cole and whispering excitedly, ""Come on, I'll show you where my Dad keeps his gun""- that one moment, to me, was 10 times scarier than all of the Blair Witch Project put together. There were many times where I jumped, and it wasn't just a ""fake"" jump, it was something clever that I genuinely didn't see coming. This was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. It would definitely go on my top 5 scariest list, along with Carrie and The Exorcist.
As far as the notorious plot twist, first of all, I've decided when it's hyped that a movie HAS a twist ending, that's a drag right there, because you-well, I do anyway--spend at least half the time trying to guess the twist. Having seen a hell of a lot of movies, and a hell of a lot of twists, I usually get it 9 times out of 10.) I'm pretty much the spoiler queen, it's like a drug or something, maybe 1% of the time I can resist reading them, I don't know what it is. Unfortunately, I read a review that gave it away without warning- it named a couple of movies (I won't name them, because it could give away the ending if you saw them) and said if you guessed the ending to those, you'll guess the ending to this. If I had to pick any movie where I could go back and not know the spoiler ahead of time, this would be it. My husband didn't see it coming, and he's pretty clever about guessing them too.
Something else I did not see coming was how emotional this movie made me. Years ago I had a friend die on me without getting to say goodbye but I was over my grieving at the time I saw this...or so I thought.  My reaction makes me think I wasn't 100% over it. If you've seen the movie, you'll know why that hits you hard. If you've recently experienced the death of someone close to you (especially if you are not finished grieving) then in all seriousness, please think twice before you watch this movie. At the very least, see it with someone supportive who you are not afraid to get emotional in front of. During the second to last scene in the car, I surprised myself by starting to cry- not just getting choked up but actually crying to the point where I needed Kleenex-, and I didn't stop until the credits were part way over (and Bruce Willis is not one of my favorite actors). MAN that scene in the car got to me.
Re-reading the screenplay, I realized even more how great it was, and how heartbreaking. There are so many elements that just make your heart wrench. I read the last scenes of the screenplay at home, alone, and had a really good cry, which hasn't happened since I read the screenplay to The Green Mile.
Aside from that, again, this movie scared the you-know-what out of me. The premise is very scary but many filmmakers could have handled it in a way that bungled it up. In this movie, the filmmakers did it just right. Even if you *really* don't like Bruce Willis' acting, and were turned off by the trailer, give it a chance. But don't be surprised if you need to sleep with the light on.",972950400,,3600,4.2235123367198835

First and foremost was the way the filmmakers stuck to the rules they set up for the universe. There were no cheap gimmicks or shortcuts taken and there was a lot of attention to the details of each scene.
If you're like me, then the ending of the movie came as a surprise. It was not as surprising as the ending to Perfect Blue, but suspenseful nonetheless.
Perhaps the best part is the fact that this is really a movie that screams to be watched twice, just so you can go back and scrutinize every scene and detail to see what you missed. There's always something new to discover in the viewing.
For all these reasons, I give the movie a solid five stars. One of the best of the year.",972345600,,833,4.180124223602484

Now the thing that made it great for me was on DVD was the first time i ever saw it. Noone eevr told me the ending and I am happy about that, But however if you have seen the movie then the DVD is not really worth it as there is nothing else to see. They have an alternate ending, but it is essentially the same just done differently. What I did like was the superior performance of Bruce WIllis as he as usual stole the movie. So as it goes for the movie- 5 stars. Watching the movie a second time and trying to pick up ""the clues""-3 stars, after that its just not worth it to see it again as the ending changes the whole complection of it.

The performances were terrific. I'm always leery of anything with a child in it but of course Haley Joel Osment is a separate breed from sitcom monsters. Bruce Willis does an excellent and sensitive job portraying the child psychologist. Regrettably I think some viewers were expecting the usual action/adventure fare and were disappointed that it was not, and were unable to accept that he is a fine actor who has done a wide range of roles.

The people at Touchstone decided to market this as a scary movie hoping to cash in at Halloween, if it had the legs to make it that far, and did it ever.  But not for the reasons you might expect.  Sense is a touching story of Cole, a confused young boy who sees ghosts and subsequently turns to a once-renowned psychitrist for help.  Bruce Willis plays the part of Dr. Crowe to subtle perfection (I'll bet you never thought you'd see the word subtle to describe the man who brough us Die Hard and Armageddon).  His disbelief in Cole lingers a little too long, but not long enough to weigh down the film's swift pace.  The pieces start to come together and by the end provide us with a good jolt that will make repeat-viewing a must.

Haley Joel is just incredible, I am more impressed by his performance every time I see it. What a shame he did not win an Oscar for this movie, I guess they just couldn't bear to give it to a kid. But boy, he sure makes this movie great. Bruce Willis as well does a great job, certainly his best role to date. All the cast was wonderful, and the story extremely well written, perfectly paced and with a wonderful surprise ending. I particularly like this movie as it didn't go out of its way to use blood and gore to scare you, it did it with a buildup of suspense and mainly through the terror and fear of the characters themselves. Excellent.
Now, for the DVD. I love a DVD with plenty of extra material, and this one certainly has that. Always fun getting to watch scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor, and Night's first movies were a riot.

1073249,4,630573240X,"Twists are great in movies.  They are especially great for the Box Office.  It changes the audience's understanding of the rest of the movie and all they can talk about is why they didn't spot the twist sooner.  Primal Fear had a great twist ending.  Ditto, the Usual Suspects.  Now, add The Sixth Sense to this list.  Notice they all did great at the Box Office.  The lesson to the studios is to put more surprises into their scripts.
However, wheras Primal Fear and the Usual Suspects were overshadowed by their shocking revelations, The Sixth Sense will be remembered not so much for it's twist but for it's original story: a boy that sees dead people.  Why hadn't this story been made before?  It seemed so obvious.  It is a child's worst nightmare - being able to see ghosts and not being able to tell anyone about it.
The reason a movie like this wasn't made before was because the script required an adult performance from a 10 year old.  Impossible?  No, but it needed a very special kid.  Perhaps there was only one child in 10 million who could have acted in this movie but fortunately, Haley Joel Osment defied the odds and got the part.  He was a revelation.  His performance seems only better when you look at other American child performances.  Often, they can destroy a good movie with their annoying cuteness.  Check out Liar, Liar.
Osment was exemplary and honoured for it.  I, for one, thought it unjust that his co-star didn't receive any such accolade.  The performance of Bruce Willis was subtle and underwhelming.  We never expected a surprise, simply because there never seemed anything out of place with this resolutely plain character.  We saw an ordinary child psychiatrist desperate to help one of his patients.  Willis, knew a lot more about the character but never over-emphasised it.  So what, you ask?  Well, Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for the same thing in Suspects.
I expect a lot from this director now.  Anytime, a director writes and direct, I question which one he did better.  I can't decide in this case.  His script was marvellous, with very few holes.  But his direction was methodical and moody, creating a very spooky atmosphere.  Kudos to Night on both counts.",971308800,,2203,4.693717277486911

1073311,1,630573240X,"This movie had been so hyped-up that I was really expecting something special.  Unfortunately, when I saw it I was disappointed.  This movie is based on the same premise as so many other movies lately:  ""Dead people contact the living to help them solve their own murder.""  We saw it in ""What Lies Beneath,""  ""Stirs of Echoes"" and many others.  I could probably fill a page listing movies with a similar plotline.  I have to admit that this movie did have a twist to the ending that I haven't seen before but that didn't make up for the routine nature of the plot.
A lot has been said about Haley Osment, the actor that played the psychic child and what a phenomenal performance he gave.  I'll admit that he did a good job,but the role was not extremely challenging.  The entire movie he had the same expression on his face - sort of a like someone that is nauseous.  ""I'm nauseous. . .  and I see dead people."" The role really didn't require him to show much range of emotion (other than screaming occasionally).
Other reviewers have pointed out the gaping holes in the plot so I won't repeat all of them, but suffice it to say that there are many.  Example: Why would the girl that knows that one parent was poisoning her, not tell someone.  Instead she decides that the best thing to do would be put it on video tape, then hide the tape so that - maybe- the right parent will find the tape and know what happened. That makes sense. I will mention one other one has to do with the ending.  (If you haven't seen the movie and want to be surprised don't ready any further. )  On all of the ""dead people,"" their wounds are clearly visible.  The Willis character looks fine until the end of the movie.  Then suddenly we see the bullet wound and blood. What makes him so different?  Shouldn't he be walking around with a hole his chest and a bloody shirt?
In summary, this is just a routine movie.  The ending has a unique twist but you can't rate a movie based on the last five minutes.  Taken as a whole, there isn't anything special here.",971222400,,2038,4.341269841269841

Someone breaks into his house and he points out to them that there are no drugs or needles around, and he will call the police if necessary.  I just had to shake my head, seeing that.  By the way, he did a great job of it.  You believed that he was a child psychologist who had just received an award from a grateful city.
Haley Joel Osmet was a compelling, but strange, 9 year old.  When he explains his 'gift' to his mother, I... hm.  It just inspired this giant nameless emotion in me.  In retrospect, I'm just in awe that it could happen.
This movie just did everything ""more"" than other movies.  The gore wasn't terribly gory, but it did grab you (me anyway, but I'm a wimp that way).  The ending was... just amazing.  Suddenly, it all makes sense and you look back over the movie and say, ""It fit, and I was fooled.  I didn't see it, but it's so obvious now that I know.""

Bruce Willis is superb (I think it was the little smirk that can't totally be erased that may have cost him a well-deserved Oscar nomination), Toni Collette is, as usual, great.  But it's Haley Joel Osment who will astonish you.  He may have only been ten years old when this was shot, but this kid is a brilliant actor.  He makes you feel his character's terror without screeching or wailing like his peers tend to do.

Bruce Willis gave a surprisingly capable performance, and Haley Joel Osment did an excellent job of handling a very difficult role.  The success of this movie did seem a slight bit overwhelming though. To me this is a good but not great movie. My first problem with this movie was (don't read on if you haven't seen the movie), is that aside from the clever gimmick of the ending (which reflects back if you watch the movie again), this is a strong but standard thriller film. It's well written, but not particularly creative, and the end gimmick, as compared to say, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, is really kind of pointless if you really think about (more than anything, it shows the craft of a smart screenwriter). And finally, this movie suffered from a lack of buzz compared to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, as both came out at similar times. THE SIXTH SENSE, came out without a great deal of hype, soon after the aggressively marketed BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. As a result, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (which I feel is much creepier and disturbing) suffered from a backlash, while this movie came out at the perfect time to recieve the opposite.  Anyways, I do like this movie a great deal. And, it's definitely a movie that should be seen more than once. But ""One of the best films ever made?"" Please.

1073463,5,630573240X,"Why don't they make good scary movies anymore? Sure, there have been a few  great horror/suspense movies made in the last 10 years or so, but they've  been buried underneath a mass of horrible movies that passed themselves off  as scary. I blame the special effects people. They've gotten so good at  mimicking dismemberment and other nasty things that filmmakers have forgone  suspense for the slaughterhouse. They forget that suspense and terror are  created as much in the mind of the viewer as on the screen. These movies  don't let us think, probably because they don't trust us to.
""The  Sixth Sense"" is a movie that lets us exercise the 'ol bean while  getting good and scared in the bargain. The plot is so well-known that it  needs little description. A psychiatrist (Willis) treats a young boy  (Osment) who, as the films signature line states, ""sees dead  people"". What to do with such a child, who otherwise seems normal,  intelligent, and aware that what's he's saying makes no sense to anyone.  What to do except believe him?
It's odd to call a scary suspense movie a  kind movie, but this movie is not, ultimately, about horror. It's about  horrible things, but it's actually a kind, quiet movie, which I think is a  big part of its appeal. That and the surprise ending, of course. Much has  been made of the huge plot twist at the end that had people going to see it  3 or 4 times, just so they could see the movie knowing what the ending was.  I can see why. I won't spoil it by telling you what it is, of course, but I  will say with some smugness that I figured it out with about 30 minutes  left. But...I'll admit that if I hadn't read in reviews that there WAS a big  twist at the end, I never would've guessed it. It is simple and perfect and  absolutely necessary for the film to end as it must.
The acting is as  spare and quiet and excellent as the film deserves. I don't know who Bruce  Willis' agent is, but if his client is capable of this kind of work than  why does he end up in all those crappy movies year after year. And Osment  was definitely deserving of his Oscar nomination. So many child actors try  to act like little adults, or they act like ridiculous cartoon kids. Osment  shows the quicksilver intelligence as well as the vulnerability of children  with astonishing skill. The last scene he appears in, when he and Willis  say goodbye, is exceptional, the more so after a second viewing.
""The Sixth Sense"" is the biggest grossing suspense movie of  all time, so maybe there's hope for we filmgoers after all. And if Mr.  Shyamalan keeps making movies like this, we all have a lot to look forward  to.",968025600,,2643,4.458158995815899

1073671,4,630573240X,"The Sixth Sense, in itself, was a brilliant movie that started off putting you into a very realistic world until the extraordinary happens, and you  have no choice but to believe it.
What made me upset is that all the  people around me talking about the ending...and when Andy Richter on Late  Night with Conan O'Brien just said the ending...when millions of people  were watching, and that is true.
However, Bruce Willis finally escaped  the Die Hard and bad-action stuff, and went into an odd, real,  psychological thriller that makes you think there might be something around  there, and maybe there is someone upstairs when you hear a creak...
The  boy, Haley Joel Osment, who played Cole, is phenomenal...I guess the  Academy would feel pathetic if they gave the Oscar to a little boy.  The  mother is a divorced, overwhelmed person who is entirely believable.  I  liked how his last name, Sear, resembles Seer.
A minor flaw was that I  would have liked to known more about the dead person with the scars all  over her...and the scars on Cole. I liked that the dead people really  wanted help, and I wanted to know about the dead person during the  audition.  The actors who played the dead people were plain freaky, as the  low-budget barely-any-special-effects, REAL places in a REAL world  is.

This disk is has high production values.  When you go to the  menu, it even has an errie visual and music.  The deleted scenes are  wonderful.  The director is taking you into the editing process of the  film. I agree with the director's decisions to delete the scenes he did,  but they are also wonderful.  The rules and clues, which I believe are also  on the video, are also wonderful.  The director seems to genuinely be a  happy man who likes his fans.

In comparison to the standard gore-filled, brain-dead fare such as the Scream trilogy and other  stinkers(oops, I mean ""thrillers"") the Hollywood machine has  crammed down poor moviegoers' throats in the past decade, no wonder some of  us seem to think this is a cinematic tour de force. I really did want this  movie to live up to the hype but sadly, I was sorely disappointed.  Admittedly my standards are high, having been raised on such classics as  ""Psycho"" and ""Rear Window"". Hitchcock did it better, he  knew how to shock and scare and just plain thrill the audience. The  ""surprise"" ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" was evident  after the first 15 minutes whereas, good old Hitch could leave the audience  hanging until the very end. Haley Joel Osment was cute in a Mikey-from the  ""Life"" cereal commercial-sort of way but the rest of the movie  fell flat. I left the movie feeling deflated and wishing I had spent my  money on a rental of a Hitchcock classic rather than sitting there watching  an unsuspenseful and pretty predictable offering from a genre which went  downhill after Hitchcock's death.

What about a third time?  Fourth?  Seventy-First?  The  movie is a cinematic treat with great scenery and great acting (especially  by Osmet), but part of its charm is the fact that you are as nervous as the  characters - not knowing who/what will show up next.

I bought the DVD the day it came out, watched it, and the next thing you know, it was over! I was disappointed,  not because of the movie, but everyone said that it's scary when it wasn't.  This was a good boost for up and coming director, M. Night Shyamalan. A  good role for diverse actor (yes, DIVERSE), Bruce Willis. It will also mark  the careers of oscar nominees Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. Bruce  plays Malcolm Crowe, a Psychologist that tries to help Cole (played by  Osment), a child with visions of dead people.
The key to this movie, if  you've never seen it, is not knowing the ending!  If someone tells you the  ending, it literally ruins it for you! I'm fortunate enough to have watched  it without knowing the ending. It's pretty sad, the outcome of the movie. I  felt empty harted, sad, and mad. It left me hanging. Watching it the 2nd  time wasn't the same as the 1st, since you know the ending. It does give  you a chance to look at the clues throughout the movie. The DVD edition is  special.

Even for non-horror buffs such as myself, this is a very  good night's entertainment (or Night's entertainment as the case may be).  The plot twist is undeniably clever.  The acting (and not just Haley Joel  Osment) is solid throughout.  Well shot, extremely well edited, who could  argue?
OK, so occasionally you meet some know-it-all who swears they  figured it all out from the beginning (or from the TRAILERS!) but even they  have to admit that the film is well constructed and very, very clever.  The  VHS version comes with interview clips with Shymalian and various  producers, very interesting if not illuminating.  I imagine the DVD has  even more in the way of such tidbits.
Ultimately though, the question  you have to ask yourself is whether or not you need to own this film.  For  now, I've seen the film twice--once for the experience and once to analyze  it--and I'm sated.  Can't say that it's a keeper for me. I have no desire  to add this film to my collection. There'll likely come a day when I'll  feel like renting it again, and it's good to know that I can see dead  people again if the, ahem, spirit moves me.",964396800,,1222,4.534562211981567
1073959,4,630573240X,"As you watch little Haley Joel Osment mutter that he sees 'Dead People' you wonder what kind of tale you're going to get into, could this be horror, psychological drama or what. As things start off, it leaves you  very mixed about what is going on, the start is action packed - but you  have little idea of why.
When I watched this film, I got to a point in  the story where I wasn't sure what exactly the film was trying to achieve.  It was as if it had the potential to go somewhere - but wasn't quite doing  it. There were seemingly so many areas that didn't fit - or didn't make  sense, but the ending is where that is cleared up and much more.
The  ending has to be seen to be believed, it leaves you gasping with amazment  as you realise what you'd been seeing was not really what was happening in  the film - it was basically a distorted view of the lead character - Bruce  Willis. The thing that makes this movie such a hit is the way it leaves you  open mouthed and shocked at the twist at the end, with no prior warning the  film leaves you with multiple unanswered questions, and clears up the  scraps from earlier on. Is this not what a good movie should do?
Away  from the storyline, the acting is brilliant, Bruce Willis is the major  character actor here, but supporting performances from the little Osment  and the supporting cast are first rate. The way Osment manages to portray  an emotional scene in the car with his on screen mother makes you wonder  just how much talent this little boy has.
This movie doesn't appeal to  one SECTOR of the fim audience as so many movies do. You don't have to like  a particular style of movie to enjoy this, as it panders to all needs. A  rare movie that is universally popular, and you don't need to sit there  thinking before watching this movie 'Will this be my type of movie' it  will.
The only possible shortfall of the movie is that it stutters along  a times, trying to mask the holes that would inevitably appear due to the  knowledge you lack as a viewer, before all is explained in the end. But  this can easily be over-looked, as you are left feeling as if you have just  exited that all too enjoyable movie rollercoater.",964224000,,2188,4.286063569682152
1073960,5,630573240X,"This review pertains particularly to the DVD version of this film because even though I'd seen 'Sixth Sense' twice at the cinema, the DVD purchase was still worth it because of its great extras. I particularly loved the  'Rules and Clues' segment which explained how the famous twist had to be  believable for both the first and second viewings. Some were obvious but  some were pretty obscure and admittedly, maybe I'm a little dim, but I  think the editors gave their viewers a little too much credit in the  fine-detail detective work! We didn't know we had any reason to be looking  for clues! Fascinating stuff anyway.
The 'deleted scenes' were also great  to see and quite considerable in content. You kind of agree with the  reasons for the deletions but understand the angst at having to remove such  great scenes. The DVD is worth it just to see those extra moments between  Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis.
And how ever many times it's been  said, I have to add to the tributes to Haley Joel Osment and say that his  portrayal of Cole was flawless. You felt the weight of the world on his  shoulders and the ending was as much as a salvation for the the viewer as  it was for him.

The Sixth Sense most definately did, and I'm not just saying that to be like everybody else. Haley Joel  Osment is an excellent young actor, and Willis is in top form in this  flick. He handled an intelligent, sensitive role better than I ever thought  possible, and Haley, well... Haley is already an icon of precocious youth.  Because these actors were well-suited to their roles, the film is smooth  and progresses naturally, without feeling rushed or pushed. I also liked  the fact that Shyamalan didn't overuse the gore and ghosts aspect of the  movie, for that would've quickly desensitized me. Instead, he placed the  ghosts sparingly, at parts in the movie when they would create the most  uproar amongst the audience. James Newton Howard is also an excellent  composer and the score of Sense is haunting and lilting without being  jolting.
If you haven't seen it yet, please do. There is a very definate  reason it was pegged the #1 thriller of all time, and the academy (in my  opinion) must've been out of their minds not to award this superlative  endeavor.",964137600,,1182,4.787128712871287

While the box-office may have had something to do with it, the actual movie itself is nowhere  near as good as the hype makes out.  The plot is simple: weird kid sees  ghosts and uses his powers to help them. Harvey Joel Osmont and Bruce  Willis do put in superb performances but even so, this movie is only  mediocre. The budget seems to have been blown on hiring Bruce Willis. What  was left was spent on makeup for the two or three ghosts we see. This movie  isn't for me - it's too slow and I didn't find it frightening or  interesting - but I can see that some people might like it. My advice would  be to rent it before you buy it. The DVD is very good, with lots of  worthwhile extras. The director says in one of the interviews that the  biggest audience was 'young boys and older women'. Perhaps a movie only for  the spiritually minded among us.  The huge box office takings can only  really be because of the surprise ending. It really isn't as clever as has  been made out.

I couldn't believe I was watching the same movie that got  such great notices and kept folks in theatre lines for so long.
The  direction and cinematography are flawless. The screenplay is gripping. The  acting is first rate. The sound is good. Hence the two stars. There just  wasn't enough to last for 2 hours. Everything of substance was seen and  heard in the trailers.
I found myself wrestless and woozy after only 45  minutes. Then after another 45 minutes I perked up realizing maybe it was  almost over. When it finally ended, my fellow viewer and I stared at each  other in disbelief - ""Is That IT?""
How could a film that  seemingly has everything going for it turn out to be so gosh-darn boring?  Are there no longer ""dailies"" in Hollywood? Was this simply  scraped together by audience profiling software in some accountants  office?

It  helps the watcher develop a spooky and freakish mood which helps you enjoy  the film in a fun way. The features also helped me learn more about the  film, why wouldn't it? I enjoyed watching M. Night's first horror film  which I laughed vigorously. Among the features are deleted scenes which I  feel were neglected great. Osmont's performace alone in a scene entitled,  Toy Soldiers was just tear shedding and really made you believe in the  character. Look at me, the DVD has brought me to babble on. That's good I  guess. The film is wonderful and probably the best of '99. Performances by  Willis went un-noticed by the Academy, but people who've seen Willis in  films such as Die Hard will be surprised to find him just as great as  Osmont.

1074371,5,630573240X,"'The Sixth Sense' is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. People who don't understand this movie either (a) don't pay close attention to what's happening in this movie; (b) just don't know much about the sixth  sense; or (c) don't believe in the sixth sense.
The 'sixth sense', for  those who have no clue on what it is, is a ""special power"" that  some people (very few, however) can have. They claim to be able to see  ghosts and spirits and be able to talk to them and the ghosts and spirits  can talk back to them and see them - kind of like being a median.
Anyway,  this movie is about a little boy name Cole and a child phychiatrist named  Malcolm. In the beginning, Malcolm and his wife meet one of Malcolm's old  patients. That patient tells Malcolm that Malcolm hadn't helped him solve  his problems, that it just made his problems worse. So Malcolm's patient  ended up shooting Malcolm with a gun and then killed himself. A year later,  Malcolm's new patient is 9-year-old Cole Sears who has the sixth sense.  He's afraid of the ghosts and spirits who ""haunt"" him - that's  his secret that he shares with Malcolm. Cole hides out in a church for  sanctuary reasons because of the ghosts. When Malcolm finds out Cole's  secret, he tries to help Cole get rid of the ghosts and make them leave him  alone.
'The Sixth Sense' is a really good thriller starring Bruce Willis  and Haley Joel Osment with a really surprising ending! The acting is  spectacular, and Haley Joel Osment shines in this movie (it's a real shame  he didn't win that Oscar for 'Best Supporting Actor' - he really deserved  it)!

1074479,5,630573240X,"I didn't move or even blink during my first viewing of this movie; it is completely engulfing.
Haley Joel Osment (Cole) is either the most gifted child actor today or he has been working on the script since birth! He is a  completely polished actor; he has all the appropriate facial expressions,  tones of voice and pauses. He is truly a one-in-a-million find.
Bruce  Willis plays a dedicated child psychologist (Doctor Malcolm Crowe) who not  only works great with Osment but also does an excellent job balancing  helping Cole, who ""doesn't want to be scared anymore,"" with  getting his marriage back together. This is very challenging because they  hardly speak anymore. (The fact of him always coming home late doesn't help  matters.)
Toni Collette who plays Cole's Mother couldn't have been  better if she had practiced her lines for 5 years! She shows so much love  and support for Cole; she is an ideal role model for all parents. One of  the last scenes of the movie with Cole and her in the car is some of the  best acting I've EVER seen.

Really?
What's wrong with you?
This is one movie I would say is mandatory for anyone who likes having their sense of reality flipped on its head. A child psychologist, Malcolm  Crowe, sensitively played by Bruce Willis, is shot by a former patient who  then commits suicide. A year later, his marriage falling apart, he takes on  a similar case, a young boy called Cole Sean- played by Haley Joel Osment -  who seems to be disturbed and preoccupied. Crowe soon discovers that his  new patient can see ""dead people"", ghosts who make his life hell.  Slowly Cole comes to terms with his sixth sense, but this leads to a  devastating revelation which no one expects.
Not only is this film  disturbing in concept but in execution. There is no gore to speak of, no  rising skeletons and no medieval demons. Instead there is suspense you  could cut with a knife and a desperately heart-rending end. In my humble  opinion it's criminal Haley Joel Osment didn't receive an Oscar for his  role - his acting is superb, and doesn't lapse into wide eyed trembling.  Bruce Willis takes an interesting role which was difficult to act  convincingly and makes it believeable, and the whole film is brought  together by a faintly eerie soundtrack which sums up the whole  atmosphere.

The acting is simply incredible- Haley Joel Osment is incredible in his  portayal of a small boy named Cole Sear who is haunted by spirits of the  dead. Bruce Willis is really believable in his part portraying a child  psychologist with serious problems of his own. The cinematography and  excellent plot come together to create an eerie, ghastly experience-  without very much blood or gore.
Now- for some about the story. I don't  want to give away too much, because most of the enjoyment from the movie  comes from the plot. Basically, Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist with a  life in turmoil, becomes determined to help a small boy who says he  ""Sees dead people."" Haunting memories from the past drive  Malcolm's ambition, making him all the more set in his cause.

Bruce Willis again is  under-appreciated.  He got lost in all the hoopla over Haley Joel Osment.  But Bruce turns in a very multi-layered and controlled performance.  Haley  is just out of this world great!  Never have I seen a child actor who has  performed to this level.  Not once did I think Haley was acting.  He  definitely should have won the Oscar for supporting actor.  At his age,  what an accomplishment---to carry so much of this complex, involving film.  Those little shoulders did a fantastic job.  I'm looking forward to seeing  him in ""Pay Forward"" with Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt.  He's an  actor to reckon with!  Also, Toni Colette as Cole's mother is fabulous.  One of the few screen mothers who really seemed to be a mother.  Her  performance is ""the heart"" of the movie.  Watching her go through  her many layers of love, guilt, fear, and frustration, and yet maintain  that love for her troubled son is worth the price of the video!  Olivia  Williams as Willis' wife is also extremely effective in a smaller but  significant role.  Even after the movie ends, you want more.

The second 1/3 was pretty good suspense. The last 1/3 destroyed the whole film. The whole concept of the boy essentially becoming ghost psychiatrist was beyond stupid, and removed any previous aspects of horror.  Having ghosts appear to say ""Tell dad that mom put draino in my soup"", and the like, was just dumb. Had it all been evil intentions, the movie would have been much more effective, in a positive horror movie way. I can't wait 'til the sequel, when they run even shorter on ideas and have ghosts appear saying ""Tell Aunt Edna that the car keys she lost in 1984 are behind the clothes dryer"". The awful ""Grandma visits me and tells me she's proud of you everyday"", was so motivated to mass appeal that I was sick. Always have to have that little irritating ""heart warming"" touch, don't they. Watching disfigured ghosts walk away from the boy after their ""session"" made this movie look more like a bad comedy!

But  this one isn't as compelling and doesn't stand up to intelligent analysis.  Let's say you are a ghost, okay?  Let's say you don't know it.  Do you  think maybe, just maybe, you would notice that nobody else sees you?  There  are ghosts in this movie, and at least one of them doesn't realize that  people don't even see him or her.  Hello?  I have to hand it to Bruce  Willis - he picks good scripts.

1074770,5,630573240X,"I won't comment here about the film itself, since so much of its enjoyment is derived by its ending.  Instead, I think it's instructive to note that the DVD version was released well in advance of the VHS copy.  This is no  accident.  The DVD version gives the film's production crew a chance to  fully explain all the thought they put into making this remarkable work.  There are arguably more extra features on the DVD than on anything  currently released.
To be sure, not all of them are welcome.  It's been  remarked elsewhere, and I fully agree, that the compulsory trailers at the  beginning (out of which you apparently can't escape) are a complete abuse  of the lock-out feature.  It is hoped that this will not become a trend  amongst DVD manufacturers.  Also, I found the storyboard-to-shot  comparison a bit spare.  Only one rather minor scene is  compared.
Everything else about the DVD, by contrast, is a movie buff's  dream.  The film is dissected thoroughly, taking the viewer through an  exploration of how each element contributes to the director's overall  vision.  Everything from color schemes to soundtrack creation is discussed.  Deleted scenes are also given director's commentary, which nascent  filmmaker's will undoubtedly find valuable.  To top it off, there's an  excellent running commentary of the film as well.
In other words, ignore  the VHS version:  this Collector's Edition DVD is definitely what you want  to have in your collection.",960595200,,1469,5.02928870292887

I read the screenplay and, after enjoying it, made it a point  to see the film again. And I'm glad I did; this is a film that should be  seen more than once.
I don't think you can appreciate it, unless you  understand that the movie's slow pace is intentional, and that everything  in the story happens for a reason and builds to something.
This story,  about a terrified young boy who sees ghosts, and gets help from a child  psychologist, works very well. It moves slowly, but that just happens to  bring you into the story.
As melodramatic as it sounds, this movie makes  you appreciate things in your life that you would normally take for  granted: a good family, love, peace, and simple communication.
And that's  all that the movie really comes down to. And it does an amazingly heartfelt  job of emphasizing on these things, and how important they are to  us.

I kept seeing references to a ""Sixth Sense style of plot twist"" in reviews of  other movies so I'm sure I would have enjoyed the ending a lot more if I'd  seen it earlier because after the first scene it's pretty obvious what the  ""twist"" is.  I spent the rest of the movie noticing the technique of the  screenwriter and the director - a little distracting to be sure.
I was  not impressed with this movie - it certainly doesn't deserve a best picture  nom, but Oscar marketing being what it is nowadays - but it does have it's  moments.  My favorite scene is near the end where the kid tells his mom  about the dance (?) recital.  Pretty manipulative, but very effective  thanks to Toni Colette.
The DVD package of extras is excellent.  I rented  the DVD just for the extras and didn't bother watching the movie  again.
Let me ask a question:  when Willis goes to see the kid at his  house, and is sitting in the living room with the mom, doesn't he think  it's strange that she doesn't know that he's even there.

Now the BEST part of the DVD.  It contains deleted scenes with  an extended ending - each with explanations by the director on why they  were deleted. It also contains this Rules and Clues portion that discusses  the rules they followed in making the scenes for consistency and the clues  they placed to slowly reveal the secret of the movie - all with  explanations.  Other DVDs just have written explanation for deleted scenes.  In this DVD, videos of the director, writer, producer, etc. did the  explanations.

Stephen King's 'Langoliers' was the scariest  movie for me for a long time. Watching it alone in a dark room mady you  shake in your boots; or at least until we couldn't see the little critters,  only hear them and feel the time disappearing. After watching this film I  had to admit that this was even scarier than time stoping. You don't  actually see it, the things that should scare you (like Fred Krueger did in  your childhood), you just feel the tension...and see dead people in their  true light for the first time in your life.
Langoliers came when they  were starting the plane and then the magic ended. To me the magic of this  film vanished at an unknown point in the second half of it. I don't know  what was the trigger, but then I realized that it isn't scary anymore. And  even the ending wasn't what it was supposed to be - ""gotcha, you  didn't see it coming, did ya?""
Now I have seen it many times and it  is still there, the trigger. Even when I watch it in broad daylight I have  to chew at my fingers. (After seeing it for the first time I couldn't stop  imagining that my breath steamed and that maybe I was the only person who  saw some of the passersby on the street, creepy.)
Overall: The cast is  great, especially young and very talented Haley Joel Osment. The music is  just the right one for this kinda movie. But the plot has some holes that  my eyes just can't slide over (where was Malcolm during that one year?)

The kid (Haley Joel Osment) is really good; it's so rare to see  child actors who are that convincing. There is a scene in a car near the  end where the kid convinces his Mom that he really does ""see dead  people,"" and it's done so well that it reduced the two grown men  watching the movie to simpering crybabies.

Quite evidently a precocious child when seen interviewed on  Opera and other talk shows, he is a consumate actor and puts his character  across well.  The plot of the film is tightly woven, with the ending so  thoroughly unsuspected and delightful, that I actually went to go through  it again to see if there was any evidence for ""cheating"" or  goofs; there weren't.

The acting is generally pretty good and the photography, while not exactly groundbreaking, is intelligent and nicely  done.  The direction of the actors is pretty impressive, too, and  occasionally even unique.  I can see this director making a really good  film at some point if he pays a bit more attention to his script.  Unfortunately, midway through the movie it's already apparent that the  story just doesn't make any sense.  The ""twist"" ending is fairly  easy to figure out before the end and is both intriguing and then silly  once you think about it.  It certainly doesn't wrap up much of anything in  the movie.  I had quite a few questions at the end --- most of which could  only be answered in ways that would seriously upset the dramatic structure  of the picture.  Bruce Willis is fine --- he basically steps aside to let  the kid do his business.  Toni Colette is excellent as usual --- quite  effective in a relatively underwritten role.  The kid is impressive, but  seems to have picked up a few bad habits early.  He is really ACTING --- he  seems like an adult actor, which is the main reason he impressed so many  viewers.  I'd be curious to see what he can do with a different director.  I only hope he doesn't get ruined by the Hollywood system, because he does  seem to have the potential to become a really great actor.  Quite  sensitive-seeming.  All in all, the movie was pretty entertaining ---  definitely held my interest.  It just didn't make a lot of sense; I'm all  for a bit of ambiguity, but the things that were ambiguous about this movie  seemed to be the result of laziness.  I feel a little bad accusing a  filmmaker of laziness --- perhaps he's just more interested in other  aspects of filmmaking.

Surely Osment deserves accolades for his performance, but it was,  overall, a repetitive, dry film. (Osment, by himself, was the only reason  this got 3 stars as opposed to 2). We clearly get the point by the middle  of the two hours that he sees dead people and something is wrong with him,  but, in a time management move comparative to that of The Cider House  Rules, Osment continues to see dead people for about an hour too long; it  would have made a very nice short picture. But no, no, no! We're going to  have a nice long movie that we can shove enough dead people in to call a  thriller and make thousands of bottoms across America fall asleep while  watching! Not only the fact that it progresses into borderline boredom, but  that I never thought the ending to be that great! Oooh so he was dead the  whole time, what's the point? It's a nice little twist but nothing as good  as how reviewers here have glorified it. It was a moderate film with a  moderate ending. Many characters, as well, with the omission of Willis'  character, develop much throughout the story.

It is when Cole tells his secret, that he  can see dead people that walk around like normal people. I would give this  movie a 4 out of 5 stars.  It was a good movie with a surprising twist  ending.  It is rated PG-13 and I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers  because of the images of the dead people.  It is a good movie for older  viewers. The director of the film was M. Night Shyamalan.  He has directed  the movie Wide Awake, which is a similar film.  Bruce Willis is Malcolm  Crowe in the movie.  He is a child psychologist that was one of the  greatest psychologists in his field.  Cole Sear, or Haley Joel Osment, is  the young child that Malcolm is trying to help.  Malcolm's wife Anna, or  Olivia Williams, also plays an important part in the movie. In the movie  Malcolm wins an award for being one of the best child psysiologists.  Later  at his house, one of the students that he failed to help breaks in and  shoots Malcolm and himself.  The movie goes to the next fall where Malcolm  has found a boy with problems.  Cole can see dead people.  He must help the  boy out because the boy has the same symptoms as the person he failed to  help.  He grows very apart from his wife and they never talk.  This all  leads into a surprise ending.

1075279,5,630573240X,"The first surprise that hit me upon viewing this film was Bruce Willis.  Understand, I'm not one of those who have made a hobby out of belittling the man's career.  On the contrary, I feel the guy has proven he has decent  acting chops, despite his pedigree as an action hero.  Still, when a friend  explained the plot of this movie, and Willis's part in it, my reaction was,  ""Aw, c'mon.""  I just didn't think ol' Bruce could carry off the  part of a sincere, angst-ridden child psychologist.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  His understated, rock-steady performance was surely a cornerstone of the  film's success.
That said, the cocky, sarcastic public persona that Bruce  Willis often puts forth serves to put the viewer on edge a bit: Will we see  a flicker of some ""Die Hard"" mannerism?  That, in itself, makes  the choice of Willis nothing less than brilliant casting, as that slightly  distracting element helps set the viewer up for later surprises.
Some  critics have ridiculed the film for being overly sentimental.  Hm.  I just  didn't get that at all.  If anything, I found the sentimentality a bit  understated, given the story line.
As for Haley Joel Osment, wow, the kid  is so talented it's scary.  I was all the more struck by the intensity of  his portrayal after watching the movie a second time.  A real key to the  movie's success is in how Willis allows Osment to carry the ball throughout  the film, and carry it he does.",958348800,,1437,4.617529880478088

Yes, it does seem unlikely that Bruce Willis would be in this heart warming yet eerie feature whose true  brilliance is the story telling and acting.  Bruce along with his movie  wife Olivia Williams (who shines better in ""Rushmnore"") give  great performances but it is little Haley Joel Osmet that steals the show  as the boy with a gift for seeing things others don't.  He is picked on at  school and even is adoring mother (played by Australian Toni Collette) is  even scared of the dead people her boys sees.  The only one that goes along  with his stories is Bruce, who plays Dr. Crowe.  Together they unravel the  secrets and even become friends.
I don't want to give anything away in  case you haven't seen it. I'll just say that the story and the acting will  shock you in its high quality.  This is an excellent picture.  As I said  walking out of the theater, ""I will never rag on Bruce Willis  again!""  Of course, I didn't see his latest movie, so that helps.

1075399,5,630573240X,"It must be difficult to cast films where the central character is a young child, particularly when the role is so emotionally demanding. In the case of The Sixth Sense, Avy Kaufman either got very lucky or made an inspired  choice by casting Haley Joel Osment. He plays Cole Sear and owns the screen  for the large majority of the show.

Cole is tormented but it isn't  until about half way through the film that we find out it is because he can  see the dead. And to an eight-year-old, being visited by disturbed, maimed  and angry spirits is horrifying. It's made all the worse because he has no  one he can turn to for support. He is the only one who can see ghosts and  his behavior has made him a freak in the eyes of his classmates and  teacher.

The film starts with a frightening glimpse of what Cole  may become. Renowned child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe has a grim reunion  with a former patient. An unstable child of yesteryear, Vincent Gray, has  grown into a fractured and psychotic adult who wants nothing more than to  remind Malcolm of his failure, before killing himself. The reminder takes  the form of a bullet in his doctor's stomach.

We catch up with the  good doctor, played superbly by Bruce Willis, about a year later. (This  role is not unlike that Willis had in The Color of Night, although in this  case his character is a gentler soul.) Malcolm is reviewing his case notes  on young Cole, prior to their introduction. We learn that Cole's profile is  identical to Vincent's, Malcolm's patient from years earlier. The big clue  for the audience is that Vincent and Cole both have a small spot of blond  hair within their otherwise dark locks.

The film builds slowly,  which is not to imply that it is dull. In fact a better description would  be ""mesmerizing"". We are forced to care for  young Cole as a  clearer picture is painted of his day to day existence. No night is safe  for him, no place is free of fear and no one understands his torment. In a  desperate bid for sanctuary he turns to the church and the questionable  protection of religious symbols, which he shamelessly steals, building a  chapel in his bedroom.

His local church is where Cole and Malcolm  first meet, after a strange solo dash down the street. And so begins the  careful building of a relationship, a friendship, and eventually a  salvation for both of them. For Cole is not the only one with problems. Dr  Crowe is also a changed man. The dramatic shooting and suicide of his  patient has shaken Malcolm's faith. He is no longer a satisfied purveyor of  mental balms but a frightened, uncertain victim. His wife Anna, seems  unable or unwilling to deal with the situation; and what had been a close  and loving relationship is now teetering on the brink of collapse.

It is not long before we realize that Malcolm is Cole's only hope for  sanity and conversely, Cole may be Malcolm's last chance for redemption.  With a foundation like that, I was looking forward to the meat of the  story. Cole does eventually come to trust in Malcolm but we already know  that trust is not a cure in itself. Vincent was a potent lesson of this. So  when Cole reveals his secret, it is simply a gauntlet thrown down to  Malcolm. Cole claims to be able to see the dead. A classic case of  schizophrenic delusions but unusual in one so young.

Up to this  point in the film we have seen nothing of a supernatural nature, only the  sad effects that Cole exhibits. And so Malcolm's diagnosis is  understandable. Once the secret is out however, our viewpoint is released  and we are able to see as Cole does. His world is populated by terrifying  beings that seem ignorant of their own maimed appearance and, in Cole's  words, only see what they choose to see and have no understanding of their  own death. His midnight callers create some of the scariest cinema I've  seen in years. Not because of cutting edge special effects but because we  share Cole's helplessness in the face of his ""gift"". Even his  homemade church offers no protection and he is driven past despair.

I can't go any further into the story without running the risk of  spoiling the final plot twist. Instead, I will simply beg you to see this  gripping, intelligent and deeply emotional movie. Let's put some more money  in the pockets of director M. Night Shyamalan in the hopes that he will  continue to make movies of this caliber.",958003200,,4402,4.547314578005115

This is  a terrific picture that kept me thinking about it for days after I saw it.  The film stars an under-rated Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist who works with  traumatized young children. After having a traumatizing episode himself,  Willis attempts to right his own life by helping an unreachable young boy  named Cole, who is played by Oscar nominee Haley Joel Osment. However, Cole  is not your average troubled child. Cole, we quickly find out, sees and  talks to dead people. Fortunately, Willis is not your average psychiatrist,  either.
There is a lot I would like to say about this movie, but little  more I can mention without spoiling it. I can tell you this film is not  particularly graphic or bloody, and my violence-averse wife enjoyed the  film. But it can be fairly frightening, especially for younger viewers. The  movie is more than your average thriller, and will keep you guessing.

The Sixth Sense is  the incredible film that properly portrayed the overlapped realms of LIFE  and DEATH through the eyes of a sorrowful, depressed child Cole Sear and  his therapy session under care by an award-winning child psychologist  Malcolm Crowe who was once shot by his FAILED case. The film also cleverly  includes the sub-plots of ethical issues as well as poignant, misting-up  scenes like the car accident-related scenes where Cole reveals his mother'  s childhood secrets to her.
Where death drives the plot, love somehow  finds a way for apart lovers as well as bridges life and death to discover  hidden truth-in-itself, and the world beyond our clear scientific  explanation exists, The Sixth Sense is certainly the BEST THRILLER / HORROR  of 1999.

Everyone talks about how  they loved the plot twist, and they are good, but what I loved the most is  that the story is taken seriously.  It is not often that a serious ghost  story is brought to the screen.  More often than not we have to put up with  the silly teen slasher movies that are not really scary at all.  I would  rank this film right up there with The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and  Jacob's Ladder.  Even when I was younger I never understood why hollywood  did not make serious scary movies.  It is almost as if movie makers do not  believe in the supernatural themselves.

If you're looking for good, emotional drama about human feelings  and what makes - at least some - humans tick, you will enjoy this  movie.
The characters aren't always likeable, but they're always  believable.  What gore there is (and there is some - this is *not* a movie  for children) makes sense in context and has a strong impact.  This young  boy is scared and the film allows you to understand and sympathize with his  fear without trying to draw you into it.
There is even room for romance  in this movie.  Romance on the level of long-standing, deep emotional  connections.  It is, in fact, a strong sub-theme in the life of the  doctor.
Sometimes events in the movie are predictable, but even there  it's only because they are only logical.  It's the only way it could  happen.  And these are more than made up for by the twists and turns that  do occur.
If you are a person who thrives on happy endings, you may find  this movie hard to take.

1075483,5,630573240X,"This film is the closest thing to an Exorcist for the 90's. There have been thousands of gory films over the years, but this is different. This is creepy. And well written.
Haley is incredible as the horrified little boy  who can't look over his shoulder without seeing something terrifying. Bruce  is just fine as the psychologist who wants to make up for a big mistake  with an old patient he couldn't help (however he does do that manly surly  puckered cheek look he's infamous for. Otherwise he was okay).
He  pursues Cole for redemption from his past. Little does he know that Cole  will help him more than he can help Cole.
Toni Collette is great as  Cole's mom, a harried single woman holding two jobs and trying to reach the  distant boy. My only problem with her acting is slight; she does that  laughing-crying thing that looks awful. You know, the boo hoo hoo with the  smile. Other than that, she's incredibly real.
When I mention the creep  factor, I'm reminded of the scene in The Shining with the dead twin girls  in the elevator. I can still visualize that scene in my head. This is a  film full of that kind of yikes factor.
As for the girl who vomits (I  won't say anything more), that scenario is taken directly from Hitchcock's  incredible Notorious, but put to good use.
There is one other scene that  sticks with me because I laughed and didn't know if it was supposed to be  funny. It was certainly macabre. It involves the boy who says, ""Let's  go check out my dad's gun collection.""
As for the ending, here it  is. Bruce Willis is actually a man. Wait, no. That's The Crying Game.

It takes the skills of a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) to help  the boy face his fear and move on with his life. Bruce Willis is wonderful  in this film.

From there, things get really ugly when they find one of his patients  inside their bathroom.  Then the story jumps forward a year.

Willis becomes consumed by the case at  the expense of his marriage, or so it seems until the very end.

1075611,5,630573240X,"Let's get one thing straight; this is NOT a horror film (chic's or otherwise) as some reviewers have characterized it.

In the end, when you cook this one long enough, what is left in the bottom of the pan is the struggle of one little boy (played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment) to somehow come to grips with an ability (more a curse than a gift, or power) that is all too frightening, not only in it's  shock value, but also in it's shear pervasiveness. The threat isn't that he  sees ghosts, or even that they mean him any actual harm (thus removing it  entirely from the contemporary horror film genre in which an ever increasing body count typically leads us to a sad and predictable (anti) climax; leaving only the  protagonist standing and able to dispatch the villain, who invariably returns in the sequel). No the threat here to young Cole is that the ever  increasing throngs of uneasy spirits will completely obliterate his rather  tenuous connection to this realm of existence, and they will leave him  utterly lost, and unable to see (or hear) anything OTHER than dead people.  They don't want his blood, they want his attention. Look past their anger  and grotesque appearance and you see sad, pathetic, needful things. Wanting  nothing so much as an explanation for their current condition, and perhaps  some justice as well.

Poor Cole; he just wants to be like the other kids. He just wants a friend. Someone that he can talk to. He just wants to be able to go to the bathroom in peace... It is his isolation, even from  his confused, and worried mother (wonderfully played by Toni Colette), that is taking the biggest toll, and is the heaviest load, on his narrow  shoulders.

In the end we come to understand that the doctor (portrayed with an uncommon and perfectly understated sensitivity by Bruce Willis) who is so  intent on helping Cole (and redeeming himself in the process) is truly the  only one with the unique qualifications necessary to rescue him. When the  twist comes at the end we don't see it coming, not because we are looking  in the wrong place, but rather because we are not looking for it at all. It  is the loss of love that we are mourning. And in the end Love is the  redemption that we are hoping for...

If you are waiting for chainsaws, or hockey masks you are looking in the wrong place. But if you are looking  for a superbly acted, and directed psychological thriller that will keep you up at night, and thinking about it for days after you've seen it, then you have  definitely come to the right place...

Hitchcock is somewhere smiling happily.  He would have gotten a kick out of this one...",957225600,,2645,4.584221748400853
1075612,4,630573240X,"When a child psychologist (Willis) is shot by a former patient he begins to reconsider his treatment ideals. The redemption for his failure he seeks in his newest patient (Osment) who displays emotions and fears far to familiar to the former failure.
  M. Night Shyamalan may not have had any  truly notable films before this endeavor, but with ""The Sixth  Sense"" he establishes a strong foothold in the Hollywood circle. His  clever and absorbing storyline stands as only a small piece of this  elaborate puzzle. The true force driving the film is its focus on  character.
  Instead of following the traditional paths of the  supernatural, or wandering off into more obscure areas, the movie remains  simple and focused, always studying the characters and their reactions to  the situations. It never goes out of its way to thrill the viewer, all of  the thrills come from the terrified, charming face of Osment.
  Who could  have figured a child would outshine a major Hollywood name, perhaps only  Shyamalan did. Haley Joel Osment steps on the stage shortly into the film  and immediately fills the surreal atmosphere of the past with a vigorously  subtle mysteriousness. Claiming to see ""dead people"", Osment is  wrought with woe and fears, but the caring child is hardly concerned with  himself. In fact his greatest fear is for his mother how his unusually  cruel situation is slowly driving her toward madness.
  While Willis  strolls through the movie with a believable and serene atmosphere (until  the end's final twist, which is questionable when considering some of the  previous sequences), he is always several steps behind Osment's truly  formidable presence.
  Never does the pace excell, nor does it let up.  Slowly and carefully it spins the story that intertwines these somewhat  ""lost"" souls and the unique ending situation that binds the duo.  Certain scenes provide gasp-worthy reactions at just the right time to  prevent the movie from slacking, but never does it let these scenes drag  into a horror oriented atmosphere.
  A clever use of colors (examined on  the DVD's extras, which are quite nice and provide a decent length of bonus  material), some tender and affectionate dialogue, and deeply realistic  characters keep what could have been just a ""decent"" movie at the  ""terrific"" level. Rather, Osment should be mostly credited with  the true praise, his performance simply swept the screen.",957225600,,2423,5.092071611253197

1075614,5,630573240X,"I was a little sceptical at first about watching a movie that deals mainly with themes that involve issues like life after death, ghosts and the supernatural. Unlike it's predesessors 'The Exorcist' and 'Omen'(which also featured a boy), ""The sixth sense"" is a much  more intense and  powerful movie, both emotionally and psychologically.
The affliction and  pain that Osment brings to the screen is so overwhelming and powerful, it's  scary to  think where all that talent comes from, more so than all the  creepy scenes in the movie put together.
 While the few sentimental  scenes between Cole(Osment) and his mother(Toni Collette) are simply  priceless, the show stopper is definately the 'knock your socks off' ending  to the movie. The punch the final scene delivers will simply blow you away  and  leave you with an emotional and psychological baggage for days after  watching the movie. I saw the movie when it was originally released in the  cinemas and as I drove home late that night , I could swear I heard a knock  on my rear windscreen. My heart  literally stopped as I slammed down on the  brakes. That's how much the movie affected me.
I can't begin to imagine  how talented Osment is and what a star he will become. His screen presence  and emotions eminates from his acting to the audience, even moving some to  tears. As for director M. Night shyamalan, I can't say enough about his  great directing and screenplay. His craftsmanship and meticulous attention  to subtleties will amaze even the harshest critics.
And the best thing  about the movie? The fact that you can go back after watching it the first  time, and see all the events and moments in the movie that have enabled the  greatest audience deception in movie-making history!

Sure there are alot of cheap  shots to make you jump, and I'll admit that some of them actually worked  (when will I ever learn!), but I liked just being able to settle into the  creepy mood of the movie.  The music fits the movie very well and does  wonders to create the atmosphere.  Bruce Willis is very toned down in this  movie, but still does a very good job.

The most frustrating part of watching this movie is to resist the temptation of sharing the ending with  my friends & family members.  The setting of ""The 6th Sense""  is spot-on, haunting & chilling throughout.  Just like a good book, the  story gradually flows through rather than hitting the viewers in the face  such as movies like ""The Haunting"", ""The House on the  Haunted Hill"".  I strongly believe that to make a horror movie works,  it should let the story does the talking, conjuring fear in the viewers of  things they don't & can't see.  Isn't it true that imagination is our  own worst enemy?  Well, ""Stir of Echoes"" starred Kevin Bacon  shares the same trait as ""The 6th Sense"" but we shouldn't forget  that ""The 6th Sense"" is the movie that started it all.

I watched this movie all the way through, saw the interviews at the end of the movie and then rewound the movie and watched it AGAIN.
I don't think I've ever done that before in my life.
To call  this a horror flick is *wrong*. It is intelligent, well acted, articulate,  thought provoking and immensely intriguing. The only gross scenes are the  dead people who ""hang around"" the school and other places.
The  ending caught me completely off guard. What a way to end a flick.
Is it  possible that someone (like a child or an older person with a child-like  thought) could see dead people?
In the many books I've read about life  after death, folks who've passed and been revived frequently make comments  that [while they were 'dead'] ""the dog kept running around me and  barking but no one else in the room even knew I was there.""
Dogs  (and children?) have that simple pure thought that sees through the veil.
The moment this movie comes down in price, I'm snagging a copy for my  very own. This one is a keeper. I'd count it among my top ten favorite  movies of all time.

Folks, if you enjoy psychological thrillers and suspense films, this one will blow you  away! Not only does it have a great cast and plot, but the emotional impact  it leaves is quite impressing. Bruce Willis is a child psychiatrist trying  to help a  kid named Cole who has a deep secret he hasn't shared with  anyone yet-a secret he feels no one will understand. This secret is that he  sees dead people, walking amongst himself, not knowing they are dead. As  the truth behind his beliefs is pending, Malcolm (Bruce Willis) must try  trust Cole and make his nightmares go away. This film will leave you on the  edge of your seat from the odd beginning to the shocking conclusion, which  makes ""The Sixth Sense"" a must-see.

The acting is superb throughout and the  production is excellent.
So why only one star, well, I couldn't give it  zero... the idiots that made the DVD seemed to think that every time you  use the disc, you want to watch 4 other movie trailers. Using the features  of DVD they have disabled all the buttons until you have watched the  trailers - this is possibly the most irritating thing they could have done.  I can accept that the FBI warning message is unskippable, but the trailers  too! come on guys!

This is a movie I will remember, watch again, and show to  friends.  Knowing in advance that there was a ""surprise"" ending,  I suspected that it wouldn't be much of a surprise.  As the director had  planned, I picked up all the wrong foreshadowing and none of the actual  clues that were clear in retrospect.
The acting by Haley Joel Osment was  extrordinary.  He managed to make a difficult premise believable by showing  you the fear in his belief.  Regardless of whether he turns out in the end  to be psychotic or gifted you empathize with his fear even though the movie  will not have most people shaking with fear themselves.  Bruce Willis turns  in a respectable and believable performance and plays to the child  well.
Unfortunately, I must agree with other reviewers who commented that  the ""mandatory previews"" were extremely unpleasant.  I am  revolted by the arrogant and insulting attitude that paying customers are  nothing more than revenue sources to be harvested by marketing.  Given my  low expectations when I bought the DVD, if I had realized it came with  mandatory previews I would not have purchased it.

If you saw this movie once, I am pretty  sure that you will not like this movie as much as you did in the theater.  The movie is very slow, especially for the first 30 minutes.

For those whoe want to buy this movie, rent  the movie first and see it.  If you still like it, then get it.  If I were  you, I will wait until the price drops a little more.
There is no  question about the acting, though.  A little kid in the movie was pretty  good (deserved to be nominated).  Yet, I cannot possibly understand that  this movie made +$300 million dollars at the box office.  Overrated!",956102400,,1027,4.28421052631579

1076102,4,630573240X,"It seems most people fall into one of two camps on this film. They either love it or hate it (it would seem that more love it). My sentiments lie with neither camp. This is a fascinating and clever story that is well  filmed but poorly crafted. Plot holes abound and Director/Writer M. Night  Shyamalan has to fudge all over the place to keep the surprise ending a  surprise. In my comments here, I have commented many times on the dangers  of writers directing their own work. In almost every case, the director  lacks the necessary objectivity to identify and excise plot flaws. In this  case they were glaring.
So, I have a fundamental problem calling this a  great motion picture. However, it was very well filmed from a technical  standpoint and produced some excellent suspense throughout that kept the  viewer engaged.
The acting was fair to excellent. Toni Collette was  mediocre at best as Cole's mother. She overacted in almost every scene and  her chemistry wasn't very good with the boy until the last scene when he  told her what her mother said. Likewise, Olivia Williams didn't bowl me  over as Malcolm's wife.
Bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is  out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type. He always  comes across as a bit whiny when he tries to play nice guy parts. His forte  is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his  career by staying with those types of parts.
Finally, there is young  Haley Joel Osment as Cole. He gave an excellent performance and was the  linchpin that held the whole film together. He was very versatile in his  portrayal of various emotions. He handled fear, playfulness, affection and  anger with equal aplomb. His physiognomy was right for the part as well, as  he looked very nerdy and self conscious, exactly what was needed for the  part.
I rated this film a 7/10. It was entertaining and it had real  potential, but it was forced to be overly contrived and had too many flaws.",956102400,,1990,4.652298850574713

Haley Joel Osment brings such an intense power to the role of  Cole that you believe every word he says, and feel his torment down to your  toes.  Toni Collette embodies her role, a working-class mother, with  empathy and truth.  And Bruce Willis defies his action hero image in a role  that literally aches with pain.

In the '90s we've been constantly bored with horror movies: the Scream trilogy, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and so on and so on. Finally a horror film that  gives depth to it's characters! This is just a great old-fashioned ghost  story. What better place to set a ghost story than in Philadelphia? Every  building has a history behind it (including young Cole's school). Any film  that drops clues (the color red) and demands repeated viewings is worth  buying. Haley Joel Osment (Cole), who may have the most lines in the movie,  truley gives the year's best supporting performance (sorry Michael Caine).  The movie grabs you immediately in the first five minutes and gives one of  the best endings in recent memory. This is the role Bruce Willis will be  best remembered.
Also impressive is Toni Collete as Lynn Sear, the  mother of Cole who feels so hopeless in helping her obviously torchured  son. She makes triangle pancakes for him, takes him for a joy ride in a  supermarket parking lot, and arranges get-togethers with the other kids,  but she can't help him. Only Malcom Crowe can (Willis).

It is not afraid to make us think, and is one of the few movies  that makes a second viewing a near necessity.  The acting is  spectacular...from little Hayley to Bruce Willis, to Donnie Wahlberg (who  is hardly recognizable), and to the female roles...all wonderful  performances.

I want anyone who doesn't have the DVD to know once you insert the disk it  plays the standard Studio/FBI intro as usual, which you can't push the  ""menu"" button for, and goes straight into a LONG session of  previews for other movies, which you also can't press the Menu button  on.
I'm all for having previews on disks (and in fact I am frequently  disappointed when the menu shows single slide ads for other movies but no  actual preview), and would encourage all studios to add them where there is  space on the disk.
HOWEVER... I think we need to make a stand and make  sure the studios don't do this again, not this studio, not other studios.  Do not put the previews at the front without a menu option! Do not, do not,  do not!
Yes, please use the empty space on the disk to ad previews, but  give us as people who BUY the movie the choice to choose them from the  menu, don't shove them down our throats! If you want to do a different  build for the rental releases thats fine, but as someone who purchased this  movie outright, I object to being forced to sit through the previews.
The  movie is a 5 star movie for sure, this DVD package with the damnable ads  should be avoided at all costs.

Ironically, The Sixth Sense manages to turn this  identification effect into a liability.  106 minutes of this soporific  snack and I felt myself among its ambulant spirits, mortally wounded and  too bored to die.  I'm not sure if any ""suprise"" ending could  have resurrected such a corpse, especially not one that is all but dictated  to the viewer in the first five minutes.  This twist is so predictable that  the movie defaults on its already meager build.  In trying to create a  mellifluous thriller, Shyamalan has instead concocted a metaphysics of  melodrama where the stiffs embody the movie's false and tawdry animism.  But at least the actors are easy to make fun of.  Bruce Willis portrays his  character like a doped-out android, and Osment, in trying to prove his  character is not a freak, delivers his lines with the cadences of a nubile  chimpanzee.  All the ink spilled and all the hype spouted over this film  bespeaks the paltry condition of American sensibilities.

I thought it moved ahead at a perfect pace.  Osment showed that he  is a young actor who will probably succeed as an adult actor as well.  Bruce Willis continues to impress me as an actor of depth and breadth.  There were a couple moments that actually scared/startled me into a vocal  response in the theater.

Haley Joel Osment is awesome; i hope he continues to find scripts that  are a challenge for him. there are a lot of really neat camera angles and  such that you wouldn'y normally think about using.  if you are looking for  a blood and guts horror movie, don't see this, because that's not what it  is.  rather, it deals more with psychological issues and pulls in your  emotions, rather than your fear.  i too am somwhat annoyed that the DVD  makes you watch the previews, but i think i can deal with it.  it certainly  isn't going to stop me from watching it again.  like Thomas Crown Affair,  the ending does surpirse you, and is a big part of the movie's appeal, but  t shouldn't keep you from multiple viewings.  overall, i think this is a  great movie, and it has been added to my family's list of favorites.",955324800,,1339,4.281124497991968

A. some people like trailers so for some it's an welcome bonus
B. DVD remotes come with a  fast forward and some (mine  does) a super fast forward.  Hit this button  and you're past this material in less time than an average TV commercial.  So no one is ""forcing"" you to watch this stuff.  Me I never even  saw them because I just fast forwarded and assumed everyone else in world  would do the same  thing instead of  whining about it.
Oh yes, this movie  is the  opposite of many movies you buy. Ever buy a movie because  you  absoloutely loved it loved it and played it over and over again for several  days/weeks and eventually got bored  with it? The Sixth Sense is just the  opposite.  The first time you watch it you think man that was okay/better  than I expected. You watch it again knowing the ending and say wow that was  really cool how that was set up.  You watch it again and say wow that scene  really fits, You watch it again and say wow here's a ""hidden  message"".

BUT, the video on  the other hand, is not worth buying, in my opinion.  Once you know the  secret ending, the movie becomes boring and tiring.

The first half hour is incredibly slow, and the  special effects were anything but, looking more like a sophomore production  of Sleepy Hollow than a huge budgeted Hollywood effort. I realize that they  were trying for subtlety instead of blood, but they seemed to convey more  apathy than actual sublime proficiency. The ending was surprising, but  after watching it twice I found far too many inconsistencies to make it  plausible (unless you buy the child's excuse that people only see what they  want to.)
The acting was very strong, though, and together with the  superb cinematography (Philadelphia never looked better) they are perhaps  the only two reasons to watch.

First of all I notice many of the reviewers of the DVD version had complaints about the previews at the begining of the disc.  I was able to just skip right by them and start the movie in a matter of a  few seconds, so I don't understand all the gripes about that.  I thought  the movie itself was very good, if not quite up to the hype, but then how  often does a movie live up to the hype?  I didn't really consider it a  ""thriller"" in the classsic sense, but that didn't detract from my  enjoyment either.  It was very well acted by the main stars, especially  young Haley.  His performance was certainly worthy of the nomination and  probaly the Oscar as well, although I haven't seen ""Cider House""  to judge Micheal Caine's performance.  Bruce Willis did a fine job too,  quite a change from the well-worn John McClane role.  As for the  unforeseen twist ending, well, I guessed it only a few minutes into the  film and was able to confirm it by the clues provided throughout(they're  there, you just have to know what to notice).

For a start you get loads of extras, including a bit of Shyamalan's first movie and deleted scenes with  Shyamalan's explanations.
This is a very simple but very powerful story  creating tension without the need for special effects. Its believability is  down to the fanstastic acting of all players, especially Haley Joel Osment  and Shyamalan's delicate touch. These, together with a great score has to  make it one of the most atmospheric movies you are likely to see. Casting  Willis as a child psychologist must have had some risks but he pulls it off  so well.
The whole pretext of this movie is in the question who is  helping whom? Is Malcom helping Cole come to terms with his psychological  affliction? Is Cole helping Malcom improve his relationship with his wife?  Is Cole helping his mother come to terms with her feelings for her  mother?
It is not often you get a movie with this kind of impact, but in  the same way that Cole's ghosts walk with him, this film will stay with you  for a long time.

The ending ruins the mystery. Without the  revelations at the end the movie would have more staying power. Those who  have seen it will know what i mean.
From an entertainment perspective the movie is great. The acting is good not great and the  directing is superb. The scenes and camera angles really enhance the tone.  There are some cheap attempts to startle you and keep you on the edge but  they don't over do it. The cole character is totally unrealistic. This is a  little 9 year old boy who sees dead people! Most of these dead people bear  the injuries of their demise. One visitor is a boy with half the back of  his head blown off who asks cole if he wants to play with a gun. Despite  this cole is no complete basket case. Rather he is courageous and almost  serene at times, even when he is telling the willis character that these  visions may have the intent of doing him harm. At times this nine year old  who sees dead people talks like a psychologist trying to analyze himself.
Never the less this is a fine movie with thrills and mystery. In the end  cole achieves some healing with his mother as he reveals his secret.  Finally his visions seem to have served a good purpose. You must rent this  movie. A solid 4 stars.

1076832,5,630573240X,"First of all, beware, there may be spoilers in theis text. I just want to  point out a few things that may inspire people who were totally surprised  in the end (I wasn't) to see the film again.
If you are yet too see the  movie you probably know some big development will be revealed in the last  minute and if you can find clues and have a good guess by the end you will  be more satisfied. Otherwise you may feel as if they just threw something  on at the end (Which is not at all true - there are so many clues, long  before the end I thought the twist was obvious) Just don't let yourself be  fooled.
Here's where some of you should leave.
I cannot believe how  many people were fooled by this movie, were told they were fooled and still  don't know it. Does anyone else realize the signifigance of the penny trick  Malcolm shows the boy. It might have been unintentional but I think it's  symbolic of how the jump between scene one and two is supposed to trick  you. First Malcolm is shot in the chest (heart area) and possibly before  you can think how he could survive the wound you see him walking around  again. The eye is quicker than the mind (or is it the other way around).  But in the film, the penny trick never works and possibly the filmmakers  didn't intend this trick to work either. (For me, the drick didn't work,  just like the penny trick, and I ended up loving the movie, every second  was good as it happened was thrilling and I could think and find clues as I  was watching) Maybe the movie would have been better if those two scenes (1  and 2) had not tricked as many people as they did.
The film is also great  because of the nightmarish quality the film takes. The settings were pretty  drab (opulent possibly) The set is nothing memorable or nothing that  outshines the two characters, which adds to the nightmare. How many people  find signifigant the details of the location of their dreams/nightmares.
This is really a well written, almost flawless, wholly entertaining,  creepy, almost completely horrifying and not too long movie. Anyone not at  all scared obviously would have no problem with unfamiliar bodies wandering  their house.",954806400,,2171,4.455470737913486

Not a bad movie per se, but the way it was hyped I expected much more. The acting, however, is  superb. As the plot unfolds, the movie swaps genres, getting from horror to  thriller to social drama to tear-jerker, making it sometimes confusing and  difficult to understand where the director is trying to take you. The  ending, whether or not it comes as a surprise, is rather disappointing. All  in all, it made me think of some remake of 'Always', 'Ghost' or 'City of  Angels', all based on the theme of the dead trying to communicate with the  living. 'Stir of Echoes' with Kevin Bacon, based on a similar theme, is  less ambitious but, in my opinion, more efficient.

1076894,5,630573240X,"The Sixth Sense starts off with a very dreary, almost purely expository scene that screams out to the audience who the main character is, what's his situation, and what his relationship to his wife is.  When I saw that  scene, I started preparing myself for a movie lacking in slyness, subtlety,  and pacing.
I'm glad to say my initial perception was wrong.  Once Haley  Joel Osment enters the picture; once Bruce Willis' character starts on his  course; once the tension sets in, The Sixth Sense begins to pack a wallop.  The gold-standard performances from the three top-billed actors Willis,  Osment and Toni Collette are already enough to make the film dramatically  involving, all three holding back on overemoting and opting for strength  and nuance.  The script is hypnotic, the camerawork carefully considered,  and the final suckerpunch one of the best in cinematic history.  Once you  see it, you can think back and realize how difficult it must've been to set  it up, how many restrictions that placed on scenes involving the  protagonist, and how well it worked.
Finally, the greatest triumph of The  Sixth Sense is to bring the supernatural horrors so close to home that they  become normalized.  Osment's reactions to his visions are so real that even  though the film draws from the well of the supernatural thriller, a genre  that's becoming increasingly dated, none of the impact is lost.
Another  lesson to the new horror filmmakers who use Scream and Urban Legend as  standards for horror:  It's never ""who"" did what that terrifies,  but ""how""; it's not gore, torture, loud music, car crashes and  weird-shaped weapons, but atmosphere and character identification.",954806400,,1683,5.0510948905109485

Haley Joel Osment was a wonderful actor and  delivered a convincing role as a confused, isolated 9 year old.  Toni  Collete was great in her role as the protective mother.  The scene in which  the boy reveals to his mother that his deceased grandmother visits him is  especially beautiful and wonderfully acted.

This is nothing short of an abuse of the DVD format!

I also agree with those that complain about the forced  previews at the beginning of the DVD.  This is not a very good DVD  production in terms of add-on material. Anyone who loves the film (and I  can understand how they might)probably won't care about the forced  previews, or the fact that there is no simultaneous director's commentary,  and will probably buy the DVD anyway.

The  ability to directly access the Movie is one of the primary reasons I prefer  DVD to VHS.  I paid my money for the DVD, so I should be able to decide if  I want to watch the previews each time I watch the movie.  The fact that  the DVD manufacturer purposely rigged this DVD to prevent escape from the  previews makes it even more of an insult.  If this type of thing becomes  the norm for DVDs, I think it will kill the format.  If Sixth Sense weren't  so good, I'd return it because of the previews.

As for the packaging of the DVD version, it has all the standard extras  like cast interviews/bios, deleted scenes, etc.  That's always nice and we  come to expect that.  But what knocks off that 5th star for me is the fact  that YOU HAVE TO WATCH MANDATORY PREVIEWS WHEN YOU INITIALLY PLAY THE DISC!

It won't let you push the  ""Menu"" button or even stop the playback while these previews are  going!  If you have a nicer player, you may be able to ""Chapter  Skip"" over them, but the point is:  you shouldn't have to skip over  the previews and if I have to fast forward over them, I might as well be  watching the movie on my VCR!

Imagine then my profound sense of  disappointment when I saw the first preview come on.  Instantly, I reached  for the DVD remote and pressed the Menu button only to find it had been  disabled.
When the second preview followed and still the Menu button  was dead, I started to feel annoyed.  By the time the fourth one began, I  was thoroughly and completely angry and pledged never to watch any of the  four movies that had been forced on me.
Yes, I will admit that once The  Sixth Sense began, the experience was every bit as satisfying as I had  hoped.  And the extra features are a very nice bonus.  I don't doubt that  this disc will be played many many times before I tire of it.
However, in  the end, the forced previews ruin this disc.  I would have been happy to  watch any previews the disc producers wanted me to watch ... so long as  they gave me the freedom to choose when to watch them.
A fatal mistake.  Simply brutal.  This disc should be recalled and replaced with one that  does not force the experience.  At this point, this studio is in my  doghouse.  If they pull this stunt again, I will never buy another disc  from them.

I agree with the other viewers who are disgusted with the DVD version containing (what is considered to be VHS material)soon to be outdated movie pre-views . What  was the studio or distributor and marketing execs thinking by featuring  Mission to Mars and other previews on a Collector's Edition DVD; Obviously  they weren't. Imagine seeing your DVD copy of The Sixth Sense 5-10 years  from now and thinking how nostalgic and dated it will look and feel seeing  that blasphemous Mission to Mars preview with its theatrical date release  glaring at you !
As for The Sixth Sense, without a shadow of a doubt, it  definitely deserves to be placed high on a mantle or pedestal next to  1999's Academy favorite and winner American Beauty !
I also would've  enjoyed seeing Haley Joel Osment win for Best Supporting Actor. So what if  the kid is only a kid. Many film critics were astonished by his performance  yet said that for a child to receive the Oscar at that age would be too  soon for his career ! Hogwash. In this day and age nothing is ""too  soon"" for anybody's career--especially an award for a child of this  acting caliber. He acts with more genuine feeling and emotion than most  so-called professional adult actors out there in today's film industry (  shocking that some of these actors are still in the business despite their  lack of acting skills).
Bruce Willis gave one of his more finer  performances in quite awhile. I can see why he was chosen to play Malcolm.  They say those with a comedic or witty and sarcastic exterior are the ones  who are more apt to show greater and deeper emotions of a serious sensitive  nature. Bruce showed that there ain't nothing wrong with a man showing his  more tender and emotional side without having to make a wisecrack to cover  up for some sort of insecurity complex! You go Bruce...
As for the  performances by Wahlberg and Collette, simply OUTSTANDING ! Could not  believe that Wahlberg lost about 40 lbs. for the role; talk about an actor  literally throwing himself into the role (method actor ?).  As for Toni  Collette, I did not know she is originally from Australia and was in  Muriel's Wedding. She was able to swap her Aussie accent for a New Jersey  one; fascinating !
The story, plot, effects, were equally mesmerizing.  This is one dvd to be purchased and not just rented ( as also mentioned by  another previous reviewer)...",954460800,,2441,4.630841121495327

Forget about it--you'll be disappointed.  What they consider the ""ending,"" which was what is extended, is  already too long. The deleted scenes add little if anything to the movie.  What struck me about these scenes is that, had they been included in the  film, they might have ruined the you-know-what.  Had these scenes been  included, I have a feeling that this movie would have come and gone without  anyone noticing. The director's commentary is nothing more than a few  comments about various aspects of the story, and what it took to pull them  off on film.  A movie-length commentary would have been interesting, though  not terribly so. If you haven't seen this movie, get it on DVD.  DVD is the  perfect medium; it would have been just as good a DVD if it contained  nothing more than the film.

It says right on the front cover that it is a ""collector's edition"" DVD -- however, when playing the DVD the first thing one sees is a preview for Mission to Mars, followed  by previews for 4 other movies. A film this good should not be tainted by  movie previews. Those belong in the VHS version.
However, I must still  give 5 stars to the movie because of the interesting extras on the DVD. The  deleted scenes are great, and the director says a few words about each  extra feature on the DVD (including the deleted scenes) which is a nice  feature.
No director's commentary, which I thought would have been a nice  extra, but he talks about a lot of the interesting aspects of the film in  the other extras (ie, the use of the color red).
Still a good buy, but  very sad that the producers of the DVD decided to put those previews in.  They ruin what could have been the best movie in my collection.",954374400,,944,4.2824858757062145

Even worse, some genius thought it would be a  good idea to disable the stop, pause, and menu buttons. This means that you  can't jump straight to the menu -- you have to keep hitting fast forward  until all the previews are done. I hate this; I'd really rather not have to  see a ""Mission To Mars"" preview every single time I put in my  ""Sixth Sense"" disc. I could sort of understand this if it was a  rental edition, but it's not. I really have no idea why anyone thought that  doing this was a good idea.
It's a shame, because the disc is otherwise  pretty nice. There are a bunch of extra features -- trailers, deleted  scenes, an extended ending, a little documentary, and so forth.

1077313,5,630573240X,"Having just finished watching the movie I feel compelled to write this review, a meagre attempt to give something back to the makers of the movie. This is one of the hardest reviews i've ever tried to write, words do not  seem capable of conveying the ingenuity and gorgeousness of the Sixth  Sense.  I'm not going to talk about the plot, to analyse it would give away  too much, so this leaves only my feelings about the fim to convince  you.
I still feel somewhat astounded by its intelligence and mesmerised  by its beauty. I know such descriptive words are not those which one would  normally associate with a film of its kind but that's what makes the Sixth  Sense different.  The plot is what binds it to the supernatural/suspense  genre, but the actual story makes it so much more.  Take Poltergiest, Ghost  and Good Will Hunting, these are three very different films, each a classic  in their own right. If you were to mix these you might end up with  something close to the Sixth Sense: an original supernatural thriller, with  excellent character development and relationships which is not too big to  have an element of romance.  Brilliant displays by Bruce Willis and Haley  Joel Osment gives the film its edge.
Technically the Dvd is also  faultless. Picture and sound quality are excellent and there are two pages  of special features which have thoughtfully been put together.
I can  offer you no more than my assurance that this is a film that I believe will  appeal to all. It is an emotional journey, which will leave a lump in the  throat and a chill in the spine of even the most hardened of persons... if  not, check your pulse!",954374400,,1649,4.606896551724138

1077316,5,630573240X,"I wanted this dvd for some time now, and now that the dvd is released, I'm happy.  When I turned it on, I was intriqued at the previews.  This is the first dvd where I've ever seen previews in it.  But,preview aside, I think  this dvd is definitly worth being on top of anyone's list.  The action may  not be at the top, but not all great movies have action in them.  Like  Saving Private Ryan.  Just Kidding.  But still, this movie is about a  little boy named Cole who has the power to see the dead and communicate  with them.  A psychiatrist(Bruce Willis) tries to help him with his power,  at first not believing him but then he comes to terms with his doubts and  realizes this boy is special.  This movie sets the stage for a great ending  that hits you like a Yankees homerun caught on your nose.  The surprise  you'll have to see for yourself, but I do STRONGLY recommend this dvd to  anyone who wants a sure to be must have for all families for all times to  come.  This dvd is acceptable for ages above 8 in my opinion because there  may be some scenes in which they may get scared, and there is a little(VERY  LITTLE) blood in it.  But for parents, you will not get embarresed watching  this dvd with your children.",954288000,,1226,4.221739130434782
1077317,4,630573240X,"So, I knew the surprise ending almost from the beginning, but this was probably due to viewer awareness brought on by hype about the twist ending.  At this point, I would bet that many first-time watchers will guess the  ending.  But, I wouldn't let that stop you from watching.  This package is  more than the delivery at the end.  The whole trip is so expertly planned  that it should be hard to be disappointed when the still intreaging  destination is finally reached.
Most everyone already knows that the  little boy in this movie sees ghosts.  ""They don't know they are  dead"", he says, ""They only see what they want to see.""  Most everyone knows that the kid playing the part (Haley Joel Osment) got  great reviews.  If you doubt the reviews on this score, you need to watch  the movie.  Personally, the only reason I wasn't too disappointed that the  sprite didn't win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor was that the  award went to the incredible Michael Cain.
The movie has the right  texture and shading throughout. It keeps you in the mood, even when it  moves at a languid, dream-like pace.  The scary scenes are made more so by  their unannounced and rather simple entrance onto this background.  The  director was using a bit of long overdue restraint (in Hollywood that is)  in presenting the more frightening scenes.  From my perspective, it  enhanced the effect.
The cast was overall great in this film.  Willis'  portrayal of the psychiatrist as restrained, somewhat removed, and at times  almost dazed and vaguely confused, works the plot like a good mule works  the ground.  There won't be any trumpets for it, but the furrows are  straight and deep, and the job well done. And, in the end, if the healthy  crop comes in, that is where it all started.  The performance is more  easily appreciated the second time around.
The most impressive part of  this film was the intensly moving way it portrayed this child's fear.  Hopefully, most children don't really see ghosts.  But their fear can be  just as breathlessly real, just as terrifying, and to them, just as  unexplainable and difficult to justify as is the character's fear in this  film.
I wouldn't call this film great.  A great film I can't forget  or stop thinking about for weeks.  But, it is very good.  If I were to  criticize the film I suppose that I would have to say that it did tie up  neatly on all corners in the end.  However, I actually prefer a film of  this type that neatly finishes.  To be bluntly honest, I don't really go to  movies, rent, or buy videos much to expose myself to huge doses of reality.  Mostly, I find that reality is free, and I don't particularly want to be  always laying down the bucks to get smacked up-side the head with yet  another pointless dose of it.",954288000,,2784,4.58282208588957

Much is made of the twist at the end, which totally surprised me, but the  entire film works as a whole, and teaches some important lessons.
The DVD  version of this film is extraordinary. The bonus material added much to my  own enjoyment.

The eerie atmosphere and music, the excellent  acting, and the incredibly written script, and the twist at the end combine  to make this a very satisfying experience. The story creeps under your skin  and stays there long after the movie is over. I was never a fan of Bruce  Willis before, but his performance in this film is perfect and has made me  a fan. Every actor is well-cast, but without Haley Joel Osment the film may  not have been as successful. Writer/diector M. Night Shyamalan found the  just the right person to play this part, and drew out of him the best  performance of his young career. Shyamalan will be the next Spielberg for  sure, as this is the best writing I've encountered in a script in a while.  (It should be, since he was paid over 2 million dollars for it.)

And so you can imagine how much I was looking forward to watching this movie. And what a letdown it was. It reminded me of a cheap soap opera rather than of an intelligent mystery story. The relationships between the boy and his mother or between Willis' character and his wife made up a great part of the movie and were full of all the clichees we have to watch in any Hollywood tearjerker. The 'horror' part of the story was not much better, though. And the ending is unbelievable I seriously asked myself what made Bruce Willis star in this horrible flick. Willis' performance is not bad, though he's already been better, but the boy becomes really annoying after the first ten minutes.  The rest of the cast is forgettable.
So that was it? Cut down to 30 minutes and aired on cable TV it might have been an okay entry in a mystery TV series, sometime between 'Ally McBeal' and 'The X-Files'. But as a full-length-feature it bored me more than any other 1999 movie (except for The Other Sister, maybe) - and take in consideration that I sat through such disastrous movies as The Thirteenth Warrior and Star Wars: Episode One.
To me, anyway, The Sixth Sense is full of clichees, offers nothing new, has a story that lacks any plausibility, and is really, really boring from the beginning to the end.",953424000,,1476,4.566037735849057

Haley Joel Osment is wonderful in this movie!  His adult-like  demeanor in an otherwise little kid makes his performance all the more  real.  It's plain to see why he got an Oscar nomination for this role.

As far as ""The Sixth Sense"", like most people it caught me, held me, riveted me to  my seat, then surprised the heck out of me.  This is one of those rare  films that, after the ending credits, I wanted to immediately purchase  another ticket and view it again from a different perspective...to see what  I missed and why I didn't catch on as the film progressed (""The Usual  Suspects"" was another film that captured me in the same way).
Although  several people didn't care for this movie, and thought it was overhyped and  that Haley Joel Osment overacted (ala a young Ricky Schroeder in  ""Earthling""), I came away with the opposite reaction...and hey, I liked the  ""Earthling"".  However, I can relate to those who didn't like it.  I've  viewed many films that have been highly praised, but left me cold (some of  these films I've viewed again after many years and was surprised to find  out that they were much, much better--or worse--than what I remembered.  I  believe ones' sense of liking or disliking anything depends upon  expectation and what mood he or she is in at the time).  With that said, I  thought ""The Sixth Sense"" did live up to its hype, and was amazed at the  performance of not only Osment, but also Bruce Willis' surprising,  understated performance.  I also enjoyed how the movie sent  honest-to-goodness chills through me, and without the use of gory ""slasher""  scenes that try to shock the audience with its violence.
While I don't  believe this is a great film in the ""classic"" sense, I do think that it is  the type of movie that can enlist impromptu discussion around the  proverbial water cooler (ala ""Fargo"").  Between 1 and 10, ""The Sixth Sense""  deserves a solid 8, and it's a film that I am anxious to see again.",953337600,,1888,4.610271903323262

1077735,4,630573240X,"One thing that is true about The Sixth Sense is that it is an especially creepy film. The way in which Shylaman builds up the suspense is terrific, letting the audience wait until about halfway through the film before the  first physical encounter with a ghost. One of the main things that made the  film so chilling is that the ghosts seem to have retained there injuries  after they have died. These injuries range from smashed in heads to burnt  flesh and all this makes The Sixth Sense much more horrifying for it.
And  that is exactly what The Sixth Sense came very close to being, a horror  film. Except The Sixth Sense is like a horror film with brains, not relying  on gore and cheap shocks to scare the audience, instead making us scared in  a much subtler way. All the actors put up great performances, with Bruce  Willis probably putting up the greatest performance of his life.
In the  end The Sixth Sense is a good film but not a great film, only being let  down by one or two less interesting scenes where nothing nuch goes on. And  one more thing. Theres an absolutely fantastic twist at the end.",953078400,,1111,4.445544554455446

This film  [without spoilers] has apparently set the Standard for which other  thrillers are to be judged. Any movies that come out in 2000 will  undoubtedly be compared to this gem.

This is the story of a Philadelphia  child psychologist; an award winning one at that. An encounter at the  movie's beginning sees him injured by a previous patient- one who was  unable to be helped.
From there, we are drawn in as the doctor attempts  to help Cole. We are as intriuged as he is by the boy's unnatural talent.

Now, you usually those two types of films don't cross with eachother, at least, not  since The Exorcist, but M. Night Shyamalan has created a masterpiece with  this film.  Bruce Willis has finally struck gold with his portrayal of Dr.  Malcolm Crowe.  Haley Joel Osment is one of the best child actors around.  Even better in this role than Linda Blair's role in The Exorcist, mainly  because they didn't result to the kid cursing like a sailor to bring depth  to the role.  He is the front-runner in my opinion for Best Supporting  Actor at this year's Academy Awards.  Oh, and don't pay attention to the  stories about Stir of Echoes and The Sixth Sense and that they were  competing with the same story.  These two films are nothing alike and they  are both equally good in their own right.

Utilizing single position camera angles, terrors hinted at rather than splashed across the screen,  and understated acting, this movie raises questions and fears without  shoving them in your face.  When I first saw it, I said that Cole's mother  should get an Oscar nod for her gut-wrenching role.  I'm glad to see she  has. When I first saw the film, it was the same week that Kip Kinkel's  interviews had been released.  This brought to the forefront the reality  that there is another realm that pushes kids and adults toward unwise  choices.  Kinkel said he heard voices.  Unfortunately, ""The Sixth  Sense"" erases its own valid questions by slopping a tidy solution  across the last half hour:  Just listen to the voices; they just need your  help...Well, that's not always true.  Only one Divine voice offers reliable  direction--but that one's difficult to hear through all the other noise.

Night Shyamalan's sleeper hit The Sixth Sense is an outstanding surrealstic supernatural character study that showcases unusually restrained and effective acting by Bruce Willis as a dedicated child  psychologist who after receiving an award for his superb work in his field  gets an unexpected visit by a previous patient who shots Willis and then  turns his gun on himself. This traumatic event starts a downward spiral in  Willis's life that leaves him with nothing but his work with a troubled  young child. Haley Joel Osment, in an Oscar caliber performance, plays an  emotionally distressed boy who is blessed or cursed with the ability to see  and interact with the spirits of the dead. Osment's star-making performance  shines with more passionate human emotion and authenticfear than any child  performance since Linda Blair in the Exorcist (1973). What makes this film  drastically different than the convential horror or suspence film, is that  this film takes itself seriously by allowing the  characters, plot, and  locale to gradually build to where the audience feels as if boys like  Osment actually due exist somewhere in America. The Sixth Sense will be  remembered in years to come as an atmospheric suspence classic that  cleverly dealt wih its subject honestly enough to make itself feel fresh  and engaging everytime you watch it.",952473600,,1355,5.199074074074074
1077840,5,630573240X,"There has been a lot of criticism surrounding ""the Sixth Sense"", most of which is aimed at the movie's supernatural issues.  It is said that the movie is quite a boring ghost story with very few frightening moments.  But by looking at this wonderful movie as merely a horror movie is to  completely miss the movie's main and psychologically deep themes.  Above  all, ""the Sixth Sense"" is not a ghost story, nor is it a horror  film.  Rather, it is an in depth study of the human psychology....with a  few ghosts thrown in to aid in the characters' development.  It is a story  of communication and how we must all learn to speak to the world around us,  acknowledge its existence rather than build our own mental and emotional  walls to protect ourselves from the ills of the world.  It is about leaving  your safety net behind and venturing out into unknown regions, thus finding  your true self.

That was when I was told it was  about a boy who could see dead people. Without exaggeration,this was the  first time a film actually made the back of my neck tingle.
A  nine-year-old boy named Cole attracts the attention of Malcolm Crowe, a  child therapist played by Bruce Willis. Malcolm is drawn to this boy  because he reminds him of one of his old patients - a patient who was  driven to breaking point and committed suicide.
Cole tells Malcolm the  same things as the old patient. He is able to see, hear and speak to dead  people.
This story initially made me think of Stephen King's novel  ""The Shining"", which was also about a young boy who had visions.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is a bit more intense. At completely unexpected  moments ""visitors"" come and go, sometimes silent, at other times  taunting and malicious. Naturally, trying to talk about this to other  people would have them thinking Cole  was either lying or disturbed. The  only person Cole can turn to is Malcolm.
It makes you wonder how common  Cole's ""sixth sense"" really is. Is it a gift or a curse? Were so  many other people who were labelled as ""schizophrenic"" really  just people like Cole who couldn't make others believe them? These are some  of the film's little subtleties.

1078165,5,630573240X,"This kind of subject is fascinating for anyone - for each individual on this Earth there isn't a more important question than 'what happens when you die' - whatever the answer is, its eternal.  If you truly aren't  interested in this question, you're either very young, or have missed the  point of life altogether! :-)
If you're hoping for a blood-and-guts  horror film, or have come to see it because you've been pulled in by some  hype-machine, you'll probably be disappointed - its not a horror film, its  a thoughtful, suspenseful story - and there are few films ever made that  can live up to their marketing hype, so don't listen to it!  You'll nearly  always go away feeling ripped-off.
""The Sixth Sense"" features a  boy, Cole Sear, who is being terrified by visions of the dead, and a child  psychologist, Malcolm Crowe, who tries to help him - in part to exorcise a  failure in his past.  There was another boy that the psycologist had  treated who was haunted, but he failed to help him.
We see this boy at  the beginning of the film, now grown into a young man - tortured and  terrified, the boy blames the psychologist for his years of torment... he  had been promised help by the doctor, and had been left to his demons by a  mis-diagnosis of emotional problems by a man who couldn't bring himself to  believe what his child patient was telling him.  The man, standing shaking  in his underwear, pulls out a gun (don't know where he was hiding that!)  and shoots Crowe in the stomach, then puts the gun to his own head and  fires.
The next autumn/fall history begins to repeat itself with Crowes  new patient, Cole.  At first he can see no further than the rational,  believing him to be emotionally disturbed because of his parent's  separation - but just as he's about to give up on him, he reviews an audio  recording of an old session (with the boy who would later shoot him), and  comes across a faint voice that couldn't possibly have been there - a  Spanish voice, pleading and begging - ""I don't want to die!""  Then begins Crowes attempts to really help the boy, by finding out what  these visitors want - and if there ever can be a way to make them  leave.
If this film has one major flaw its that it skips over its subject  too fast.  The boy is supposed to be tortured, but we only ever see a  couple of ghosts - my sister has seen more ghosts than that!  And if  anything, there's no search for the answer to how to make them go away -  Crowe puts his finger on the solution immediately - and then the doctor's  theory is considered proved by just one ghost.
That point aside, this is  one of the better films I've seen, simply for its thoughtful speculation of  the nature of ghosts, and the story's clever twists.  This is the kind of  film Twilight Zone fans will love, but maximum-body-count horror film fans  will probably find weak and slow...
Be that as it may, the line ""I  can see dead people"" has got to be a film line destined to be in the  future books of world's greatest film lines!

Although the movie holds an atmosphere that is  initially unsettling, it finishes off in such a satisfactory way that  you'll want to watch it over and over again, just to keep experiencing the  feeling it gives you.
Bruce Willis is refreshingly good as a child  psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment, as a troubled boy with a frightening  secret, is nothing less than extraordinary. If you ever thought kids  couldn't act, this guy will prove you wrong. Much of the emotional  resonance of the film comes from his pained looks and whispered words.

While watching The Sixth Sense I couldn't help but think how average this movie was. The script is  so-so at best, the acting (with the obvious excpetion of Haley Joel Osment)  is pretty average and the plot as a whole just seems like something that  you've seen before.
Then comes the ending which is undeniably a great  twist. In fact the ending is really the only brilliant thing in this movie  and I believe people often overate this movie just because of it.
The  Sixth Sense is nothing more than an average movie with a great  ending.
The fact that this was nominated for best picture is even more  sickening. Then again The Green Mile was also nominated so it's fairly easy  to conclude that the Oscars have no credibility anymore.
People glorify  the Sixth Sense in the same way that they glorified Saving Private Ryan.  They saw the opening beach sequence in that film and thought ""wow,  that part was so good, the rest of the film has to be good."" Well it  wasn't at all. Did anybody care about the fact that each character in  Saving Private Ryan was nothing more than a cartoon charater? It was a  wonderful example of how Steven Spielberg cannot make a movie anymore  without having something big to distract the viewer from the fact that the  film is mediocre. Unfortunately the Sixth Sense suffers from the same  problems, it's nothing but mediocrity that impresses everyone because of  the finale.

The expression on his face shows a hurt and agony I thought only  a veteran actor could produce. In the other, Cole has a secret to tell to  Malcom (Willis) and is ready to tell it. When the scene ends you wish there  was something you could do to rid this angel of his demons.  M. Night  Shyamalan directs a masterpiece of darkness and suspense. This film is a  wonderful character study, proving that you can make a great film without  resorting to gore or multi-million dollar special effects.

As a Catholic, it explains the deep subject of Purgatory, making  ammends for one's sins, and blowing me away at the movies.

It's a pretty good film, but the hype surrounding it is excessive, and not to mention,  undeserved. I didn't really think of it as a horror movie, more of a drama  with spooky undertones, and that is why the film disappointed me. The whole  ghost aspect of it was quite weak, like it had no power or energy . Sure it  had an eerie atmosphere, and one ""jump"" scene, but that was  pretty much it. The film also felt kinda wooden at times, and generally  moved at an all too slow pace. However, negative points aside, ""The  Sixth Sense"" boasts some good performances and a strong emotional  sense. Bruce Willis is good, but it is Haley Joel Osment who steals the  show, his performance as the tortured boy is flawless. I also found the  film to be quite moving, especially the last scene between Osment and his  mother. The famous ""twist"" at the end is also something to  appreciate. So in all, ""The Sixth Sense"" is pretty good, it's  strengths overcome it's weaknesses, but unfortunately, media hype has made  it out to be a better movie than it actually is.",950313600,,1175,4.455399061032864

The boy is a strange genius and the psychologist a tortured  workaholic, forever changed after a former patient made an attempt on the  good doctor's life before taking his own. Seeking redemption for failing to  cure the gunman, the doctor tries to help the haunted boy discover why the  ghosts come visiting and how to send them on their way.
This intelligent  suspense thriller becomes one of the greats by tapping into your psyche and  plucking nerves with startling effectiveness -- rather than bludgeoning  your head with blood and gore until all five conventional senses are  blunted. The ghost sightings are occasional and relatively subtle overall,  leaving you on the edge until finally seeing them in full force sets off an  adrenaline rush hard enough to knock you out of your seat. By seeing the  apparitions through the young boy's eyes we become fearful little children  watching our nightmares come true even as we huddle with the protagonist  under a tent of bedsheets with a flashlight. Intelligent writing and sharp  cinematography create an eerie atmosphere that carries all the way through  to a surprise twist at the end. It's just ... exquisite.

Haley Joel Osment is great as the boy with a terrifying power (I  see GOLD in his future).  If I had to have a gripe, I'd say the supporting  cast is a little weak, but that is a minor point.
I must say, I don't  think I have heard ANYONE talking about the ending --  I must conclude that  there are some sort of subliminal messages keeping people from revealing  it, because I don't think I've EVER seen a movie that hasn't had the best  part(s) ruined by the general public.
Treat yourself and buy this DVD -  it will be well worth it!",948844800,,919,4.292397660818714
1078503,4,630573240X,"""The Sixth Sense"" is an odd movie in today's multi-million-dollar mechanical-effects-laden shoot 'em ups, as it sets a slower, more thoughful pace and rewards those who can slow down long enough  to notice with a chilling story of death, and life beyond it. As such, it  is not the movie of choice for the average chronically-overstimulated,  caffeine-driven consumer. On the other hand, if you have a couple of hours  to allow yourself to be woven into the fabric of this little story, you'll  experience a film that almost universally sends its audience  retrospectively through the details of the plot, looking for the one minor  flaw which causes the premise to collapse like a deck of cards. I know I  did, and I was delighted to find that all loopholes appear closed, and all  conflicts seem resolved -- a sure sign that the screenwriter combed through  this script many times before heading off to market. I appreciated that  sense of craftsmanship, and look forward to seeing this one again.
But,  if you gravitate more to the ""She's The One"" or ""Varsity  Blues"" market, you will likely find this movie maddeningly slow, like  reading a book for which a movie has already been produced. In such cases,  the remainder of Bruce Willis's body of work will likely interest you more;  however, this one (for me) stands head and shoulders above the rest.",948844800,,1356,4.8304347826086955
1078504,5,630573240X,"Have you ever watched a scary movie in the dark, and almost swore you saw someone moving out of the corener of your eye? I have, and after seeing this movie it happened a lot more.
""The Sixth Sense"" has great  performances from Bruce Willis (who plays Malcolm, an emotionally wounded  psychologist)and Haley Joel Osment (who plays Cole, a little boy with a  remarkable gift:he sees dead people) The screenplay is  wonderful.
""They don't know they're dead,"" laments  Cole.""They think they're alive. They see what they want to see.""  Malcolm is determined to help him. His marriage has been failing ever since  an old case that showed almost the same symtoms shot him in the side and  then killed himself. Malcolm is determined not to let that happen to  Cole.
This is a remarkable movie with a Hitchcokian twist at the  end. Watch it, and you'll be doing double takes next time you feel that  strange presence behind your back.",948672000,,926,4.725
1078505,5,630573240X,"There has never been a type of movie with more allure than the thriller series.  Many have scared the socks off of their poor audience, with a paticular tip of the hat to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but this  movie is different.  The movie tells you with its story, its tone, and its  color that something will happen, but you can not put your finger on it  until the end.  The movie supports no ""cheap scares"" present in  movies like Scream in which a scene is not scary, just sudden and  startling. This movie, ""The Sixth Sense,"" Will make you afraid.  Afraid of the dark, and afraid of being alone.  The genuine surprise ending  added closure to a genuine 21st century scary movie.  And, with added  footage, you will not want to miss ""The Sixth Sense.""  Note: This  movie is only for those who are not afraid to be truly afraid.",948585600,,831,4.410596026490066
1078506,1,630573240X,"Overhyped, yes, and severely overrated in general.  This movie was just plain horrible.  It's an incohesive film, with a plot that pushes one's suspension of disbelief to such an extent and is so full of holes it's  almost a parody.  There are incomprehensibly also a LOT of tears in this  movie; it seems almost every scene involves some kind of inane variation on  someone crying.  Most of all, it was just plain boring and dumb.  Throw in  one of THE most annoying child actors you'll ever see, and you have the  recipe for a pure waste of a couple of hours of your life.  I watched this  film with friends, and the only reason we lasted past the first half-hour  to begin with was to see the much-vaunted ending.  Needless to say, it left  us as empty as the rest of the film.  It's too late for us; our two hours  are lost forever.  A chunk of time we'll never see again.  But it's not too  late for you.  If my review can save just one person from wasting that same  chunk of their precious life (not to mention the synapses they'd burn out  by sitting through this moronic mess), then my sacrifice will at least not  have been in vain.  Stay away from this garbage...your five senses will  thank you.",948585600,,1207,4.34841628959276
1078507,5,630573240X,"I was surprised when I first heard the rave reviews and witnessed how much money this film was making... it seems to me, that it would've been much more a ""sleeper"" The reason is that, compared to most  horror/pyschological horror films, this movie is ""slow"". It moves  more like a 3-hour long movie, than an hour and a half or so, and it  contains only sparesly, albeit well-placed, bits of gore. On the whole, the  violence in this movie is only included to tell a story, not give a cheap  thrill. For this reason, and because it seems to me to be a sensitive,  thoughtful look at the possible existense of ""ghosts"", I highly  recommend this movie. If movies were assigned personalities, and if  ""ET"" was cutsie, and ""Exorcist"" was loud and profane,  then ""The Sixth Sense"" by M. Night Shyamalan is quiet, pensive,  brooding and clever.
As for Haley Joel Osment, the 12 year old who plays  9-year-old Cole Sear... there is only one word to describe his acting  abilities: AWESOME. Never, and I mean never, have I come across a youngster  who is as capable of giving such a realistic performance, and of  influencing the mood of the audience to such a degree. Haley has a way of  claiming the screen, and is coupled well with a quickly-maturing Bruce  Willis, who was darkly-mysterious as the tenacious, caring child  psychologist, Malcolm Crowe.
By now, you probably know that this movie is  about a young boy who has the very-real ability to ""see"" dead  people. Consequently, if a child really was capable of seeing such things,  they would be terribly frightened and probably give the impression that  something is very wrong, without necessarily stating what the problem is.  This is where Malcolm comes into the picture... he wants to  ""help"" Cole because, at the beginning of the movie, Cole appears  to be living the life of an emotionally abused child. And also... Cole  represents the chance to 'redo' the past; a past that has one, rather  large, error in it for Malcolm (one of his patients had a mental breakdown  and committed suicide, after shooting Malcolm in the solar plexus).
Even  if you don't think this movie will satisfy your need for constant 'blood,  gore and shocks', see it anyway. It is almost a calming experience, when  compared to the gaudy, LOUD horror movies that are flooding the market,  and, to me, a welcome change.
Congratulations, Bruce and Haley, on this  awesome landmark film!",948412800,,2418,4.765700483091788
1078566,5,630573240X,"Writer/director M. Night Shymalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" is that rarest of breeds: an intelligent, well-made film that conquered the box office. Equal parts mystery, drama and bone-chilling horror,  ""Sense"" deals with a weary, wounded child psychologist (Bruce  Willis) whose latest patient (the remarkable Haley Joel Osment) has a  mysterious and terrible gift: he sees ghosts.
Shymalan, ably assisted by  Tak Fujimoto's brilliantly icy cinematography, wrings suspense and terror  out of empty doorways, split-second glimpses of figures in the background,  and unknown things lurking in the dark. But this is hardly a cheap slasher  film: perhaps the most wonderful aspect of this film is its message, that  fear can be conquered through understanding and compassion.
Cleverly  plotted, bolstered by fine performances from Olivia Williams as Willis's  melancholy wife and Toni Colette as Osment's worried mom, and graced with a  twist ending worthy of Hitchcock, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a  magnificently creepy film that will have you jumping at shadows long after  it's over.",947894400,,1071,5.537037037037037
1078567,4,630573240X,"In this summer's proliferation of scary movies, The Blair Witch Project got all the hype, The Haunting got all the fancy schmany special effects, and The Sixth Sense won the acclaim of moviegoers and critics alike. This  film is the best of the new crop scary movie flicks (the aforementioned, as  well as Stigmata and Stir of Echoes.
Willis plays a kiddie shrink who  failed once and is determined not to make the same mistake for the special  but troubled little child played by Osmet (Forest, Jr. from Forest Gump).  However, he can never be prepared for the revelation Osmet makes to him. In  a scene that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end he  confesses to Willis in a raspy whisper, ""I see dead  people.""
What progresses are a series of images that are lackluster  in special effects, but so well-set-up they will literally scare the hell  out of you. It is a non-stop adrenaline ride from then on out. For the  first time since I saw The Exorcist at 16, I felt uneasy when I cut the  lights off and settled into my bed.
There are some holes in the plot and  a few melodramatic moments, but all in all this movie is fantastic. There  are two particular bright spots that outshine its other traits, however.  The first is Osmet. A child of his age in such a role would normally play  it very melodramatic and unconvincing, but he is soft-spoken and as  realistic as any other actor I have seen. Because of his age, I think this  is one of the best performances of the year (nuge, nudge, Academy). The  other bright spot is the twist at the end that will literally make your  head spin. Never duplicated, totally unpredictible, you will walk out of  the theatre shaking your head in disbelief. That is all I will say about  it.
Overall, this one is a must see. Just keep that heater running as hot  as it will go when you get home. Brrrrr...

1078568,5,630573240X,This film is extremly moving. I like this movie because it's very jumping and the actors in it act so good. If you haven't yet seen this film then you should see it. The ghost in it look so real it's unbelievable. I  personaly thought the little boy in the film acted really good (so did  Bruce Willis).,947808000,,303,4.206896551724138
1078569,4,630573240X,As a Bruce Willis avoider I would recommend this video because there appears to be a shift in Mr. Willis' character deliverance.  Up until now Mr. W. appeared to be a bone headed tough guy with an affinity for  delivering the same character over and over in most of his craft.  I made  the decision to see this movie because I had seen an interview with Mr. W  and he made sense for the first time.  He appeared to have some insight  into his own life and the role he has at this time. Perhaps he needed to  get away from Demi!,947721600,,527,4.098039215686274
1078570,5,630573240X,"First of all.  Forget the fact Bruce Willis is a Die Hard stereotype of all movies.  The director of the 6th sense obviously knows how to move and motivate the full potential of an actor. Halley Joel  Osmont concieved an excellent performance and does deserve best supporting actor.  The story in  genius,  is well scripted, and well done.  The direction and the script was  intelligent,  making movies like Austin Powers 2 and American Pie,  one hit  wonders like a bad hit by a wanna-be teenband.  Sixth Sense is the BEST!",947635200,,524,4.7
1078571,5,630573240X,"Wow - what can I say?  A very intelligently scripted and amazingly acted film in which Bruce Willis proves that the action stereotype is just a misconception of him while he plays a child psychologist with a real sense  of character.  The supporting cast offer a uniformly high standard also,  and with an amazingly scripted plot, make this the best film I have seen in  a long, long time. If it's action you want then stay away, whereas if it is  suspense, drama and plot you want order it now!

1078572,5,630573240X,"We saw The Sixth Sense in a theater last year just as the public was discovering this little gem.  Some magazine my wife had read blew the ending for her, but she still cried up a storm.  The film is THAT moving.  I have to agree with the Amazon Staff Review.  The excellence of this film  is in it's execution.  The plot has been utilized over and over again.  Some one (in this case a little boy) is seeing ghosts and has to perform  services for them so that they can ""move on"".  At first the kid  is thought to be disturbed, but with the help of his psychiatrist he is  able to come to terms with his gift and move on with his life.  Think  Ordinary People meets The Haunting.
How this film is shot is where the  payoff comes from.  The use of camera angles and perspective is amazing.  The cabinet scene made us both jump out of our chair and there was no  special effect.  Just good film making.
I had heard a rumor that a sequel  may be in the works, but not for a few years so that the kid playing the  lead character can grow up a bit and reprise his role as a teenager.  I  vote yes for this.  It could prove a very interesting follow up to a great  film.
If any of this film's nominees read this-  Good luck at the Golden  Globes and see you at The Oscars!",947203200,,1267,4.008064516129032
