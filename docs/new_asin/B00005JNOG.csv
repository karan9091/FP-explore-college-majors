While the action and facinating backstories make for entertaining television, many small details are missed by the average audience. (i.e. Sawyer is reading ""Watership Down."", the ancient references to symbolism like the color black and white, etc.) It explores many philosophies of human nature, from many different angles. Excellent show! Can't wait for the DVD.",1105660800,10,470,5.28

1537932,5,B00005JNOG,"This definitely a DVD series I will buy.  The plot is awesome, and every week you cannot wait to see what will happen next.  This is also a nice change from all the reality series and everything on TV, because this series has nothing to compete with.

You have 48 survivors of a plane crash searching an island for food and shelter, and trying not to kill each other in the process due to personality conflicts.  As the series goes further, you learn amongst the survivors are a doctor, an ex-rocker/druggie, war veteran, prisoner, brother and sister, a father and his distant son, a gentleman who has turned into a man whom he has be searching for all of his life, a pregnant girl, an oriental couple, and many others.

You never get tired watching this show.  Even when ABC re-airs episodes I have already seen, I am still attached to the TV.  You will definitely be seeing this show on the air for years to come.",1104710400,14,915,4.4431137724550895

1538389,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost was a great series, although it wasn't an original idea. The Lost Islands and The New People are a couple of examples of shows that came decades before Lost. The New People is one of those shows that Ive wanted to buy on disc for years, but its never been available, and its not available to watch on Amazon either. Ive got a list of little known shows that Id buy if they were available on disc like Danger 5, Galavant, etc. Someday.

After buying the first two seasons of Lost, and liking it, I bought the rest of the series on disc. I laughed at the crazy Jack character and some of his silliness, but overall the series was very entertaining. The ending didn't live up to the hype. Some reviewers said that Everybody was at the church in the last episode. Not true. Mr. Echo and a ton of other characters were not at the church. The church was mostly empty.

When Im not watching episodic storytelling Im reading, everything from nonfiction to westerns, but at least half of my time is spent reading sci-fi and fantasy.

Sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Ray Bradbury, Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, William R. Forstchen, Joe Haldeman, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, George Orwell, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, John Steakley, J.R.R.

1538488,2,B00005JNOG,"Season 1 of Lost was fun, though its annoying tendencies were already starting to show. The next couple of seasons should have been called Very Lost, as the writers began piling more and more hoopla on to try to hide that they had no idea where to go with it. The last few seasons should have been called Hopelessly Lost, as it became dreadfully clear that the writers had no more clue what was going on than the increasingly mystified and aggravated viewers. The infamously awful and unsatisfying cop-out of the last season was just the capstone to an enormous mess that had been piling up for at least 4 seasons by then.

1538491,1,B00005JNOG,"Do not invest your time in this. Lost has the absolute worst series finale of all time. After spending all your time puzzling over the ""mysteries"" of the island, you'll discover that the writers really had no clue where they were going with it and tried to pull off a really foolish ""Ha ha, they were actually dead the whole time"" surprise at the end. They left major storylines unresolved and unexplained because, quite frankly, they couldn't explain them in any way that made sense. Just one example: Walt was supposed to be such a central part of the island's purpose, but disappeared halfway through the series and his ""importance"" was NEVER explained.

If you simply must watch this series, turn it off with 10 minutes to go and invent your own ending. There's no way it could be any worse than the stupidity you'll see.",1476921600,2,825,4.6506849315068495

1538620,2,B00005JNOG,"I actually rate this from 2 Stars to 4 Stars, please read - I'll explain;
I originally watched this when it was on TV. Odd now watching it on DVD in 2016 - most of my memory of the events were wiped out.
Some of the initial premise is fascinating. A large group of people marooned on an island - and what they do.
I would say this 1st season is the best one - and it just gets too many bizarre twists to make it worth while.
On one hand this show can keep me on the edge of my seat - and often leaves each episode as a cliffhanger.
The 2 stars - is for how Despicable most of these characters are!! And the on-going downward spiral of television.
As in - if a show can't be 'Famous' - it might as well be 'Infamous'.
So - a plane drops from the sky - in a storm - at night. People are banged up - but a day or two - and
everyone is as fresh as a daisy. - Come On!!
Also they're on this stupid island for Months - and No one looks emaciated (thin, worn down - unhealthy)
People get beaten up - stabbed - shot and they behave with some temporary discomfort and bounce back.
Most of these characters I despise!! - I picture if I were in the shoes of these other fictional characters -
I would have Killed them by or During the 2nd season!! - People keep forgiving murderers and lunatics.
They also have Boundless energy to go on adventures - hikes and fight with others.
This plot goes beyond Convoluted!! - I can follow it - but it goes beyond imagination.
Sure it's exciting - but when I turn off the TV - I feel Uninspired by people. I'm 55 now - and I Love the 1960's TV,
Fun, silly, clever - with morals and fiber.
It's Sickening where TV has gone - and 'Lost' only Worsened this trend.
It gets to the point - where I hope None of these a-holes survive. - At least on Gilligan's - I liked All of them - and
Wanted them to get back home.
One lost - I want to fly overhead - with a B-52 and Bomb the whole cast!!
Sawyer, Sied(sp?), Kate, Shannon, Echo, Michael - and even Jack - I'd like to line them up against a wall - and Pop!!
Disgusting behaviors!! - I would Never want to meet people like them - but Unfortunately - I have
I blame the creators of this show - and although these actors have talent - they misused it by being willing to be on
such a show - that perpetuates and accelerates a dismal society.
So - it's a 4 for excitement, twists and turns - and ultimately a 2 star - for leaving me feeling
empty and full of despair. Scott M.",1469145600,,2445,3.9614604462474645

1538628,2,B00005JNOG,"Crestive and rather addictive show until it goes off of the tracks in Season Five and becomes increasingly bizarre.  The final episode sums up the series name for the characters very appropriately as ""Lost"", but this time spiritually.  Seriously doubt that even pagans would buy into this ending.  If you haven't been completely indoctrinated as of yet by our current cultural zeitgeist and retain even a slightly open mind, then it's worth taking this opportunity to open up the Bible and read John 14:6 and then Ephesians 2:8,9.

If you would like to know for a fact where you will spend eternity when you die, then admit to God that you are a sinner and that you cannot save yourself.  No religion or a lifetime of good works can save you.  The only way thay any of us can be saved is by God's grace through placing our faith in Jesus Christ and accepting the free gift of salvation purchased for us by Christ dying on the cross to take the punishment for our sins.  Our righteousness in the sight of God is then through Christ who paid the price for our sins.  Remember that if you have ever sinned even once, then it's the same as having broken every commandment of God (James 2:10) and that there is no forgiveness for sin without the shedding of blood (Hebrews 9:22), so being really sorry and begging for forgiveness or saying x number of prayers cannot forgive your sins.  Only Christ (The lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world,) who chose to shed his blood and died on the cross to pay the penalty for your sins can provide forgiveness for all of your sins (past, present and future) when you place your faith in Him alone for your salvation and accept the free gift of salvatiom that He paid for on your behalf.  Do you think this is stupid and really foolish?  If so, then read 1 Corinthians 1:18 which has a message for you.  Pray to God for faith to believe and once you have placed your faith in Christ for your eternal salvation, the Holy Spirit of God will open your eyes spiritually and you will be forever saved.  (Ephesians 1:13, 14.)  The Bible will then start making sense to you in ways that you can never otherwise have imagined and you will realize that it's not just another book.  Your life will be supernaturally changed forever.  You'll read the books of Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Hebrews, etc., and you will understand.  God bless you on your journey.

I felt led by God to write these words this evening.  Is it because He meant for you to read them and to choose to put your faith in Jesus Christ tonight?",1466553600,,2552,4.449462365591398

If I were Amazon, I would cut ties with new and used. I've had a lot of fraud with used books too! I've read to be real careful with stuff like the Beatles. Lots of knock offs there too.

1538794,4,B00005JNOG,"I'm around episode 15 of season 1 and overall I enjoy the show for its mystery, etc, but I find a few things annoying, particularly the behavior of the people when some of the events happen.
I understand that some/most of the peoples behavior it is to drive the plot but it feels unrealistic more often than not. Caution: possible spoilers below.
Shortly after the crash people split into tiny groups and with the exception of the few main characters they seem to not care much about whats going on or what others are doing and why. They tend to happily sit around multiple campfires and chat. There seems to be a total lack of interest in collective problem solving. Yes, people help each other here and there but something overall seems to be missing.
Nobody except one or two people seems to be interested in salvaging of whats left from the plane, baggage etc. When a superior shelter place is found with fresh water, others decide to sit on the beach around campfires and wait for the rescue arguing that they want to be found. Wouldnt the rescue teams be able to spot huge plane parts lying on the beach even if people moved somewhere else while leaving obvious traces of activity? When one of the characters is captured by an old visitor (with white teeth and in good physical health) and later escapes, no one seems to bother and investigate it further. How about sending a team of people there and talking to her? No, lets just sit around campfires and mind our own business. When another creepy old visitor attacks and later is disarmed, no one cares to investigate where he came from, why, etc.  How about organizing an able team of people, leaving those campfires and cautiously exploring the island? These are just a few examples, but a lot of time I keep thinking to myself that the actions (and inactions) of those people make no sense in the given situation. I keep watching it nevertheless.",1457654400,,1907,4.608823529411764

1538997,5,B00005JNOG,"Don't hesitate for a moment to grab season 1 of this excellent series and which continued on for a total of six seasons!  So too, and I'll limit my comment to just season 1, you're looking at ==25== episodes and in the Blu Ray version [well worth it!], over 8 hours of extras! The main attraction, IMO, is the quality of the writing and the excellent performances of the cast. This series is in =no= way any sort of ""Gilligan's Island"" slapstick kind of thing. Quite the contrary! The characters begin to really grow on you and the plot line keeps the drama moving. You'll notice that virtually all reviewers have given 5 star ratings, myself inclusive, and I'll wager that if you engage in ""marathon viewing"", it will be hard not to say to yourself the old ""just one more episode"" thing but only because it's that compelling! A real grabber!

Kudos to the writers and the cast where a mix of talent was found that really worked and the rest is gold! I think it was by episode 14 or 15 [out of 25 episodes for the first season] that I was so hooked into the series and into the characters and plot, I went back to Amazon and ordered seasons 2 through 6 on the strength of just the first season and not to mention hours of extras. In Blu Ray format, I found it visually stunning and in the extras you will see how the production team took great pains to get it right.

If you're looking for a series [it's finished its run now after 6 seasons] to keep you both interested and wanting more after each episode, this is it! I think lightning was captured in the proverbial bottle and the first rate cast really made the series work. Another interestng concept in the series is that you learn even more about the characters in a sort of on-going brief series of flash-backs ==prior== to the crash but which fits perfectly in the character's present situation on the island. As I say, it's compelling and with the pre-crash flashbacks, you begin to get a sense of the 'why' of a particular character which in itself becomes a sort of sub-story line but the mesh of the then versus now really works well so that you get, how to put it, a fleshed-out n-depth character and you begin to see the why of their personalities and therefore the total absence of any wooden characters who just happen to be on that flight. The series concentrates on about 14 or so of them [out of 48 survivors] but you really get to know them because you're made aware of what they were about previously as well as in the present. It's a brilliant story telling device when it's done well and I'm here to tell you that it's done well. Very well!

Grab season 1! I believe those first season 25 episodes [and over 8 hours of extras in the Blu Ray version] will also grab you!  Enjoy!

1539085,5,B00005JNOG,"One of the best first seasons of a show I have ever watched.

Usually I am more for thrillers or drama, but every once in a while science fiction really does it for me. This is one of those shows. Starts with such a great mystery, and explosive intro. One of the best first episodes of a show ever. Then it slowly unravels the mystery as you learn about each character, until by the last episode everything has been twisted up and no one is exactly what you expected. Then they introduce the Others, and the hatch, and OMG the wait for Season 2 was so difficult.

This is an old show most people already have an opinion on but I had to share my 2 cents. One of the best ever season of a show ever, science fiction or not. The only thing that could have made it better was more (or any) Desmond and Penny ;)

1539296,1,B00005JNOG,"Lost is a story of castaways on a Mysterious Island.... sounds good (and not just a little derivative) until mystery after mystery is stumbled upon leading..... ultimately.... to bad writing. The further in you go the more you realize that the ""mysterious"" story threads just unravel and go nowhere. On the rare occasion where a loose end is Actually resolved  - the big reveal is Idiotic.... over and over again you are left slapping your head like someone who has been working on a brain teaser for hours only to find out that the author didn't actually have a solution ..... and you just wasted your time.

And that is the best way to sum up ""Lost"".... a colossal waste of time. Over and over again a mystery is put in front of you and either - not resolved or the big reveal is just too stupid to be believed.

Add to this that most of the characters are varying shades of unlikable and you wind up with a lot of time you could have better utilized doing pretty much Anything else.",1436400000,5,985,4.4010989010989015

With all the odd things that happen on the Island though they so far have done a great job of answering some mysteries while deepening others, and introducing new ones as we go.

1540209,1,B00005JNOG,"I have at least 3 regrets in life that will traumatize forever . One was watching Al Jazeera to see what happened to Berg in Iraq and the other time was when I had ""one more Guiness"" on my 21st birthday. Watching LOST is my biggest life regret. I will never get that time back and when I leave this world, if an image from LOST is part of my flashback, I will be truly upset.

Every LOST episode introduces new questions and answers no old questions to any satisfaction. By the time end is reached, the authors realize how screwed they are for all the spaghetti they wrote and the useless characters they introduced and decide, uh oh, we're in a corner here.

It would be like watching a show of 80 episodes about main characters that include a time traveling pygmy navy seal who has a father that may or may not be a diamond smuggler who has a Siberian friend who sells Ozarka water door to door but has dark past as evidenced by the tattoo on his arm that says ""Knowing."" None of this made any sense, so let's just end it by writing an end where he is dreaming the whole thing or have him see his name as a patient in a psych ward! Or maybe we can just say it was aliens. Oh crap, we never explained the tattoo, but we did zoom in on the tattoo about 50 times and never really figured out what we wanted to do with that. No worries, some zealot of a fan will start a blog about how the tattoo was symbolized the birth and rebirth of man. We will just say, ""the show means what you want it to mean."" Wheew!

My fiance is watching ""The Leftovers"" on HBO right now (another Lindelof product) and I always walk out of the room when she does. It is hilarious watching her get so frustrated after every episode where nothing coalesces and new questions are opened. Telling someone to get Lost is truly a modern day and offensive insult.",1407369600,4,1832,4.198863636363637

Updated
What does QHHT and the show 'Lost' have in common? Spoilers ahead, if you've never seen the TV series, 'Lost'. I sat through the show again, just so that I could enjoy that perfect perfect ending.

I may be one of the few people who actually fell in love with the ending. But spiritual people will get this. Now I understand why I love it so much. Its message is, 'No one really dies.' All the people we loved, all the people we didn't love, all had their reasons for making their mistakes and creating whatever life they created. All are redeemed on a greater level and all are valuable. If you're thinking Im seeing only what I want to see, sure I am, but let me tell you why.

After twenty-plus years of dealing with asthma and traditional medicine that has no cure (among other unsolvable mysteries), I recently went to a hypnotherapist to see if I could find the real cause and cure. She practiced a special form of hypnosis, called Quantum Healing Hypnosis Therapy (QHHT). It is still considered a ""fringe"" science in some circles, so don't look for traditional doctors to validate it, some do however. While ""under"" I was regressed to a series of significant events that I have no memory of in this life. Before any of the regression took place, my foot started hurting. I had to interrupt the process briefly because of this. Now, while under, I did not lose consciousness. I felt awake and that I could stop the process any time I wanted. Only later did I realize this was part of my validation that what I was experiencing was part of a greater reality.

I found out that in three separate ""lives"" I had foot trouble that came from one initial injury, but I kept creating an emotional state that kept ""re-opening"" that wound, so to speak. None of this had to happen, it was all based on how I was making choices at the time. Out of fear or freedom.

The initial injury developed when I fell into a watery crevice while off exploring in the Virginia mountains. I was a young coal miner, but I loved to go off by myself every chance I got. Not to make anyone sad, but I didn't make it out of that fall. I was stuck immediately and cold water quickly filled in. Don't worry, it was bad for a moment, but it was over quickly and I felt so alive and buoyant and free afterwords, that I didn't know that my body never made it out. I always used to wonder how anyone could not know they're dead, like in folklore or superstitions. Now I know, you don't feel death after death, you feel greater life because you're not weighed down by the body anymore.

I remember flying over that wooded area, enjoying the beauty, but for some reason, I didn't feel I could leave. My memory wasn't the same. I had no memory of a body, I was somehow still the me I was used to being and didn't need a body. One day, a very compassionate man came and prayed for me. He knew that I had passed and that I didn't understand. He helped me and I felt myself leaving that place to get on with my life and future. I was free.

In another life, the foot injury showed up again whenever I had to make a painful decision that kept me stuck and indecisive. Stuck and indecisive equals fear, fear of what will happen if I make the wrong decision. In my present life, I experienced feeling stuck in a ""no-win"" situation and the foot pain just became a part of my life. The stuck feeling, when left unsoothed or unsolved, triggered the symptoms of the initial experience, along with the injuries: cold (I've always been cold-natured), unable to breathe, injured foot, stuck. In short, a panic attack, drawn out over years. In that first injury, the cold water took my breath. My foot was wedged in such a way that there was no chance of getting out of that crevice. The key is emotions and learning to soothe them by realizing we are freer and more supported than we know. Perhaps symptoms are our body's way of reminding us of lessons we've already been through and need not suffer again.

Since that session, I have not had an asthma attack, and I was having them every day. I'm not saying that I'm cured, because the recording that was made of my voice talking, said that it will be a gradual cure if I accept it on a deeper level.

Now, what does this have to do with the TV show Lost? Everything. Lost is about simultaneous lives and how death is meaningless. Lost is a supernatural drama that starts out looking like any other drama until you get caught up in the hero, Jack Shepherd's (Mathew Fox), compulsion to save as many people as he can from a plane crash. He's injured, confused, and just doing the best he can, with a heart of gold. And he ain't bad to look at, either!

By the time his story and the other characters' are told, you end up caring for them all. Even the evil characters because there's just desperate people, not evil people. But it sure seems like it for a while. Nothing is black and white and you find yourself accepting people you initially felt you could never accept, due their corrupt nature. Like the Grinch, your heart freakin' expands three sizes.

Jack Shephard, who has a god-complex and always has to do what's right, gets a minor neck injury towards the end of the story. But that neck injury starts to appear, repeatedly, long before it is caused in Jack's timeline. It's always a mystery to him, because he doesn't yet understand that he is living simultaneous lives and experiencing bleedthroughs, literally. He's a very special man and I'm a sucker for that.

There are so many plot twists, you forget the show is more sci-fi/fantasy than traditional drama. There's a smoke monster, the question of whether none of them ever survived the crash, and dead people constantly making appearances. By the time it ended, I found myself floored by the performance of Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson), one of the cruelest geniuses I've ever not wanted to like but had to admit how perfectly he played that role. All the characters went far deeper than I thought they would and made me care. But Jack Jack is given one of the most beautiful conscious deaths that I've ever seen depicted in film or TV. Don't worry, he doesn't die the way we're told death is. All of the characters are given this to some degree, yet the story goes on. No one really dies and yet they are finally awarded a deep spiritual peace and reunion for all their struggles.

At the very end, the characters ""solve"" their life issues and begin to wake up to their multiple lives. If you research it, you'll find opinions that can only accept so much of the outlandish concept, so don't limit yourself to that. The show has so much to offer, nothing I've said really spoils it. That's why I watch it over and over every few years. The ending is never spoiled for me because Jack Shephard awakens from his life-struggle illusion to a greater life.

After my QHHT session, I can now put words to why I like the show so much. It reveals more of the truth behind the daily illusions we all struggle with. All packaged just right for me. (And by package, I do mean Jack.) Why does one person appear to have it easy and another to have it so hard? Friends in one life can be enemies in another, as the show depicts. It's as if each life or timeline is only one perspective in an attempt to look at an issue from every perspective.

The minute I say I don't like something, another perspective exists where I do. I will only get to meet that part of myself if I can integrate my feelings, or the two will be separate lives to the other. If I hate doctors or policemen, I will not benefit from the natural healing and protectiveness that my other lives, where I am a doctor or a policeman, hold. On a subconscious level, the show, Lost, integrated and validated this for me. This is why it feels so good to get to the ending where all of the healing is.
 If you read all this, thank you so much and bless you.",1395878400,2,8206,4.399472643375082

My family and I have spent the Christmas holidays re-watching the Lost series, in part because some family members haven't seen all of them and in part because we thought it would be fun. Too, we're snowed in here and one can only read so much or clean so many closets before one needs something else to think about. We've just reached season 5 and have been having a grand time getting to the end of an episode and looking at one another, asking, ""Well? Should we go on? Or tolerate the tension until tomorrow?""

However, this morning, when we sat down to watch a couple of more episodes from season 5, we discovered that you'd pulled the plug on it. Now in order to watch the series, we have to pay for every single episode? I double checked--going back a few to the seasons we've already seen and, indeed, you've taken the entire series off Prime and now customers have to pay for it by the episode.

Are you kidding me? I can only assume that we're not the only customers who've taken the time to renew our acquaintance with the series this winter and that some Einstein up there thought you'd make more money by charging by the episode.

.I am massively disappointed in you. You guys are better than this.

This is the perfect way to watch; 2-3 episodes on a weekend.

I only give this 3 stars, simply because of the slow pace and story arcs within story arc.  Even after the first season, I feel as if I'm completely in the dark concerning some things.  This is more soap opera than I prefer.",1388534400,,619,4.293103448275862

1541572,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is not for the instant gratification crowd.  If you hate mysteries or need to have everything solved and worked out in a short amount of time, this series will frustrate the hell out of you. If you take the series Alias and mix it with the movie Castaway (except have an ensemble cast instead of just one person marooned on the island) you have Lost.  The series starts out in the aftermath of the crash of a plane from Australia to the United States.  From there it, in parallel, tells the back story of the characters stuck on the island through flashbacks and then tells the story of their attempt to survive.

If you look back at the first season there were two main things it did.  First it developed the ""main"" characters, by giving you their back stories in dribs and drabs and secondly it introduced the secrets of the island.  By the end if the season you have a pretty good idea of who the characters are, but you know little to nothing about the island and the things/people that were on it before the plane crash.  There are tons of weird twists and turns throughout.

What was probably the hardest thing to pull of for a series like this was to give all the characters time to develop and make them interesting.  There are some episodes where some characters are barely in it other than in the background.  Each of the ""main"" characters get focused on though, sometimes with an entire episode devoted to them.  I think they struck the best balance they could to get you to a point where you were invested in the characters you were supposed to be invested in.

The writing and acting in the first season was top notch.  The story was a great blend of drama, mystery, suspense and very dark comedy.  The season ends on two big cliffhangers and definitely leaves you wanting more.  As far as the discs themselves for those who get the blu rays, the A/V quality is top notch.  There are a ton of extras, including almost 2 hrs of behind the scenes, extended scenes and making of material on the last disc.  Definitely enough to make the people who like to go through that stuff happy.  All in all, if you like shows in this genre, it is definitely worth picking up.",1383436800,,2180,4.421052631578948

I never knew what to expect and could never predict what would happen next. At the end of every intriguing episode there was always a totally unexpected hook that made me want to watch the next episode immediately. As with Fringe, the acting is excellent, the show is geared to an adult audience, it is beautifully photographed, excellently edited, and the musical score is top notch. You must watch the episodes in order.",1383436800,,560,4.446601941747573

This is an incredible show. I'm surprised it made to commercial TV. Language is kept relatively unoffensive, drugs are
present with visible personal conflict and there is a brush of sex. I think the overall tension (re violence) of all characters
is my biggest problem.

I know I was late on the Lost bandwagon I didn't start watching until almost ten years after the first season aired but I can see what all the buzz was about.

I just highly recommend it from the First season on. It's not your normal plane crash movie though. There are strange goings on, on this Island. If you don't mind a bit of sci-fi and fantasy thrown into a Fantastic Drama, this show is for you! I suggest everyone give it a try. It's very thought provoking in which you'll be trying to figure it all out. The characters and the actors who play them are just Terrific! The cast & writers made this show so wonderful to be a part of. Hope you enjoy it as much as we have.

I'd also recommend Hero's. It's a completely different show compared to LOST but it was a fantastic show in it's on right.",1378512000,,790,4.231788079470198

Not being a very patient person, I'm glad I can watch it at my own pace and not get tied in to a weekly ""must watch"" situation.

No matter how many times you must scream ""No way!"" you keep watching.  It's got sci-fi, action, time travel, mystery, love, comedy, suspense, horror, well, pretty much everything in it.

Its a decent show with some profound thrills, but soon enough you'll come to realize there's a thrill around every corner (literally)Which will then have the adverse effect of drawing you out of the show and making you think 'this is overkill'. There are also a few inconsistencies within the show, as well as a few things that aren't realistic (even within the world that the producer created). Also notice how 90% of the footage you're seeing is within 2 feet of the character (i.e I hope you like seeing freckles and untrimmed beards).",1377561600,3,615,4.866666666666666

At first, I thought it was one of those reality TV series and never gave it a thought, then I was looking for a new series to get interested in and thought I would give it a ""look see"".

The sow seems well done in terms of acting, credibility of the plot within the context of all kinds of mysteries that need unraveling, and the way it makes the microcosm of the island socially relevant to the outside world. I worry that the ultimate resolution to the series story arc will turn superior science fiction into a cop out fantasy ending as happened with the otherwise excellent Battlestar Galactica. I certainly hope they can do better than that and the writers and producers have figured out a rational solution to Lost's plot lines without having to undermine everything that went before through by creating a silly supernatural glossing over of all the loose ends in the story line. For now, I am having a lot of fun trying to think about what could possibly explain all the unusual things that are going on.

1542508,5,B00005JNOG,"I would first like to say that I absolutely loved watching Lost. My biggest complaint her is that when I ordered this product I expected it to be brand new, but upon receiving it I noticed several cosmetic defects with the packing. The outer sleeve was bent in every corner,  the plastic case itself was broken and cracked on the back and the inside (I had to replace it ) and due to my background of working in a used video store for the past 4 years I could absolutely tell that the product had once been opened and then re-shrinkwrapped. I have absolutely no complaints about the television series of Lost, but the quality of the product once I received it was definitely not up to the standards I normally see from sellers here on Amazon.",1376092800,,742,4.416058394160584

And we didn't have Amazon Prime to watch shows we missed back then.  I'm into it now and I plan on watching all 6 seasons.  Great show.,1375228800,,287,4.071428571428571

1542703,5,B00005JNOG,I previously owned the DVD versions of Lost seasons 1-3 (with 4-6 on Blu-ray). I was initially on the fence about upgrading to blu-ray but wanted the best experience when I decided to rewatch the entire series. It just didn't feel right not having everything in HD. It was well worth the purchase/upgrade.,1375142400,,305,4.773584905660377

1542776,5,B00005JNOG,"The theme of this series, 'lost on an island', has always interested me.

The series is sometimes believable, but for the most part, just like other TV series, written to keep the audience guessing.

Good choice of characters, easy on the brain.

If you are able to just sit back and relax, you should find it entertaining.",1375056000,,323,4.631578947368421

1542779,5,B00005JNOG,"Having watched the entire first season of ""Lost"" in the space of a week or two, I can say I'm totally hooked!  The first three episodes were slow to get my attention, kind of like the first up hill of a roller coaster.  Once it got started, though, look out!  It was like the rest of the roller coaster ride; ups and downs and twists turns and unexpected plot changes!  The characters are great, and I find myself alternately loving and hating, trusting and not trusting them.
Seeing the ""back stories"" of each character, bit by bit, really increases their interest for me.
I'm so glad I didn't watch ""Lost"" when it originally aired; if I'd had to wait a week between each episode I would have been a basket case!",1374969600,,713,4.419847328244275

1542782,4,B00005JNOG,"While the show has it's ups and downs, overall it is very entertaining. It seems as though there are points where the writers are not sure where they are going with things. The story meanders nonsensically. However, it's worth sticking with.",1374883200,,241,4.902439024390244

1542784,5,B00005JNOG,"My boyfriend got me into this series as it is his favorite and I was SO happy it was on Amazon Prime. As a Criminal Justice graduate, I'm a stickler for the law and I don't like it when people suggest ""torrenting"" . It's illegal! With Amazon Prime, I'm able to check out shows LEGALLY at no more than my usual Prime membership fee.

As for the show itself, it's fascinating. It really is more like a long movie than a television series. I'm always wondering what's going to happen next. The cast is excellent. The storyline, albeit a bit far fetched at times, gives the viewer an accessible humanity quality that allows you to identify and inquire of yourself, ""Is this what I would do if I was stranded on an island?"" I have started the 2nd season and can't wait to finish the whole series. Thank you Amazon for making this available!",1374624000,,835,4.422077922077922

Each character is so interesting, and over the episodes you learn more and more about their backgrounds, why they were on the flight, more about their motives.  Wonder why I never checked it out when it was on the air?  So glad for modern technology that lets us have another chance.  I'd recommend this series to anyone who enjoys mysteries, the unexplainable, and great characters.",1373587200,,527,5.214285714285714

This show makes you think, surprises you and is totally different from anything else that is on TV. Hmmmm, maybe that is why it has a cult following?!! If you have never taken the time to watch this or have said to yourself....how can being stranded on an island be interesting?............I promise you it is very interesting!!!

1543135,5,B00005JNOG,"If you like a bit of mystery or suspense even a little bit, Lost is worth watching, especially from the beginning with the full season 1. Seasons 1 and 2 are both absolutely great. Season 3 stumbled a bit and the show spun in circles a bit, then with season 4 (once ABC backed that they would have 6 seasons and then end) the show got back on track.

Maybe you saw a few episodes mid-way through when it was on TV and it didn't seem all that great, just watching season 1 all the way through is worth it. Well crafted, with great characters and dialog, it really deserves to be seen from the beginning as it was meant to be watched in episodic fashion.

I've already seen it all the way through once before, and I'm watching it through for the second time with my wife who is watching it for the first time.  The series has great rewatch value.  There's so much detail, that you forget a lot about it after a few years.  However, it's interesting what you pick up on the second time through just because you already know the end from the beginning.  There are little tidbits of foreshadowing that you would recognize on your first time through and would remember by the time the event that was being foreshadowed occurs.",1372118400,,596,4.5327102803738315

1543138,5,B00005JNOG,"Great writing, plot and characters are the keys to this opening season of the ABC series ""Lost"".
The story is simple enough.... a plane (Oceanic Flight 851) bound from Sydney, Australia  to Los Angeles, California runs into problems, goes off course and crash lands. There are some survivors....some are injured severely, some with little physical problems. They must learn to work together as a community to work toward essentials t o continue to live, and hopefully be rescued.

Over the course of the season, the backgrounds of one of the characters who survived is featured each week...and how they wound up on the flight plays into the story.",1371945600,,647,4.981481481481482

-Some episodes just drag out way too long. Above average written show, but I've seen much better.

-The characters are interesting but I started to grow tired of some of the character's, especially sawyer, hes funny at first but it gets old quick. I also can't stand how much everyone lies.

As the show progresses they never explain anything, and it just gets dumb.",1371945600,,672,4.929203539823009

1543333,5,B00005JNOG,"This review is for Lost Season 1. Lost is an amazing television series that I didn't get to experience until now. Back When Lost first came out I was a freshman in high school this show was never on my radar. It wasn't until after going to college and becoming a mature young adult that I learned to appreciate the contents portrayed in this show. Back then in 2004-2005 we did not have an HDTV either to experience the quality filming put into this series. Thanks to Amazon prime video on demand I decided to start watching Lost since the full series is on here and in HD! Now back to the show itself, Lost is extremely well paced and you will want to keep watching to see what happens next. The actors portray the characters extremely well! everyone! especially Jack, Kate, Charlie, Locke, and Sawyer. The mysterious Island is beautiful and exotic. (turns out to be filmed in Hawaii so no wonder!) Every main character's back story is portrayed in flashbacks so you get a sense of where they are coming from to see how they became who they are. All I can say is wow! I wish I had seen the show earlier but it's going to be the perfect show to tackle this Summer!",1370476800,,1164,4.368663594470046

1543337,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is simply amazing.
I first heard about this show in 2010 sadly the last season was airing on tv.
Thankfully it was on netflix and I watched the fist season in a few days, and i was blown away.
Now 3 years after watching it for the first time I have watched the complete series 4 times.
Every time you watch it you will learn more and more about everything. The first time watching the show you will learn the basics about the story, but the story is so complex and has so many hidden things you need to watch it more than once to fully understand it.
The cast members are great. Every single one you will connect with and all have great back stories.
This is one of these shows that everyone needs to watch, and it will and has changed tv shows for ever.",1370304000,,759,4.135135135135135

Now I can watch them on my own schedule!

I have only watched 6 episodes so far, but the acting is great and there is just enough mystery each episode to keep you wondering what will happen next.

A pleasant and entertaining series thus far.",1370217600,,371,4.271428571428571

While there are 100 episodes and will take a time investment, totally worth it.  I was convinced during much of the original airing that the writers randomly threw events into each episode without any forethought, I'm more convinced how cleverly they tie episodes into later seasons.  You'll grow feel like you really know some of the characters and will be very sad to end the 100th episode, knowing you can't look forward to anything further from the series.",1369785600,,573,4.777777777777778

1543910,4,B00005JNOG,"The premise is what made Lost interesting.  The characters kept the loose story going, but in later years I'm not sure if the writers had a coherent direction.  Still, something about this series that draws your attentiion.",1366329600,,223,5.0
1543911,5,B00005JNOG,"This show is so good that it is nearly impossible not to just watch it straight thru beginning to end. Heart stopping at times, and always on the edge of our seats.
 Lost is one that my whole family, including 10 year old daughter and 13 year old son, can watch together. We can not wait to watch the rest of this series of 6 seasons!",1366329600,,334,4.0606060606060606

1543976,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is definitely one of the best series out there.  It gets a bit convoluted towards the end of the series and obscure, but all of its strengths as a series outweigh the weaknesses.  It will make you laugh, cry, and angry.  It will make you feel like the characters are long ""lost"" friends.  It's a must see and I love owning it.",1366156800,,331,4.2063492063492065

1543978,5,B00005JNOG,"Mystery Island, definitely not fantasy island.. People being captured, people being swallowed alive, seeing dead people. The flashback as to how they all ended up on the airplane together and how they were all somehow connected in someway or another..  I didn't know about the 1st season til after the season had ended and heard from all my other sci fi buddies what a great show it was and that I needed to watch it so that I can follow along with season 2, and they were right. I was hooked right from the Pilot episode of season 1.  It really pulls you in and you can relate to so many parts of all of their lives and past mistakes, etc,
In someways, I was dreading the inevitable, when the program would eventually have to end ""Season 6"". Could the last episode been in alittle better yes, but was I disappointed no.;... It reminded me of Star Trek Voyager. After 7 years of being hooked and then boom they are home back in the alpha quadrant and then nothing! No follow up as to what happens to the crew their home comings, the relationships, etc;,Sorry to bring this up here, but anyone who was into lost I assume was a Trek fan as well...

Lost is in a special class of great shows. The characters are excellent, and there are a lot of characters to love and hate. Twists and turns keep you guessing and when you think you know what's next, they hit you with a curve ball. I enjoy Lost even more on my Kindle. No commercials and in HD. Win, win.

1544044,5,B00005JNOG,What I like the most about this series is how they worked very hard to mesh stories together to make for some seriously blatant surprises. This is a good show. People you know and are comfortable with suddenly get shot and die. Or live. Scheming and back stabbing are the norm. The big plot is pretty big. And the bottom line of Lost is beyond most all reasoning. If nothing else this show will keep you on your toes.,1365638400,,417,4.291139240506329
1544045,5,B00005JNOG,"i remember one day, a friend told me to watch this new show that had just came out called LOST, it was very cool and was produced by JJ Abrams, and with music from Michael Giacchino, which btw his cousin is a good friend of mine, anyways as i watched the pilot i couldn't stop watching it i kept rewinding it and re watch it it. The plot made sense, the characters are written so good, i got so into this show that once it was over i started to marathon it again, and still as today when there is nothing on tv, which recently is more often, i pop one disk or two and watch it...

1544158,1,B00005JNOG,"This was a very fast project sold to a television network and was cast before the scripts were written or the framework for the series developed.  You could tell that some episodes were very poorly thought out.  In the first disc I figured out what was actually happening and the answer to the ""mystery"". It really wasn't a thriller and you could tell that the story was being written and changed as it went along.  I cannot see how it could have been a hit or could have run for six seasons.  In the special features on the disc, the young writers seemed to be very impressed with themselves and the series but surprised that it ran more than one season--or was picked up by a network.  I agree with the previous reviewers who panned this series--it cannot hold a candle to the excellent series of ""24"", ""Homeland"" or ""Person of Interest""--thrillers with very good writing and script development.  I resold Season 1 of ""Lost"" half-way through the discs--it was a huge disappointment to me.  It is not worth the time invested in watching the episodes.",1364774400,4,1051,4.618279569892473

Of honor.  How can you just start something and not finish it?  Besides, I needed to know what the heck everyone else was talking about.  Time travel?  Going back to the island?  Aren't they still on the damn thing? Why was everyone so mad about the ending?  So I kept watching.

Like 24, I don't know how people watched this on regular television because I don't think I could have waited a week for the next episode, nor could I have sat through commercial breaks waiting to see what happens next. It's a fun ride, and I'm looking forward to seeing how everything is resolved. Sure it's a little unbelievable in some respects: everyone manages to stay ""groomed"" after over a month on an island, and the women magically have some color on their lips, and no one has gotten sunburned, but there are enough twists and turns to keep you coming back for more.",1363478400,,700,4.392307692307693

1544404,3,B00005JNOG,I find the lack of story and meandering character development to be a bit tedious.  Most of the show is backstory and interpersonal drama.  The plot seems to go no where and the only thing to keep people interested is the slight hints at some darker purpose to the island.  I just wish the plot would move forward to drive character development instead of in-fighting being the plot device.  I find the idea interesting and most of the characters to be likeable as long as they stay true to their character which rarely happens or they just end up dead after creating an entire reason to like them and a role on the island.  It works as a show I can throw on while I do other things but I wouldn't want to actually just sit and watch it.,1363305600,,737,4.273381294964029

This was a series we didn't have room to store on our expensive DirecTV DVR and subscription in our primary residence when it aired.  Sorry we missed it then, but glad it is on Prime for us for free now!

The best parts of the story are the backstory elements, where you learn more about the essence of each character.  Not an ordinary survival drama in this respect. There are also extra- natural elements threading through the storyline.  I am interested in seeing how this develops in episodes ahead.

Prior to that I had watched West Wing, which I hadn't seen in it's original run and thought that may have been the best, most creative, intelligent TV series ever. Now that I've watched Lost once again, it is hands down the best show ever. The cast, plot, creativity, ability to keep you interested from episode to episode is by far superior to anything else ever produced.

1544568,5,B00005JNOG,My friends kept telling me to watch this. In the begining I did not believe I would like it because the episode previews I saw made it seem as though there were supernatural forces in the show. I am almost done with season two at this point and I find myself talking to the TV telling the cast what to do at points. I feel like I am right there with them at times.,1362614400,,364,3.9324324324324325
1544569,5,B00005JNOG,"If you were scanning movie titles, and ran across one named 'Lost on Demon Island', you'd think it was a grade-B movie from 1950's drive-ins, where teen-age California couples sneaked off, to writhe in back seats.  Yet that's what this series is really about:  people enmeshed in a horrific experience with an island that has marked natural and supernatural 'powers' over their lives.  Before and after that experience, the island affects them, drawing them together, keeping them together;  keeping them miserable, when not on it.  Keeping them terrified yet happy, when they are on it.  As if to be happy, one must have terror, too.

Yet this is no grade-B flick.  Far from it.  This series hits you where you live.  Your own life.  Very realistic about the problems of modern life, tied to the age-old problems and conundra we all face.  Epic Greek Drama, but set to our time and day.  To get the most out of it, first watch Season Six Episode 15, then go back to Season One, Episode 1.  The LOST writers kept the story's origin under wraps, until the last season.  If you find it confusing before you get to Season Six again, watch Season Six Episode 9.  Then go back to where you'd left off.  Much of the disinformation about the series in the minds of viewers, is that they don't understand 'the gods trick us to do their bidding' explanation in Series Six Episode 9.  That theme, is the heart of Greek drama.

This is one of the most engrossing series of all time, and whoever at ABC decided it should have only six seasons, should have been fired.  Superb film editing, scripting, ensemble cast, story line -- everything is grade-A++++ through the end of season 4.  Season 5 is sometimes barmy, because it seems rushed, less attention to continuity (=threading subplots).  Season 6 is still good, but way too rushed.  Of course, that could be due to the show's cancellation, so they tried to finish it off.  Ending is somewhat hackneyed, therefore.

Even so, you can make up your own ending.  In fact, that's what the overwhelming majority of viewers have done.  The meaning in the actual episodes and what's said in them, are very different from what viewers say.  So there is a huge amount of disinformation in lostpedia(dot)com and its sibling lost(dot)wikia(dot)com , both of which pretend to be 'encyclopedias' for LOST;  sadly, too much is hallucinated, OPINIONS, not the storyline facts.  Of the two fake 'encyclopedias', wikia is somewhat better, because at least they provide actual storyline information per character in LOST (so long as you just stick with the ABC production characters).

Worse, novels post-LOST as if about LOST have been written;  all of them trite, completely off-the-mark from what the writers of LOST, actually wrote.  So you really need to see the ABC episodes for yourself.

Like Bible's Revelation, the construction of the LOST storyline follows Aristotle's Poetics rules for drama, faithfully.  That's why the series is so good.  But if you don't know how Greek drama is constructed, despite the overwhelmingly obvious hints

* quadrilogy (subdividing an epic drama into four sub-plays, one of which must be a comedy=happy, not haha),
* NOBLE SACRIFICE as the reason for living, always by hero with tragic flaw (which he either overcomes, or does not),
* katharsis (=purifying the soul's emotions through vicarious experience)
* circularity (cardinal rule that drama must center on One Day),
* flashbacks and flashforwards (to explain the epic value of that One Day),
* idea of Time Reset due to Noble Action,
* deus ex machina to save and reward (at the end of the quadrilogy),
* co-existence of science and faith (big theme in Aristotle),
* puny man's action being an 'agent' of the gods,
* even using Greek god names and Olympian plots, Bible names and plots, quotes from The Odyssey --

if you don't know all this classical drama on which all modern drama including LOST is based, then you'll hallucinate meanings which aren't in the show. And that's fine, it's only fiction.  Yet LOST fans are often religious fanatics about their hallucinated meanings.  You can't talk to them, give them storyline facts from the episodes, that contradict their positions.  It's worse than talking to someone about the Bible.

So do this:  JUST WATCH the episodes, don't read anyone's commentary.  Draw your own conclusions.  It's worth your time, to do this.

For if you watch the series over and over; you will always find something new or a new combination of old stuff, to ponder.  Epic question of why are we here, forces of good and evil, the mundane petty silly noble and to-die-for, all in one story.  Which is, the confluence of many stories.  Many lives.  Yours.  Mine.  Ours.

Does the past determine the future, or does the future, determine the past?  What is the nature of time, of cause and effect?  Does life really go on forever?  What about your 'ripple' in the pond of time?  These are the questions, the series explores.  Pity they had to rush the last two seasons in a way to leave so many initial threads (like the one with Walt), unsewn.  More on this is in my first comment to this review (with links of posts I wrote in LostPedia, that give away the plot and purpose of the series).

Enfin, you get the idea of interrelatedness, something like six degrees of separation:  at some point in our lives, one out of six people you do or will know on this planet, does or will know someone who does or will know someone who knows me.  So our lives, greatly affect each other; even if, you and I never know each other.  And above us, there is some grand scheme of things.

Just watch the series.  Like everyone else who does, you'll get 'lost'; and then, maybe find yourself.",1362614400,,5728,4.744421906693712

As the characters are developed, the lives they led prior to the crash are revisited to give some background about them.  I am drawn into the story and the characters as they are explained and it adds interest to the plot.  It does seem as the series continues that the writers are working pretty hard to come up with the next round of adventures.  It is a bit shallow in that when a character is killed, the remaining people usually seem to take little notice and just move right on with the new routine.",1362009600,,681,4.373015873015873

I'm tempted to say the first season was the greatest season of TV in the 21st century. The show has a great ensemble cast and manages to give each of them adequate screen time. It also creates an air of mystery, subtly but effectively. The mystery elements don't overwhelm the character development. While the later seasons go a bit too far out on a limb,

1545128,5,B00005JNOG,I finally decide to purchase the Lost series and was glad I did. I will be purchasing all 6 seasons. Great storyline..,1360108800,,118,4.409090909090909
1545129,5,B00005JNOG,"My family of five started watching LOST on DVD last Nov or Dec (2012) and only one of us had EVER seen Lost before. I never watched it EVER when it was on TV but my husband did (wasn't my husband then) and when we married in 2011 he BEGGED me to watch the LOST seasons with him but I didn't buy into all the hype back when it was on and didn't want to start now.

But I gave it more thought and I decided to go ahead and ""try"" and see if I could ""get through"" the first few episodes before telling him ""well I tried and it's just not that good"". Well, I was WRONG!!!! I could not believe how HOOKED my girls and I got from the very first episode and we still are! We cannot get enough of LOST. My 17 year old loves it and my 13 year old is absolutely obsessed with it!! She even started watching it from the very first episode ALL OVER AGAIN during times we aren't watching where we currently are at!! She's on Season 3 on her ""own time"" while we all watch it together.

We have watched Season 1-5 now with last night being the finale of season 5. We are VERY sad that season 6 is upon us already and will be very sad when we're all caught up and we're done. I bought season 3-6 on Amazon and I am SOOO glad I did!! I HOPE you will watch every single episode of LOST and give it a chance. We think it is the BEST show we have EVER seen!!

Heck, I even dream about it pretty much every night. The only thing I don't like is that there aren't enough episodes in season 5 and 6!!!! I cannot recommend LOST highly enough! There just isn't enough ""stars"" available to rate this show!!! You will fall in LOVE with the characters (we LOVE to list our favorite characters IN ORDER and discuss why and what's going on during each episode), LOVE the plot, LOVE the scenery, LOVE the humor!!! LOVE the whole CONCEPT of the show and LOVE LOVE LOVE being engrossed in it!!!!! Thank God we can pause the Blu Ray player because we always have to pause it and go ""no way!!! what!?!"" and discuss what is going on!! It is SOOOO exciting!!!!!!",1359849600,,2024,4.055
1545130,5,B00005JNOG,"The season showed up as expected in perfect condition. That being said, the content of the disks is certainly worth it. Even if you weren't a fan of every storyline, or every character, the series was good. You can't take that away from it. As such, I'm glad that I can add it to my library.",1359331200,,291,4.214285714285714

1545132,3,B00005JNOG,"I admit it.  I watched none of the Lost series when it was on television.  I kept hearing that it was a fascinating show.  Okay, now the DVDs are out.  I finished season 1, and now I am starting season 2.

A plane crashes on an apparently deserted island (North Shore, Oahu).  The survivors are an eclectic bunch, all imperfect in some way, and as the season professes, you learn the stories of these survivors prior to getting on this plane.  There is a lot of running through the forest, of getting mad and punching and each other, and of foraging alliances.  The island proves to have a number of mysteries, and the survivors learn that they are not alone.

What would you do if you crashed on an island?  Well, this group never seems put together a search party to go around the island (you would soon discover if there is civilization or not).  They let people ""steal"" or accumulate material from the crash site.  They just don't seem to behave in ways that are reasonable given their situation.

But, of course, the island has a number of mysteries, from ""the Others"" to a hidden hatch to a... well, I can't go into detail, because discovery is what Lost is about.

So it is okay, but I'm really hoping it picks up in season 2.  Otherwise, this is as far as I will get.",1358640000,2,1275,4.365957446808511

1545135,3,B00005JNOG,"the show started really well, no doubt the best opening ever. the characters were fully developed, by the time you finish all six seasons you will feel like you be living with them on the island. you will feel what they have gone thru or will go thru throughout the end. As i said before the characters were fully developed, you will see their past, present and the future. you will see the hard work they put into the show. Enough about positive talk. I didn't like the take on S6. By season 6 there were many loop holes in the series, and the writer forgot about what the series has been all about. there were many new characters in season 6; they were not properly introduced, plus i was hoping for better ending. Overall the show is blast i will rate this show 3.6 out of 5",1357948800,,777,4.256756756756757

1545212,5,B00005JNOG,"2 years after the show has been off the air I still find myself getting new friends into the show and rewatching all the DVDS on my own.
This show is so intricate that it requires at least 3 thorough viewings to get the full picture and clarity. Each time I find new things that surprise me, amuse me and keep me coming back for more.
Each season DVD features amazing special features that are supplementary and interesting to any fan.
I am going to keep this short and sweet because everyone before me did a fantastic job of expanding on the episodes and the characters. If you are bored, interested or Lost in your own life this is the show to entertain you, and include you in the epic mysterious, action-packed, friendship driven, spiritual journey that is Lost.
Lost has something for everyone-- which makes it so diverse and intriguing to a wide-range audience. Do yourself a favor and give into the hype-- you won't be sorry.",1355961600,,932,4.553571428571429

1545297,3,B00005JNOG,"I loved the first season and I think I liked the second one too. Who knows.. I watched it so long ago on Netflix I'm gonna have to go back and watch them again. I know I found myself fast forwarding through a lot of the other seasons and I didn't really care for the last season at all. I do not think this is the greatest show ever like some people say but I'm glad people found something they love. We each love our own shows. I watch way better shows than this one.. that being said it was a great idea and may just get the first season not any of the others since I can get the blu rays free on Disney with my rewards. And Hurley rocks!!! I love him. He's the best character on the show! Hated all the flashbacks and going back and forth. I fell out over the same reasons with Heroes on Netflix. Couldn't wait to get it finished. I hate when things start out so good and then they just go into weird back and forth junk.

1545505,5,B00005JNOG,"Having just watched the first season for the first time, I can't agree with those who think it's the best TV show ever, but it's certainly enjoyable and far better than most of what passes for entertainment on commercial television. I like the ensemble cast and the ability it creates to tell a variety of stories as the backgrounds of various survivors are revealed. The episodes are a bit uneven, but for the most part they are intelligent and creative. The overall story, the cement that holds it all together, is intriguing. I'm a little worried that the explanation for the island will turn out to be supernatural -- that seems foreshadowed by all the talk of fate and destiny -- but enough of the episodes are exciting and touching and unexpected that I'm more than willing to move on to season 2.

The acting is generally excellent. Initially I thought that Matthew Fox, playing Jack, was a bit wooden, but he grew on me as the season progressed. One measure of the quality of the acting (and writing) is that my favorite character kept changing from episode to episode. Most of the featured characters have greater depth than television writers usually manage. While the island's mysterious threat creates tension, the story's drama is rooted in the way the characters interact with each other and, in the process, learn about themselves. The writers wrote some real emotion into these stories, usually without becoming cheesy.",1338163200,2,1435,4.881147540983607

There is no other series that can fill that void now.  I have yet to find another series that is as dynamic and enthralling as ""Lost"".  Some have come close (like The Walking Dead and Flashforward) but I still get disappointed at most because they're just not as good.  I wish they would make another season or at least a spinoff... <sigh>",1337299200,,471,4.571428571428571

1545585,4,B00005JNOG,"Lost is a solid show.  The first season is easily the best.  They develop the characters slowly and intricately, and the show is really mostly about human interaction in close confines.  It is an excellent premise for a series.  The downside of Lost is that the seasons deteriorate each year.  The second season is still good, but not as good, and after that, they just get worse.  If you are OK with the diminishing returns on your time investment, go for it.  Otherwise, steer clear.",1328745600,,485,4.635294117647059
1545586,5,B00005JNOG,"I felt compelled to buy season 1 of Lost at a Thrift Store, where I had to spend x-amount of money in order to use my debit card (I rarely carry cash).  I'd never seen the show on TV but figured it was worth the meagre price to check it out.  I'm just finishing the season and I'm good and hooked!  What a great show!  Sure it's a little predictable sometimes but the characters are great and the story line (at least in season 1) is pretty engaging.  I'm really glad I took the chance and will now endeavor to find season 2!",1328572800,,525,4.058252427184466
1545587,5,B00005JNOG,"I could string together a long line of adjectives to describe how brilliant the first Season of LOST truly is but even then justice wouldn't be done.

Never before has a TV show had the production values of a feature film in every episode, the talented ensemble cast that vaults the show from the sea of mediocrity known as network tv, and the sheer intrigue of this mysterious island to give the a show a depth that very few have ever had before. Because watching LOST truly transcends the screen; once you start to attach to the many excellent characters, watching their trials and tribulations on this, at times claustrophobic, at times vast and desolate but ALWAYS intriguing island becomes something of a religious experience.

The character development is relentless, each episode powerfully reveals the backstory and possible motives for each character's actions on the island, while the first real connection you're likely to draw is that almost everyone suffered in some way. This show has a way of humanizing even the most derelict or seemingly outcast characters, and just as Jack says in one of the early episodes ""everyone deserves a fresh start here.""

But all the best character development in the world could only take the show so far, fortunately this show goes FAR BEYOND ""interesting people crash on an island, fight the impulses to devolve into primal anarchy, ""live together, or die alone,"" and into this complicated web of mythology and paranormal phenomenon that constantly causes the viewer to go, ""What!?"" and then pulls you, faster and faster down the rabbit hole.

I could go on and on about just how great and what a tremendous impact this show will have on the viewer, for all the reasons above and many more, but my best advice is to watch this show for yourself and see first hand why this could be one of the greatest television shows of all time. Season 1 was arguably one of the best seasons and will grip you in ways you never thought possible for television. LOST is long off the air, but hardly forgotten.",1328400000,,2042,4.776203966005665
1545588,4,B00005JNOG,"I love this show and the characters are well developed. My favorite is Hurley, because he's a funny guy. We find out that the people on this Island are not alone.",1328313600,,162,4.258064516129032
1545589,5,B00005JNOG,I really don't like to watch too much TV. We stumbled upon LOST on our Roku and we were immediately hooked.  I remember it being the subject of many lunchroom debates at work but like I said I never watched it when it was on TV. Now that we have the luxury of the Roku and Amazon Prime. It's was just so different from what is on TV that we all liked watching the suspense unfold and being able to watch the next episode right away if we pleased.  We can't wait to watch all the seasons.  You love and hate the characters in the show and we enjoy the suspense on finding out things about the enchanted island.  Some episodes are uneventful but all in all its the only show we keep coming back to watch.,1328227200,,702,4.102189781021898
1545590,2,B00005JNOG,"As for the product, the DVDs arrangement and extras are fine. Concerning the show, I wasn't impressed and lost interest rather quickly. Fortunately, I was able to borrow the first season from the local library and the only thing lost was some time. I could only get the first five DVDs of this 7-disc set since five was the maximum that could be obtained at a time. I reluctantly borrowed the final two DVDs (one with episodes; one with bonus features) today and I gave it a shot. A couple of the episodes in the season were okay, but it's not enough.

I didn't really care about any of the characters and it was just rather silly to me. I think it's important in a drama show to get the feeling that the actors are 'hiding' that they are acting. With this one, everyone seemed so fake and over-blown, hamming it up for the camera. Too many emotions seemed fake.

Maybe the rest of the seasons were better, but I couldn't get into it. If I had watched this on TV, I know I would have been curious for the first 3-4 episodes. While watching this season over a couple days, it never became anything where I felt I was hooked and had to know what happened next. I never really cared and there wasn't enough to even get me to remember the previous episode (even though I was watching them all in a row). I didn't like the flashbacks all the time, yet I guess that was necessary to learn about the characters. The scenery was the best part of the series.

What got me 'mad' right in the first episode: nobody even talked about the plane crash! I kept waiting to see what I thought would be the first thing on people's minds. What the heck caused the disaster and why didn't anybody seem to care? It seemed like it was handled as a common event in the survivor's lives. ""Well, it's just one of those days. The plane crashed, so let's just make ourselves at home. Can anybody help me wipe myself with one of this leaves?""

I read about the rest of the series, learned about the final episode, and didn't care. I'm glad I wasn't one of the people who got hooked when it was airing, only to end up seeing a crappy letdown with questions and no real answers. Of course, some people think it ended fine but I would have hated it. I have no interest in seeing any other episodes.

Too bad I was fooled with the recent ""FlashForward"" -- a show I was hooked on that had a terrible final episode for a series in which it was promised that it wouldn't end that way. At least it wasn't on as long, though. ""Quantum Leap"" was another classic I liked that ended terribly. 1995-1996's ""Nowhere Man"" remains my favourite show ever and, even though it had some silly episodes and the ending was not a completely satisfying finale, it was surely a better ending then QL or FF and, from what I've learned, would have eclipsed this show's as well.",1327363200,3,2822,4.32703213610586

Now that it's January and there's nothing to do but stay inside and wait for spring, I thought I'd start watching my DVD.  I'm about halfway through and couldn't believe how much of the lst season I had forgotten. Obviously, I remembered basically how the storyline started, but some episodes felt like I was watching for the first time.  The DVD quality is outstanding and really shines through in some of the sweeping beach scenes and especially the beautiful mountain settings in Hawaii.  It makes me miss the series so much and I think I would like to order Seasons 2-5 too.  I already have 1 & 6.

Nobody can deny that Oahu Hawaii is an island paradise but I think the screenwriting for this series is too shallow and dysfunctional.  The plot flits and undulates with a shallow orchestration.  Too many cheesy and modernized takes on pop culture seem to bog down this schizophrenic, and brain-damaged weekly video hopelessness.  It may be paradise but it surely is paradise LOST.

If you choose to waste your time on this series feature, you will have too many attempts to overthrow a simple faith in God to withstand at one time, such as the lie that death is not dying, Catholic faith constitutes true Christianity, romantic relationships with multiple partners is a good thing.  This series represents everything that is wrong with our world and none seem to be speaking up about it.  It is addictive, but definitely in a bad and morally-depraved mode.

I think the first season is my favorite season in this series. It is just amazing, it is the perfect blend of action, drama, science fiction and horror, the series have the ability to captivate the audience, it draws you into it's world and make you sit on the edge of your eat glued to the TV.

Most of you that read this review have probably already seen the series or at least know what it is about, but if you do not then let me tell you the basic premise of the plot. A plane crashes on an unknown, mysterious island and the few dozen survivors have to try to find a way to make it on the island until they are rescued. Soon strange and paranormal things starts to happen, however this is all presented in a so subtle way that it is hard to know what is really going on. The episodes all belong to one huge storyline that spend the length of the entire series, however each episode also have a theme. The episodes is divided half between life on the island and half between backflashes to the lives of the various characters before the crash, the main character changes with each episode.

Lost is a series that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of audiences, allot of it is drama as the survivors form friendships, love affairs and make enemies, but a part of it is also science fiction or horror. When I was trying to describe the show to my fience I told him that Lost played like Survivor meets Call of Cthulhu or to make another comparison along the same lines, it is like Survivor meets The Twilight Zone.

Lost have a huge cast of characters and they are all nicely fleshed out, as the season progresses one get to care about these people, they are all flawed but also have redeeming factors just like real people. The actors really do a good job with this one. The picture quality is great and the show is filmed in beautiful locations, the music is pretty good to. Lost moves very slowly and this is both it's strength and it's weakness, you are left wondering through the entire series so this is not a show for you if your are impatient, however if you like your science fiction presented in a leisurely manner with subtle hints and plots withing plots storylines then Lost is right for you.

Season 1 of Lost is a great first season to a fantastic show. I have watched it several times and I find something new to enjoy every time. This is a quality box set that I think most people no matter their tastes in films and TV series can enjoy.

I'll keep it short, the sixth season is ridiculous, the ending makes the entire show pointless and will really bum out anyone who actually gets this show or might ever want to rewatch it 1 or 5 times. Just accept that most of your questions will never be anwesered and don't let it get you down, stop watching after the fifth season, act like the sixth didn't exist and enjoy pondering for evermore, don't let darlton spoil what was a great show.

Update - here I sit 8 years later having finally set aside the time to complete a full rewatch of LOST. Simply put, it is quite an amazing thing how time & the experiences of ones life can affect & change your perspective on things. I never thought I'd be back adding to this post, as you can see I was quite set back then in my ways & opinion. However, simply put I now after all this time have accumulated the clarity to understand the creators intentions and meaning behind the finality of the show, and I must admit I have been left quite satisfied with how it all turned out in retrospect. Perhaps it was the week to week viewing experience and constant  build up while I first watched the show compared to the binge nature I found myself consuming it in all these years later. But it was a treat to not be able to remember every storyline and get to really suspend disbelief as I delved back into the rich blend of character backstories and mysteries. I'm now ok with not having every thing answered, because I'm different now and can say it meant more to me how everything and everyone ended up, and I'm now able to leave the show, although still slightly wanting more but content with the investment and payoff.

Now, in my opinion Lost is one of those once in a lifetime shows that will never come around again. Lost has a beginning and an ending, but to fully enjoy Lost you need to own and watch all of the seasons sequentially. They are all great seasons. While I do like some seasons better than others, I find them all an intricate piece of the overall puzzle that is Lost. In order my choices for seasons are:

Season 1
Season 2
Season 3
Season 5
Season 6
Season 4  I believe the writers strike really messed this season up.

*****Spoiler Alert *******

Lost is a story about a group of people who crash land on an island. They soon discover this is not just any island, there are ""Others"" living on the island. There are various life forms living there that should not be able to live there such as a smoke monster(explained in season six), a huge polar bear etc. The island has certain properties as well, such as women who become pregnant do not live to full term, there are also hatches on the island from a former group called ""The Dharma Initiative."" These inhabitants were killed off by ""The leader of The Others."" (Explained in season 3) When it becomes apparent that rescue is not coming to the survivors thing really start to heat up on the island. Eventually some of the survivors do manage to get off of the island (season 5) during which time the rest end up back in time (yes the island can move through time)and find a way to work in the Dharma Initiative. When those who had been off the island find a way back, all hell breaks loose. I won't tell you how it ends for a number of reasons, but I will say that I was very happy and disappointed in the ending. The ending had answered most of my questions satisfactorily only to leave me feeling a bit empty about the whole series.

*****End Spoiler Alert******
If you want to be hooked on a great series buy the whole series and enjoy. I personally could not watch each episode fast enough once I started. I found every excuse to watch show after show. I cannot remember the last time I had felt this way about a TV show. I only wish there had been more of Lost to watch.

Seeing this first season now, I can recognize that it had promise even that first year: the creative staff knew how to create evening soap opera and the director and cast had the talent, overall, to put their ideas into convincing performances. That is not to say that anyone was challenging Sir Lawrence Olivier's pre-eminence as master of the English speaking stage, but mostly the strength was where it was needed. I have no ideas what troubles were devised in the remaining years, but these refugees from civilization stranded on an island, sure had plenty of nicely suspenseful ones. Seeing the season without commercial breaks, without delay of a week between episodes, puts a production to a very tough test it was not devised to surmount. The breaks are built into the structure of each program. However, the production bore up well. Obviously, there is a family resemblance inevitably built in to make the show somewhat like other good (and bad) stranded on an island stories, but rarely does the material seem stale.
I can commend the show to any television viewer who likes to immerse him-or her-self in the challenges to life that that a threatened community must face.",1284595200,,1431,4.844897959183673

The first season border on the ridiculous, this in no ways represents some stranded individuals on a isolated island.

First issue is the setting, the fauna is nothing more than corn, if one looks at the supposed jungle setting you'll see corn in the early stages of growth.

Second issue, a phantom father, this is just dumb, WHY!!!, there is so much more which can be done with the plot, why include this.

Third issue, after so many days they are still sun bathing, ok, I'm crashed and sunbathing supersedes food and water.

Fourth issue, second disc after a number of days they expect you to believe some are actually still alive and swimming in the ocean, ok, just bad.

This series does not even come close to something I would consider realistic.

Other than the obvious there is no plot, cohesiveness does not exist, not what one would expect given the situation.

I would have watched sooner, but by the time I wanted to jump on the bandwagon, a lot of my friends jumped off, ""It was great for a while, then it just got weird"" they'd say. But now, with the final season upon us, and with my hearing that answers will be/have been given, I jumped on the fated Lost plane. Thus, this review will be in the context of a first-time viewer starting from the beginning, so forgive me if these facts are later changed, resolved, or otherwise not true in later seasons.

Highlight Episodes:
Pilot
Walkabout
All The Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues
Hearts & Minds
Deus Ex Machina

From the opening moments of death-dog, Vincent waking up our fateful hero, then finding out that a plane has crashed on an island, and the ensuing chaos that follows, Lost comes up with one of the best pilots in TV history. It's absolutely mesmerizing for anybody that watches it. How could you not become a fan after watching this? The beach scene not only has some great special effects, but the tension and feeling of terror on the beach is just so well-done. In fact, this scene is so iconic, every show like it that has come afterwards has tried to come up with their own version of this scene. Guess what, they all fail. What may seem like a simple scene, is actually an encapsulation of all that makes Lost a great show, at least in the first season.

Another aspect of Lost that the show does so well, is that while it's most known for its story, it's characters hold the show together, and it's mostly what makes the characters so good. It's so hard to get to know so many people since it's an ensemble cast, but by the end of the season, you get a good sense of most/all of the characters, their motivations, and what brought them to the island.

Jack is the reluctant leader who was told all of his life that he didn't have what it takes to be a hero (He's also the first of many characters we learn that has MAJOR daddy issues). Sawyer is the local conman, unlikable maybe, but he gives clever nicknames, so he can't be all bad. Locke is the local philosopher, always the wiser, he struggles with issues of faith. Sayid is the local Iraqi torturer. Hurley is the comical fat guy with a heart of gold and a harsh unlucky streak. Jin & Sun are the local Koreans that are surrounded by emotional and linguistic barriers. Charlie is the local drug-addicted former rockstar that finds a new addiction in the pregnant/sweet/cute Claire. Boone & Shannon are the high-class step-brother & sister that slept together. Michael & Walt are a father & son that struggle to build their relationship. And even though Kate is often criticized for being the worst character/actress, she's a tragic type who's built by circumstances, and only suffers because she's the least likable out of the whole cast.

To build out and flesh out that big of a cast in only 25 episodes is an amazing accomplishment to me, especially since a lot of it comes in the form of well-placed flashbacks. And again, in this season at least, Lost puts its characters above its story. Sure, it may string you along with a few mysteries, Lost Season 1 was all about the characters. This is where Lost succeeds, and for me at least, makes it such a compelling watch.

Overall, it's a must that you at least try the show out at least thought the pilot, and probably through episode 4 or 5. If you're not satisfied by this point, then you'll probably never be satisfied, and if you continue and make it through the whole season and you still don't like it, then just drop it. This is the best that Lost has offered so far, and to me, it's a TV gem.

Also, if you've already seen this season, after you've seen the whole show, I hear it's equally comelling and facinating the 2nd time around. Which is always great when a show stands up to, and even benefits from repeat viewings.",1266710400,,4006,4.442176870748299

1546026,5,B00005JNOG,"Ranking up there with great movies, Lost has redefined the scope and quality of what you can do with a live-action television series and is easily one of the best tv smashes of all time.  The viewing experience is enhanced greatly through the boxed sets as opposed to watching an hour a week on the regular broadcasts - widescreen high-definition shows uninterrupted by commercials, with the ability to watch several episodes in a night, and, if you wish, an entire season in a relatively short span.  And at a price like this (listed at just $16.99 as I'm writing this), this is just too good a value to pass up for anyone who doesn't own the sets yet.  Note: the 'rewatch' quality of Lost is a lot higher than with a lot of other cases, as seeing earlier episodes with the hindsight of knowing how those early events tie into later developments, just makes for a great experience.  If you haven't started the Lost series, or have only seen sporadic episodes, it's much better to start off from the beginning and see everything in order than just jumping right into where the tv show is at now.  That would be kind of like starting an epic novel at page 700 and trying to figure out what's going on.

  The basic premise of Lost is well-known by now and simple: a commercial airliner crashlands on an uncharted tropical island and the survivors have to try and carry on, keep themselves alive until rescue comes or try to find a way off the island themselves.  How the story actually unfolds, of course, is anything but simple.  The first, double-length episode is a perfect example.  For almost its whole running time, it focuses as if it were, in fact, just that simple: the survivors, confused, afraid, and sometimes injured, try to survive in the immediate wake of the crash, with chaos reigning and the plane wreckage still aflame.  People have to come together very quickly.  It's only after things have settled down, that night, at the very end of the pilot episode, that the first real sign comes to the survivors and the viewers that things aren't as cut and dried as they might seem, with the classic view of what happens off in the jungle (which I'm not going to spoil here for anybody who hasn't seen it).

  Also in the first episode, the flashbacks begin to the lives of the various passengers before they boarded the plane.  The continuing flashback usage was seen by some as annoying, and even I initially thought they might be over-using it just a bit, but you realize later on how vital everything is and how it all ties together.  In fact, it may be less accurate to view Lost as a story being told, with the help of a lot of flashbacks; than to view it as a story that's being told in more than one time frame simultaneously.  I'd seen this technique used in comic books and some movies (it's since become more prevalent in movies than it was) but I don't know if any ongoing tv series had ever tried to do this before Lost.

  Few of the passengers know each other before the crash, and the initial episodes focus a lot on the early day-to-day survival, the early forming of friendships, sometimes the seeds of relationships, and in some cases rivalries and enmities.  Some of the characters come into this with volatile personalities (yes, that includes Sawyer), others (like Jack and Hurley) ty in different ways to act as the glue that will hold the fledging group together, some (like Kate and Sayid) have secret pasts that will figure into things after a while, and some, most notably John Locke, quickly come up with their own, sometimes way off-the-beaten-path, ideas of what the group's priorities and long-term goals should be.

  Clues begin coming that make it more evident that things aren't as simple as a plane accidentally coming down on an uncharted island.  For starters, it quickly becomes apparant that the island is awfully Large for something that's supposedly not on any map.  Things happen that would seem to indicate that the survivors aren't the only ones on the island, and other things seem strangely out of place, even unnatural.  The first seeds of the idea that it isn't coincidence that this particular group of strangers has come to be on this island at this time, are planted, as Locke comes up with a lot of ideas concerning fate.  And the season continues on to a spectacular cliffhanger season finale, which will become the standard with the show.  Lost looks and feels like an extra-long big budget movie, but one of the well-written, well-executed big budget movies, not a movie with high budget but low in other factors.  One of the most skillful things about the overall series is how some seemingly minor incident will happen, and only much later (sometimes several seasons later) be revealed as tying into other events in a big way.

  Lost got me to re-asses television shows as a whole.  I don't watch a lot of tv programming as opposed to the number of DVDs I watch, but Lost opened me up to the idea that there might be some good stuff on there I was missing.  I like the boxed sets of series better than seeing the regular broadcasts with their commercials and with there often being several weeks between episodes.  Renting disc one of a series and then buying the box set if disc one was good enough seems like a good way to go about it.  But even as I've become more familiar with some of what's been on tv, and enjoy some of it a lot, there are still relatively few programs past or present that can come close to Lost.  This is up there among my favorite movies, or favorite stories from any other medium (comics, novels, etc.).  Very highly reccommended.",1265932800,,5629,4.594594594594595
1546027,5,B00005JNOG,"I can't believe I never watched this when it was on t.v. but I was under the impression it was a reality show which I detest. When I read the write up about it by accident, I decided to watch it. It is astonishing. Usually I can't sit still for one little movie, but I am sitting through this watching nearly an entire season in two days. That is 24 episodes! When I think I really should get back to work or do something besides sitting in front of the t.v., I watch another episode which leaves a cliffhanger and I have to watch it.

There's a lot of mystery and usually 2 or 3 plots are going at the same time. The actors may have been rather unknown before this show but I bet they are known now. I know I have looked every one of them up. There's also a lot of supernatural events which keep you enthralled. And the question of whether this group ended up together due to fate or coincidence is always there.

You have to watch the show carefully because when they show flashbacks from these people's lives, you will see someone else from the island in nearly every one of them. They may have just been a casual passerby in the background but usually someone is always in someone else's flashback, even though the one having the flashback never really notices them. It's odd and makes you start wondering why. Also the flashbacks lets them bring in guest stars that they wouldn't be able to do if they just did island scenes. You'll see some surprising guest stars...like Peg  from Married with Children to name just one.

It appears most of these people were ""bad"" people with little redeeming features, some were murderers or killed someone by accident, or some other misfit of society. But they are now saving other's lives and appear entirely human. You start wondering if they are part of some experiment, why some of the ones who appear to be ""good"" get killed off of if they are all just dreaming. The show keeps coming up with a plot that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat.

I am so glad now that I didn't watch these on t.v. from the beginning because I would never have been able to wait week by week to see what happened next. It's all I can do to continue through the seasons I have on disc now and not watch the new and last season of this show on t.v.

If you can't afford to buy the series then rent it or watch it online thru amazon video on demand or one of the other places. It's worth your time if you love mysteries, science fiction, romance, suspense. It is filmed in Hawaii and the views are spectacular (although they can be scary when black smoke is chasing one of the inhabitants around or uprooting trees left and right).",1265500800,2,2662,4.324649298597194

1546030,5,B00005JNOG,"When Oceanic Flight 815 from Australia to Los Angeles wrecks in the middle of nowhere, the survivors find themselves stranded on a deserted island in the middle of the ocean. Led by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), a doctor back home, the survivors fend for themselves looking for shelter, hunting for food, and having to find clean water while trying to get the word out that there are survivors of the devastating crash. But when unexplainable events occur, including polar bear attacks, the new residents of the island begin to ponder the meaning of their existence on the island. Furthermore, they may not be alone.

I'm just a little late jumping on the Lost bandwagon, partially by choice. After missing the first few episodes due to scheduling conflicts, and hearing that missing an episode would cause you to be, for lack of a better word, lost in the series, I figured I would hold off until they were further into the series before picking up the DVD's to check it out. As time went on Lost became a ""water cooler sensation"" and I wanted to dive in, but with the love/hate relationship people had with the series slowly unravelling it's mysteries making it pertinent that you not miss a single episode, I thought it would be better to wait till near the end of the series to start the first season. So here I am. The sixth and final season starts on February 2, 2010 and I just finished season 1. Was it worth the wait?

Absolutely! With Lost, JJ Abrams and his team of producers and writers have created a fresh and intriguing story with characters that feel real with real arcs. Each episode focuses on an issue on the island while also focusing on a specific character's past. Even though each episode follows this patter it never feels gimmicky and allows the writers to further flesh out the characters in an interesting and inventive way, while also giving story arcs that will further flesh out the world and mythology of Lost in seasons to come.

A lot has been made of how Lost keeps piling on mysteries while slowly solving them, if at all. After watching the first season you can definitely see the seeds of this starting to bloom, but since the first season is an introduction to the characters and their predicament, mysteries are part of the territory. Still, for better in my opinion, as the writers let you in on one secret another two or three in most cases are bound to pop up. Since this process always feels organic rather than feeling like a gimmick to keep ratings up, it keeps the viewer intrigued in the story while making the viewing experience more interactive as you try to figure out the mysteries on your own.

The acting in this show is top notch, probably one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen for television next to Battlestar Galactica and this season's Flash Forward. With a cast that includes Naveen Andrews (Grindhouse: Planet Terror), Matthew Fox (Party of Five), Daniel Dae Kim (Crash), Evangeline Lilly (The Hurt Locker), and Dominic Monaghan (Lord of the Rings) they found a cast that more than excels at the challenge of bringing this story and these characters to life. Of all the great actors on this show, the one that really stuck out for me though is Terry O'Quinn (Primal Fear, Tombstone, The Rocketeer). As John Locke, O'Quinn really makes you feel every tick of this character, and with a character like Locke, who starts off making you wonder about his secrets and his allegiances that's not an easy task. As the season carries on you see him bring out the psychological and emotional scars buried beneath the confident exterior of the character.

If you haven't checked out Lost I highly recommend that you jump on this wagon. The first season is a brilliant ride that will keep you guessing and engrossed in the characters. Since I've started the first season I've had a hard time putting the series down to do or watch anything else. I can't wait to get started on the second season now!

I even plugged in a memory card stick to see if it will save my profile but it didn't.  So the SEASON PLAY is annoying.  It just doesn't remember you and it asks you ever time you press play an episode ""Would you like to play this using SEASON PLAY?""  Annoying.

Third complaint is no booklet for the episode guide.  That's an important missing feature on ALL of these Blu-ray Lost discs that is not included on any of the seasons.

1546116,5,B00005JNOG,"It is not too much to say that ""Lost, Season One"" is an astonishing television event.  Somehow this series manages to avoid all of the pitfalls that usually lead to the downfall of a television series.  The acting is first-rate and the storylines are engrossing and vibrant.  This is an imaginative show that constitutes first-rate entertainment.

The theme is simple yet subtle.  A plane headed from Sydney Australia to Los Angeles USA goes off-course and crashes on an uninhabited island in the Pacific.  There are 41 survivors.  There are many strange things about the island, to put it mildly, and these anomalies become increasingly apparent as the story unfolds. (The most obvious anomaly is that it becomes apparent very shortly that there is little prospect of rescue.)  Further, there are connections between the passengers that most of them were unaware of.  The use of flashbacks concerning each of the principal characters is brilliantly done, and this often misused device is devastatingly effective here and serves to weave the story together.  The overall effect is a series that is incredibly absorbing and addictive.  The basic theme of the story, subtly recurring is ""Don't tell me what I can't do...!""

The acting is first rate.  Matthew Fox as Dr. Jack Sheppard is particularly good, but many of the others are also superb.  Naveen Andrews as Sayid is an especial favorite of mine, as are Harold Perrineau as Michael and Evangeline Lilly as Kate.  Every viewer will have his or her own favorites. As the series progressed I found myself liking Jorge Garcia as ""Hurley"" more and more.

The first season is my favorite just because there is so much mystery. Nothing is known of these characters when they crash, but you quickly bond with them and began to understand what makes them tick. There are flashbacks in every episode that helps fill in the backstory of each character. The island is a mystery that you and the survivors attempt to figure out. There are tons of plot twists and mysteries to keep you on the edge of your seat. LOST is filled with mystery, drama, comedy, and suspense. There are tons of characters that help develope the plot. As they try to investigate the island you attempt to figure them out. LOST is the best show on TV. The writting never stops to amaze and shock you. The cast never misses a beat either. They are on top of their game at all times. If you haven't seen LOST pick this blu ray up today you won't be disappointed. This show stabs you in the jugular and doesn't let go.

Also the blu ray looks amazing. LOST is shot digitally and is the best looking show on Blu Ray. I had the first season prior to this on DVD, and I still am going to pick up the entire series on Blu Ray next year. This is a great series that has the best writting staff and cast on TV.

1546184,5,B00005JNOG,"I've gotten through the season and I'm impressed about this tale about 48 survivors (only about 10 are lead ones) who survive a plane crash and try to make it through a mysterious Island with what looks like a huge creature who is just waiting to gobble them up whole. Mix in some boars and polar bears, a mysterious french woman (I KNOW I SEEN HER BEFORE!!!--I JUST FORGET WHERE FROM!! I WAS REWINDING IT SEVERAL TIMES TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND I STILL DON'T REMEMBER...GRRRR..), some weird black mist, a mysterious hatch, among others and then somehow managed to mash it into a hit. After the first couple of episodes, I was hooked.

I would rather have them not that french woman in the series (even though she playes a part), it kinda ruined the mystery behind her. The only thing I can say that is a little bit off (not bad, mind you) is the music after the episode is over. Sometimes it dosn't mesh well (like with the episodes in which is a more ""feel-good"" type). I admit, the 2nd pilot ending (the transmission realization), and the ""whispers"" ending SCARED THE CRAP OUTTA ME!!! I loved those endings to the episodes. Those are the ones in which I HAD to watch the next one in place of something else such as sleeping, eating, etc.

I need to see what happens to a ""certain characters"" and I got to see what's the mystery behind the hatch and the big beast that no one seems to see (or the producers keep teasing us by angling the camera a different way...grrrr)

1546186,1,B00005JNOG,"I really wanted to like this show.  My favorite series of the past few years (""The Shield"" and ""The Wire"") had ended, and I wanted a new show to enjoy and get hooked on.  I knew ""Lost"" was already several years old by that point, but I figured I could start from the beginning with the DVDs and get caught up quickly.

However, this show stinks so bad, I am having a hard time getting the smell out of my DVD player.

This show is overwrought melodrama, and is full of manufactured tension and forced dialogue and situations.  The premise is fine (and even interesting), but the dozens of little moments used to fill the time between plot developments are ridiculously melodramatic.  The show doesn't have to be realistic, but there needs to be some verisimilitude -- the actions, dialogue, etc of the characters need to be grounded in reality and naturalism (even in a surreal or fantastical context) or else it looks cartoonish.

Watching this show has helped me become a master at physical multi-tasking:  I can now yawn and roll my eyes at the same time.  I never saw the show until August of 2009.  My boss recommended it to me (we were both huge fans of ""The Shield"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"", so I was willing to accept his recommendation).  I rented Season 1 of ""Lost"" from Netflix and somehow managed to watch almost the entire season without wanting to slit my wrists from boredom or having my eyes roll permanently into the back of their sockets.  It wasn't easy to get through the season, that's for sure.  It was quite the endurance contest.  The most notable reaction I had to this show (other than intellectual agony) was when I ran, and I mean RAN, to my computer to delete the rest of the season's discs from my Netflix queue.

The premise was interesting, but that's where the fun ended.  I accept the fact that this is a network television show, and for that reason this show will feature an inordinate number of attractive young actors playing stock characters and that there will be an ethnically diverse cast of characters that somehow feels ""forced"" (Handsome young male lead?  Check.  Add a few impossibly beautiful young women?  Check.  Black guy?  Check.  Asian characters?  Check.  Chubby comic relief?  Check.  Dangerous rebel?  Check.  ....You get the point).  If it seems like the network had a checklist for the stock characters and ethnicities they wanted represented so as to widen the show's appeal, well it did.  That's how network TV works.  That's how network execs think.

Next ingredient:  make it eerie but not too complicated.  Don't make it cerebral, but make it LOOK and FEEL like it is cerebral.

Make the post-plane crash behavior as unrealistic as possible.  The survivors are at first without a decent supply of food, water, shelter, adequate medical care, etc, but they go about their business like calm sheep, only pausing to stare in wonder whenever they hear a strange animal growl or trees moving.  Even then, they only react when the camera pans to them.  It's kind of a ""rolling acknowledgement"" - each one of them on the beach hears the sounds at the same time, but their reactions are in ""staggered time"".  Apparently it is important on a television drama for the camera to capture the startled reactions of each and every character, no matter how much time it takes, whenever something startling occurs.  It looks so hokey and cliche and REHEARSED that you'd swear Steven Spielberg himself had shot it.

By the way, the plane wreckage and debris looked totally unrealistic.  It looked like the debris was simply placed on the beach.  I didn't see any tell-tale signs of a large object having a violent crash landing and/or coming to a stop.  A plane crash (even just a downed fuselage and two engines) leaves a HECK of a lot more physical damage to the surrounding area than what we see in ""Lost"".  But that would be expensive to design and would spoil the beauty of the scenery.

Maybe I'm nitpicking.  Maybe my expectations are too high.  But details and verisimilitude are important.  If the network wants me to invest a significant amount of time in that show, then they should invest more time and effort into paying attention to details.  A cool premise will carry a show only so far.  The premise and plot don't have to be absolutely realistic, but the everyday elements of the natural world (Laws of Physics, patterns of human behavior in desperate situations, etc) should be grounded in reality, even within the context of a fantasy show.  Otherwise, this might as well be ""Gilligan's Island"" or a Saturday morning cartoon. I said that already, but it bears repeating.

By the way, at the beginning of the pilot episode where Matthew Fox's character ""Jack"" awakens in a field of tall grass that completely surrounds him, how did he know which way to run?  How did the dog get out of the carrier he was presumably in?  Isn't it convenient that their luggage arrived with them and intact when the rest of the plane was essentially blown to bits?  How come a grown man got sucked into the engine but nothing else nearby of considerably lighter weight even rustled in the suction breeze?  And why does J.J. Abrams seem to think that using one of the most overused cliches in drama (having a young pregnant woman go into labor or have labor pains at the most inopportune moment) does NOT look downright silly?  He did it here, and he did it again in his ""Star Trek"" movie.  It's old and tired and it should be beneath him.  But apparently it's not.  Maybe the pregnancy has a dramatic payoff later in the season, maybe it doesn't.  That's not the point.  The point is that it is an overused cliche and stock character to suffer through while we're waiting to see IF there is a payoff. Maybe some of these questions get addressed YEARS later in future seasons, but those are bad elements to hinge a plot line on.  It's like asking someone to listen to a singer's 11 terrible CD's because the last track on the 12th one is supposed to be good enough to make up for the rest.

I just don't get it.  I don't see how so many people are so enamored of this show.  It is a cool premise executed in the laziest way imaginable.

If ""Lost"" was the first and only dramatic series I'd ever seen, I'd probably think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  But the bar has been set very high recently by shows like ""The Wire"", for example, and now any other show that doesn't even attempt to match it for quality just looks all the worse for not trying.  Not that ""Lost"" and ""The Wire"" are the same type of show.  That's for damn sure.  But ""The Wire"" has shown how great episodic drama can be.  It is character-driven, not gimmick-driven.  ""Lost"" is, first and foremost, gimmick-driven.  Americans love ""gimmick TV"".  No surprise that this show has become successful.  Even the fans who complain that the show moves too slowly and that nothing really ever happens still rave about the show as if it were the best thing ever on TV.  They give it an unconditional pass.  That's too bad.

I somehow made it almost all the way through Season One of this show.  I was hoping to enjoy it, but I just couldn't see past all the weaknesses and laziness in the directing, writing, logic, and production design.  This show was a soap opera gone ""high-concept"", that's all.  When a soap opera aspires to be greater than it is, when it tries to reach the heights of great drama or a great thriller, it usually just comes off looking silly.  That's ""Lost"" in a nutshell.

I have no desire to see any future seasons and I can't recommend this show to any of my friends who insist on a minimum standard of literary or narrative excellence.  This show has often been compared to ""Lord of the Flies"".  Hardly.  ""LOTF"" explored man's dark and primitive nature.  ""Lost"" is too superficial to tackle that theme with any seriousness.

The show is abysmally bad.

Did you know that the idea for this show was dreamed up by a network exec at ABC?  He thought the premise would make for a cool series, so he hired various folks to write it for him.  The series was greenlit on the basis of the concept alone.  Too bad the so-called ""creative talent"" behind the show couldn't make it work any better than they did.

This show was about as big a mistake as a trouble married couple deciding to have a baby to ""save their marriage"".

The ONLY thing Season 1 is good for is as a drinking game.  Every time you see a scene where someone in either the foreground or background is folding clothes from a piece of luggage, drink a shot.  Actually, it might even help you enjoy the show more.  I'd probably have to be drunk to watch more of this crapfest anyway.

This show in some ways disappoints me the same way the Star Wars prequel ""The Phantom Menace"" did.  As in ""Phantom Menace"", ""Lost"" doesn't have nearly enough plot to sustain its running time.  As a result, the show's flaws take center stage when there is nothing else interesting going on on-screen.  Watching this show, you can never forget you are listening to scripted dialogue.  There is almost nothing natural about their conversations.  Every word sounds like it is being spoken for dramatic effect.

....  You know what?  It makes my head hurt to even discuss this show.  I'm still not sure if I genuinely hate the show or if I merely resent the writers and directors for being so lazy and for paying so little attention to the small moments.  This show is FULL of small moments.  When they are weak and silly, it paints the whole show with that brush.

This show might have worked better as a 2-hour TV movie.  It would have been narratively tighter and more effective, maybe like one of the better ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.  But it is stretched too thin and can't sustain itself on a moment-to-moment basis without resorting to trying to squeeze a high amount dramatic tension from very minor events.  It just looks silly.  What a waste of a good premise.

Funny thing is, this first season won an Emmy for Best Dramatic Series and then in subsequent seasons was criticized for being slow and boring.  I thought Season One was about as slow and boring as a show could get.  I can't really imagine how unbearable the subsequent seasons must have been.

Like anyone else, I've been either disinterested in or disappointed by any number of shows over the years.  In those cases, I'd just shrug my shoulders and never tune into them again.  But ""Lost"" is the first show I've absolutely resented for being as poor as it is, and I will NEVER understand why people are/were so fascinated by it.

*************************

I hear they are making ""Lost"" action figures now.  You wind them up, set them down, and they sit there for three seasons before doing anything.",1249776000,26,10753,4.5883280757097795
1546187,5,B00005JNOG,"I started watching the second season on LOST on TV a longer time ago but realized soon that in order to keep track and fully appreciate the show, it seemed better to postpone any further LOST watching until Season One and Two became available on Blu-ray (i.e. HD) and watch the show in chronological order (a wise decision as it has turned out to be).

This is a unique, mesmerizing TV show with a special appeal to adult (i.e. mid-life) audiences, which among others draws inspiration from works like MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, SURVIVOR, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, THE PRISONER, various works of Stephen King and elements and clues that are reminiscent of better video games.

That LOST's main creators, J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, picked supporting actors from the BABYLON 5 universe, MATRIX:RELOADED and LORD OF THE RINGS, suggested to me on a subconscious level to have faith in this TV show, which has not been disappointed. On the contrary my early expectations in regard to LOST exceeded far beyond what I thought I could possibly expect.

LOST achieves the seemingly impossible task of combining gritty reality with enchanting mystery. Just as in real-life and with friends and people we come to meet, we get to learn more and more about the characters through the means of flashbacks which eventually either turns us away from a character or establishes a bond through sympathy. Sensitive audiences may have difficulties with various scenes, especially during the first two seasons, but I felt it to be obvious that these were not intended to attract audiences hungry for blood and gore but to add to the realism (my wife had a hard time with the graphic, medical surgeries - especially in the pilot episodes - but I told her she should consider it a desensitization attempt of her fears, enabling her to provide first aid after a traffic accident...).
And instead of graphically showing the dangers and 'monsters' of the island of LOST, the creators cleverly opted to address the spectators' own imagination instead (as it usually turns out to be more frightening what we do NOT see).

The characters are three-dimensional, the (final) choice of actors is excellent and dialogues range from very good to simply outstanding. If there was any complaint I were asked to mention, it would be that I felt the romance triangle between Jack, Kate and Sawyer at times to be rather immature and not totally convincing (just my two cents). On the other hand LOST takes a firm stand against racial prejudice, with the Iraqi character of Sayid Jarrah beeing portrayed as one of the most common-sense, repentant survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 (my wife is of Christian Arab origin, she was positively shocked, because that was the last thing she would have expected from an American TV show). Through the Korean couple Sun-Hwa Kwon and her husband Jin-Soo Kwon, LOST also provides us with insights into Asian culture.

While the aforementioned elements contribute to make LOST a unique, interesting and entertaining TV show, I feel the most remarkable and outstanding characteristic is the enormous range and diversity in the way the show explores ethical, philosophical and spiritual issues (with my personal highlight being a witty, verbal punch John - faith - delivers in a short dialogue with Jack - science - in the last episode of Season One).

It seems some audiences have criticized LOST for the amount of 'puzzle pieces' the creators add on a regular basis while still beeing in the process of putting the early 'puzzle pieces' together, thus creating confusion and disorientation. Having now watched Seasons One through Three in a moderate 'marathon', my wife and I can't share this criticism.
On the contrary I hope that J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof will resist the urge to put the entire puzzle together because that'll be be like putting a lid on the show which might be counter-productive to LOST becoming a timeless cult classic (in my humble opinion some loose ends will rather contribute to keep audiences busy to continue using their own imagination and interpretation as it is and has been with Patrick McGoohan's THE PRISONER).
However, my wife found those LOST episodes confusing, that entered the realm of THE TWILIGHT ZONE where all of us were invited to deal with different scenarios of what this was all about (Hurley, Desmond and at the end of the third season Naomi, making a stirring claim which didn't seem improbable, given previous events and hints...). Ever since TOTAL RECALL and THE MATRIX, I, on the other hand, have cherished such an occasional ""mindf..."" and felt these episodes rather to be contributing to the diversity of LOST, than being a distraction.

Looking forward to the second part of the story of LOST (i.e. Season Four through Six), I feel it is safe to suggest that among the ""100 things to do before you die"" watching this TV show ranks among the top positions. This show is asking important questions - and invites each and everyone of us to answer these questions in regard to our own, individual personal lifes. This not just another TV show, it is a profound experience.",1249603200,,5119,4.917824074074074
1546188,5,B00005JNOG,"I think that when the final season of Lost wraps up in May 2010, the show will end up being viewed more as a full body of work to be revisted and immersed in again and again than as a series of individual seasons.  It's going to be an example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.  Much like the Lord of the Rings films and the Harry Potter books, Lost is going to be one complete viewing experience.  I don't know many other shows in the history of the medium that can say that.  Viewed individually, each season has its flaws, but as a whole, this is going to be a series for the ages.

Season 1, which earned the show an emmy as best dramatic series, is probably the most popular of the series' run.  It sets up the plot:  a group of strangers survive a plane crash and must figure out how to survive on a tropical island.  But right from the start, it's clear that this isn't going to be a mere rehash of Lord of the Flies, Robinson Crusoe, Castaway, etc., although elements of those works are certainly present.  There is a mysterious monster running amok in the jungle, a polar bear attacks the castaways and a distress call from an unknown French woman which has been playing continuously for 16 years is discovered.  As Charlie says, ""Guys, where are we?"".

A good question, indeed.  The first season slowly builds on this mystery.  As the episodes unfold we learn that the island is inhabited by mysterious ""others"", the French woman who created the distress signal is located, a mysterious metal hatch is found in the jungle and a series of cryptic numbers come into play.  Oh, and at least one miracle occurs there.  Confused?  You haven't seen anything yet.

But don't worry.  Lost isn't just some elaborate puzzle box.  It can be enjoyed in various ways.  It is an engrossing action/adventure story, a rich character study, an examination of the themes of destiny and redemption and a head scratching mystery.  The show also rewards repeated viewings since pop culture references and other clues which may point to the show's ultimate destination are scattered throughout.

Season 1 focuses largely on fleshing out the major characters:  Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley, Locke, Sun, Jin, Syaid, etc.  Each has secrets and, ultimately, a reason for being on the island that they don't fully understand.  Flashbacks fill in the details of their past lives leading up to the fateful crash.

Think of season one as the opening chapter.  The introduction to a novel as it were.  But be patient.  The show, just like the island, is not going to reveal its secrets until it's good and ready.  In the meantime, enjoy the ride.  We may never see anything like this again.",1248912000,2,2686,4.591578947368421

So when season 1 finally came out on blu-ray I decided to get started on this series and man, oh man am I glad I did.  I'm also extremely pleased I had the patience to wait.  Not only is this show beautiful on blu-ray, but I don't think I could take waiting 6 months to a year to start watching season 2.  This show now ranks at number 2 on my favorite all-time show list right behind the Sopranos, and right above Breaking Bad.  There are 25 episodes in total and I finished season 1 in about a week.  This show leaves you hanging so much I was so glad I could just skip to the next show and start watching.  I was watching about 4 shows a night.  The only negative thing I can say about it is I wasn't getting enough sleep at night and going to work extremely tired because I just had to see what would happen next.  Almost every episode I would say this is my last one then I'm going to bed, but as soon as it ended I would start right up on the next one.  It also has an awesome season play feature.  Which means you can stop watching at any time, even take out the disc, then put it back in later and start watching from the exact same spot.  Pretty cool.  So if your like me and never watched Lost when it came on t.v. you picked a great time to start.  There is enough time to pick up seasons 1-5 on blu-ray then to start watching the season finale when it starts which I think is in January 2010.

If you already own the DVD's it's still worth picking up the blu-ray because you get a $20 dollar mail in rebate with it for having already purchased the DVDs.

1546266,5,B00005JNOG,"I think I must be the only person on the planet who has not seen all of what has been broadcast of ""Lost"".  I caught on to the show just prior to the start of the Second Season when I ordered the First Season on DVD with the intention of starting a regular viewing of the program.  I got about half way through it, then just stopped watching (other things came up and I just never continued watching).  My wife and oldest daughter are COMPLETELY hooked on the show, and they bought subsequent seasons on DVD; so it's been sitting there, waiting for me all this time.

Cut to earlier in the week when I received all 4 Seasons of Lost on Blu Ray as an early Father's Day gift from the family.  I started watching this Season on Thursday Evening, and wrapped it up last night.  The only thing I kept saying to myself was, ""What was I THINKING not watching this?""

Absolutely SUPERB picture quality and sound make this a MUST buy.  The beauty of the island is enhanced by the Blu Ray, and as someone already mentioned, the audio makes a lot of use of the rear surround speakers for the ambiance of the island.  The writing is BRILLIANT, and the acting is truly awesome as the layers of each character's past are slowly revealed throughout the series.  Subtle hints of the plot line are sprinkled throughout each episode, making it very much like a puzzle to be pieced together...with some of these hints and plot devices pay off in subsequent episodes, while others remain unresolved (presumably for future Seasons).  NOTHING is what it seems, and even the obvious has hidden meaning. I sat through all five seasons of ""Babylon 5"", and ""Lost"" is similar in the way it takes a plot and turns it back on itself; creating one huge mystery to be solved.  at no time are you ahead of these characters on their journey; you are a PART of the journey itself.

""Lost"" will keep you on the edge of your seat with every episode.  It is truly a remarkable piece of television, and Blu Ray is the ultimate medium in which to watch this fantastic program.  The Extras are a great addition and just icing on the cake, allowing you to catch your breath after you've gone through the whole series (at least once).  I cannot recommend the show and these discs highly enough. Surely, this will be repeated viewing for me in the future; and like ""Babylon 5"", I expect I will notice things that were right in front of me that pay off down the line.

If you love great writing, acting, and photography along with mind-blowing audio...then these Blu Rays will not disappoint.  If you're thinking about an upgrade...don't go any further...add this to your cart.  Trust me, you cannot go wrong.",1245542400,,2666,4.4937759336099585
1546267,5,B00005JNOG,"In a TV era where most network offerings are intellectually insulting and virtually worthless, there is at least one bright shining star - the series ""Lost"".  I am one who shuns the major networks, but I admit that ""Lost"" is one show I cannot miss.

Season One sets the table for the sensational 5 seasons that follow, and it does so in absolutely gripping dramatic fashion.  Season One captures you from the moment Jack, the central character, opens his eyes and finds himself ""lost"" on an island after what should be a fatal plane-crash.  There are about 40-some survivors in all, and season one introduces all the main characters in unique fashion.  Each episode focuses on one central character using flashbacks to illustrate key past moments in the characters life.  The flashbacks reveal the background and personality of the character as well as important (and sometimes mysterious) events which placed him/her on the doomed plane.  As the season progresses one nail-biting episode at a time, one comes to realize the passengers have a more in common than just being random passengers in a plane. And this is but one of the many mysteries to solve on the island of ""Lost"".

It is apparent from the first episode that the island they find themselves on somehow has a mysterious ""life-force"" of its own, which impacts each of the characters in turn.  Each episode pushes the plot forward a bit, and we discover there are ""others"" on the island, and they are not friendly to the crash survivors.  What are they doing on the island, what it their purpose in being there?  The mysteries grow as the season progresses, and while partial answers are found, the tantilizing fullness of the mysteries remain unsolved.

The writers have created amazingly ""real"" personalities in their main characters, so true to life, each with a complex personal history, each with moral and ethical dilemmas, each with personality faults. And it is these rich characterizations that drive the show forward episode after episode.  The direction is superb, with plots that build with each episode, usually ending in a climactic finish that leaves you literally begging for more.  The episodes are like ""Lays"" potato chips - it is tough to just take one.  I found myself watching several in a sitting - the tension and mystery was too great to stop.

You cannot go wrong purchasing a used (or new) copy of ""Lost"", watching all the episodes, and then perhaps reselling it and buying the next season, which trust me, you will do.  ""Lost"" will sink its teeth into you and hold you in a building tension unlike any other series I have ever watched.  It is truly superb TV.

1546270,5,B00005JNOG,"""LOST"" the series that took America by storm in 2004 and has since been a fan favorite today.

In 2004, the series was hyped as the latest series from J.J. Abrams who was known for his TV series ""Felicity"" and ""Alias""  and joined by a talented team which includes executive producer and writer Damon Lindelof (""Crossing Jordan""), executive producer and writer Carlton Cuse (""Nash Bridges"", ""The Adventures of Brisco County Jr."") , writer Jeffrey Lieber, producer Ra'uf Glasgow (""The Big Easy"" and ""Profiler""), Jack Bender (""Eight is Enough"" and ""Beverly Hills 90210'), Bryan Burke (""Alias"") and Jean Higgins (""CSI: Miami"") .

The series debuted on ABC in Sept. 2004 and was instantly a critically acclaimed hit as people all over the Internet would discuss and debate the circumstances of the show.  Series creators would plant Easter Eggs on the TV series, on the Internet, on commercial trailers and eventually people were drawn in by the well-written dramatic thriller and sci-fi storyline, wonderful acting but the overall signs of conspiracy and mystery.  The series would inspire many blogs, podcasts and so much hype that around 17-20 million people were drawn to the series each night a new episode aired.

The series won an Emmy Award for ""Outstanding Drama Series"" and series creator J.J. Abrams was award an Emmy in September 2005.  The series also won the Writers Guild of America Awards for ""Outstanding Achievement in Writing for a Dramatic Television Series"", 2005 Producer Guild Awards for ""Best Production"" and the 2005 Director's Guild Award for ""Best Direction of a Dramatic Television Program"" and the ""Screen Actors Guild Awards 2005' for Best Ensemble Cast.

""LOST"" Season 1 makes its first entry to Blu-ray and similar to both Season 3 and Season 4, the Blu-ray's allow for ""SeasonPlay"" that allows people to watch as they go and can stop, restart where they last left off.  ""SeasonPlay"" is optional and people can select it before watching an episode.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""LOST""  is a series that looks incredible on High Definition.  Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly.  The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean.  Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and ""LOST"" is no exception.  There is grain that can be seen in each episode and I have to admit that the quality is not up to par as ""LOST - THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON"" (not sure if they are using better equipment in the later seasons) but the picture quality is still pretty good.

There is little compression artifacts that can be seen in low light conditions but overall, the picture quality of ""LOST"" is not perfect but still looks gorgeous!  I compared both my DVD box set to this Blu-ray set and the picture quality in High Definition shows off detail that I never caught on DVD.  From the plane wreckage to the orange dimples on the orange peel in John Locke's mouth.  These can be seen quite clearly on Blu-ray.

As for the audio, ""LOST"" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle.  The explosions of the plane is caught all around you and you are literally immersed into the destruction of the plane as audio is heard on the front channels, surrounds, rear surrounds and through the LFE of your subwoofer.  Very nice!

Also, I loved how music and sounds really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome.  So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!

JUDGMENT CALL:

When the first season of ""LOST"" was on television, I was instantly hooked.  I was on the main forums every week, downloaded every ""LOST"" podcast available, read the magazines and just pretty much got drawn in by the story but the various theories that people had about the island, the characters and more. In fact, I have owned the first season on DVD, listened to the audio books and even owned the pilot on UMD.  That's how hooked I was to this show.

Personally, I just found that mystique of crash landing in an island and having to survive to be quite exciting but even moreso, finding out that there are some weird things going on in the island that makes you wonder if what we were watching is actually happening or are the people actually dead.  There were so many unusual things that have happened and ""LOST"" was what was needed on network TV.

Also, as much as ""LOST"" would seem like a wreck with so many characters featured, the way the show is presented through various flashbacks of each of the main characters, the writers really focused on character development and making the viewer feel positive (or negative) about a certain character and learn about their behavior and a past that somehow each character has some kind of connection with each other.

There were so many amazing episodes, one such episode that will always be a favorite was the first death of one of the main 14.  What a shocker! What was equally amazing was watching the season finale and I can remember being shocked and having to go back and forth on my DVR and then later on my DVD copies to see these ""secrets"" that fans have caught in the final episode.  Nevertheless, that finale was awesome and left myself and many fans highly anticipating the second season.

The first season of course leaves the viewer with plenty of questions (and we're currently awaiting season 6 and many questions still exist today) but it was those questions that help fuel the fire to various theories that many fans could not help but take part of.  It was quite fun to see how this series captured the attention of so many people and how the producers, writers and even the talent were so surprised of the various theories themselves.

I have to say that watching the first season of ""LOST"" on High Definition five years later is quite amazing.  The series is absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray and  was also impressed by the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack.  And it was great to see all the special features on the DVD included (although I wonder if all Easter Eggs are also included on the Blu-ray since I've only found a very few so far).

Fans who enjoy the ""LOST"" series will truly want to own the series on High Definition.  If you are a big fan of the show, it is pretty much a no-brainer to pick up both Season 1 and 2 (as well as the previously released Season 3 and 4) on Blu-ray.  This season is what started it all and with the final sixth season coming soon, you can't help but be happy that all four seasons are now available on Blu-ray.

""LOST - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!",1245110400,55,16377,4.6483746941628805
1546271,5,B00005JNOG,"Hopes were not terribly high for ""Lost,"" the action-drama about a planeful of castaways lost on a tropical island. ""Gilligan's Island"" all over again? Not quite. This mysterious show rapidly turned itself into a runaway hit. Mystery, drama, the supernatural and horror seep into this series, turning it into one of the most intriguing shows on television.

The series opens with a wrecked plane on a beach, surrounded by panicking people who manage to escape the wreckage. Jack (Matthew Fox) manages to group the refugees into a makeshift camp on the shore -- but soon they hear strange noises and see palm trees being trampled by a gargantuan monster. And when he ventures into the jungle, with the mysterious Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and junkie rocker Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), they find the still-living pilot. The pilot reveals that they are hundreds of miles off course, and no one will be able to find him. Then he gets eaten by an unseen monster.

Now the island is occupied by a motley band, including a strange warrior-sage with a knife-throwing knack, a traumatized con man, a pregnant girl whose baby holds a secret, a secretive Korean couple, a snobby rich girl and her exasperated brother, an Iraqi ex-soldier, and a ""dude""-talking chubby guy who has a dark secret of his own. Despite Jack's best efforts, the group splits into two camps, and tensions grow between them.

And there are even worse things coming -- the survivors are not the only ones on the island. A possibly crazy Frenchwoman (Mira Furlan) is hiding somewhere in the jungle, and the murderous ""Ethan"" kidnaps and nearly kills two of the survivors. The island itself has mysteries -- mysterious monsters, voices in the woods, radio towers, a metal hatch in the jungle ground, and a string of numbers that bring madness and ill fortune...

Yes, it's a weird show. But in the midst of shallow sitcoms and endless reality TV, it's refreshing to see a twisty-turny show like this one. J.J. Adams, best known for ""Alias,"" outdoes his first hit TV show with something totally different. The best way to describe it is as ""Swiss Family Robinson,"" as written by Stephen King.

The gorgeous Hawaiian landscape is a contrast for such a dark storyline. Adams never reveals everything, which keeps up the suspense -- the mysterious monster (a dinosaur?) is only briefly seen by the characters, and nobody knows exactly what it is. Nor are we sure who has been there, or what is up with the island. Adams keeps viewers guessing by slowly peeling away the layers.

What's really interesting is that ""Lost"" is truly an ensemble show -- Adams gives every character a chance to shine, and flashbacks reveal what makes them tick. Some, like ex-con Kate, are a bit more mysterious than others, but some like the Korean marrieds and the haunted, smart-alecky Sawyer get a lot more dimension and humanity.

Matthew Fox is given a lot of attention, and he is a good actor. But it's the secondary actors that really catch your attention: Dominic Monaghan gives a simply amazing performance as Charlie, especially when Charlie goes through withdrawal, Jorge Garcia is equally good at comedy (""Dude, that was a Jedi moment!"") and drama, and Terry O'Quinn is stellar as the enigmatic cubicle-worker-turned-jungle-warrior. Evangeline Lilly gives the debut performance of a lifetime, as tormented criminal Kate.

The blu-ray edition amps up the visual effects, especially in the jungle and with special effects. And the blu-ray basically has the same ol' extras -- episode commentary, behind-the-scenes footage, making-of stuff, bloopers, deleted scenes, extra flashbacks, and so on and so forth.

""Lost"" is a well-written, well-acted show that brings a bit of mystery back into prime-time television. Creepy, funny, romantic, tragic and sometimes just weird, it's definitely worth checking out.",1245110400,,3848,5.047244094488189

1546355,4,B00005JNOG,"It is really hard to guage this series on the first season since it has now had four more seasons to develop its stories and characters, and has gained such a devoted following.  However, I for one had a lot of qualms with season one, which struck me as very discordant.

I have a feeling that Abrams and co. had no idea what they were getting into at the start.  What begins as a plane crash on an apparently remote island soon takes on many mysterious tones with a huge ensemble cast not much unlike those old Airport movies from the 70s.  The cast is made up of relative unknowns giving the show the initial feeling of a staged reality show, but the writing has a lot of gaps, and the actors really seem to struggle with their roles in the early going.

But, a core group soon emerges, much to the chagrin of the other ""Lostaways"" such as Arzt, which pretty much carries the action.  Even still it is a pretty big group and doesn't break down easily along the lines of other castaway shows like Gilligan's Island, but I can't help seeing Jack and Kate as the Professor and Mary Ann.

The writers, who earned their chops on such shows as Nash Bridges, Alias, Brisco County Jr. and Six Degrees seem to take elements from near and far when it comes to island movies and TV serials.  One can't help but sense the menacing feel of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island or even H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau, but the threads that develop seem to come more from the 70s, when we were all absorbed with Bermuda triangle theories, alien encounters and supernatural thrillers.  The Island gives them a lush venue to update these themes and keep you going with a number of tantalizing threads.

Unfortunately, the writing stumbles and falters and the situations don't bear up that well under scrutiny.  This show is mostly for effect, not for any deep underlying themes, and seems to be developed pretty much from week to week.  But, take heart, Lostophiles say that the show only gets better with each passing season.  However, I give the first season a B-.",1240099200,,2051,4.510810810810811
1546356,5,B00005JNOG,"(DON'T WORRY, NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.)
I'm a die hard Firefly fan. I think it's the best show ever made. Then one day, Sci Fi Channel started showing Lost starting from episode one. As a result, I've now purchased and viewed every DVD set of Lost. Yes. It's that good. I haven't seen Season 5 yet though (waiting for the DVD). I've been busy catching up on seasons 1-4. I really don't know how one can stand watching this show on TV! I can't watch just one episode per week!!!

About this DVD set in particular, it's awesome. I've seen season 1-4 on DVD on my PlayStation 3. Let me tell you, save your money. Don't think you have to get the Blu-Ray version. The audio and video quality, on my PS3 at least, is so amazing, you would think you're watching HD quality video. So bottom line, if you are worried about price and you have a Blu Ray player or an upconverting DVD player, just get the sets on DVD, they look and sound fantastic.

If you are considering checking out Lost for the first time, just do yourself a favor and buy Season 1 and 2 together, because by the end of season one you will be foaming at the mouth until you see the second season.

That's the worst thing about this show. It's extremely addictive.

1546361,5,B00005JNOG,"The following is pretty much the review that I wrote for LOST Season One when Amazon first solicited reviews for the show as it was about to come out on DVD.  I'm going to post most unedited.  But I wanted to add a bit here.  I have now purchased Seasons Three and Four of LOST on Blu-ray and while the show has always looked good on DVD, it looks nothing short of stunning on Blu-ray.  I've been somewhat disappointed with how some shows turn out on Blu-ray versus regular DVD, even when the latter is view on an Up-Conversion DVD player using an HDMI cable.  The difference in quality is astonishing.  In Season Four, for instance, you can count every single one of John Locke's whiskers or Jeff Fahey's chest hairs on Blu-ray.  What you gain in clarity is breathtaking.  In contrast, I am at the moment rewatching Season One of CHUCK on Blu-ray, and I've been extremely disappointed with the image quality.  It looks good, but nowhere near as good as some of my other Blu-ray TV sets, like LOST, TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, or PUSHING DAISIES (if ever there was a show made to be watched on Blu-ray, it is DAISIES).

My one complaint so far with LOST as with many other Blu-ray sets has been the cost.  This is as clear a case of bilking the public (milking the public) as I've seen in a while.  I'm buying a fair number of Blu-ray sets, but my concern is that it is a media that may not last.  This is partly because the costs of both players and discs are so expensive that sales are not increasing at the rate that they imagined once Blu-ray won the format war.  And with Up-Conversion DVD players, which can cost as little as $50, playing regular DVD players over HDMI cables providing pictures about 95% as good as Blu-ray, many consumers have resisted taking the Blu-ray plunge.  I buy a lot of shows on DVD or Blu-ray, but currently I pick and choose.  Shows I love a lot, like LOST and MAD MEN and PUSHING DAISIES, I buy on Blu-ray.  But most of the others I just get regular DVD (though the show I most want on Blu-ray, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, still is not available in the format).  So, while I will get this and will even pay the exorbitant price to get it, I can't necessarily advise others to do so as well.  Unless the small improvement in visual quality means a lot to you (it does to me), you might just want to stick with your regular DVDs.

OK, here is my original review, from May of 2005.

It is too early to state for certain just how good LOST is compared to the great shows in television history, but by the highest possible standards its first season has to stand out as one of the great seasons in the history of the medium. Season One of LOST was not merely good but great television, and not merely great television but great narrative storytelling. But the impact of LOST goes completely beyond its aesthetic success. Along with another show on ABC (albeit one that I do not care for), DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, LOST has managed to cause the prodigiously stupid television execs to realize that there is a huge demand for quality scripted television. After years of an endless string of simply awful reality shows, all of the networks suddenly want shows that are written ahead of time and feature casts of actual actors. Although final schedules have not yet been announced, it looks as if the 2005-2006 season is going to have both a dramatic decrease in reality shows and an increase in scripted shows. The stunning success of LOST has played a major role in this sea change.

We have in recent years seen genre shows that were huge hits with critics and managed to generate a passionate cult following. Probably no show was more critically praised than BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (with hordes of high brow critics preferring it to more respectable hit series like THE SOPRANOS), but at its peak it managed only a small audience. LOST has generated critical praise almost as strong as BUFFY, a core of fans nearly as passionate, but unlike BUFFY managed absolutely stunning ratings. It is one of the few instances in recent television history where what is arguably the best show on TV also managed among the strongest ratings. In fact, LOST would be considered a cult show based on the number of websites that it has inspired and the passion of the fans, except that the ratings instead make it a mainstream hit.

Who would have thought that a series dealing with plane crash survivors on a most unusual island would have been this successful? Before it debuted I remember people joking that it sounded like GILLIGAN'S ISLAND without the humor. But it ended up matching or surpassing the most optimistic expecations, in quality as well as in ratings. The mention of ratings is not gratuitious. So many superb shows have been cancelled in recent years (FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS, DEAD LIKE ME, ANGEL) that there was even a ""Save LOST"" website started . . . before the show even debuted! Luckily, the ratings have made cancellation seem not only remote but impossible.

It is almost impossible to acknowledge everything that LOST does well in the space allotted here. Above all else, it is a superbly written show, not merely on an episode by episode basis, but in the way all of the episodes mesh with one another. The continuity is the best that I have seen in a long time. For instance, the first time we see one character in the show, she is rubbing her wrist. Later, we learn that she had been a prisoner of a U. S. Marshall and had obviously gotten rid of her handcuffs just before we first met her. Almost any detail like that will be dealt with at a later date. But the scripts are just as strong on character development, humor, excitement, and adventure. I do have a tiny bit of fear about Season Two: former BUFFY and ANGEL writer David Fury, who wrote many of the finest scripts of the year, including ""Walkabout,"" which could very well win Fury an Emmy for best written episode of the year, has left LOST to work this summer on the new FOX series THE INSIDE, before joining 24 as a writer and executive producer.

My initial fear when the show started was that the central cast was perhaps too large, but it turned out to be unjustified, and the great ensemble cast is unquestionably one of the reasons for the show's success.. Yes, there are a lot of characters, and sometimes I wish some were more central than others, but the depth and power of developing the stories of a dozen characters ended up being both unique and exceptionally entertaining. Jack is the titular lead of the show, although show creator J. J. Abrams has confessed that their original idea was to have Jack assume leadership in the first couple of episodes, and then have him die off, forcing the lovely fugitive Kate become the leader for the castaways. But they quickly realized that Matthew Fox's Jack was too valuable a character to toss aside so cavalierly. If there is a second main character, it is Kate, who is performed by a remarkable newcomer, the excruciatingly beautiful Evangeline Lily, who despite virtually no prior experience (I did recently spot her in a very, very tiny role from the first season episode ""Kinetic"" on SMALLVILLE, where her only task is to kiss her supposed boyfriend). One of the most consistently fascinating characters is John Locke, played by Terry O'Quinn, a veteran television actor familiar to anyone who has seen shows like ALIAS, THE X-FILES, MILLENIUM, and THE WEST WING. Although he has always performed marvelously, LOST has made him a star. Every one of the major characters has his or her own set of fans. Naveen Andrews, for instance, a Londoner of Indian descent, has been a big hit playing Sayid, the former Iraqi soldier, as has Jorge Garcia as Hurley, the obese lottery winner who is as unlucky for others as he is lucky himself. And while Dominic Monaghan shared in the enormous success of THE LORD OF THE RINGS playing one of the Hobbits, he has achieved more individual success as Charlie, the heroin-addicted bass player for the fictional band Driveshaft (one hit wonders famed for their song ""You All Everybody""). So rabid are the show's fans that there are websites dedicated to Driveshaft.

Structurally, the narrative shifts between the efforts of the survivors to adapt to and understand the island on which they are marooned and flashbacks that explain the personal history of each character. Some people object to this, wishing instead that they focused exclusively on the events on the island, but I think that this is wrong. If you focused merely on the events on the island, it would be only an adventure story, but through the flashbacks we learn so much about what makes the people tick that the series becomes as much a character study as an adventure. By the end of the season, we get to know the characters so well that we can anticipate how they are going to respond to even the smallest events. We learn very quickly that the island contains a host of mysteries, including invisible monsters whose location and function remain unknown until the end of the season (if we even understand them then), other inhabitants whose intentions seem both sinister and unknown, and a lone insane Frenchwoman named Danielle Rousseau. But there is not much more than we know about the island. Rousseau talks of the Black Rock, but it isn't what we expect when we finally see it. And then there is the metal doorway that Locke discovers in the middle of the jungle. How can it be opened and what lies behind the door? By the end of the season many of the mysteries are explained, but more are left open-ended.

LOST clearly has the potential to be one of the great series in the history of television. The producers are highly ambitious, but so far their execution has matched their aspirations. I read an interview with David Fury before the first episode aired in which he said they had a plot line that runs over several years, so their clearly is a well-conceived storyline. I have only one concern with the show, and that is the executive producer and creator J. J. Abrams. Although he has two prior hit shows, FELICITY and ALIAS, he has had some problems with taking his shows to higher levels. What made BUFFY so extraordinary was that each year they managed to do something new and amazing, even if some fans were disappointed by some directions it headed. But ALIAS has started to disappoint some fans by the fact that it hasn't progressed much beyond what it was in the first season. Instead of doing strikingly new things, Abrams just tends to recycle the same general storyline. And there has not been much of a payoff for all the focus on Ramaldi (for nonfans of ALIAS, a Renaissance genius whose artifacts provide much of the narrative force of the show). Abrams clearly is brilliant at conceiving and initiating great shows, but he has not yet demonstrated that he is a great finisher in the way that Joss Whedon has. I'm forever the optimist, and I believe that Abrams either will come to terms with this or the other creators and executive producers will help LOST get to a place that we will all find satisfying.

Regardless of the future, this nonetheless is one of the most remarkable rookie seasons any television series has ever enjoyed. I'll end with food for thought. THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and FARSCAPE, to name just a few shows, were much better in their second and third seasons than their first. What if two years from now we are able to say the same of LOST?",1236729600,21,11489,4.615874571288584
1546417,5,B00005JNOG,"I'm a little torn on my rating. I know it sounds stupid to give something a 5-Star rating and then mention that you're not sure it's earned it but...well this is Lost and weird things are allowed to happen in its review.
The fact is that I began to view Lost as two different shows.  One in which the survivors of a plane crash struggle to maintain their existence on a jungle island amidst some, frankly, bizarre stuff.  Polar bears attack, smokey blurry monsters obliterate trees and the occasional person and an insane french woman does...well she does insane things.  And I enjoyed that side of things.
On the other side of things we delve, via flashbacks, into the lives of all the main characters, slowly fleshing out who they are and how they wound up on the plane to begin with and what their demons are.  That side of things I found to be utterly exceptional television.  I can't, off the top of my head, think of a single back story that I didn't enjoy.  Some were sad, some were funny, some were heartbreaking, but all of it was great television.
So, how do I reconcile one half of a show which I enjoyed and the other half of a show I found exceptional and wind up still being torn on my review?  Because while the back stories all came together enough to round out the season, the weird island storyline ended in an unbelievably excruciating cliffhanger that really seemed a bit too much for me and resolved absolutely nothing. I'm watching the show on DVD and will have the next season in my hands shortly, but holy cow if I had been watching live I think I might have lost it and not been so appreciative of the teasing nature of the season finale.
I'm all for surprise twists and cliffhangers but this one seemed downright cruel.
So it gets five stars, and I'm very much looking forward to Season 2.  I guess I just feel a little bad for those people who started watching this show live way back when and had to wait an entire summer for the new season.",1236297600,,1969,4.3901098901098905

1546422,5,B00005JNOG,"To me, LOST is the best TV series of the third millennium, so far. Prison Break comes as a closed second and Heroes is closely behind. I am very surprised that TV series can be made this good these days when cost cutting and declining standards seems to be the norm everywhere else. But, not in the world of television, it seems.

LOST employs a cast of dozens to tell a big story. How big the story is? I don't know yet, it seems that we could have another 10 seasons and not come close to an end. But, slowly, what begins as your run of the mill airliner crash survivors story keeps adding layers on top of layers, expands, branches out in unexpected directions and, episode after episode after episodes keeps us mesmerized, guessing, mourning those lost and left behind, surprised, intrigued and always ready for more.

The first season starts a bit slowly and, speaking for myself, I didn't care much for the first couple of episodes. I will not reveal the plot but, it's probably proper to note that you are going to see peoples struggling to overcome extreme circumstances, stories of friendship, solidarity, spontaneous cooperation, the inevitable conflicts between people of many different upbringings, chasing different dreams, sometimes competing for the same rewards. Facing danger, the unknown and, what appears to be, the incomprehensible, the initial state of anarchy spontaneously gains textures and a fragile structure.

The first season is mostly about our heroes' survival and their struggle to go back to what used to be the `normal' life. Scenes of life and struggle on the island are often interrupted by increasingly disturbing flashbacks and puzzling hints that little that's going on is accidental, random or `normal'. The survivors are tied to each other in most surprising ways and, little by little, the supernatural, the mysterious and the plain unbelievable begin to manifest. We learn that the island is not what it seemed to be. There are monsters and unexpected beasts roaming in the woods, there are hints of other inhabitants and the familiar laws of nature don't seem to always apply.

LOST has an incredibly well-written story line, great acting and it's shown to us in the highest quality picture and sound. It is, without a doubt, one of the best TV series I've watched in a long, long time. If you haven't watched the weekly episodes on TV, you should consider yourself lucky. I haven't either and I am glad I didn't have to wait, week after week, for yet another mystery to solve itself in the next episodes.

If, after watching the first season, you felt it was entertainment time well spent, then you should definitely acquire the subsequent seasons because it only gets better. A LOT BETTER. Seriously.

Oh, and talking about viewing addiction, it took me a couple of weeks to devour Season One. As I was done with it, Amazon made available a Seasons 1-3 bundle and I bought that. I finished seasons 2 and 3 in the next couple of weeks. Season 4? It only took me 2 nights.

Oh, and, one more thing that you should keep in mind - but you will constantly fail at it: NOTHING is what what it seems to be and nobody is what he/she claims to be.

Happy viewing :)",1233619200,,3201,4.724014336917563
1546423,5,B00005JNOG,"I got Lost Season 1 as a gift about 2 years ago.  I had never seen the show and I really hadnt though about seeing it either.  One lonely night, I sat home with nothing to do, so I decided why not.  I popped the DVD in the player and watched the first episode and the second and the third.  I think I got up to episode 6 before I realized I needed to go to bed so I could get at least a few hours of sleep before work.  As soon as I got home I thought, screw working out today.  Stuck the DVD in and watched another 6 or episodes or so.  I was don't with season 1 in 3 or 4 days.  I watched the whole season again then headed out to Wal-Mart to get Season 2 (Even though I didn't have the money, I didn't care).  Once season 2 was over, I watched season 3 on my computer at work during lunches..and while the boss was out.  So I guess you could say I'm hooked.

How could anyone not like this show?  There are a wide variety of different characters and they all are very well rounded and interesting.  The whole concept of the flashbacks is just genius.  Then you have the island.  Smoke monsters, healing powers, people who never age, numbers that have some kind of power, The Dharma Initiative.  This is sci-fi at its best.  You also have a lot of drama and some comedy.  If you haven't seen this show, I would recommend buying season 1 or at least dowloading the pilot episode.  If you don't like it, I would be really surprised.",1233532800,,1432,4.05

Bush Age? Whoa! Nothing like it had ever been seen before! Season one was golden, and here it all began, the original concept, the original cast, just an unlikely group of jet crash survivors and their addictively intriguing back stories. Lost has come a long way since season one, but it's great to look back on the beginnings. Also unlike most TV series on DVD, the extras are actually worth watching. There's the eight-minute long Art of Matthew Fox, in which the actor does voice over of photos he took of the cast, crew, locations, from season one. There's also the cast gathered at Comicon, shots of the massive undertaking that was acquiring, dismantling and shipping an actual jumbo jet to Hawaii, all with the intent to make the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 that much more realistic. All the episodes of the first season of Lost are here, plus about eight hours of special features.

After my keen disappointment with the first season of the misanthropic ""24"" a while back, I promised myself I'd never waste my time on series television again without a helluva reco from a friend who knew my proclivities, and preferably after the series had had enough time to reveal its underlying themes. Well, we got such a reco recently for LOST, now in its fourth or fifth season, I understand, so the Clan and I sat ourselves down and started watching season one.

And watching, and watching...

Okay, I confess: we're two eps short of the end of season one, the second season is lined up in my Netflix queue, and I'm good and hooked.

This, for two main reasons: first, the show breathes a frefreshingly benevolent air--the creators clearly like these characters, and wish the best for them; second, the creators have slso astonishingly remembered that not only are many members of the tribe Homo Sapiens inherently spiritual in outlook, some of us are actually and overtly religious. I mean, this is a show where characters, sans irony, pray, go to confession and look for the meaning of life (or at least The Island); where everyone has a shot at mercy, redemption and a second chance; where a rosary may drop from the leafy treetops at any moment.

Indeed, the scripts are so thick with a mixture of Jungian archetypes and Judeo-Christian tropes that I'm wondering if the answer to all the mysteries of the show aren't somehow answered by the Catholic notion of Purgatory, or at least its more generic cousin, the concept that every person faces a life-reviewing personal Last Judgment at the time of death--I've even gone so far as to wonder if the show's creators weren't suggesting that the characters all actually died in that plane crash, and what we're seeing is a sort of ""Limbo of the Lost"".

Be that as it may--I'm still very early in the show--there's no question in my mind that a large portion of LOST's popularity and ""cult"" status is derived, not in spite of the series' overt spirituality, but because of it. Even among skeptics, the old religious tropes are powerful--indeed, they undergird the structure of western art.

For more on this subject, Mark Lawson of the Guardian U.K. has written a perceptive little article on ""why artists can't resist the lure of Christianity"". Here's just one paragraph:

""Christianity, as well as being a safer subject [than Islam], is also a rich one. The faith has become a cultural battleground because of a gulf between the astonishing boldness of the religion's central stories, and the pinched timidity of many of the people who have practised it. Its narrative elements - the fallen angel Lucifer becoming Satan, the birth to a virgin of the son of God, becoming man and dying on the cross - are, regardless of whether or not you believe them, intensely dramatic.""

Which is why, I dare say, as someone once pointed out, one never hears of ""the great Buddhist novel"".

Anyhow, for the rest of Lawson's article, go here: [...]",1228262400,,3172,5.024761904761904

To say the show has some twists, turns and suprises would be an understatement and just when you think tyou have an understanding of what is happening, another wrinkle is thrown in.

The use of cut-backs (and sometimes cut-forwards later on in the series) are extremely well done and help to add somee depth to each charactor on the show and why they do what they do.

The bonus features are a must and it is nice to have a widescreen version since I originally had not seen it in that format.

I highly recommend this show to anyone who was in my shoes before who have heard good things about the show but are skeptical. Every episode has suspense and has it's fair share of creepy moments. There's basically no limit to what could happen on this show which is nice because it sure does stimulate the imagination. A great show to watch!,1222905600,,447,4.333333333333333
1546588,5,B00005JNOG,"I somehow missed LOST during its first season.  But after renting the first disc and watching all four episodes of it in one sitting (including the absolutely stunning two hour pilot), I have been hooked.  LOST is now the only show I watch as it airs, rather than waiting for the DVDs or watching it on Tivo.

The premise of the show is simple; a plane crashes on a tropical island, and the show follows the survivors.  Yet LOST is so much more than that simple setup.  By the end of the pilot episode, it's clear that the surivivors of Oceanic Flight 815 didn't land on any normal island.  There's something lurking in the trees, a mysterious broadcast that's been running for 16 years, and oh yeah, someone found a polar bear in the rainforest.  As the season progresses, people start having visions of the dead, people are mysteriously kidnapped, and a babbling French woman warns of ""Others"" on the island who are anything but friendly.

If all of that sounds ridiculous or confusing, don't worry.  The show is so well written and executed that you buy into everything.  You won't get all the answers right away, and many questions will be left unanswered when the season ends.  But the fun of LOST is coming up with your own theories about the island and the survivors, and the careful viewer will find a wealth of clues hidden in the narrative to help you along (which makes rewatching the episodes just as interesting, as you catch all sorts of things you initially missed).  But while the ever growing mysteries of the narrative keep you engrossed, the real bread and butter of LOST is the absolutely stunning ensemble cast.

Of the 48 people who survived the crash, the series focuses on 14 of them, and that the writers manage to juggle so many characters is a feat unto itself.  Each person has a backstory, which is revealed piece by piece through the flashbacks in every episode.  These flashbacks show what happened to people before they came to the island, and also help explain why people act the way they do in the present.  Each character is brought to excellent life by the supremely talented actors who play them, and each role is tailored to the performers strengths.

Even better, the writers and actors (with rare exception) avoid showing the characters in black and white, good and bad terms.  Pretty much everyone will do something you love, and then a few episodes later something you hate.  With so many characters in the show, one of the great joys is discussing it with fellow viewers and seeing which characters you like and don't (you probably won't agree).  I personally love Sun and Jin (a Korean couple who doesn't speak a lick of English, and is more fascinating because of it), Southern bad boy Sawyer, and ex-rocker/druggie Charlie, all of whom light up the screen when they're around and have suitably intriguing backstories.

I could go on and on about this show's production values, but suffice to say the show looks like nothing else on television.  It is shot entirely on location in Hawaii, and the tropical vistas are absolutely stunning, especially with the widescreen DVD transfer.  There's also some solid special effects work, aided by the fact that it is not overused.

The DVD set has a wealth of extras, including commentaries on select episodes that will provide further hints as to what the writers have in store.  However, I recommend saving these until you finish the entire set to avoid any spoilers.

If you are even remotely interested in this set, you MUST buy it.  You will not be disappointed.  It is simply the most amazing debut season of any show I have ever seen.  Even the best shows spend a good portion of their first year figuring out what they want to be; LOST knows what it is from the first frame, and doesn't veer from that until the season finale fades to black.  But while watching LOST, do yourself two favors:

1) Carve out large chunks of time to watch it in, because nearly every episode ends in a cliffhanger that will leave you wanting to watch ""just one more.""
2) Watch it with friends, because half the fun is comparing theories about just what is going on with the island (for instance, what do *you* think is hiding in the trees?) and arguing about who is up to no good.",1222128000,,4255,4.633333333333334

1546592,5,B00005JNOG,"Now that I finally got to experience ""Lost"" for myself I can certainly see what everyone around me is raving about. I didn't watch it when it came out because I'm not really a TV person and following shows is hard for me on weekly basis  so I decided to wait till few season finished to later watch them all in one swoop. For someone who doesn't watch the telly I plowed through this show ferociously and in six days was done with season one.

First of all, I simply adore the lost in the woods and deserted island stories, books, films you name it. The drama that unfolds in this series has the same elements that can be found anywhere, rivalry, jealousy, hatred, love, false accusations, hidden secrets and all sorts of emotions take over characters as their time on the island seems to extend into eternity. The cast of characters is very broad but I adore how many main personalities there are because of the myriad of adventures that follow each and the groups they form themselves. One would think that staying calm and friendly would be one way to survive, but hunger, lack of protection from elements and the erratic ways the human behavior can change are no match for what really awaits for them on the island.

The island they are stranded on is not your average lush tropical retreat. Not only is the island inhabited by strange creatures and monsters you don't really get to see at first but there is talk of others, dark beings that are either sinister people or something even worse. Best way to watch this is without knowing anything about it so I am not going to divulge any more details, let me just say that there are very few slow moments and most of the time things go from crazy to insane. My favorite characters so far are John Locke played by Terry O'Quinn  and Sayid  played by Naveen Andrews. One never knows if the characters are really pure at heart because there are so many wild twists but man this show rocks, I love it. The moment I finished watching season one I started with season two and few episodes into it I am just as enchanted as I was with the first. The revelations are incredible and the mysteries only seem to grow in size and danger. This is one show that I wish could go on forever, I hope there will be many more seasons to come.

1546593,5,B00005JNOG,"When the first previews came out of this show back in 2004, I was like its going to be a crappy show.  But after watching the pilot, I was glued to my couch.  The mysterious island kept me wanting more and more.  All the characters are played wonderfully.  Most noted ones Jack, Sawyer, Locke, and Kate.  I thought the reality shows were killing the network drama shows.  But after watching the first season of this show I knew it would never die.  I am not going to going to tell what happens, everyone knows about this show.  Once you watch it you will want more and more, very addictive show. Highly recommended for people who love mysteries and thrillers. The show has little bit of everything.  Scifi, romance, intrigue, mystery, you name it, it has everything.",1217462400,,766,4.573529411764706
1546594,5,B00005JNOG,"One of my favorite TV shows ever. This is the first season and although it is interesting from the start - the unique aspects of this show don't occur until well into this season and even more in season two. If you've just caught an episode here or there out of sequence, then you are probably not hooked because this is a story line that has to be viewed in order.
If you like NOT being able to know what's going to happen next, then this is the show for you. It's full of mystery and has more questions than answers. It doesn't follow the usual Hollywood story lines at all. They are not afraid of killing off main characters. Hold on to your seat - this is a great journey.",1217376000,,676,4.1679389312977095

I tried to like it, but the more I watched, the more painful it got to sit through an entire snooze-fest episode. I actually found myself fast forwarding so that I could see when something interesting would happen.
How can people find this show amazing. There's an episode about playing golf, an episode about building a raft, taking a shower, picking fruit, and even drinking water. COME ON!

1546647,5,B00005JNOG,"The first season of Lost had me hooked the first time I watched it. I saw the trailer before the show even started and was intruiged. I did not watch the pilot episodes or the three following episodes. That is a testiment to how good this series is. You don't even have to know exactly what is going on to be reeled in by it. One thing that I think really helped hook me in was the beautiful scenery. But, on the other hand, how could extremely goegeous Hawaiian scenery hurt?

Another thing that hooked me to the show was the fact that you learn something about the characters every epeisode. The flashbacks are the thing that make this show truly unique.

The pilot episode is probably the single greatest episode I have ever seen of any television show. The first ten minutes are truly mesmerizing. I didn't even watch the pilot episode until I was about halfway through the third season. After watching it, I was shocked at the great camera work and storytelling. After watching it , I began to think, ""What the hell is going on?"" I love being not knowing what is going to happen next, and that is what this show constantly does.

A JOKE. Why is everyone ignoring the dead bodies on the plane? No burials? No a-r-o-m-a? It's to laugh when the POLAR bear is killed and nobody thinks of it as FOOD to feed the 40+ crash survivors. Yikes! I was instantly apprehensive when the first character we see in episode 1, scene 1,(the doctor)wakes up, COMPLETELY UNINJURED, literally hundreds of yards from the crash site--some kind of 'soft landing' involved there? I had to bail shortly thereafter from this ridiculous mess of a story. YAWN...everyone just waiting around for the next stupid surreal event to get all excited over. These actors are, for the most part, ALL unsympathetic characters thrown together having no clue how to cooperate for long-term survival on a jungle island. Too much pointless dialogue, too much pointless everything, with multiple contrived sub-plots meandering aimlessly. Programming CLEARLY aimed at a youth market able to grasp little more a than connect-the-dots, Jurassic Park-meets-dumb-paranormal-event storylines. It's a sobering thought that this shallow timewaster can have so many adoring fans. This is decidedly NOT a thinking person's notion of stimulating entertainment. ""LOST"" indeed!

There is excellent television shows(Battlestar Galactica Re-Mastered) and  perfect television(Buffy The Vampire Slayer).  Lost crushes every television show in history.  The acting cannot be beat, the writing is swift and memorable, and the story is the stuff of legends.

Lost Season 1 is in my opinion the best season of the 4 and a half seasons so far.  Not to say that the subsequent seasons are bad(they still trump everything else!), but they lack something that this season has.  The acting was the best, the writing was close to the best, and the story was not as strong as later seasons.

The story is this:  Ocenaic Flight 815 has crashed landed on an Island in the Pacific Ocean.  48 people have survived on a plane that had 324 passengers.  The next day, three chracters, Jack, a doctor with serious daddy issues, Kate, a fugitive who was being transported to prision, and Charlie, a drug addict who was in a rock band, trek into the jungle to try to find the pilot.  They find him, and then something kills him.  This is how it all started.

The acting award goes to Terry O'Quinn for his performance as John Locke.  Not many actors can compare to Mr. O'Quinn's tallent in Season 1.  Although their are severel runner ups, including Naveen Andrews as Sayid Jarrah, Josh Holloway as Sawyer, and Ian Somerhalder as Boone Carlyle.

With its intricately planned plots, fully fleshed out characters with well-thought out back stories, and a wild premise that is brilliantly executed, this is a show with truly universal appeal.  It's enough to entertain the ""we love action!"" crowd, but there is also a deeper level to this show, which often works on metaphor as it connects the `main story' of Lost to the characters' histories, utilizing flashbacks in each episode.

Unlike J. J. Abram's last series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alias/dp/B000H5V8DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alias</a>), you won't be checking the time while you're watching the first season of ""Lost.""  Every one of these twenty-two episodes is completely enthralling, focusing on the history and current situation of one character at a time.  Even the less interesting characters are easily able to hold up their own episodes.  There is always more to find out about each character as the seasonal arc builds, never giving the audience too little or too much.  Because that's what this show is really based on: mystery.  Be warned, Lost is not, I repeat, not for the impatient.  The arc of this series is based on the mystery of this island and the people who have landed on it, and every single time one of those nagging questions is answered, we are given a new question.  From the mystifying hatch, to the captivating character of John Locke, to the island itself, the sheer need to find out `what the heck is going on' will drive you through this season.

Take all of that good stuff and add a cast of actors with rare talent and the most beautiful on-location scenes you'll find on network television, and you have the phenomenon that is the first season of ""Lost.""

This story is about a bunch of people who are plane crashed on an uncharted island. Beyond being scared to death about being plane crashed, there are weird noises in the jungle, there are weird people showing up from out of nowhere, there are kidnappings, polar bears, and so much more unthinkable things on this island.
How will these people survive without fresh water? When will the rescue people be here? What's that noise? Why can't we contact the outside world?
There are so many questions that need answering and for now there seems to be no answers.

Then, four episodes after, I was lost, but knew I had missed something, because it was clearly one continuous story and not a bunch of discrete episodes. Now I have watched the whole thing over a week, and have not seen any of the other seasons, so my impressions are limited.

First off, as entertainment goes, it is first class. This is the kind of show that justifies television. The menacing drum roll during the credits is emblematic, apt and unforgettable.

This island is allegorical of human life on earth. We all crashed here through the birth canal. Many die in the process. We are surrounded by strangers, who become family, friends and enemies. We depend on each other for survival. It is a dangerous, beautiful and surprising place, full of mysteries and learning opportunity. We are of different races, appearance and body types and bring a package to this life. There is no such thing as a tabula rasa. We all have a history. Although different, we are remarkably similar. We are all imperfect, yet we all have the capacity of transcendence.

Archetypal characters emerge. There is the hero, Jack. Totally obsessed about this side of life, he is heedless, willful, courageous, emotional and engages in self-sacrifice, but his character is the most off putting for me personality.",1196467200,,1344,4.860262008733624
1546974,4,B00005JNOG,"The first season of Lost was fascinating television ... or at least it seemed like that.
From the get-go this series was unlike anything I'd seen on television, a brilliant mix of powerful human drama and mysterious science-fiction adventure and suspense. It was so exciting. TV was exciting again.

I have to add in retrospect that the second season was disappointing because it seemed the writers were unsure of which direction to go, and they just kept adding mystery after mystery, leaving us with endless questions. I stopped watching after Season 2 because the series could not live up to its first season's promises (and the seasons were getting alarmingly shorter anyway).

As for season one, well, for a bunch of Wednesday evenings in 2004, I was absolutely enthralled. I actually looked forward to a television program; a drama, no less. But in the back of my mind there was a seed of doubt. So the promise that ""Lost"" held to intrigue me slipped away into smoke, vanishing into thin air. I didn't even tune in to Season 3. I'd had enough disappointment and endless unanswered questions.

But the potential and possibility presented in the first season was unforgettable.",1195776000,,1181,4.924623115577889

1546976,3,B00005JNOG,"Over the past three years ""Lost"" has gone from winning best TV drama at the Emmys (for this season) to simply being known for sliding ratings and their outspoken, whiny fans. Of course ABC and the makers of this show have brought a lot of that on themselves with storylines that provide far more questions than answers and a scheduling system that would have killed most weaker shows. Though after we work our way through all that nonsense we find a show that is fine but ultimately overrated. Maybe people love this show as though it was the perfect specimen that they wish it was.  After busting down the gates with two strong episodes to open the series which lay out for us strong characters and strong groundwork the show loses its new show luster very quickly. I'm sure JJ Abrams and company would have you believe that this show is far more cinematic than episodic but I'm not so easily convinced. Too many episodes fall into the trap of being mysteries that need to be solved in 43 minutes. Who burned down the raft? Who poisoned Michael? What is this, freakin' ""Murder She Wrote""?

The story, for those that don't know, involves a bunch of people who get on a plane which goes down in the middle of nowhere, stranding them on an island that is apparently on nobodies map. Then weird stuff starts to happen. A polar bear shows up. They find some crazy French chick with a taste for torture. Jack (Matthew Fox, strong in this role) takes over as natural leader of the pack. They try to play it up as though he needs to be a leader to get over his daddy issues but I wasn't really buying that. More realistically the good suits at ABC probably picked him out to be the leader because they wanted a clean cut, attractive white male to get top billing. There are a lot of characters here and by painting them fairly broadly (the Iraqi, the hot girl, the fat guy) they are able to produce legitimately strong people. We learn about them slowly over the season through flashbacks to their previous lives. These flashbacks were widely criticized as simply slowing down the plot, but let's look at this situation from a different angle. This is a huge season (large even by network TV drama standards) at 1068 minutes, could they really fill all that out, and 5 seasons afterwards, with just island life? Especially considering how tame this island life is (no raping!). The story moves towards two climaxes. One involves a set of characters who build a raft and set sail for freedom into the wild blue yonder. The other revolves around a mysterious hatch found buried deep in the jungle and what exactly it contains.

Along the way the plots vary in quality. Claire getting kidnapped provides a perfect mini arch right in the middle of the season. I also enjoyed most anything Sawyer was involved in because even though I generally hate Texas racists he was at least pragmatic compared to the rest of the day dreamers. Too often I found the flashbacks to be too closely related to what was happening in real time. Their poetic coincidence was my network TV contrivance. Also, as could be expected, the plane roster was unusually attractive and unusually interesting. Where are the lazy bums like me who would watch a show like this? So in conclusion this show is certainly not my favorite, it is an ambitious, original concept that still needs to work out the kinks.",1188777600,8,3367,4.599001663893511

Lost gets increasingly complicated and has you guessing what is going on from the beginning. A Polar bear, A monster that uproots trees and kills people!! It is edge of the seat stuff. However as the stories twist and turn my interest has decreased significantly. I know many whom have lost interest altogether. Unfortunately I am one of those people who want to see it through to the end. I will be buying all boxsets!!!

1546981,5,B00005JNOG,"Ever since the early 90's (when TV peaked with TWIN PEAKS) had I to come across such an engaging Series! Weird (in a good way), Insightful and Intelligent - and with much better luck with scheduling and ratings.

The secret in my opinion: truly SMART writing; well-ahead planed plot and characters not only interesting but also one cares about to follow week after week!
Faith and Reason, Fate and Choice, Dogma and Intuition, Nature and Nurture, Good and Evil are in a constant dynamic equilibrium, raising everyday issues under extraordinary conditions to render all the hues discernible and debatable. Come for the story, stay for the Philosophy.

If you liked the X-FILES you will appreciate the mythology been interwoven with the action (instead of mythology episodes alternating with action episodes and, thus, pretty much ruining the rhythm of the series).
If you liked TWIN PEAKS you will appreciate the skewed reality and the blurry boundaries between reality and fantasy.

Although not by much, the 1st Season was the best of the three so far. The introduction of the characters with all the serendipitous path-crossing and the unpredictability of major characters getting killed made the difference.

One thing that had me hooked early was the exciting fact that, as the plane crash survivors suddenly discovered, they were not alone on the island:  there was apparently some sort of invisible dinosaur prowling nearby, eager to consume them.

And then the writers, in what was either a burst of hideous writing or a frightening insight into human psychology, have the survivors then proceed largely to forget about said monster, spending the rest of the season playing golf, going for a swim, getting a tan, etc.

Bound for LAX, the widebody makes an unexpected and fatal detour to a tropical island unknown.  Slightly over 40 survivors must now contend with the prospect that they may not be rescued.  Worse, the island offers small, yet unmistakable hints that it's far more than off the beaten track - in the first several episodes alone, we meet a hungry polar bear, an even hungrier thing that isn't even visible (unlike its gruesome leftovers) and we overhear a taped broadcast message that repeats a desperate plea for rescue twice every minute.  (An eerily robotic voice counts down how many iterations have already played - with a bit of arithmetic, the transmission is proved to be about 16 years old.)  As the survivors learn the secrets of the island, we learn their secrets through flashbacks - often overlapping with each other but sometimes repeating the same moments from a different POV.  We begin to wonder if the survivors can escape the island, but also whether the island is their escape.

This is an unmissable show for so many reasons.  First off, we don't know what kind of story we're in - is it simply surreal?  Sci-fi?  Is there some supernatural aspect to the story?  Is it some government conspiracy?  The producers behind flunked shows tend to excuse their failures by saying they never settled on just what they wanted their show to be.  ""Lost"" skillfully and deftly writes that search for identity into its very core - we spend whole episodes peeling away layers of the island and the survivors - the beautiful yet treacherous Kate, the heroic yet torn Jack, the seemingly mercenary Sawyer, Syed, who was a ""communications officer"" in Saddam Hussein's Iraq...and then there's Locke (Terry Quinn) whom the island has changed instantly.  The show sticks to a common theme - whether life is determined by fate or free-choice - with Locke and Jack taking opposite poles.  The show moves at a glacial pace, often weaving the characters' back stories into the larger mystery of the island.  (This is best displayed in the episode ""Numbers"" in which we learn that Hurley, a seemingly slow witted slacker, is actually worth hundreds of millions; the secrets to his success revolve around a set of numbers that bring him great luck, and disaster to everybody else.)

1547160,5,B00005JNOG,"I'm a somewhat recent convert to Lost.  After hearing fans of the show carry on about it at work and elsewhere, I just didn't see what could possibly be appealing about the show and refused to watch it.  Then an acquaintance of mine recommended I simply take the ""Lost Challenge"" - watch only the first disc of season 1 (about 4 episodes are on each disc, if I recall correctly), and see if you aren't hooked.  He boldly claimed that he knew of noone who had taken the challenge that had not become a convert.  I was skeptical - but after watching the first disc, I was in fact hooked, and I completed season 1 in about 2 weeks and subsequently purchased Season 2 as soon as it was released on DVD.

First, what I don't like (and why I initially resisted for so long): The entire premise of the show is utterly ridiculous and cheesy.  There's nothing about it that's remotely realistic.  The acting is ok at best.  The island contains about 45 inhabitants, 10-15 of whom are charactars and the remainder are essentially extras with no dialogue (although they'll occasionally have a line here or there).  Most of the characters, also, just aren't that believable.

Yet, after 4-5 episodes, I was glued to the TV.  The reason, I suspect, is that it's extremely suspenseful - there are always 3-4 plotlines going on at once, and there's a cliffhanger around every corner.  It's sort of like Fox's 24, or even the novel The Da Vinci Code, in the sense that it feeds you information one little morsel at a time and every answer seems to lead only to more questions.  For this reason, despite all its flaws, Lost is highly entertaining to the point of being addictive.

If you're not already a fan of Lost, I'd highly recommend taking the Lost Challenge - buy season 1 (or borrow the first disc, I'm sure you know someone who has the set) and watch disc 1.  Do that, and I'll wager you'll be hooked.

One note, I think shows like Lost are much more enjoyable to watch on DVD than on TV.  The plot is highly involved and it's much more satisfying to watch an entire season in a relatively short timeframe versus watching one episode a week with a 2-3 month gap in the middle of the season, as they subjected us to in Season 3.

1547161,5,B00005JNOG,"I am one of the few people that does not watch Lost on prime time TV. Unlike most, I waited until Season One was released on DVD in order to keep up with the story arc. A few warnings are below.

Warning #1: Season One can cause alcohol problems. Since my motto is ""have a few beers and enjoy,"" I did that very thing after I put the kids to bed and settled into my chair to screen the first episode around eight in the evening. I reached a point some time around one in the morning that I had to force myself to turn off the TV and pass out. This was only after telling myself, ""Okay, just one more episode, then I'll go to bed"" for several episodes.

Warning #2: Season One causes sleep deprivation. Because I stayed up too late ""having a few beers"" the first night (the end of each episode ended in a way that I kept saying, ""I can't stop now...I gotta know what happens next""), I was beat-down tired the next day. After going all day of telling myself to be in bed early, where did I find myself at approximately eight that evening? In my chair, beer in hand, having to re-watch the last several episodes from the night before, tired as heck, and knowing better than to go through with this debacle. Yet there I was.

Warning #3: Season One causes memory loss. After averaging a ""couple of beers"" an episode, the later episodes viewed in a screening get a little fuzzy. Thus, reviewing episodes becomes a must and I find myself in the same situation - up too late, drank too much, and re-watching episodes all the way to the end of the first season.

Intricately written, wonderful cinematography , all the clues and twists meshing together like a gigantic 500 piece puzzle. The story has some little plot twists ,aside from the big ones which hit you like a bus,But the real gems are the little ones that make you say hey wait a minute...A really enjoyable series with lots to think about.

1547246,1,B00005JNOG,"The hype contained within these reviews is well out of proportion to this show's merits in my opinion. I wasn't bothered by the whole implausibility of the script on the whole - I suspended disbelief in the hope of being entertained.

The problem is that that script is just awful. You get the feeling that having had the 'big idea' - that is, 'let's do a drama based around crash survivors in remote location', the writers then struggle for further ideas. It's cliched and colorless and the acting (with exceptions - such as central character Jack) is wooden. I watched the whole season in the hope it would improve, and that the characters would develop greater depth. It didn't and they didn't. The Asian characters, for example, are so cliched that I think I can reliably predict that one (or both) will be revealed to be a Tae Kwon Do or knife expert in a later season.

If you like a little more quality in your script, any season of the The Sopranos or Six Feet Under makes Lost look like a school drama project. Even Bleak House, improbably, moves faster and carries more intrigue than this unimaginative pile. Avoid, like a plane crash.",1169510400,15,1145,4.607843137254902

Like a relly good Stephen King novel: complex characters, unfair events happening to unsuspecting people.  A little supernatural flavor, but not overwhelmingly so.

It took me 6 episodes and then I couldn't look away. Once you get familiar with all the characters you get this strange sort of attachment to them. I would never watch this show on T.V. because I couldn't handle waiting week after week to find out what happens next. This show has mastered the art of wanting to find out what happens next so bad that you want to die if you don't find out right now. The end of each show leaves you yearning for another. There is no skimping out on episodes here, there is a ton of shows in this first season and each show is pretty long. It took me a long time to get through all of these, a long and really entertaining time. When Lost first came out I wrote it off as a stupid ploy to get people to watch a dramatic version of Survivor, but this is anything but that. There are so many fantastic twists here and where I usually hate flashbacks of any kind Lost really pulls it off. Prepare to have a lot of your time taken up.

1547419,5,B00005JNOG,"I thought this would be a stupid show that the network would cancel after 10 episodes.  How do you make a show about a plane crash?

The first 2 episodes are about the plane crashing.  The rest is so much more.  When I sat down to watch this on DVD I couldn't stop.  I grabed some food and told my mom I couldn't make it to lunch.  It's 24 episodes, so 17 hrs of an amazing movie.

I don't know how they do it.  But my thinking is this... Each episode is between 6 hrs- 5 days but there is ALWAYS something happening!  They could NOT have cast this show more perfectly.  There isn't a charater who isn't interesting.  Best of all, each episode centers on a certain castaway, relating their current situation on the Island to something in their past (look for which castaways have met eachother in passing in their past lives!).  They show that everyone has made bad choices, no one's life has been led the perfect way.  Every show a new mystery pops up, confusing yes, but not so that you don't get what's going on enough to stop watching.  You always keep thinking of new possiblities but I am sure no one will ever figure it out.  If you like action, fantasy, reality, romance...this show is for you!",1163808000,4,1202,4.327354260089686

The plot is interesting, the screenplay is excellent and the characters are very deep and differential. In my opinion, the characters and what they did in their past lives before the crash is emphasized so much that it took away from the show for me. Half of the season literally takes place before the survivors ended up on the island. Sure it all comes in bits and peices but it seemed that the season went too slow developing events on the island. I got bored with the flashbacks and kept waiting to see what the island had in store for the characters. It was like being starved for a week and unable to move with a big juicy turkey on a table in front of me and a guy throwing me a little peice every couple of hours. It progressed painstakingly slow but there were great moments here and there that led me to give it a decent rating. If you're looking for something new to watch and have seen most of everything else give this one a go. However, if you haven't seen Nip/Tuck, The Shield, or most definitely 24 you should watch those first. They're better than this show.",1162944000,3,1233,4.318965517241379

1547490,5,B00005JNOG,"Okay, if a TV show can be this good, why can't Hollywood, with its gargantuan budget, come anywhere close in terms of acting, script, cinematography, or give viewers the sheer joy of watching a complex plot unfold with over a dozen deep and conflicted characters?  The answer--because Hollywood doesn't take risks.  This show never should have been a success, according to the Establishment, whose philosophy is: Go with the sure thing.  Has there been one original movie in the last two years?  If so, better make twenty more just like it, say the film companies.  It seems like every mainstream movie anymore is a rip-off of a teenage sex comedy, a crime thriller, a car-chase show, or a drama about disfunctional, unrealistic, and unlikeable families.  As for the TV market, the prevailing view seems to be 'why pay actors high salaries when you can find idiots to be on reality television for free?'

LOST gets back to what real entertainment should be.  Give the viewer an intriguing story line that is not predictable, excellent three-dimensional characters, each with a deep, dark secret or a tragic flaw, put the cast on a beautiful, deserted island to create a micro-society, throw in a mysterious villain or villains, and you have all the elements necessary to create a show that will become as classic as the original Star Trek---quirky, thoughtful, well-acted, and just plain fun.

Watching LOST is like viewing a tapestry in construction.  The threads are constantly beginning to come together, a pattern is emerging, and the viewer thus becomes a participant in putting it all together.

Sheer magic.",1161734400,7,1614,5.007490636704119
1547491,5,B00005JNOG,"Don't even read the reviews just press the buy me button and prepare to watch the whole of Season One of Lost in about two or three days. This is one hell of a way to watch Lost on DVD. Those who sat through the episodes as they aired will admit that as one of the biggest selling TV series DVD box sets in history (also see `Firefly' for similar achievements) is better than the best of science-fiction series we have seen yet still offers many norms taken, and used well, from some of the best sitcoms of the twentieth-century. It is part `ER', part `Star Trek', part `Twin Peaks', part `Gilligan's Island', a whole big bit of `Survivor' with real drama and yet totally unique in every conceivable way and form with the episode (third on this season's disc 1) `Walkabout', which is widely considered one the best television episodes for any series ever aired. Lost will catch you hook, line and sinker. This will put a stop on every other media you watch or listen to for the next couple of days. The logistics are simple. A plane travelling from Sydney to LA has veered 1000km off course and smashed into an island strewing the passengers everywhere who soon learn from a co-pilot that their rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place. When the co-pilot is hurled into the air and eaten alive by an invisible beast who stalks the island the audience comes to realize that the island is no ordinary island, and so do the survivors who set about establishing themselves and facing various challenges that befall them. Who are they and will they survive? Will the Doctor fall for the possibly dangerous freckled heroin? Will the junkie die? Who stole her baby? Where did Locke learn to use a 9mm like that? Where does the electric cable come from? What is in the underground hatch? Who are the others? Are the fish poisonous? Is it in the future? Is he psychic? Are there dinosaurs? Is he who he really says he is? Who murdered him? Are there ghosts? Is this all an experiment? These are the kind of questions that can come up in a single episode of Lost. With that said and done there is much in Lost that can be rationally explained but a whole hunk of it will leave you Lost and bewildered. It may be as painful as having a tooth extraction waiting for the answer to any of the major questions but some of the smaller ones are eventually uncovered towards the end of Season one. So expect to sit through quite a number of background history stories for the series character build-ups, that are quite well driven, although extremely odd at times.

Of course there is the death clock element. People will die. Who do you side with and why? Who do you hope makes it and who do you secretly hope doesn't? Can Sayid stay macho dating women on the island? Will Dr. Jack get it on with criminal Kate? Will Hurley loose weight? Is Sawyer dead? Is Jin going to beat his wife? Will Sun leave him? Why does Locke like the island so much? Is Charlie going to marry Claire? Will Michael's plan work? Is Shannon too hysterical to survive? Will her brother Boone be able to keep his balance on a tipping plane? You just don't know how things will go. The seven degrees of separation instead becomes one degree as everybody has a distinctive relationship with everyone else, including you. The racial degrees of actors and actresses gives Lost a worldwide appeal, and deservingly so, as who can say that they don't enjoy the suspense and mystery it has to offer. In a day and age when television is boring there is nothing quite like Lost, nor will there be for some time to come. Yes we can complain that this can drag on to keep the bucks flowing but even Firefly only lasted one season. So lets hope the series gets a good few box sets together before the producers know when to call themselves to deliver on what is all means... and they better! In short, WOW!!!!

The writers acomplish that well through flashbacks tying each feature character into the fateful plane crash.  There are also enough plot twists to keep you eager for more.  The overall production quality is excellent.

The only warning here is the gore in some scenes.  If you're squeamish about blood, flesh and bone, then you will be covering your eyes a few times.

1547494,5,B00005JNOG,"I am a fan of shows on TV that try and expand our idea of what you can do on television. Basically if a show feels like it could be a movie as well, then I am interested. 'Lost' is such a show. Every episode feels like a mini movie and when put together it feels like an epic story covering the diversity of the human experience in all it complexity. At the center of this show is the horror of a plane crash on a seemingly deserted island in the south pacific. 47 passengers are left to fend for themselves and soon discover that the island may not be as peaceful as it appears. But really that is only half the story because each episode also gives the audience the chance to learn more about a given character, so that each hour feels like its own story. Those main characters include: Jack (Matthew Fox) a doctor and the chosen leader of their band, Kate (Evangeline Lily) a quiet woman with a tortured and hidden past, Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) a fading, drug addicted rock star, Michael and his estranged son Walt, Sawyer a con-man with an attitude, and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) the man with the secret... just to name a few. What makes this show special is both the style it uses, the time on the island is combined with flashbacks of a given character as it effects their choices in the community, and its substance, each person is dealing with their own inner demons and mysteries. The characters are both believable and involving in such a way that as their stories evolve we are both shocked and moved as we learn the truth about who they all really are. I cannot reccomend this show enough. It can be funny, tragic, horrifying and astounding all at the same time. I guarantee that if you watch the first disc in this set to completion you will be there to the end, it's that good. Highlights for me include the 2 part pilot, the 3rd episode Walkabout, episode 8-Confidence Man, episode 9-Solitary, episode 16-Outlaws, and of course the 2 part season finale Exodus.",1158019200,6,1974,4.470914127423823
1547495,5,B00005JNOG,"I rarely watch regular television, although I do watch HBO, movies, and DVDs.  That said, I had not watched a single episode of Lost, before I thought I would see what all the hype was about and ordered the set.  What is even more amazing is that I ordered the set in October 2005 and let it sit on my shelves for close to a YEAR (Sept 2006) before I was ""in the mood"" to watch this series.

After the first episode, I was absolutely HOOKED.  The cast is superb.  The plane crash was AMAZING and I loved watching how they recreated the scene as we are one of the few ""aircraft boneyards"" that house vintage planes in Tucson.  The L-1011 that they purchased was brought out of the Mohave desert, but just seeing this made me wish they had come to us.  (Or cringe, because if I remember correctly, they did call us - but the L-1011 that we store wasn't for sale as it is owned by a govt. funded agency.)  I would have killed to be involved in the recreation of this in Hawaii.

Plane crash aside, the episodes are filled with intrigue and mystery.  There are so many sub-plots going on at once that you just don't get bored and are kept on the edge of your seat.

Surprisingly enough, I'm not watching the regular show on tv, but am just going to wait for the DVDs.  I don't think I can take being on the edge of my seat for a whole week while I wait for each episode.  As it was, I saw the first season over the weekend.

1547589,5,B00005JNOG,"""Lost"" became an instant hit, and the series has since rewarded its faithful audience with engaging plotlines, intriguing and realistic characters, and convoluted twists which spark endless speculation. The show focuses on 14 of the original 48 survivors, with the rest of the group being made up of extras and a few recurring characters. The format of each episode focuses on the past of one of the 14 characters (in a ""flashback"" form), whilst simultaneously depicting events in the ""present"" time of the island. But of course, the island is no mere setting. The island is the omnipresent 15th character, delivering surprises and danger for the survivors at every turn. By all means, it appears to be a rather sizeable South Pacific tropical paradise, but as the survivors quickly find out, this island is far from normal. Though it feeds its inhabitants, sometimes heals or aids those in need, and keeps

its stranded victims mysteriously well-groomed and ruggedly handsome at all times, it also contains terrifying danger and befuddling mysteries. I'd be willing to bet that most other South Pacific islands don't have polar bears, anachronistic artifacts, or large obscure beasts that sound like robotic dinosaurs roaming the inland forests and feeding on the deepest fears of their victims. But when the hope of rescue vanishes quickly, the survivors must learn how to sustain themselves within this supernatural atmosphere.

Social roles and reputations are established among the core fourteen, and several character staples are present, though somehow given a more believable, less-caricatured spin. The pseudo-leader feigning bravery to compensate for his own inner demons, the amicable one with a criminal past, the seemingly uncaring jerk with a tragic history, the kid with strange powers and his stubborn father, the washed-up musician, or the wise intuitive elder who somehow understands the behavior of the island and goes with the flow of its will. Just a few examples, although Abrams and his creative team are, by and large, successful in making these character templates not seem derivative. Their personable behavior only makes you more curious to witness their outcome on this lost, and increasingly otherworldly, island.

Originally, the concept for this series was formed and hammered out in just a scant few months before its premiere. Its production was incredibly fast; for example, only 3 weeks were allowed to cast nearly 2 dozen people for primary, long term, and recurring roles. By the time the series premiered, the season had only a slim order of 13 episodes for its first season. After the first four episodes garnered enormously high ratings, however, approval was given out to produce another 9 episodes, making 22 total. Filmed during the airing of the other 13, ""Lost"" was given a very padded out schedule in order to make up for the wait time of the latter 9; the show even went on hiatus for nearly a month in December of 2004. Despite its slightly clumsy beginnings, however, the show continued to pull in high ratings from enraptured audiences and received much critical acclaim for its high-quality storytelling, culminating with both Golden Globe and Emmy awards for Best Drama Series, in addition to several other accolades, nominations, and wins.

Constantly challenging, always engaging, ""Lost"" is an addictive puzzle of a series, and richly rewards the astute adult audience it's aimed at. Though its high ratings and continual popularity could possibly subject it to overexposure, scheduling abuse, or creative burnout on the part of the writers (wherein they ask more questions than they can satisfactorily answer), the potential for this series is still incredible, and I for one am hoping for many more labyrinthine years to come!",1156809600,6,3782,5.215460526315789
1547590,5,B00005JNOG,"I more or less gave up television a few years ago.  Once the Fresh Prince went off the air, I haven't watched the t.v. or a particular  show with any regularity.  In fact, I probably haven't watched more than 5 hours this entire year.  Well, that all changed a few weeks ago when my girlfriend was house sitting and the owners had the first season on DVD.  She popped in and said, ""You have to watch this with me.""  In short, we almost watched a DVD a night for the next six nights.  Keep in mind, I don't watch t.v. and feel like I am wasting my time when I do.  This is not a waste of time.

There are others that can spell out the plot line better than I can, but I will just say that this is a compelling story.  It is the type of story that gets you talking to your friends and asking, ""What do you think x means?""  ""Oh yea, well, what about y?""  There are so many twists and turns that you cannot wait to learn more.  It is a first rate ""mystery"".

The integration of the individuals lives prior to the island is a wonderful feature.  The character development is amazing and what you want from a t.v. show.  They are like real people.  They have stories, a life, hopes, dreams, sins, and redemption.

This is a wonderful show.  Rent it.  Buy it.  Whatever you do, just watch it.",1156291200,10,1285,4.1214574898785425

1547592,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is an outstanding concept and was made more like a movie than a tv series.  From the plane they purchased as a prop to the special effects exhibited in the show, this series is a step ahead of all other TV series.

The storyline is suspenseful.  Introducing you to more characters and developing the exisiting characters with each new episode.  Just when you think what else can there be, they hit you with more twists in the story.

Finally an outstanding show NOT based purely on sex, violence, or crude humor!  The show is based on survival, it is based on the battles between good and evil.

Lost is a masterpiece in my opinion.  It is one of the most talked about, debated, and watched show on television.  I would venture to say one of the best series of all time.

Thank you ABC for taking this series!  Now if you could work on the mass produced book series that has spun off from this, that would be great!  Make them something worth reading!",1156118400,3,956,4.4
1547593,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is a show based on survivors of a plane crash on a deserted island. The show starts directly after the crash.

  The first episode, and a couple episodes later, is mostly about the ""main"" characters first few hours after the crash. This season does a really good job of telling the ""main"" characters story and backgrounds. (The reason for the quotations is that there are about 12 main characters.) This is one of the reasons for the shows success. The writing is great! Even simple things you might not think about, or even see, come back to be involved in the story later.

  The characters go about the task of first helping those in need. Then try to make some shelter, then find some food, blah, blah, blah. The real story starts to unfold the first night. While still on the beach, the characters hear strange noises and rumblings coming from the jungle. Moments later the trees of the jungle start to shake and even louder noises and rumblings are heard/felt throughout the makeshift encampment. It's an erie experience for the characters as well as the viewer.

  As the story unfolds, the viewer is let in on more and more secrets of the survivors and the first few secrets of the island. It's hard to say which has more secrets, the survivors or the island. Most of the island's secrets stay shrouded in mystery untill the final couple of episodes. New secrets and mysteries are discovered to replace the old secrets and mysteries. Like I said the story is involved and complex.

  Lost is a drama-comedy-action-thriller. I'm not kidding, it's all those and more. Have you ever been watching a really good movie/show, and seen/heard something happen that sent chills down your spine? Do you like that type of story? If you do you will love Lost! There are about 2-3 times an episode where chills will go down your spine, not because of some axe weilding psycho, but because of an in depth well written story. If you don't like this type of story, go pick up the fifth season of Everybody Loves Raymond. You'll be safe from any type of thrills. Not that E L Raymond is bad...it's just that it's safe.",1154995200,3,2114,4.608

1547595,5,B00005JNOG,"I LOVE LOST! This first season is spectacular and exciting! From the first minute to the cliffhanging conclusion, LOST is amazing all the way through. Join the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 on an incredible journey on a mysterious island. Why are there polar bears roaming free? What are the numbers? And who are the Others? This spectacular show is a real find and is a quality show no one will soon forget.",1153785600,8,410,4.63013698630137
1547596,5,B00005JNOG,"Wow. Thats really all I can say after watching the first season of ""Lost"" on this beautifully packaged DVD Set. What may be one of the best TV shows on the Television Airwaves ever, this show is much more then just a ""TV Show"". For some, it's a lifestyle. For others, it's a get-away into another world. And for the people that just like entertaining TV, this is definetly the show to watch. I was amazed that this was only the first season. Amazing graphics, intriguing stories, beautiful acting, and just plain awsome mysteries made ""Lost"" an obsession for me. This is NOT your average Sci-Fi/Action TV Show. I'm not into the whole ""Star Trek""/""Stargate-SG1"" thing, because I'm just not really into Sci-Fi. But this show, although Sci-Fi, is so much different. Think of it as a math problem, like so:

Sci-Fi + Drama + Action + Comedy + Mystery + Suspense + Horror= LOST.

Yes, I know that it may seem like I am just blabering about this show, but I can't help it. I STRONGLY recomened buying this DVD Set. And you will get completly sucked into the strong storytelling and sense of dread and just so much more. And you thought seasone one was good. Wait till you see Season Two.....",1153612800,9,1185,4.5327102803738315
1547647,2,B00005JNOG,"I don't know what anyone sees in this mess of tangled tedious lives the characters in this show have. The story line drags on and on and on episode after episode going nowhere and is about as unrealistic as it gets from the get go. From a plane crash where bits of a plane are lying everywhere and...... one of the engines is still running to polar bears to ..... oh you name it. A friend of mine purchased the complete season 1 and .... we watched it all over a period of 3 or 4 weekends. So - yes I watched the complete season 1. I don't know what I am missing here but having read the reviews I expected something different. Interesting even. This, to me, is a tedious boring soap set on a desert island. The budding romances , the inter actions between the characters , the loves , the hatreds - all could have been set almost anywhere. But,  because THIS involved a plane crash , they are on a desert island with spooks and noises that we have as yet , at the end of season 1 , to see anything of -  that makes this interesting ? I don't think so.",1152489600,13,1052,4.0772946859903385
1547648,5,B00005JNOG,"The only way to watch LOST is on DVD.  Once you finish one episode, you want to watch the next and it is right there for you without commercial interruptions.  I hadn't seen the first season on television, but my brother had been following it.  He received the DVD set as a gift and loaned it to me.  I told him it was as addicting as heroine.  I did not watch the second season as I am once again, waiting for the DVD's to come out in October.  Until then, I purchased my own set of series one and will watch that again.  I cannot say enough about it.  The show is just wonderful!  Truly, it gives you a break and you get LOST for a while!",1152489600,11,640,3.9763779527559056

1547650,5,B00005JNOG,"What can you say about Lost that hasn't already been said? One of the most gripping shows on television, that has made it big on both sides of the Atlantic, this is the one show that every one should own. It seems that at the end of every show, no matter how well you think you may have sussed out what is going on, the fantastic writers on the show throw in a few twists and turns, to leave you completely. . . well lost. Which in my opinion is great. At the end of this season, I was happy to say that I really didn't know what would happen come series two, and I was just dying for more. The plot is no doubt a tad unrealistic, but this is the appeal of the programme- to be able to lose yourself for an hour in such a dramatic, yet, at times, humourous, adventure. Yet that really should be adventures, what with so many things going on from the mystery that surrounds THAT hatch to the daring exodus mission to the 'others'. Of course this kind of show couldn't be pulled off without characters that we come to love and the actors must be given a lot of credit for that. Along with the many mysteries of the island, we also get to explore the inhabitants' lives, which, to put it lightly, have been eventful. From the doctor, that becomes our unwilling hero, to the convict, and the millionaire to the confidence man, EVERYONE has secrets. This seven-disc is really worth its value, and after a rollercoaster twenty-five episode season, the extras are there to give a light-hearted view on the making of the show. One thing's for sure- Lost will go down as one of the most imaginitive and original shows on history.",1152144000,11,1620,4.332236842105263
1547651,5,B00005JNOG,"It had been a while since I last spent one hour every week in front of the television watching episodes of a television series. In fact, I haven't done this since I was a child. I remember counting the minutes until the next show on ""The fall guy"", ""CHiPs"" or ""Automan"" began. After I grew up and time seemed scarse each year, I simply lost my interest for such series (although I rented the ""Simpsons"" seasons a while ago).

And then, ""Lost"" came. As I was zapping through channels, AXN's short preview caught my attention. Being a fan of ""Lord of flies"", ""And then there were none"" and other such stories where a bunch of previously unacquainted people have to live together in a remote place, making life possible with what they have at hand, I decided that I would give this new series a try.

From the first scenes of the plane crash, to the choice of the characters, the beautiful locations and the unusual things happening along the island (a polar bear in a tropical place!) I was hooked. I not only watched this first season in its entirety, but browsed through the net wanting to know more about everything related to the series.

The writing is great, the episode structure is intelligent, mixing what is happening on the island (new discoveries, smoking monsters, antique planes crashed full of heroine, the ""Others"") to the tales of the lives of the characters previously to the plane crash. What were the reasons for each one of them to be in Sidney traveling to Los Angeles at that moment of their lives? How are they related to each other (because, in a way or another, they are)? The obvious attention production spends with every detail is also remarkable. Add to all that Evengeline Lilly and the show is almost perfect. Of course, there may be lots of inconsistencies, plot-holes and other absurdities in the series, but this time I'm not looking for them, I'm just watching each episode like I was a kid again, and having lots of fun.

My only fear is a stalling in the development of the story. But in the first season it did not happen, as the variety of the characters and their relations proved to be a good source of plots to the series. Hope that the second season is as good as this first one. So, a solid five-star it is.",1152057600,11,2250,4.520884520884521
1547652,2,B00005JNOG,"Really, what is all the fuss about? I'm bewildered by peoples' immense attraction to this show which generally I've found to be ridiculous, lightweight, tame, often sentimental and full of unrealistic contrivances which serve only to push along the various subplots and totally go against what the characters would normally do if they were real people, and although there are some interesting subplots including the actual main premise, I find so many clich's in the way the characters behave and interact with each other. Most of the flashbacks which serve to deepen the characters and give us a sense of the people they were previously and their motivations are not really that interesting and are at times so unbelievable and at odds with the people they now are that I find myself cursing and giggling sarcastically at the writers for just dishing out all this nonsense.

As to the show's popularity, I can only guess that this kind of TV is more appealing to US audiences - in the UK, although a revered show, it's certainly not considered the greatest show ever and I find people around me slowly wondering why they are following it. For me, it's another example of why I stopped watching fictional TV dramas a long time ago.",1151884800,13,1231,4.806603773584905
1547653,5,B00005JNOG,"So I was one of those misfortunate ones who didn't believe the ""Lost"" hype.  It looked to me like some sort of Jurassic Park-like show, so I didn't tune in.  Then everyone was talking about it so I borrowed the DVD set from my dad, and my wife and I took less than a week to watch the entire first season!  What makes this show so great is 1)The characters.  What a perfect cast?!  Each character is believable and you become so wrapped up in their lives that you want to know more and more. 2) The mystery and intrigue.  Everytime you learn something new, you are left with 3 more questions.  Sometimes it will drive you crazy when you try to figure out the ""big picture"" of what is going on.  I'm anxious to see where the show will go from here and am now watching season 2 reruns this summer.  Hopefully, the writers will not let me down.  With this season, my favorite characters are Swayer, Locke, and Charlie.  Definitely the most interesting.  And yes, I believe the hype now as this has become one of my favorite cliffhanger shows along with 24 and Prison Break.",1151539200,3,1070,4.348484848484849

1547655,5,B00005JNOG,"I bought this dvd months after it was released, never having watched a single episode. I kept hearing about it on tv and seen all the awards the show recieved so i took a chance and bought it. Best decision i have made. This show has the best writers, directors, and actors out there. But what really keeps you watching are the mysteries and questions each episode raises. You just wanna know how? why? when? what? where? and you have to keep watching to find out. I have literally made atleast 10 of my friends who have never heard of the show watch it with me, and every one of them is a fan now. Most people think ok a plane crashes and there are people stuck on an island. I heard this before. But not the case with LOST. The island is very mysterious, and the characters are as well. Flashbacks in the lives of the survivors give you insight on why they are who they are. Can you really trust each other, or are people just looking out for themselves? Some will kill to get back home but some would not mind just staying where they are. It's a very entertaining show and some of the things that happen on here are shocking. Once you watch you won't be able to stop. Season two is just as good, with quite a few surprises and shocking moments. It will be out on September 5th, i can't wait. So go buy this season, i promise you will love it.",1151193600,6,1345,4.196911196911197
1547656,5,B00005JNOG,"A one of a kind series, Lost, brings to the screen the parallel stories of (mainly) fourteen survivors of an airplane crash trying to survive on an island somewhere in the South Pacific.  Things, however, are not what they seem in the Garden of Eden...

Terry O'Quinn, Josh Holloway, Dominic Monaghan, Evangeline Lilly, Naveen Andrews and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, tears, not to mention scares.  Lost does a great job of describing people's personalities, secrets and the problems they face.  It's all about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

The setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!

In short, Lost is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!",1151107200,6,1165,5.159574468085107
1547767,5,B00005JNOG,"I became Lost-obsessed late in the season. However, I was hooked immedietly. A few dozen people survive a plane crash on an island, as they struggle to survive, they find they are challenged by the island inhabitants, and not all of them are human. We focus on 14 of the survivors, all have a secret. Each episode focuses on 1 survivor and we get flashbacks to their past, and in some cases it ties in with the island

Many episodes stand out, mainly the pilot, Numbers, Deus Ex Machina, and Exodus. However, once you see the second season, this seems inferior, yet still better then most everything else. The characters are so well-developed and you feel you know all about them, and yet there will still be something new you learn. And the suspense, wow, when one episode ends, you can't help but pop the next one in.

Now the special features are great. There are deleted scenes, outtakes, and several featurettes, so much that there is another seperate disc for all of it. The commentaries are good also.

So if you like mystery (and can handle waiting a long time for answers, which some fans are so impatient they stop altogether which you should never do) and like a large ensemble cast, this is what you need.",1151020800,4,1217,4.573394495412844

Great show!",1150761600,3,284,4.109090909090909
1547770,5,B00005JNOG,"What I absolutely love about Lost is the fact that every single character had some sort of connection with each other, however minor. The characters all had something to atone for as well, like Sawyer needing to kill the REAL Sawyer, Jack needing to bury his father, and a whole mess of other people. The deep mysteries and the profound characters make this one of the greatest dramas in an age of reality-TV-crap. So if you miss the good old days when there was nothing on TV BUT the scripted stuff - the WELL-WRITTEN scripted stuff - do yourself a favor and pick up LOST right now. Don't make the same mistake I did!

**On to the DVD**

The DVD offers an amazing plethora of special features. If you've been itching to see how the show is made, your best bet is to go to the Season 1 DVD. Audition Tapes, Deleted Scenes and Backstage Passes galore, this DVD is great at offering insight to the external making of the show. Not to mention a couple of great additions, such as the amazing photography book created by none other than Foxy himself (Matthew Fox) and the hilarious comedy of Jimmy Kimmel interacting with the LOST stars on set.

What're you waiting for? Buy this now, you won't be sorry (unless you don't like LOST, of course)!",1150070400,7,1240,4.477876106194691
1547771,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is an absolutely amazing season and the best I have seen ever. All characters, especially Locke, Sawyer, Jack and Kate deliver an outstanding performance. The season starts off with a plane crash and totally involves the viewers on the mysteries and problems faced by the survivors.

The best part is that the season is not merely a typical story about survival, but it's more focused on the mysteries surrounding the island and pre-crash stories of all characters. In every episode there is some sort of a new mystery and you just can't stop by just watching one episode!

Slip in the DVD only when you have ample time as you will end up watching several episodes in a go!

I'll admit that at first, I wasn't quite 'hooked' the same way I was when I saw the pilot of '24' on DVD (the only other show I watch regularly now). Sure, I was impressed - the quality was amazing (both audio and video - it was meant to be seen in widescreen with a 5.1 system) and I wanted to watch more. But it didn't quite get me the way 24 did (but that's likely more due to the adreneline rush real time format of 24).

As I started watching more episodes of Lost, I began to really appreciate the character and personality development. This is where Lost truly shines. You start to feel for the characters and their past. At times, the backstory for me tended to drag. I'd say it's the show's greatest strength and at times, weakness (in that you want to see more of island). But as you start watching later episodes, you realize the backstory provides info on how the characters were interconnected.

I think what makes Lost's appeal so broad is not only each character's unique personality (all acted well), but it's ability to cut beyond genres. It's a bit sci fi, drama, comedy, action and adventure.

Overall, it's a rewarding entertainment experience. Some shows truly shine on DVD. It's so much nicer to watch shows without ads and the ability to watch certain parts is great (especially with something like Lost). I haven't seen the extras disc, but from what I've seen they have plenty of info as well.",1149120000,3,1595,4.547038327526132

This show ended for me the moment the characters begun to make totally absurd, egotistical, no-sense decisions going against what we have learned about them in the first season. The pinneacle of these absurds ocurred at the moment that Michael killed Ana Lucia. Michael, a character we learned to admire due to his love for his missing son. My jaw simply dropped in astonishment... it was absurd, useless, it broke plot coerence, it was a twist just for the sake of twisting, nothing more.  From this moment on I simply do not care anymore about this show. Good luck for all of you who wil kkep watching it.",1148342400,6,796,4.598591549295775
1547866,4,B00005JNOG,"So what happens when an orphan, a drug dealer, an evil lawyer, a hobbit, the F.B.I. Assistant Director, an inmate in a wheelchair, a gay-basher turned gay homosexual, a surfer chick and Jay Leno get on a plane. Well if you sprinkle in some token hot chicks, you'll have one of the most talked about shows in recent memory. (Bonus points to anyone who guesses who's who. Leave your guesses in the comment section with the character and the show/movie.)

The first episode of Lost rivaled that of a big budget, a plane crash, an enormous monster, an exotic location and of course, the hottest token hot chick on TV today. It was compelling enough to become an instant water cooler topic. We all debated what the monster was, who would be the first to die, and where exactly where were they.

Then the show moved into its ""Back-story of the Week"" format where we learned that Kate was a wanted woman and that of course raised more questions. What exactly did she do? From there, we saw flashback from each of the main characters, so more than others. We saw some that were absolutely shocking (Locke was in a wheelchair). We saw some that were easy to predict (Boone and Shannon are siblings by marriage and have hooked up). We saw some that were funny (Hurley's bad luck).

By the time the finale rolls around, everyone is more confused than Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton in the celebrity spelling bee. But since the producers are so nice, we get a glimpse of the monster. Umm, it's just black smoke. We are supposed to be scared of that? Well at least we get to see who the Others are. But that turned out to another let down as they looked like extras from Deliverance. If they force Hurley to squeal like a pig in his underwear next season, I will never watch the show again. So after the Other signaled that they have selected a new pope, they hop on their boat to pick up Walt. But I thought they were supposed to use white smoke for that, but anyway.

There were a lot of flaws that could be found in the writing. During Sayid's second flashback, it's been well documented that terrorist that are strapped with explosives do not detonate the bombs, they are led to believe they do but are followed and some one else does it just in case the suicide bomber gets second thoughts. Also how could the explosives expert, Artz, explode after picking up one stick but the people that don't know anything about it can carry six sticks threw the jungle without incident? Not to mention, why has no one mentioned that Locke is no in a wheelchair. I'm sure some one noticed he was in a wheelchair before the flight then being carried onto the plane by the flight attendants. These little details bug me a little everyone and a while and takes me out of the story.

The bigger problem though is the amount of unanswered questions that each episode leaves such as (my theories are in parentheses):

What did Kate do that was so bad that her mom is scared of her? (Eco-terrorist blamed for the death of an oil tycoon.)

How did Locke get in the wheelchair? (Complications to surgery.)

What is the monster? (A specter.)

What is the hatch to? (A submarine.)

What happened to Rose? (She went looking for her husband around the island.)

Why did the fortune teller change his mind about Claire keeping her baby? (The fortune teller didn't change his mind. There is no couple in LA. He saw another castaway's future and made Claire get on that flight.)

Who was Ethan Rom and why did he want Claire? (One of the others looking for the chosen one.)

How did Claire escape someone who could capture two people at one time? (She didn't escape, she was let go after it was realized that her child wasn't the chosen one.)

How did Jack single handedly beat up Ethan Rom after be beaten like a red headed step child days earlier? (Ethan let him win.)

Why would Sayid hook up with Shannon after being so close to finding his true love? (I, personally forget about any past loves if I had a chance with Shannon.)

What's with the number? (Just a way to connect everyone and everything.)

What did the French chick say to Hurley to calm him down? (Haven't a clue.)

Why did Claire name here kid Aaron? If she lost all her memory, what could the significance of this be? (I think the writers screwed up.)

What do the Others want with Walt? (He can control the monster.)

What will happen to Michael, Sawyer & Jin? (They will float back to the island and will discover the other survivors like Rose's husband and Michelle Rodriguez.)

What will Jack and company find down the hatch? (Boone, Ethan Rom, the marshal, Scott and anyone else who died.)

Why is a flight from Australia carrying so many non-Australians? By my count there is only one Australian that we have met, Claire. (It's an American show.)",1147478400,3,4787,4.497116493656286
1547867,4,B00005JNOG,"before lost came onto our screens... there was hype surrounding it as we heard about how well it had done in america, but there were also sceptics, sure people where amazed at the graphics and special effects, and indeed the sheer scale of production costs to produce and create the first episode... so when it finally arrived after what seemed a lifetime of adverts, i antisapaited what this programme would be like and whether i would become a sceptic or not. I WAS ASTOUNDED. to say the least... after what seems like a lifetime of endless reality shows (im 15), it was great to see an original, well scripted piece of drama, that didn't rely on big names, or in fact sponsers, however i was a little precausious when i saw merry off lord of the rings.... but i thought his portrail was astounding. tonight series 2 will begin here in britain and i cannot wait. for anyone reading this review, buy/watch lost, it is one of the most groundbreaking, landmark, franchises of the decade, hopefully series 2 will be just as great as series one and it continues having the remarkable scripts. the sheer brilliance of the storylines is remarkable.

Of course in comparison to cult programmes like buffy before this, you don't know what to expect, sure lost has graced are screens, and has had success in the ratings, it is a good programme, theres no doubt about that. but until series 3 (or beyond, althogh it is doubtless it can go on to series 5 at the most) however im not so sure, until answers are answered, i remain sceptical of how the franchise will go in the future. But 1 thing is for sure lost is a great programme, undoubtebly successful, leaving antisapation for the next episode week after week, of course it is worth buying, whether or not you are a fan, lost is something you shouldnt lose out on.",1146528000,3,1810,4.569230769230769

I love Naveen Andrews!!! Since I saw him in Mira Nair's Kama Sutra I always have loved him, but now everybody else can see his acting prowess as well as his chiseled abs! Maggie Grace is also very beautiful. Emilie de Ravin, who plays Claire, is not only beautiful, she can actually act!

I used to think this show was just plain weird. Now I am hooked on the season 1 box seat and I am too embarassed to admit I only have been watching it 2 days ago!!! Dont take my word for it, though!

One part of the plane lands of one side of the island, and the other on the other side.  Two groups of people survive, many die.  Both groups spend a week or two waiting on the beach, burying the dead, and wondering what to do next.  Both move away from the beaches when it becomes apparent that they are not safe there.

This is brilliant because in each episode you learn more about each person, for example the episode focussing on Ana Lucia showed us she was actually an cop (and a tough one), who was shot while pregnant, lost the baby and now carries a massive chip on her shoulder.  She killed the guy who shot her -in cold blood.

Just about everyone on the island seems to be harbouring a dark secret.

And then there are ""the others""... who are they, what are they doing on the island and why are they hostile?  Why did they kidnap half of the survivors?  There are so many questions and mysteries, you must watch every episode to try and untangle the web.

I rarely watch TV other than ""educational"" stuff like Discovery, History Channel, etc. Lost really blew me away. It is hard to find a movie or series that can really compare with it. The storyline is as good as any novel ever written, the acting is suberp, cinematography and special effects are great for a movie let alone a TV series, and the writers aren't afraid to throw some curves and keep you guessing.

Other reviewers have complained about the lack of realism in some plot points, but they're missing the big picture.

The story is very good, plus the effects and the performance by the cast are both excellent. Personally, I had never head of any of those actors and actresses, but I really liked them. One thing I have to say that I liked very much, was that the story was very fast, you didn't have times to get bored, plus it has scary scenes, funny scenes, action scenes, dramatic scenes, and there are also some ""twists"", that make you think that you don't know the characters, they may not be who you think they are, and it's just incredible and entertaining. I think it's true that the producers spend the maximum money ever spent for a pilot episode on this TV show pilot; it's so good, plus, it's like a movie, lasts about 80 minutes, which is, at least for me, perfect, so the story was all established only on that first episode.

Thay also had a great idea when they decided to make some flashback scenes, returning in time a little while, because it really helps you understand more about the story, the characters.

1548211,5,B00005JNOG,"If I had to pick three television DVD sets for a desert isle, knowing I was going to crash land and have nothing else for entertainment, I'd pack ""The Prisoner"", ""The Avengers"" (Emma Peel mega-set) and this. And this might be the first in the bag. Delving into the extras, you discover why this series is so good. It was rushed into production, all the obvious actors were already cast in other pilots, the producers/writers were forced to cast the best actors and rewrite the open-ended script to fit them (Sawyer was originally a Buffalo NY slicker, but they didn't even ask Josh Holloway to try the accent, in fact reprimanded him when he did); and they have obviously read Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"", Flann O'Brien and his human surrealism (featured in a shot, causing a spike in interest in the little known, long-dead Irish genius) and I suspect Borges and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. As well as comic books, Grimm's fairy tales, Dante's ""Inferno"", etc. The very best dramas seem to be written in a rush of inspiration, with almost desperate energy to realize it while its flash is fresh in the mind. That they managed to do this with a television show is almost miraculous (""The Prisoner"", which is shorter, was similarly conceived and executed). I suspect the ace in the whole is that the tail section survived on the other side of the island and in two years we'll see events from their perspective, so enjoy Sawyer, Hurley, Kate and the others while their salary demands are reasonable. Given what they've achieved so far, the producers will probably be forgiven. Hopefully they will avoid the rabbit hole ""The Prisoner"" fell into in its last episode (McGoohan had to hide out as he was literally physically attacked for it), but as with most stories it's the journey not the destination that matters. Even if ""Lost"" declines, this season justifies its existance regardless. Personally, I found this DVD set after a series of deaths in my family and laid up with a torn ligament in my calf (dodging a cab, I fared better than Michael), and it was immensely healing as a distraction. May I recommend it as that (and warn against it or any other television series as an obsession). It is good enough to become either. PS They will never have to explain The Monster any more than McGoohan had to explain the bouncing menacing roaring white blobs. I hope they never do. PPS In a cast this large, the lack of a gay character is rather glaring, though there was one line that indicated Boone was (posthumous backstory to come?). It's not too late for Sawyer to turn, of course. Or Kate, for that matter. In scripts this intelligent, it should have already come up.",1141344000,,2665,4.708779443254818

There is some 'silliness' in the beginning, where Jack seems to be the only one running around helping people, etc., but the writer put in enough hooks to keep one watching. We're also pulled into each individual life with flashbacks, but not so many that it bogs the story down. It's fast enough that you might miss details, so watch them more than once. I also enjoy not having to wait through commercials!

1548367,3,B00005JNOG,"The best thing about Lost is the mystery.  The inexplicable nature of the story will keep you watching even when the particular episode you're watching isn't that great.  I bought the first season and I watched it in three days.  I then downloaded the 14 episodes of season two, which are now available, off of iTunes.  It's Wednesday, and I'm ready to start watching along with everyone else.

I gave Lost three stars because, while I enjoy the mystery, the characters aren't all that well written.  Each character, despite their accent or dialect, has a very similar mode of speaking.  Each character has a flair for the dramatics that gets slightly wearing after seeing it over and over again.  I'm afraid that after I've watched all of season one, and half of season two, the characters are slightly predictable.

I also didn't like the fact that I couldn't get into the series until about the seventh or eighth episode of the first season.  The characters didn't compel me right off, and the story moved at a snail's pace.  This show reminds me much of a huge literary tome.  Like a classic, the story doesn't grab you `til chapter ten, but once it does, it grabs you hard.  However, like that proverbial literary tome, it can also be a little boring at times.

I do like the story.  I do like the mystery.  I do highly recommend it.  I don't like very many of the characters.  So, there you have it.",1140566400,5,1405,4.552

1548416,5,B00005JNOG,"Actually, I missed the first season of this show on TV because I rarely watch television, especially since the assault of all the ""reality"" shows has left me wary of going near the TV. I'd heard many, many people talking about it and sometimes friends would ask me, ""What happened on Lost last night?"" I had no idea what they were talking about.

A couple of weeks ago I was laid up at home sick and my brother brought me the first disc and said, ""You've got to watch this!"" From the openeing scene I was hooked and I proceeded to watch the entire season in three days. The quality of this program is simply amazing. The storytelling, the acting, the suspense, the moody atmosphere... everything.

People have tried to compare this show to many others but to me the one closest thing it resembles is an RPG video game where the island is the game and the characters have to try to figure out what to do next.

1548418,1,B00005JNOG,"This is a terrible show.  Looking back over these hundreds of 5 star reviews makes me fear for the future of my country.  Lost is a horribly acted mess, with painfully annoying characters who have ludicrous backstories and dialogue that sounds like it was translated from Klingon.

People who like this show seem to love the way the series slowly unfolds and everyone's story is very complicated, but it's worth noting that complexity and idiocy are hardly mutually exclusive.  It's tedious to point out everything that makes no sense about the plot, but let me say that my willingness to suspend disbelief ends exactly where the con man with the fake southern accent allows himself to be tortured by the former Iraqi Republican Guardsman (who, as chance would have it, turns out to be one of the few nice and honorable members of Saddam's elite torture units) for a kiss from the criminal girl.  Everything is so convoluted that sometimes you almost forget how stupid it all is.

 Here is the backstory for everyone on the show: ""I have a dark, but in the end excusable, past where events climaxed immediately before this plane trip.  Also, I have one facial expression, which is the look a 14 year old boy gets when he finds out he'll have to take his clothes off in front of other people in the gym locker room.""  There, that's it. Now please, please don't watch this show.

Look, we live in a golden age of television, and there are so many great shows available on DVD that its insane that anyone would sit through this, let alone buy companion books to find out more about these stupid characters.  Buy The Sopranos, Deadwood, Arrested Development, Rescue Me, The Grid, 8 seasons of The Simpsons, The Wire, Curb Your Enthusiasm, good lord buy Miami Vice, but do not waste your time on this horrible show.",1139184000,37,1810,4.660377358490566
1548419,5,B00005JNOG,"I love this series. The acting is first rate and the show is structured so that the writers can be endlessly inventive. Through the use of the backstory device, viewers learn of a character's history bit-by-bit. You may have formed an opinion of a certain character, but that opinion may well change as you view their backstory. At the very least you will understand them and their motivations better. Maybe the series throws in a bit too much (polar bears, etc.), but there is nothing else on television that holds my interest in the same way. J. J.

With full-feature film production values, Lost is an astonishing, in-depth look at a strange place, neither of the earthly world or the heavenly world, where we begin to wonder if the survivors are being tested in a sort of purgatory.

John Locke is the show's most enigmatic character. Is he Christ, the Devil, one of the Others? Sometimes serene in a Zen-like way, other times devious, Locke remains unpenetrable and is indicative of the rich complexity that this revolutionary TV show has to offer.",1138320000,2,765,5.071428571428571
1548578,5,B00005JNOG,"My wife and I watch almost no TV with commercials, and we never saw this series on TV. It was recommended to me separately by four friends during the season, but they had the sense to tell me not to try to jump in the middle of the season -- that the background was just too necessary to a full appreciation.

Since there are other excellent reviews that cover the details, I will just offer my impressions as to why Season I ranks high among the great TV shows of all time.

First, if you love mysteries and unfolding them, you will love this series. It is impossible to pidgeonhole this program into one genre--adventure, because at times it has the ""flavor"" of sci-fi, of mystery, of horror. Attempting to predict where the writers will take the episodes from prior clues is intriguing and challenging. Foreshadowing often occurs, but is refreshingly subtle.

Second, if you love thoughtful, interesting, and developing characters in fiction, you can't help but admire the masterful way that writing, acting and directing combine to make us care about these characters and watch develpment as the episodes slowly reveal key pasts of characters that wonderfully explain their flaws and strengths.

Thirdly, if you like stories of redemption--of characters who are transformed by unusual events or circumstances, you will enjoy getting to know these actors in these rolls.

Finally, this set reminds me of the distinction between entertainment and art. Entertainment provides a pleasant diversion from other matters. Art inspires thoughtful contemplation long after the images are no longer before our eyes. I don't know what the future holds for this series, but the first season is definitely art. The DVD visual quality is excellent and the audio is very good, as well.",1137888000,10,1773,4.996610169491525
1548579,5,B00005JNOG,"I waited for the release of the DVD-set before watching LOST, and I have to say, I was smitten from the first second and could not stop watching this riveting series. The extras on this boxset are very interesting and shed some informative light on the creation of the series. GREAT ENTERTAINMENT",1137628800,,296,4.711538461538462
1548580,4,B00005JNOG,"This show hooked me right away. How could it not? The people hating on this show because it's ""not realistic"" should stick to ""The Amazing Race"", ""Survivor"" or ""American Idol"" if they want reality. This is A-Grade suspense. It's compelling, and spellbinding, though yes, dialogue is a bit clichd and some characters are as well. To me ""Lost"" is a refreshing, gutsy, series that I am quite impressed a network actually had the balls to air. Imagine this show on HBO, oh my God. It works so well within the confines of cowardly network standards and practices; I have to salute them for their ability to create a show on this level without having to stoop to gore-ifying, or excessive expletives.

To me ""Lost"" is a kind of Fantasy Island in Hell, where people who have skeletons in their closets, checkers in their past or just bad karma check in to face their demons. Some are up to the challenge: Locke, Hurley, The Doctor (whose name I can't remember), Walt and Vincent the dog, Sayid and so forth. Others should just start swimming: Michael, Sawyer, Shannon (she even has the bathing suit), etc.

Shows like ""Lost"" are demonstrating to me that networks are beginning to shed their cowardliness and start competing with HBO for our time. I enjoyed this first season very much, however, there is such potential for the creative people behind this to blow it that I am worried.

I never watched ""Lost"" during its TV run, strictly DVD for me. I borrowed from my brother, and wound up buying it for myself. I'm glad I never took the time to watch it during its run, simply because (A) No commercials, and (B) No waiting for cliffhangers with the exception of the final episode.

Much of this show is impressive and creative, but then there is a lot of corniness happening here too. Clearly they were ""brought"" to this island for a ""reason"", and frankly they are stretching this thin, thin enough to snap completely in future seasons if they aren't careful.

I gave ""Lost"" Season 1 four stars, because it is enthralling, interesting and there are plenty of angles, and mysteries to ponder. I just hope the answers to all the questions are satisfying, because that could bring the whole thing down in flames. I really want to know what the deal is with this place, the castaways, the ""others"" and the numbers--- I just hope the payoff is worth the anguish they are putting us all through. There are a lot of people talking about how ""Lost"" is the best show on TV--- for me that depends entirely on how they end it, and that's a long way off, because the ""best show on TV"" can easily become the biggest letdown in TV history.

Here's to ""Lost"" and it's creators, and lets all keep our fingers crossed that future seasons are all as good as this till the very last episode. Thanks for reading my worthless opinion.",1137542400,9,2808,4.594810379241517
1548581,1,B00005JNOG,"Terrible - I found this series to be unrealistic and melodramatic.  When have you ever seen such a uniformly good looking bunch of plane passengers?  Obviously, this particular flight had taken off from LAX and was a bunch of actors on their way to some tropical casting call.  Why can't Hollywood get it right?",1137542400,15,311,4.722222222222222

Removed from that ""what happens next"" compulsion, the first season replayed in DVD is even more rewarding.  Yes, you occasionally notice little -- and perhaps important -- things you missed the first time around (Hurley on Korean television for example), but mostly the pleasure comes from seeing just how consistently superb television this is -- the writing, the acting, and most of all the rich imagination and creativity that underpins it all.  Quite simply, this is the best dramatic television has to offer -- with The Sopranos on hiatus and Buffy ended -- and in the DVD versions you get it wonderfully commercial free.",1137456000,4,859,4.86986301369863

The dialog is great, and the plot is often literary quality.  The characters and their relationships are exceptionally complex for television drama, my favorites being between Jin and Sun.  I can't recommend this show highly enough.",1137369600,,575,5.0
1548664,5,B00005JNOG,"I thought I loved watching LOST on Wednesday nights, but after getting the DVD set, I'm an even bigger fan. Being able to watch the episodes without the commercial interruptions gives the shows a whole new feeling that you don't get on television. Plus, if you catch a glimpse of one of those famous ""Lost"" hidden messages, blips, or mistakes, you're free to rewind and review. If you ""like"" Lost, buy the DVD set and you will become a hard core fan. It is well worth the price, however my only gripe, (not having anything to do with the show itself) is the irrelevant previews on Disc 1. I would like DVDs such as this to go right to the main menu screen, but Disc 1 forces you to fast forward through a bunch of crappy ""coming to theaters"" and ""coming to DVD"" garbage, which is really REALLY annoying. This is not the DVD set to buy ""just so you have it"" as it collects dust on your entertainment center.

1548668,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is so engrossing I would almost warn you to lock some of the DVD's up so you don't try to watch them all at once. This format really shows itself as being a better story vehicle than film when done so right like season 1 of Lost was. The character development and slow revealing of the mystery, especially each and every character's mysterious history is very rewarding and always surprising. The production is better than many films and the writing is excellent. All of the characters can be liked or disliked depending on the way they deal with a situation and this makes them more like real people instead of the typical 2 Dimensional television character. The attention to detail is fantastic. In the pilot, Jack runs into Kate for the first time as she emerges from the jungle rubbing her wrists. A few episodes later you see why. The thing is, is that you don't really notice she's rubbing her wrists until you've already seen it and you already know why she's doing it. The writers really planned ahead. The show is full of these little hints and details that it's almost impossible to keep up with. Lost really is a high watermark for television and being on at the same time as Battlestar Galactica and The Shield is simply awesome. These are 3 of the best TV shows ever.",1137110400,2,1285,4.543103448275862

1548670,4,B00005JNOG,"The first series of Lost has just finished on English TV literally half an hour ago (I know, were miles behind America), and I held off my review until then.  All in all I thouroughly enjoyed Lost, and once a friend recommended me to watch the first episode, I became hooked.  There are many reasons to watch lost, the characters are interesting and thankfully don't follow usual racial stereotypes.  On good episodes the plot is gripping, unfortunately there a lot of episodes where the plot is a little slow though, and tend to focus more on the characters past.

The character flashbacks are a good idea, and it helps to get a clear understanding of why certain people are like they are.  On certain episodes though (particularly in the middle of the series) it seemed as if they were just fleshing out the plot which wasn't 25 episodes in length.  However the series ended well and my faith has been restored, I can't wait for the Second series, which thankfully is starting in spring.  With very few secrets revealed at the end of the first series my only reservation is that Lost will continue indefinetely, and it may be years before we find out what the island really is.

If the second series is just a little more action packed (which from clips i've seen it looks like it is) then it will be great TV, this series just narrowly misses out on a 5 star rating.  All the people knocking it because they saw the first 3 episodes etc... should have watched a bit more before making their judgement. Highly recommended.

By the way in England weve been ripped off, they sold the first half of series 1 on DVD months ago, and now they are going to sell the second half seperately.  Buying them both is considerably more than it would be if it were in one set.  Please bring out the whole series on DVD over here, they are treating us like idiots.",1136937600,4,1850,4.473214285714286

1548672,5,B00005JNOG,"Long before their Oceanic flight crashed on a remote island, the crash survivors all had something in common, yet they, nor the television viewer at home, knew just how they were connected, and even now, a season and a half later, the mystery still remains.

What is no longer a mystery however, is whether or not this show, a ""scripted Survivor"" if you will, would suceed. That question, unlike many of the queries on the show itself, has been answered with a resounding yes.

Lost enjoyed a phenomenal first season, teaming with Desperate Housewives to bring ABC roaring back to primetime success. The fantastic cast and incredible story lines, along with the fantastic writers and producers, helped bring about that success and viewers everywhere are hooked on the story of the crash survivors and just what the island holds for them. This DVD set certainly raises the bar for television DVD sets, with a fantastic release loaded with great extras.

The group of survivors is certainly an eclectic group. There's the reluctant hero doctor (Matthew Fox) who finds himself torn between different groups of survivors, all desperate for a leader. There's the strong, beautiful Kate (Evangeline Lilly) who we learn is a fugitive from justice, who was on the plane with a US Marshal. There's the brash, cocky Sawyer (Josh Holloway), who competes with Jack for Kate's affections and also has some dark secrets of his own. There's the Korean couple Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) who as the show starts, are isolated by the rest of the survivors because they only speak Korean. There's the pregnant Claire (Emilie de Ravin). There's the drug addicted rock star Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), desperate for a fix. There's Michael (Harold Perrineau) and his son young Michael (Malcolm David Kelly) who have spent very little time together in the past. There's brother and sister (okay step brother and step sister) Boone (Ian Somerholder) and Shannon (Maggie Grace) who share a very dark secret, one that I imagine nobody saw coming. There's Hurley (Jorge Garcia) the millionaire (though nobody knows it) who builds a golf course on the island. There's Sayid, the Iraqi soldier and torture expert. And of course, there's Locke (Terry O'Quinn), the hunter, the one who provides everyone with food, but who also provides everyone with a number of problems too.

When the show began, you had to wonder just how it would sustain, how would following survivors of a plane crash keep a show on the air for a year? But, the writers and producers had the great idea of flashbacks, where viewers get to look into the past of the castaways, see what helped them become who they are, see the reasons they got on the plane, see who they were before they were survivors. This tool is absolutely fantastic. Some of the backstories are amazing and reveal some incredible secrets, which I won't reveal here to avoid spoilers. Every major character has at least one backstory with several getting a couple. Locke's first backstory is one of the best, and certainly one of the most surprising.

The island itself is also a character on the show, quite possibly the most intriguing character. What it holds nobody knows, but the survivors do know that there is some sort of monster that terrorizes them. Sawyer shoots a polar bear (yes a polar bear in the jungle). There is a strange transmission from a French woman that Sayid picks up on a radio from the plane. Of course the transmission has been looping for 16 years. We also get to meet the French woman, Danielle Rousseau, and learn her story.

A number of survivors follow Jack to the caves to be near fresh water, while others remain on the beach with hope of being seen by a passing ship. Claire and Charlie are kidnapped by ""The Others,"" people who were already on the island when the plane crashed. Though the two both return, Charlie shoots the captor before the rest of the group can get information from him. Locke and Boone find a hatch buried in the ground, which eventually leads to Boone being severly injured when a prop plane falls from the treetops with him in it. The hatch has numbers emblazoned on the side, numbers that Hurley used to win the lottery and numbers that he believes are cursed.

All told, things are pretty strange and when season two started, they got even stranger.

It is obvious from this DVD set that the producers of the show had a DVD set in mind when they made the show, because the amount of extras on the set are amazing. There are interviews with cast members, audition scenes, unaired scenes, a gag reel and a number of commentaries, just to name a few. These extras provide some great insight into the show and to someone who is addicted to the story, these extras were certainly very welcome.

Without a question, this is one of the top DVD television sets of the year. The quality of the production is amazing and the show is one of a kind. This set comes highly recommended for those who love the show and particularly for those who want the chance to find out what the hype is all about.",1136851200,3,5075,4.718961625282167

Then I started watching the show again after episode 5 and couldn't stop watching after that. Now I love this show and sometimes it takes multiple viewings for me to really get into a show. The cast is awesome and the quality is like a big budget movie. The storylines are mystic, scary and very cool to watch. It never gets boring and sometimes unrealstic but in a good way. I also like the secrets of the island and the story and plot for each episode is much deeper then I first thought. I bought the DVD today and I'm very glad that I did. The extra stuff is very good and only a photo gallery was missing. The menus where cool and there was no problem to navigate at all. The cast is just perfect because they look great and seems to be very nice people and you can tell that they had a very great time doing this. I must say that Lost is the best and most awesome show ever made. I can understand that so many people love this show, because it's so diffrent and J.J Abrams really knows what he's doing and he's very cute too. There's something for everyone in this show and it's not lots of violence and blood, only little wich is good. Lost is so much better then almost anything on TV today and I will continue to watch this wonderful show and buy the season 2 DVD when they release hopefully later this year.",1136332800,4,1447,4.153024911032029

Disk seven of additional footage, behind the scenes information and other assorted Lost tidbits is almost worth the price of admission alone.

I rented these DVDs from Blockbuster and my quandary is whether or not to buy all of Season 1 after I've already watched the first 4 discs and plan on watching the last couple in the next couple of days via rental.

Being Korean myself, I like the plot concerning the Korean couple.  However, I must say that the producers should have cast a more ""Korean"" individual for Jin's role.  Any Korean would be able to tell you that his Korean language pronunciation skills are clearly lacking and it is patently obvious that he is a Korean-American and not a Korean Korean.  Obviously, most Lost viewers would probably not pick up on this nuance, but I'm sure there would have been a lot more suitable ""Korean"" actors for this role.

But that's a very minor complaint in an otherwise brilliant series.  I'm glad that I wasn't able to catch much of the show while it was on air.

Lost features: (1) addictive main storyline that makes you want to keep watching to find out what happens; (2) excellent acting; (3) surprisingly interesting stories about the main characters' life before getting plane wrecked. (Although it does seem like half the characters are criminals, and the other half have evil curses and/or psychic powers.)

But let me talk about the amazing quality of the DVDs. Consider yourself lucky if you never watched the show on broadcast TV, because the DVDs feature a high resolution widescreen version of the show. The quality is incredible: extremely sharp and detailed. You can tell that the show was shot on film and not a video camera on account of the many artistic shots which wouldn't otherwise be possible.

It is not some mindless show. You can't watch it while doing other things. You have to pay attention and that's something that is, sadly, a LOST art...no pun intended.

With every episode there is a backstory for each character. You get a small glimpse of the person's life before they ended up on this strange island. I have my own personal thoughts and feelings as to what the island represents but I will keep them to myself and let you arrive at your own conclusions.

If I only could watch one television show, it would have to be LOST. The writers of this show has found a way to consistently grab me and now that I am aware that there are hidden clues in each episode, I am even more intrigued and it is very exciting to notice something that I didn't notice before because it keeps the show fresh and alive.

I happen to like watching the DVDs better than watching it on television for obvious reasons...no annoying commercials and also I can basically watch two episodes in 90 minutes rather than just one at 60 minutes on regular television.

As far as extras go, there really isn't that much that's too amazing. There's a pretty good documentary on how they made the season premier but everything else is kind of ho-hum. Buy the set for the show itself and forget about the little extras because the show itself is the amazing thing and for a little more than forty dollars you have a great gift that keeps giving long after it has been given out.

Then one day we had a gift certificate for a local book store and we took a chance on it.

Holy cow, Lost is brilliant. The cinematography is stunning. The writing is crisp and believable. The characters are memorable and endearing. We had no idea today's TV shows could be this good.

It's hard to explain what Lost is all about because there's a slight sci-fi/fantasy element involved. (The island has some strange -- and even invisible -- characters on it. And at least one character -- Terry O'Quinn's Locke -- thinks the island is ""alive"" somehow and is responsible for bringing all of them to itself.)

If you're looking for character- AND plot-driven television at its finest, Lost is for you. This DVD set is worth every dime. Do yourself a favor and buy it.

(Incidentally, we were spoiled watching Lost on DVD. When we tried to watch it on television we couldn't do it. The commercials severely interrupted the flow of the story.

My advise if you want to get the most out of the mystery and suspense of the show is to not read the booklet and not watch any of the extras until after watching the whole season.  I often watch an episode with commentary right after watching the episode as aired, so I remember what is going on behind the talking (the commentary so far IS very interesting - not just a retelling of the story on screen).  But I finally had to stop, because things were being said about what happens much later in the season.

I missed the entire first season on TV because it was somehow marketed as if it were a reality-ish show or something.  Something about the previews turned me off.  After hearing a friend mention the show offhandedly, I decided to give it a shot and got this DVD.  I'm so happy I did.

I started watching this Season 1 DVD a week before season 2 began to air, and after seeing only a few episodes, I was completely hooked.  If you have plans for Wednesday nights at 8 CST already, then you better not buy this DVD, because one viewing and you'll be hooked.  Even good TV shows (of which I only watch 2 regularly) are not usually DVD-purchase worthy in my book.  However, this brilliantly constructed show is teeming with easter eggs, clues, hints and red herrings that toy with your emotions and understanding of who the characters are, what they will do next, and what the island will do to them next.

If you're a fan of mysteries, science, and meaningful character development, don't miss this series.  It has very high rewatchability, and this season stands as a shining pillar of light in a muddy pool of recycled sit coms and soap operas.  It really has something for everyone.  Some of my friends watch to see who will hook up.  Others, like me, watch to see how the plot and mysteries will unfold.  That's probably one reason it is so popular.

Just don't use the numbers for the lottery.  On the last huge draw for Powerball, over 800 people picked 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.  If you do win with them, the jackpot would have to be immense in order for you to get a decent share!  I saw a recent Irish lotto drawing that used 7 numbers, and matched 5 - all but the 42 from this series.  Normally an average of 50 people match 5 in that Irish lottery, and that has been established over thousands of drawings.  The day the lotto matched 5 of these 6 numbers, 298 people won.  That's IRELAND.

It's a testament to the power of this series.  If you don't usually like TV, give this show a chance.  It won't make you watch lame sitcoms, but it will remind you why you bought a TV in the first place.",1135382400,5,2276,4.364285714285714
1548846,5,B00005JNOG,"I cannot think of a better dramatic television show in the history of television.  beats out Roots, Rich Man Poor Man and other historic television shows by far.  I just watched the whole frist season this week. Once you start you cannot stop. Haven't begun the second season yet, but if as good as the first I will be hooked.  This is simple like watching a feature film in a movie theater that keeps going without ever getting tired of watching. GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!

SECOND SEASON COMMENTS: Having said that I can't say the same for the second season as it first slowed down by 50% and then to about 20%. Why on earth they would keep revisiting the same stories and clips is beyond me. It slowed the pace of the series and is basically ruining it for me thus far.  What was so fresh and intriging about the first season was the quick pace and narrative, however, this is completly ""lost"" (no pun intended) in the second season as almost every episode is the same stories from different points of view but with no new angles. Too bad...",1135296000,3,1039,4.447368421052632

We possess an actual TV, but it is a monitor only to display exclusively what we choose to watch on DVD or tape.  Rarely have we watched any part of a TV series -- movies are our occasional fare -- until 10 days ago when a friend loaned us the first series of Lost.  We consumed the entire first season in five days -- that's more than one disc per night!  We forced ourselves to ration the episodes when we realized that there were only three discs left in the package!  Pleased to be watching such quality storytelling without abominable commercial interruptions, we have been mesmerized by the suspense, plot twists, backstory drama, excellent acting and writing, beauty of the location shots, apropos music, and promise of a deeper storyline to follow in future episodes.  Disc seven, which contains three hours of extras, is overall very entertaining.  The screentests of the lead actors are somewhat ho hum, but the featurettes about specific episodes and background on the creation of the series are informative and entertaining.  The only downside to an utterly fascinating set of DVDs is the somewhat boring commentary supplied on four (I believe) of the episodes.  Desperate for more Lost, I watched these few episodes for a second time, listening to the commentary, but found myself nodding off due to the mundane content and rather monotone delivery.

The only other American TV series (we frequently purchase and watch BBC-productions) we have watched in recent years has been the Everwood Series I DVD, a completely different genre of television that is in a class by itself when it comes to quality of writing and raw beauty of its acting.  Lost is definitely a ""keeper"" and I look forward to purchasing Series 2 when it becomes available.  Meanwhile, I avoid reading anything about the current series while thumbing through popular magazines, or looking at any websites with plot spoilers, as I don't want to risk spoiling the surprise!",1135209600,3,2100,4.884507042253521

LOST is almost like watching a movie, in pieces.  The way it's written, filmed, the quality of the scenes, the characters, the plots, the suspense...I could go on and on.  But, the point is, if you haven't seen this show, you need to pick it up!  You are missing out.",1135209600,3,499,4.0

1548924,5,B00005JNOG,"As ABC likes to say on their promo commercials - now is the time to get...""Lost"".  I started watching the show about Episode 4 of this, the second season of the show.  After watching about 3 weeks in a row I was completely hooked.  Of course, I was a little confused, and after reading some of the ""Lost"" forums online I decided to order Season 1 on DVD.  Definitely one of the best investments I ever made.  Season 1 came via UPS and I ended up watching the entire set of 7 DVDs in two days (it took about 15 hours).  I just couldn't stop watching!

Season 1 of ""Lost"" is compelling TV at its best.  Well-written, crisp dialogue, excellent cinematography, and the right mix of action and heart-tugging emotional tension.  Although this is an ensemble cast show, the writers have a nice technique of developing the characters.  Each week you get a ""flashback sequence"" involving only one of the major characters.  Therefore, you quickly forget its an ensemble cast and for that week, while still focusing on the entire cast, you're honed in on that one character.

Let me not forget to mention the 2-part pilot episode.  Wow, is it amazing!  They used an actual plane, and the wreckage of the ""plane crash"" is so realistic you think you're watching the real thing!  Its beyond the level of television - more like motion picture quality.

There's all kinds of little secrets like the sequence of numbers, whether or not they're all part of a science experiment, etc, etc.  You can research all this on the internet.  Its all part of the excitement of watching this show.  And part of the advantage of having the ensemble cast is so many different points of character interaction - like the science vs. faith conflict present between Locke and Jack.  And you only learn ""bits"" about the character in each episode - so you know its gonna be a few weeks before you get to learn more (keeps you hooked!)

As others have said, hopefully these writers can keep up the good work!  As for the review - 5 stars all the way.  Even if you're just getting into ""Lost"" now, this DVD is well worth the investment.  You can get the Season 2 episodes on iTunes.",1134777600,2,2144,4.5234375

1548928,5,B00005JNOG,"The best way to watch LOST is the DVD set. With no commercials to disrupt the ride, it's like watching a big-screen movie (except for the intro & the signoff off each episode). I love the series, but I tape every new episode & watch it by fast-forwarding through commercials. TV, with its unbelieveably disruptive and CONSTANT commercial interruptions, have made viewing more aggravation than enjoyment & now that I realize how much more engrossing LOST is without commercial breaks, I'm tempted to stop watching season 2 until the DVD comes out. I can't say anything about the extra features--I watched none--but the series itself is well worth the cost of the DVD.

1548930,4,B00005JNOG,"a few days ago, my friends convinced me that i needed to lift my embargo on network sitcoms and watch lost.  in the past week, i've watched over half of the first season, and i'm loving every minute!!

this is one of the few shows that offer viewers intriguing concepts rather than just coffee talk and hair styles.  everything else is mindless propaganda designed to teach us how to be more complicit americans.  it's kind of scary watching everyone you know pick a character from friends that they feel best defines their personality... and then playing those roles accordingly.

my only real complaint is that the dialogue is pretty ham-handed.  not that it's unique in this area, so it's pretty easy to get past it and let your imagination take over.  everything the characters say is designed to serve some larger purpose..  there isn't enough random, ordinary conversation so that you have to excavate the important stuff.  it makes it a little too easy to figure out what's going on.  my boyfriend gets irritated by the fact that i'll figure something out twenty minutes before it will happen and then i'm sitting there stunned because the very obvious clues pointed me right to it.

which brings me to another thing.  the metaphoric images used are often pretty transparent as well.  you'd have to have lived on a desert island for most of your life not to get them... or perhaps it's because i study archetypal symbolism.  maybe i am being too hard on this awesome show??

either way, it's a good show.  nevermind the fact that everyone always seems to have clean clothes, top-of-the-line hiking gear, and the perfect 5 o'clock shadow.  if you haven't seen lost yet, watch this first season as quickly as possible, get some rabbit ears and indulge!!",1134000000,,1758,4.768211920529802
1548931,4,B00005JNOG,"I am, traditionally, wary of extremely popular things. Many of the shows and movies that command the #1 (or #2, or #3) spot on TV leave me wondering if I'm some sort of defective for disliking what everyone else apparently adores. For once, I'm a part of the group: I like Lost. It's not the best show I've ever seen, but the productions values are very nice, the plot is interesting, and the characters are likeable without being perfect (morally, at least; physically they are still mostly too pretty for the real world. Which is why they live on TV...but I digress.)

Other good things: a willingness to tackle issues most TV shows wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole and a Siberian tiger pushing, an amazing cast, and have I mentioned the writing? The camera work is fantastic! I realy love the cinematography and the flasbacks, for once in a show, are an actual treat which I anticipate instead of the usual filler and annoyances. I love that the intro isn't some 5 minuite music video advertisement, but a 5 second clip of the title - that's so cool it gives me shivvers. And I love the setting. It's lovely.

My one fear is that it'll all end in disgusted fans. A show like this must have a fitting end, a conclusion, a finale. You can't keep going just because your ratings are up and people will buy it. You have a plot with mysteries - as every mystery fan knows, there is a time and a place for everything, and all myseries must be solved.

So - as much as I love the show - until it ends I'll worry. If they do it right, and end it, then come up with another show with the same high production values and excellent writing the producer and director will have gained a big credit account with me, and I'll be a devoted and trusting fan. If they draw it out and mess it up and get tangled I'll chalk it up as another great idea ruined by shoddy execution and go back to watching my reruns.",1133740800,8,1899,4.313725490196078

I used to tease my husband that I paid $55/month for cable so the kids can watch cartoons.  I would pay $500/month just to be able to watch Lost.  I never watched television until this show came on.  I only watched the pilot because I recognized one of the characters from Lord of the Rings.  It took only one show and I was COMPLETELY hooked.

The actors are stunning (even to look at), the writing is captivating and it is absolutely the fastest hour of television you will ever watch.

I was opposed.  I was skeptical.  I was that guy.  I said ""Great... bunch of people were in a plane crash... on an island... (insert heavy sarcasm) sounds addicting.""  So on went season 1 of LOST, practically unbeknownst to me, and totally if not for the occasional ""Do you watch LOST?"" from friends or family.

Then I had a conversation with my new roommate, this was in August, with the second season slated to start in September.  He told me LOST is the ""sickest show he's ever seen,"" and was ""a visual drug"".  I continued to be skeptical.  The next day one of my managers asked me if I was excited LOST was coming back soon.  When I said I didn't watch the show, he gave me a tale of an island that pulls you in and won't let you go and that I owed it to myself to pick up the dvd in order to ""catch up quick!"" before the season started.  It wasn't what he said, it was the passion with which he said it.  So I did.

The DVD contains roughly 23 episodes ~42 minutes in length, and the finally is ~85 minutes in length.  I bought the DVD's on a tuesday night when I got out of work at 6.  I work every day 8-5.  I watched the ENTIRE season by Sunday night.  I was a shut-in.  I watched Tuesday until my eyes hurt.  I rushed to work in anticipation of leaving to watch the next episode.  What would happen on the island?!?  It plagued my days.  As soon as I was home I would not move from the couch.  All weekend, instead of going out, I watched and watched and watched.  And on a Sunday night in August, at the end of season 1, when I reached the bitter end, I sprung from the couch screaming ""I HAVE TO WAIT A MONTH!?!?!""

This is not an exaggeration by any stretch.  LOST, point blank, is the best television show of any genre I have ever seen.  Since September, when season 2 began airing, my home shuts down at 9pm.  Cell phones are off, doorbells are ignored.  No one comes or goes.  From 9pm-10pm every Wednesday, my world stops for this show.

This may sound sad.  If you've seen it, it doesn't.  If you've seen it, you may say what my roommate said when I jumped off the couch, after having watched 24 episodes in 5 days (most of which he watched again though he had already seen every one), and after I screamed ""I HAVE TO WAIT A MONTH?!?!"", my roommate turned to me, threw his arms in the air, and said ""A MONTH!?!? MAN I HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE APRIL!!!"".

If you want to see a show that will hurt your brain, and dazzle your eyes and ears and imagination, this show is for you.  My only recommendation... make sure that at 9pm est every wednesday, you haven't made plans.  Otherwise your plans, will be very dissappointed.",1133395200,7,2650,4.178217821782178

And where do they get all they freshly laundered clothes and new wardrobe each week, does the French woman run them something up?It is trying too hard to be 'wacky', when it has episodes which deal with living on the island and general relationships it is so much better.",1133395200,8,536,4.37

Lost is an original piece of work. It combines very layered, and deep characters and a great storyline that is sure to give you jumps, chills, and ""Whoas!"" The characters are very human, and that gives this show an edge. It's, in fact, difficult to explain how it captivates you, because it just does. I've been watching it with my friends. Even they were skeptical at first, but they understand. Lost is unfortunately underated. Many think it is a reality show. But no, please give it a chance.

1549019,5,B00005JNOG,"""Lost"" is a great show that has a lot going for it.  I never watched the series on TV and my first exposure to the series was when I couldn't find an interesting movie to rent, so I decided to take a chance and rent the first disc of ""Lost"".  After seeing the first 4 episodes, I had to buy the entire season.  Owning the entire season is great, it allows you to immediately start the next episode when the show ends on a cliff hanger, which is almost every week.

This is the type of show that really had to exist in an age of Tivo or DVD box sets.  I can't imagine how you could appreciate the series if you occasionally missed an episode.  The writers did a great job of weaving numerous sub-plots through each episode.  At the end of the season, there are still a large number of unanswered questions.

The cast includes a number of likeable characters.  I couldn't stand Matthew Fox on ""Party of 5"", but he fits well into this show.  There are really few weak links here.

I would recommend this box set to just about anyone.  While some of the scenes are a little intense for very young viewers, most people will not be offended by the violence depicted.  Each episode has its share of suspense, and the entire series has the 1st rate quality of a production intended for the big screen, which is extremely rare for network television fare.  The 7th disc has some very good special features.  All in all, this is a great series to own.  Many viewers will want to watch the episodes a 2nd or 3rd time in an attempt to catch all that is going on each week.",1133222400,2,1560,4.255102040816326

1549082,5,B00005JNOG,"LOST is a compelling drama that will have you rivetted within the first few moments.  However, it just keeps getting better and better as it goes along, as what seems like a simple premise at first--a plane crashes on a remote island in the ocean, and how will the survivors cope--soon turns out to have extraordinarily rich storylines and character development/depth, with more than a few compelling (there's that word again, it comes up a lot when describing LOST) mysteries thrown into the mix.  There is so much complexity, depth and layering to the characters and the stories that LOST will completely pull you into its world and you won't ever want to leave!  I highly recommend getting the first season on DVD.  Those of us who saw the program as it aired will want to have the already-classic first season to enjoy over and over again, and those who have not seen the first season and find themselves hopelessly ""lost"" trying to keep up in season two will definitely want to get the season one DVD set in order to catch up.  LOST is an epic series that must be watched from Moment One in order to be fully understood and appreciated.  So much goes on in each episode, that you are afraid to blink, as you might miss something CRUCIAL.  If you get the DVD set, you won't have to worry about missing anything.  I personally also love the bonus disk that is included, especially the ""bloopers"" and the audition sessions.  I am completely obsessed with this program and enthusiastically recommend this obsession to others!",1133136000,2,1526,4.685393258426966
1549083,2,B00005JNOG,"I don't normally watch a lot television; the wonders of Netflix have made it so I don't need cable ever again. so, I've managed to avoid the hype until my sister insisted that I borrow her 1st season DVD.

I wanted to give Lost a chance, because I think the premise of the show is interesting; combining a disaster with a fantasyesque background, as well as infusing the plot with elements of numerology, redemption, etc. However, I just can't get into it. I'm not really surprised or enchanted by any of the characters and their plight (with the possible exception of John Locke and Vincent the Dog.) And even with John Locke's character, they could have at least made his name somewhat ambigious, instead of naming him directly after the philosopher. The storyline is predictable, at best, and the characters seem to constantly use cliched phrases. I don't really have a desperate desire to see Season 2.

Now, if the producers of Arrested Development could get their act together...",1133049600,5,985,4.822485207100592
1549084,5,B00005JNOG,"TV is a visual medium. Let's not back away from that. The written word and radio obviously has a different set of criteria. And the acting acumen that these (for the most part) young(er) actors bring to the fore may even be more difficult to present when you consider that they know that their appearances are going to be chopped up by . . . you guessed it, the sponsors. That's the nature of the beast. So say we see an early Jon Voight talking with his friend Lewis (Burt Reynolds) in ""Deliverance."" Voight's a 'woos' and Reynolds is so macho  that he makes you feel uncomfortable. BUT THAT'S THE WAY VOIGHT WILL BE IN 100 MINUTES. He knows it. The Director knows it. He can grow into the part over the course of an hour and a half. The actors on LOST have a lot of moments in the sun but they may be 30 and 40 minutes apart.

And these actors look good. They are articulate, know their craft, and the women are sexy and yes, there's a lot of skin. When Jack is out on the makeshift driving range with Kate, she ain't Roseanne Barr; no offense meant. Even Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriquez) who is one tough, nasty person, even when she's busting someone's head or threatening to cap them, she just looks gorgeous.

Additionally, the juxtopositioning of the then-current time-line with the past is brilliant. One of the reasons for this is because it reverse telegraphs what went on. Dr. Jack running stairs in one of the early scenes in the 'past' and pausing to commiserate with a stranger . . . whew. And the story of the Kims, Daniel and Yoon, and how they met, just excellent. A love story within the drama. It was like ""The Notebook"" without all the other sacharine.

The writing is tight. The episodes are very well crafted. There is an urban legend that the production-management staff didn't count on the success and that while failure wasn't planned on it was considered. Hence the overwhelming success caught everyone especially the writers, off-guard. Here is a problem as I see it. We all have a certain half life we give to TV shows. Much as we love 24, for instance (I think still a 'smidgin' in front of LOST for sheer magnetic, breathless episodes), we know eventually Jack will have done everything possible in any human's imagination. He's been electrocuted, shot, addicted to heroin, and all the women he's slept with have been killed or left him. Time to move on. Ditto The Wire. So where do we go with LOST?

One of the comments mentions a hubris with this staff of writers-producers-directors that they're great in the opening rounds but fade after the 8th. At the risk of using too much of a jock analogy, they have no bullpen. We'll have to wait and see. I haven't been bored yet for one episode in I (or II for that matter.)

To go back to 24 and The Wire for a moment by analogy. We expect the year to produce one story. We expect the story, that story, to be completed in the 30 weeks alloted time.

With LOST, it's a continuum and it will be curious to see where it goes. A lot of comments have been made about the show being Gilligan's Island with an edge. I would submit to you that those women aren't ANYTHING like Ginger and Maryanne. Great stuff for TV and coming at the end of a decade of truly worthless junk on television when we were all about to don the trappinigs of Peter Finch in Network and and say ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"" and hurl our TV's into the garbage. The recyclable bin, naturally. We're much more environmentally sensitive than Finch's character.

But a quick word about Reality TV. Yeah. It's crap and my only hope is that Springer et. al. (the Judges' shows also) produces a thorozine calming effect on that portion of the public that is their audience. But . . .

If you're giving props, check out the early shows of Survivor and Amazing Race. (granted, forget the spinoffs)). Are you kidding? This is where LOST emanates from. Stress. Conflict. Competition. Sex. Reward. Hardship. Bad weather. Bad characters. Come on. There are only 28 basic plots in storytelling. TV found a tangent. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1132790400,3,4097,4.503364737550471

1549087,5,B00005JNOG,"Over the past couple decades, I can probably count on one hand the number of television series I've ever watched with any semblance of habit.  In fact, I'd never even watched a single scene in any one of the 24 episodes of this one during the entirety of its first season on air...  What actually happened was that my mind had been by chance in a highly restless and impetuous state one evening several weeks ago, and whilst searching for a DVD to rent appropriate to my pure old brain's disposition, I happened upon LOST- Disc #1, and it sufficed to pique me, so I promptly took it up.  Oh- and Wow!

I must indeed thank the Forces That Be for how wonderful that momentary impulse turned out being!

Right off the bat, with the opening scene, one can sense that this is something reaching the extraordinary.  A devastating frame: the catastrophic wreckage of a plane ripped apart and smoking- the hellish nightmare of chaos wracked upon a shore of sublime beauty, where stunned survivors clamor about trying to get a grip- the bright sands, the deeper shades of the jungle slightly inland, and the rocky heights of the cliffs against the backdrop of vast ocean and sky, conjures the feeling that the medium projecting all this can't possibly be merely a TV screen.

Needless to say, I was hooked from then on. I'd not only made up my mind to watch the rest of the Season One episodes (4 episodes to each of the first 6 DVD's, and then the 7th for special features), but had also made sure that I would acquire them, as I knew I'd certainly not be the only one of my acquaintance to needs get hooked on something such as this.

Each episode focuses on one of the 14 main characters in the form of flashbacks while the storyline moves forward on the island (there were some 48 survivors in all, but only a few- the ""take action"", plaintively elite of the bunch - who are the focus.)  Among them are Jack (Matthew Fox), a doctor; Kate (Evangeline Lilly), a fugitive from the law; Locke (Terry O'Quinn), a salesman at a box company; Charlie (Dom Monaghan), a British has-been rock star; Sayid (Naveen Andrews) an Iraqi soldier; and Michael (Harold Perrineau) an unemployed artist & construction worker who had just recently reclaimed his estranged 10-year-old son, Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) after the boy's mother's death.  Add to the mix, with piquant dashes of blessed good chemistry, a rough-necked Texan con artist, a self-centered young woman and her brother, a young Korean couple, an unmarried Australian woman about to give birth, and a young man who'd won the lottery under weird circumstances, and you have here a show that raises the bar for all of network TV entertainment.

What makes this series additionally so appealing is its atmosphere, which contains somewhat of an undeniable supernatural factor.  Indeed, it's almost as if the island itself were alive: an entity possessed of a soul all its own.

Throughout these many weeks gone by, I've been working my 12-hour night shifts quite a lot, and so ultimately could not help but relay to my co-workers the many extraordinary virtues of this series...  Of course then, naturally and without much persuasion, I began at their behest to bring my LOST DVD set to work, to play as chance would have it, each of us, endeavoring to watch an episode or two during our down-time and breaks.  My colleagues became as hooked as I was, actually, and I derived much pleasure in this re-perusing of it -- found myself laughing heartily in places I would never have singled out as so amusing when watching it alone.  I've found so many inklings in the re-viewing - even some outright portents upon the whole, as to make owning this set very worthwhile.  Truly, there's such great ingenious story weaving, some of which I never would have divined had I not gone over it again.  Oh yes- one can very well be assured of coming to crave the intrigue of the tales these episodes tell - and well into the present season, to be enchanted still by the many separate fates of these wonderfully captivating, vastly intriguing LOST beings and their isle....",1132531200,4,4098,4.675938803894297

1549089,5,B00005JNOG,"Let me tell you why...

An underappreciated aspect of this show is that its creators have plotted far in advance how the story and characters will develop. By now, the flashback structure of each episode is a well-known trademark of the series. In some of the best episodes, that structure raises the dramatic stakes a notch. Consider ""Walkabout,"" with an amazing reveal at the end that whips your perceptions around and in a scant few seconds adds stunning depth to an already interesting story. The entire series has many such moments, but less obvious are the subtle clues and foreshadowings sprinkled in amidst the ongoing action from episode to episode.

Who can revisit the blooming apprenticeship of Boone and Locke without dreading its now-infamous conclusion? Will you see Jin the same way in the earlier episodes after you've seen ""...In Translation?"" Some of Hurley's early scenes are even funnier once his backstory is revealed in ""Numbers.""

Even if you avidly devoured every episode as it aired, you will be sure to find hidden meanings in every episode when you watch them knowing now what the creators knew then. If you are new to the series, then you have a great opportunity to get involved in a mind-bending mystery with some intriguing characters (about whom we still know so little...)",1132272000,2,1306,4.954337899543379

1549173,5,B00005JNOG,"I didn't start watching LOST until it came out on dvd. I actually did not like the show, without ever even watching it. I was mad about how popular the show was, when great shows like Angel got cancelled, plus it was taking J.J.'s attention away from ALIAS. Then the more I heard about it, the stupider it sounded. I heard about polar bears in the jungle, dinosaur like monsters, and joked about how it was like Gilligan's island. Then my friend made me watch it. After the first five minutes I realized how wrong I was. I knew the show was a bit sci-fi, but it was so popular I was afraid it would be a sell-out... it wasn't. I watched the whole first season in two days. Then went on to watch it again with my mom, my aunt, and three friends. (all separately) I didn't get tired of watching it, even after all that.

 J.J. Abrams is amazing, as he proved with ALIAS. The cast is unbelievable. I love how they aren't incredibly well known. They all fit their parts extremely well, and the acting far out does any other show on television. The plot is wonderful. I don't want to give anything away, but the reason the polar bear is there, and the subtlety of it, is amazing.

 I love the flashbacks, I know some people would rather they weren't shown. But we learn who the characters are through them, and why they act the way the do. I love the continuity of the characters as well. You get to know the characters so well, you can almost predict how they will react to something. The writers also don't underestimate our intelligence, which is nice and new. There hasn't been a show this good since BUFFY and ANGEL ended. You also don't have to like sci-fi to enjoy this show. My best friend HATES all things sci-fi, and LOST is her favorite show too. The show fits in so many genres, I think anyone who gives LOST a fair chance will love it.

I know a big concern is that because of J.J. reputation, it might not get better with age. Since he is a co-creator, and making a new show, I don't think that's a big possibility. There are other people around him who will make sure that doesn't happen. And even though ALIAS didn't have a great 4th season, not many shows do. For example, BUFFY and ANGELS weakest seasons were the 4th, and while the fourth season of ALIAS was airing, J.J. was working on LOST. (I haven't seen FELICITY so I cant comment on it).

Basically, to not at least give LOST a chance, is to deny your self one of the best television shows to air in a long, long while.",1132012800,,2489,4.285106382978723

The stalling tactics start to become more obvious (and less plausible) as the season progresses, resulting in some tiresome scenes. Because of the quality first half, I give it a 3. The degradation of the script attests to the fact that the overall concept is fundamentally flawed - you can't maintain the sense of mystery on an island over several seasons without resorting to boring filler.",1132012800,4,600,5.070707070707071

Not an easy achievment for me. And now I have bought the complete series on DVD. I am in the middle of watching it again. Roll on series 2.

When I am reading a book, or watching a film or a television series, I like to see good charachter developement. There is excellent character development in this show. I find it impossible to say which charachter I like most as I am drawn to nearly all the characters. They all have amazing stories. They all have a reason for acting and behaving the way they do. Which I guess teaches us a lesson. We should not judge people too harshly on our first impressions. You never really know what has gone on or is going on in their lives to make them act as they do.

The story here is amazing. I won't go into it here, as this is done by other reviewers. But it is brilliant and takes many twists and turn. Basically expect the unexpected. The ending of the series was brilliant. And it was only half way through the last episode that I started to guess what might happen. Excellently done.

Then there is the acting, which really is in a class of its own. I have to make a special mention to the characters Kate and Claire. Great job done here.

Each episode (after pilot 1 and 2) select a character whom that episode is sentric, they produce 'flashbacks' on the selected character that shows WHY they have problems dealing with other people or themselves on the island.

Not only that, the island has a few unexplained mysteries that begin to unravel thru season 1.  As season 1 begins to introduce characters, season 2 comes back raring for action as it plunges into the interesting storyline season 1 ended with.

1549177,4,B00005JNOG,"A few days ago I finally finished watching the 1st season( i tried watching it slowly so i could enjoy it more, and even though i was really surprised and satisfied with the season finale, i came to certain conlusions taht are not necessary positive about the show. Sure, the photography is great, acting is top notch, direction is excellent, sound and music really good, but not everything.

First of all, people who haven't watched anything (which i believe are a few) shouldn't get their hopes up too much for the product, specially after readong a thousand reviews about how it is the best show around. This is because you will get your expectations too high and it is likely that they will not be met. That is what happened with me i guess, i came to expect too much and got a bit disappointed.

  Now, the series is, without a doubt, excellent in a number of aspects, but not in everything. For example, the story and plot is REALLy good, interesting, worthy of hours of speculation, and new. However, i have rarely seen one that moves as slowly as this one, i mean, you hardly know much more than what you did the first minute of the series. That is a big drawback, really, the plot moves really slow. Actually, the first two disc are extreamly BORING (except for the pilot of course)!!! Hardly anything happens, and the only memorable part from them are those well done twist that come as you approach the end of each episode.

  This lead to the next problem that viewers face, once the plots takes speed, you might be watching a series of really good, exciting and mind blowing episodes only to find that the next one is one boring piece of crap that has nothing interesting and that breaks the entire fludity of the series. And sometimes it is the other way, things couldn't be more boring and then WAM! the next episode blows you away with new unexpected things and shocking events.

  Also, though the plots goes on pretty well, the writers had so much to exploit and didn't!! For example, the misterious things that happen in the island, things that shouldn't happen, are completly wasted, instead of making emphasis on them, the episode  revolves around useless uniteresting, unimportant things like ""why does kate want the toy airplane so badly?"" So, there are times that you think that things are going to heat up fast and a new event changes everything, but the truth is that the writers choose to focus on other things.  ALSO: Don't be fooled by the back of the package ""...the action packed show that blablablba"" there is hardly any good action, and hardly any chases.

  However, despite of all this, there is one thing that the show does in superb way, unmatched in tv, and that is the development o the characters. Never before had i seen better written and interesting characters. Even the ones that you think that are going to be boring turn out to have an interesting life. Each of them is well acted and shows a convincing performance to their character's specific personality.

  I must admitt that there were a fair number of episodes in which i just gasped and my jaw dropped to the floor  as i saw some events in the show, the plot twists are that good. And you certainly will find yourself at the edge of your seat a few times.

  In conclusion, of course i recommend the shows, it is better than most things around these days, however,keep in mind that it is not free of mistakes and errors.

1549179,5,B00005JNOG,"I loathe television. Ask my wife. I'll watch a football game here and there or a special on the History Channel, but I absolutely do NOT watch regular television series, except for rare occasions. The only exception is ABC's Lost. After having a friend sing its praises to me last year and witnessing all the media hoopla about the season finale, I decided to watch it from the beginning this summer when they started re-airing the episodes. I brought my wife along by the third episode, and by the fourth episode (the Emmy-nominated ""Walkabout""), we were hooked. But since ABC started skipping episodes this summer we decided to quit watching and wait for the Season 1 DVD to come out.

Why Lost is such a big hit is no mystery: take an interesting concept (plane crash survivors stranded on a strange island where very weird things happen) and mix it with strong characters and first-rate cinematic storytelling and you have a winner. My wife often comments that when we watch Lost it feels more like we're watching a movie than a TV series. Some have blamed the current dearth of box office attendance to the fact that Hollywood is simply making bad movies. When I watch Lost, I understand why: all the good writers are working in television!

I suppose you could say I like the show because it deals with philosophical and religious themes (for example, people are mysteriously healed of physical and psychological trauma on the island, seemingly out of nowhere), but the simple fact is that the producers and writers of Lost are just good at narrative storytelling. When these types of concepts work, it's not solely because of the concept but because the viewer is made to care about the characters that have to deal with that concept. The episodes are unique in that each one is intercut with flashbacks of the lives of different characters before their plane crashed on the island. The writers use this device to explain why the characters are the way they are and why exactly they behave in certain ways in certain situations. There are no one-dimensional characters here. The events in the backstory of Sawyer, for example, make up one of the best tragic tales I've seen on screen in years.

But the mystery of the island is something that keeps people coming back as well. Every week a new nugget of information is revealed about the island, but never enough that would spoil all the fun. Watching this DVD set is better than the lion's share of all the junk released by Hollywood last year. There are a few weak episodes, but that's to be expected in an hour-long drama that is essentially telling one very long tale.",1130889600,7,2629,4.710869565217391

I decided to wait for the DVD release because I hate not knowing all the individual storylines, which in lost accounts for plenty.  This definitely saved me tons of anticipation because each episode leaves the viewer wanting more, so I continued to watch more.  I finished the first season in about a week and am completely hooked on the show.

I won't explain the storyline of the show, I am sure it can be viewed elsewhere among these reviews, I will just say that Lost is well worth the price even if you have watched the series on ABC.

The opening of the show was fabulous and quickly grabbed my interest. How can a traumatic moment like a plane crash be boring? Of course it's not handed to us at the opening of the show. Bits and pieces of information are rationed out so the inquisitive viewer keeps watching. The show truly does a very good job of revealing information about the characters, the setting and the past just a little at a time to keep the viewer guessing and interesed all the way through the show.

The Island - Jameson Thottam

The island has its own mystery. No one from civilization knows where to look for the airplane. The survivors anticipate that the plane went down 1,000 miles off course. They soon realize that the last plane that crashed on the island was never rescued. They also discover there are wild animals on the island which can be a danger to them.

The viewer gets an opportunity to consider if the island is enchanted and exactly what kind of animals are on the island. A lot of things that shouldn't be possible seem to happen on the island and seem to defeat scientific explanation such as the way the aircraft landed with so many unharmed. Some people on the island believe they are on the island because of fate while others believe it's purely chance. Isolated incidences are revealed and eventually even the castaways start talking about it. Nothing is simple to answer or explain. The characters say if you want it bad enough the island will give it to you.

Uniqueness - Jameson Thottam

Most shows are predictable and you know a character's personality well enough to know what they're going to do next and how they will act when presented with a situation but we have an island full of unpredictable individuals. The viewer may attribute it to the fact that they just had a traumatic experience or the situation they are in which changes them. One minute a character looks like a hero, the next minute they look like the enemy. Sometimes it looks like a character is trying to sabotage the rescue but who would want to do that and why?

Character Interplay - Jameson Thottam

The crash happened so we start to see how the individuals reacted to each other and started to get to know them. One by one we started seeing flashes from their past. We saw what decisions were made in their life that put them on this particular flight. It would be so easy for the viewer to say, yea, how convenient for the writer to put a hunter and doctor on the plane. I know I thought it was too convenient, ridiculously convenient. But then the viewer gets more insight to see that these people had reasons why they were on this particular flight and not just any flight. We see why the characters are on this particular plane and I began to wonder if that was supposed to mean something. Perhaps that was another clue about the movie because the characters as different as they are seem to have unusual things in common.

I absolutely love how the characters unfold for us because it gives the viewer an opportunity to formulate ideas. The longer I watched the more ideas I formulated about where the story was going. But I was wrong. I found this show very suspenseful and unique.

Final Episode - Jameson Thottam

The final episode is more like the beginning of the next season. Instead of having answers I had more questions. Too many questions to sleep. I am anxiously waiting for season two which starts on ABC September 21, 2005. The synopsis for season two sounds really exciting with some new developments and should prove to be just as exciting as season one. There's no way that I could possibly wait until the DVD comes out, I'll have to watch it on TV.

I really enjoy watching a well written show without commercials screwing it up, but I have to say that the commentaries on this set of DVD's are especially disappointing.

Everything in Lost is mystically interconnected!

If you joined the Lost fan club in season 2, there's no way you can properly appreciate the show w/out this DVD set. You have to see the 'flashback' episodes for each character so you can appreciate how they relate to the experiences the characters are having on the island.

And I spent the next week watching every single episode with my dad and brother who are also fans.

how manuy times has this storyline been used? Too much. All J.J.

ABRAMS did to create this series was: Take Gilligan's Island, replace the charachters with smart people (as well as people who are buff and handsome or sexy), use a plane crash to get them stranded on the island, and then use a few storylines that make it seem new and interesting, even though it isn't. This is an action packed soap opera. With a little luck, people will get tired of having to wait months and years to find out the answers to these mysteries.",1130284800,9,779,4.557142857142857

1549470,5,B00005JNOG,"When I first saw the preview for ""a new show that will rock your world"", I thought to myself, well that's not an original idea.  In all honesty the show looked like a cross between Survivor and Jurassic Park.  I remember thinking, ""That show will never last"".  But, it did.  I didn't watch it and ignored all the hype behind it.  That was until my brother-in-law bought us the complete first season on DVD.  I wasn't thrilled or happy, but a gift is a gift and it is pointless to let a gift go to waste, so my wife and I sat down and watched the pilot episode.

We weren't even two minutes into the pilot episode and we were hooked.  It was absolutely unbelievable how the story kept you on the edge of your seat.  When the first episode finished, we looked at each other and without saying anything started the second episode.  The show is so magnificently done.  The acting, directing, and writing are near flawless.  It is truly a marvel.

Our obsession grew as the episodes went by.  We found ourselves craving ""Lost"" at times that seemed crazy (One night we woke up at 2:30 in the morning and when we both said we weren't all that tired, threw an episode in).

I'm not one for spoilers, so I won't tell anything about the show, but I will say it is well worth the time and money.  I must warn, however that once you start it, there is no turning back.  You, too, could find yourself lost in ""Lost"".  And once you've started there is no turning back.  Addictions can be evil, but this one is extremely rewarding.",1130112000,3,1516,4.330960854092527

1549549,5,B00005JNOG,"Quality-wise, on the technological side, the Lost Season 1 DVD set delivers. Video and sound quality are as good as you'd expect from a DVD in 2005. The drawback of the transitionary times we live in now is that the video quality of the HDTV broadcasts were actually somewhat superior. Still, don't let that discourage you from buying this if owning a complete copy of Lost Season 1 is all you wanted.

If you have already faithfully watched every single episode on TV however, and don't feel an urge to watch your favorites a second time, the seemingly long list of bonus features in reality aren't worth enough to make it a must-have for the dedicated Lost fan.

The 24 episodes come on 6 DVDs, four episodes on each disc, totaling an approximate 1069 minutes of Lost goodness. A seventh disc is dedicated in whole to the extras, which, while it would be a sizable amount of additional material for any 2-hour movie, feels very limited next to the 24 episodes here. There's a disproportionate attention on the grandiose season opener, the famous Pilot episode which cost ABC $12 million, making it the most expensive and certainly the most impressive TV show debut of all time. As such, the extra attention is understandable but you still can't help but feel unsatisfied with the rest. For example, there's a grand total of FOUR minutes of bloopers -- for the whole season. Adding to the insult, they are even crudely censored of profanities, making it hard to have a good laugh with the constant beeping.

As for the show itself, Lost indeed is a great find, as is proudly quoted from the New York Daily News on the box. Sure, there are things which bother me or episodes that I find boring, but as long as I always look forward to watching the forthcoming episodes this much, you know it's something special. The most I dread about Lost is what I've come to call the Matrix Syndrome, after the trilogy of movies. A promising beginning, with lots of mystery, tons of unanswered questions; followed by a middle act where you feel like it's only trying to postpone getting to the answers; then finally, a disastrous ending, as evidently, there could be no satisfying answers and there never were.

In a Jimmy Kimmel segment, included on the seventh disc, Matthew Fox (who plays Jack on the show) claims that ""I guarantee that somebody knows where it's headed."" It is strange then that I still get the feeling that the show's writers are only digging themselves deeper and deeper into a hole of unexplainable events, hoping in vain that one day in the future they might figure out a satisfying solution.",1130025600,,2603,4.689277899343545

Let me say I will forever be glad that I did. This show has twists in it that has made me shout out loud, more than once, what the hell. Every Wednesday you will find me in front of the TV to found out what crazy stuff will happen next. And believe me something will happen. The first season DVD set is an awesome set. It has very good special features and a great design to the case it comes in. There is a review before me that states the best way to watch the show is on DVD so that you can skip the commercials and plug in the next DVD to found out what happens next without having to wait a week or three, and I must agree with that statement. Just can't wait till season 2 comes out because season 2 is turning out to be greater than the season 1. If you have heard people talking about the show and are on here checking it out then believe me when I tell you this you will want to buy this season to get caught up with whats going on then start watching season 2 which is airing now.

There is not enough happening on the island that they feel it neccessary to flashback to the lives of the main characters before the plane crash - again, I find it enjoyable but I feel that it is also a ""gimmick"" that is simply there to keep people hooked.

While I am sure the writers will tie things together in the end, it seems like they wrote all sorts of weird story ideas and just put them in a mixer (crazy castaways that were beached 20 years ago? Random lottery numbers and a computer that you have to input the numbrs into?  Polar bears and invisible guardians? Etc...).

Everything about this show works...the cast, their performances, cinematography, soundtrack, plot devices, EVERYTHING!  Skill and serendipity come together in a perfect mixture.  Having the ability to watch multiple episodes in one sitting greatly enhances the LOST experience.  Unfortunately, having to wait for new episodes on TV each week results in forgetting certain nuances or plot points that are so integral to the fun and mystery of the overall show.

Great special features on Disc 7 (the entire product is as thoughtfully and beautifully produced as the series itself).  If only all series were given the care, backing and attention of this one, the world of network television would be elevated to a much higher level.

My only pet peeve is that most (NOT ALL! There are definite exceptions...) of the commentary tracks feature participation from multiple actors/producers that essentially turn into a joke fest of insider's humor or recollections that do little to enhance the ""behind the scenes"" information.  It would have been better to limit these commentaries to one or two participants at a time and have them addressing the home viewer rather than each other.

LOST Season One has set a very high bar and I hope they'll keep it up for all the seasons to follow.

The show really does suck you in.  It has action, adventure, a little bit of an X-files feeling to it, drama, romance and so much more.  As you watch, you will really feel like you know the characters and identify with them.",1129852800,,453,4.625

Lost doesn't disappoint - an excellent series, easily the best programming to come out of The States in years. Constantly compelling, twisty plot, fascinating characters and little bits of drama & comedy at just the right moments to carry the story in a new direction. Bring on series 2!

1549752,5,B00005JNOG,"I purchased this DVD boxset because I was so hooked on the series that I could not wait for the next episode to be shown on TV.  The series would only be available over here in England in installments, the first part being released after the episodes were aired, with the second to follow later and that wasn't good enough for me, so I was happy to see that the entire first season of Lost was on amazon.com.

Before embarking on the rest of series I watched the special features and I wasn't disappointed.  It was interesting to see the audition tapes especially the ones where the actors tried out for different roles, it was odd seeing the guy who plays Hurley auditioning for the role of Sawyer!

The programme itself is fantastic with twists and turns in the plot, that you were not expecting, including the tragic death of one of the major cast members (I won't say which one in case people haven't seen it yet).  There's also blossoming romance and don't get me started on the eye candy (Sawyer, Jack, Charlie, Boone, Sayid, Jin - it'a all good).  The end of the series left me itching for more, I can't wait to see what happens next because I need to know what is in that damn bunker!

As soon as season two boxset comes out, count me in.  Lost is a brilliant addictive programme that I hope to be watching for many years to come.  Well done!",1129852800,,1350,4.368

It's so much better without the commercials.  It makes it easier to follow all the sub-plots, and characterizations.

I never watched an episode of Lost on TV, so I wanted to buy the whole season, especially since it won some awards. I think the show was amazing. Matthew Fox is even better than he was in Party of Five. The show is compiled of a bunch of brilliant actors. I ended up watching the complete first season in 4 days. It was one of those shows that I just had to keep watching, episode after episode. I can't wait for season 2 to come out!",1129680000,,529,4.096153846153846

Great characters, great acting, great plotting and twists; the show is almost faultless.

1549866,5,B00005JNOG,"""Lost: The Complete First Season"" is indeed the complete and essential set for ABC's hit new show on seven DVDs. Episodes are available only in English (perhaps sometime they'll be available in Spanish and other languages too) and are shown in widescreen. Sound quality is great as far as can tell, although I don't really have the most advanced sound system.

There are a lot of special features, all decent, but some more notable then others. Therefore, I'll only comment on my favorites:

The Art of Matthew Fox

This is very nice. Set along with a couple of the more touching scores from the show, Matthew Fox talks about a sort of photo album he did for the show, along with some original artwork.

Lost Flashbacks and Deleted Scenes

Unlike with some other shows or movies, you can tell that this isn't stuff that was cut because it was stupid, but rather because it either wasn't working with the story anymore or just for time. Now you can finally get to see and enjoy it.

Commentary

The commentary is definitely great to listen to. You'll find out what the writers and actors were thinking, why certain things happened the way they did, etc. And, if you have the captions on, you can rewatch the episode at the same time. There's commentary for four episodes, five if you count the Pilot as two episodes. This doesn't seem like necessarily a lot, but it's okay with me --- it's just enough without being too little, but not so much that it sort of goes into overload. Also, I was impressed by a very neat thing with the Pilot commentary where sometimes they'll switch out of the action of the show to take you to scenes from the filming and then once it's done, it seamlessly returns to the show. Cool feature.

On Set with Jimmy Kimmel

This is just plain amusing --- Jimmy Kimmel visits the sets and talks / cracks jokes with the cast and crew. He even collaborates with Dominic Monaghan on a ""theme song"" for the show.

Previews for Other Shows and Movies

Includes a number of previews and promos, including ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" ""Alias,"" ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Lost"" second season.

Perhaps the only slight disappointment about this DVD set is that it doesn't have any commentary on the finale, but I suppose maybe it was all put together a bit too late to do that, or they had a fear of it leaking out.",1129334400,,2342,4.563245823389021

Over five years they've developed some wonderful shows that I've quickly become addicted to.  Honestly, tv wasn't worth watching unless it was an HBO series.  I shunned most everything else.

ABC's LOST has reversed my way of thinking.  Drama, suspense, mystery; this show has everything.  I'm an addict now and I really get into this series.  The only drawback that I see is the necessity to watch the shows in order.  If you miss an episode you could potentially become clueless on what's going on.

1550029,5,B00005JNOG,"Forget about the fact that LOST is the most engrossing, gripping drama ever - buy it just to experience Matthew Fox as Jack Shephard. You won't be sorry.",1129161600,,153,4.5
1550030,5,B00005JNOG,"What's that old saying about the best laid plans of mice and men? Because it sure fits in here. Hello, I'm The Curmudgeon, and for 50 reviews now I've been slating the baddest of the bad, the most laughable, awful drivel known to man. For (supposedly) five reviews though, I decided to write about things that I really liked. Then Amazon decided NOT to print one of them, meaning I had to replace it with something.  Then they decided to print it anyway. Leaving me with six instead of five. Hey-ho. Thank YOU, Amazon.

Anyway, I'm from the UK so haven't actually SEEN all of this show yet. Now, I know some of you may be thinking ""what kind of knee-jerk reactionary dimwit puts something in his list of top things ever when he hasn't actually SEEN all of it yet?"" And you'd be right. That's why these public votes on ""The Best Albums Ever"" are so worthless, because The Scum merely put the last album they bought as the best ever - hence why you get Franz Ferdinand albums high up in those lists.

But I'm not here just to talk about Lost itself. Awesome, awesome show as it is, full of great, fully fleshed characters with believable dialogue (if at first slightly mawkish.. ""count the fear away"", indeed) and some terrific pulse-pounding moments and a great ""gaaaaaah, don't end NOW"" sense of driven suspense.  What is really great about Lost is that it's a superb TV show that The Scum all get excited about as well.

You know who The Scum are; the wretched, easily-pleased, watch whatever drivel is on, buy whatever's popular, wouldn't have a single original thought if their lives depended on it - yeah, you know what I mean - THEM. It's a show that THEY watch, and they don't even have to phone up and vote anyone off. There isn't a lame cover-version single released by ""their favourite"" at the end of it. It doesn't have desperate wannabes or even more desperate ""celebrities"" trying to claw their way into newspaper colum inches.

In short - it's not reality television, the most hideous form of entertainment on the planet.

And for that, we should be thankful. We should embrace Lost to our hearts and never let it go. This isn't some ""Cult"" show, it's not some God-awful sitcom a la Will And Grace - it's intelligent, thought-provoking drama that's got smart people, you and me, and thick people - The Scum, ALL watching.

Now, here's the best part. TV execs might see that Lost is doing so well and think, ""hey, you know what? This Lost program is kicking ass in the ratings.. and look at the DVD sales. I might take this 10 million budget I have here and NOT comission another series of Pop Idol, but instead spend it developing ANOTHER cutting edge drama, with, you know, real actors and real scripts and.. what was that word again? Oh yeah - TALENT.""

We can but dream.

There. Positive reviews all done. Back to normal after this, but what dire piece of filth will be getting The Curmudgeon treatment?  There's only one way to find out...

There was no question about it - I had to buy it to get caught up. One might think that 'How long can a show go on with 40+ people crashed on a island'? Well this has to be one of the best written shows I have ever watched. I have watch the Season 1 set twice since I bought it.

You've got this glossy outer layer that looks appealing and you can peel it off to reveal a soft, pulpy, sweet center. But as you bite into it, you find that there's a core, tough, edged, and in it a set of seeds that will allow you to grow more apple trees ...if you plant them.

The glossy outer shell is the cast and what we (the viewers) think we know about them. But as we bite into the series and get a flavor for what's on the inside, we realize that there might be a worm or two. That shiny surface hid some interesting and not-so-nice things. We've got a man who was wheelchair-bound prior to the plane crash who now can walk; a young black boy who seems to be able to make things happen just by thinking about them; a doctor who's battling the past and who is the defacto leader of the group; a beautiful young woman who seems interested in the doctor, but has a past she continues to run from; a Korean couple trying to survive the ugliness of a marriage on the fritz; an overweight lottery winner who finds out that the numbers he won the lottery with are bad luck; and a slew of others.

As we eat further into this apple, we get closer to the core, that part you can't eat but contains the seeds of new life. Like the characters, if they can get passed their own cores, they might find the seeds awaiting them. Maybe.

The tropical island in which they crashed on seems to be a character in the series, too. It slowly reveals hidden secrets: old plane crashes, ancient shipwrecks, concrete bunkers, a crazy French woman, polar bears, and something that protects the island itself and acts very much like a dinosaur.

Sound interesting? You bet it is.

Some have said LOST is a combination of Gilligan's Island meets Survivor. That's rather shallow. This series has much more depth than either of those shows. It deals with how our past influences our present and, ultimately, our futures. It makes you think about what you believe the guy standing next to you is really like. And it makes you think about the core of ourselves.

I also have to comment on the fact that the producers/directors showed some guts when they killed off a prime player 3/4 of the way through the first season. Most shows would never dream of doing that in the first season. But I was happy to see that they're keeping it ""real"".

I do have to say, though, that I hope they know where they're going with the series. I hope they don't get lost themselves as they continue this great TV drama. And I also hope that they don't revert to some cliche (i.e., they're all dead and are in some sort of purgatory). I guess I'll just have to trust them and keep on watching.

Continuing with the filler point, that is the one major drawback of the series, there are a few filler episodes e.g. Whatever the case may be and Exodus 2 but this is counteracted by the superb acting and story writing that is present in most of the boxset, examples being the absolutely outstanding episodes Walkabout, Confidence Man and Exodus 1.

In my opinion, the beauty of it is in the complexity of the story, the clues, the interactions/connections between characters, the design of the story.  It has great acting, great plots, great characters, and great one-liners like ""Dude! Looks like someone steamrolled Harry Potter!"".  The show keeps me on the edge of my seat during every episode.

I watched the first couple of episodes on TV and then couldn't wait for 20 more weeks, so I bought the DVDs. My wife and I watched the whole lot in a few nights. Only problem now is...when's Season 2 coming? I feel like Charlie going through withdrawal. This should carry a health warning!

If anyone hasn't seen the TV show, get started. It really is a breath of fresh air in the stale TV schedules. My wife and I were hooked from about episode 3. You can epathise with the strong cast who are very good and not overly well-known. Each has their fair share of skeletons in their closets and various other mysteries surrounding them. We learn more about each one and the island week by week, although it is not always useful information. There's plenty of action that moves along at a fast pace, but also plenty of reflective and dramatic moments. Some of the best bits are the most unexpected and sometimes surreal parts.

If you liked the conspiratorial/mysterious threads of the X-Files and the ""have to see the next episode"" factor of 24, then this will be right up your street. On the extras DVD they talk about years worth of material, so it could run and run. Hopefully it won't get stale.

1550552,5,B00005JNOG,"Funny how the opening credits perfectly sums up the feeling of the show. The word ""Lost"" appears among a black background out of focus coming closer to camera, then it goes clear for 2 seconds than goes blurry again before disappearing. Exactly like the show: plot points and answers are revealed only to have them not appear like they are and it's gone. Like trying to finding a really fast cat.

A man wakes up in the jungle disoriented. While going through the jungle and reaching the coastline he sees a certainly eye-opening sight: the flight he was on as crashed and debris among with survivors are on the beach. This has to be the best scene in the entire series, it's suspensful and gripping, especially the um, turbine part. Then the pilot continues with the series next 2 best scenes: the hearing of something ominous in the jungle and an ""attack"" on the front end of the plane.

After that, things don't really get as gripping, except for a little phantom passenger but other than that, nothing really sinks its claws in like those opening 2 pilot episodes(including the transmission scene, btw recommendation: don't read the booklet with the episode sypnosis, they're not the most discreet about certain things.) What does compel you though is the answers to those questions which oddly just literally hang for episodes on end.

With such a huge survivor list you would think we'd lose perspective on how many people they are but you notice that there's just enough although 48 survivors is kind of pushing it. We'd all develop our favorites too, and that might change since every episode one character tends to have their own flashback episode where something about their life is revealed. So some survivors you probably wouldn't like but end up liking them anyway. One of my favorites is Sawyer: funny, brash and quite complicated. And I can identify with Charlie, always wants to help but never seems to have it appreciated, even when he needs the help as well.

If they're could be one complaint is that the show almost seems like buckling under its own weight. Like loading a table with boxes, the more you put on the more it'll crack and break. So it seems with the show: with so many questions and very few answers being given, you're not really sure how the writers will pull off the ending without it being like ""oh come on, as if!""

i really hope this show stays on for quite a bit, and i have a feeling it will, because of all the women watching it. heh. I just hope they don't kill any of the characters i like.

this show is pretty violent too, the pilot episode with the plane crash, wow, i couldn't believe they showed that. and the one part on the season finally with Arzt, i was not expecting that.

this show also got into my ultimate favorite shows list by its creative comedy the developers made, the one episode with Sayid, and the terrists were playing Half-Life, on tv, and if you are a Half-Life fanatic like i am, you would probably consider this one of the biggest inside jokes i've ever seen in the mainstream. (incase you didn't get it, Counter-strike, a very well known mod, is a total conversion based on Half-life. in the mod, it is Terrists Vs.

I bought the set a few weeks ago and have since been watching nonstop. I'm more hooked than a crack head.  Luckily, season 2 has started and now I can get my fix each week. I am not a big TV guy.

1550634,5,B00005JNOG,"I didn't watch the first season of Lost at all while it was on TV (I watch little network tv), but my wife quickly became a full-fledged Lost addict.  Every week she would come back with a plea for me to watch the show with her.  Finally once the season one DVD's came out, I capitulated and purchased them to see what all the fuss was about.

All I can say is 5 days later I had managed to watch all 24 episodes (some of them twice).  In fact it got so bad towards the end that I began to ration my remaining episodes as I was becoming distraught at the thought not being able to get my daily Lost fix.  Simply put, Lost is one of the best shows I have ever seen on TV, that it aired on ABC and not cable is nothing short of a miracle.

I would advise that you be prepared to set some serious time aside if you buy the first season, as it is very likely you will be watching Lost for 3-4 hours a day for the next week.  I started to promote the show and got one of my friends hooked.  Five days later I got a call at 1 AM (on a Tuesday no less) begging to come over and borrow DVD 6 as he couldn't wait until the next morning to rent it. This is the kind of addiction many of you will be facing

In my opinion the DVD's are the way to go.  Every episode ends with you craving more.

For this reason I seriously debated waiting out the second season and just purchasing it on DVD, but my wife has threatened to torment me with tidbits if I don't watch it with her, so I am now watching the new episodes on Wednesdays.

This is the show  - it has everything from gripping stories, realistic characters and it never slows down.  Going from one theme to another welding characters into one through flashbacks for starters then raising the stakes & above all putting them on an Island that has one heck of a mystery about it.

Great sad that we lost one character and a great actor but with this show you are always learning or getting a further twist when you least expect it.

All credit to the cast they made it so real & this is a global success show it combines everything from race, culture, age, disability etc its all put across superbly & there was at least three episodes that were absoutely heart-breaking to watch.

Wait it go & how long till Season 2!!!  This show has simply went from strength to strength & i loved the finale especially the flashback of them taking there seats on the plane.

This DVD was worth every penny & had plenty of extras included. 10/10!!! & lovely scenery included for free what a concept and an idea that has simply rocked.

The bonus features included on this set are some of the best in all of the TV shows on DVD sets that I have.  Since the DVDs were on the producers' minds since the beginning, there is an indepth documentary on the making of the pilot episodes, including how they bought a plance, cut it up, and shipped it to Hawaii for filming.

As one reviewer said, you will want to share this set with anyone you know who has not seen it.

I read that what turns many people away from Lost are the flashbacks that ""disrupt"" the events on the island.  I have just one thing to say to these people; try watching the show WITHOUT the flashbacks, espiecially the second season premire.

I made my husband start watching it with me, and we are totally addicted.  I cannot imagine how tv fans are able to wait a whole week before seeing the next episode.  We watch 2 or 3 in one shot; many times going to bed very late.....

This show is amazing.  I am familiar with J.J. Abrams work, as I was an avid fan of Felicity's and Alias grew on me after getting over the first 5 episodes which were really bad.  But Abrams seems to be growing better with experience.  Lost is a superior show to Alias.

I will not go over the different aspects of the show, I think talking about events in the show spoils the element of surprise.

But if you love high-quality, suspenseful, entertaining, amazing tv, then you must get LOST.

There were only a few real stand outs and ""Lost"" was by and far the best of the bunch.  When I first heard the premise - a group of people crash land on an island - my first thought was just how far can this show go?  I mean, you crash on an island and then it's fictional ""Survivor"".  Right?  Then I remembered ""Gilligan's Island"" lasted 3 years!

But this isn't your comedic Skipper with Gilligan for a side kick.  Each major character has a major back story.  And there's something on the island - your guess is as good as mine.

I think that's why I like this show so much.  Every week you think you've figured out something and the show proves you wrong.  It keeps you guessing what's coming next.

Yet I didn't deign to tune in until nearly the end of the first season. What a shame! I see now what I was missing. ""Lost"" would have been a standout in the days when well written, well acted TV shows were the norm and not the exception. In today's sad state of network programming, it is a true gem. Brilliantly crafted, never predictable, with complex storylines, it compells us to think about what we're watching, rather than passively waiting to be entertained.

1550739,5,B00005JNOG,"I thought that ""Lost"" was the best show on television last year, even without this week's validation with the Emmy for Best Dramatic Series.  Creators Jeffrey Lieber (""Tangled""), J.J. Abrams (""Alias""), and Damon Lindelof (""Crossing Jordan"") took an airplane crashing on an island in the middle of south Pacific after taking off from Australia, made it a mystery as well as an adventure series, and throw in weekly flashbacks regarding the characters.  This becomes important because the people are as much of a mystery as the island.  One of the things I love about ""Lost"" is how the revelations of a flashback force you to go back and rethink what is happening.  Learning that Locke (Terry O'Quinn) was a paraplegic before the plane crashed on the island (""Walkabout"") is as important an insight as knowing the epistemological positions of the English philosopher of the same name.  Besides, any given flashback is but one episode in the previous life of a given character, and on this show sooner or later everybody gets a second bite of the apple (as Locke gets in ""Deus Ex Machina"").

It is also important that ""Lost"" is a mystery where you really need to pay attention to clues.  In this regard it is like ""Twin Peaks,"" where the clues were all there and they showed you who killed Laura Palmer at the end of the first season but did not tell you, which confounded many viewers who praised the need to pay attention the David Lynch's quirky series.  Fortunately ""Lost"" is not reducible to a single question and even to the extent that ""What is down the hatch?"" is the big question of the summer, we know that it is a transitory issue and that other questions remain to be discovered as well as answered.

I also like the fact that it is so easy to forget that Jack (Matthew Fox) and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) are core couple, if not the stars, of the show.  Throw in Sawyer (Josh Holloway) and you have you basic love triangle, only with lots of baggage (and my favorite moment with the trio ends up being when Jack gives Sawyer the gun and Sawyer responds with the story of his meeting with Jack's father in ""Exodus, Part 1"").  My favorite character is Sayid (Naveen Andrews), and between him and Kaysar on ""Big Brother 6"" it has been great to see something on television other than Arabs as terrorists.  Of course everybody loves Hurley (Jorge Garcia), Dominic Monaghan has put the whole hobbit thing behind him with Charlie Pace, it is great to see Harold Perrineau playing a character that can walk as Michael, and at least this time Emilie de Ravin's character Claire Littleton has had a human baby (or HAS she?).

Having season one of ""Lost"" out on DVD right before season two starts is great, not only so that those who missed out on the fun the first time around can catch up, but also so that those of us who have been around from the start can go back and try connecting some more of the dots.  Did I not notice that in Part 2 of the ""Pilot"" that there was a polar bar in the comic book that Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) was reading or did I simply forget?  What about the two stones, one black and one white, that they found with the corpses in ""House of the Rising Sun""?  At the top of my wish list is does it matter that all of the magic numbers are those that have been retired by the New York Yankees: 4 (Lou Gehrig), 8 (Bill Dickey and Yogi Berra), 15 (Thruman Munson), 16 (Whitey Ford), 23 (Don Mattingly), and 42 (Jackie Robinson, who did not play for the Yankees but MLB retired his number)?  There are so many questions and clues, and perhaps the greatest testament to this series is that we are not in a hurry to find out and are perfectly content to let them parcel out answers and more clues slowly but surely.  Everyone is in for the long haul this time around and it is absolutely great.

For commentary tracks there are a few, but they are decent.  Co-creators J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, and executive producer Bryan Burk do the pilot episode; Terry O'Quinn, executive producer Jack Bender, and co-executive producer David Fury, show up for ""Walkabout,"" an episode that was nominated for a writing Emmy; Dominic Monaghan, Lindelof and Burk do ""The Moth""; and executive producer Carlton Cuse, supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach, Maggie Grace and Ian Somerhalder do the commentary track for ""Hearts and Minds.""  You have to remind yourself that the actors are not really the characters, so that mabye Jorge Garcia doing commentary for ""Numbers"" or Naveen Andrews for ""Solitary"" would not be as interesting as you would think (and if the writers did the commentary tracks they would have to keep remembering not to give things away).  But then this DVD set is loaded with other extras, so it is hard to complain on that score.

Hopefully ""Lost"" will be able to build on its successful first season, although the initial auspices are not good as new people are showing up from the mainland in Hawai'i to fix a show that is not broke.  Hearing that they are retroactively trying to make their changes in the scripts for season two fit what happened last year is not good news.

1550840,5,B00005JNOG,"ABC's ""Lost"" -- which just won the 2004-05 Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series for what it marked its debut season -- is now available on DVD and it ranks as a must-have.

48 passengers enroute from Australia to L.A. crash somewhere in the South Pacific, offtrack by more than 1,000 miles. There's mysteries as to how it all happened and will they be found. And there's some scary stuff on the island on which they must now live.

14 characters are focused. From one episode to another we get richly textured background stories on all the characters -- why they ended up on that ill-fated Oceanic Flight 815; where they each originated (only one is truly from Down Under); and what kinds of lives did they have before they became lost.

One of the worst things anyone can do when writing a review of a film or television show is to include too much information. It can, unintentionally, reveal too much information and subsequently deny the motivation of those unfamiliar not to be bothered in taking a journey.

This is one adventure for which it is well-worth getting ""Lost."" Created by ""Alias'"" J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, this is escapist-adventure series that has huge scope and takes on hurdles over which they gladly jump...and succeed.

Though I have a slight annoyance about the packaging with regards to accessing the discs, this is such a minor flaw I can live with.  The contents make up for it in spades.

The story itself is very engrossing, and what makes a great movie or tv series is the story and the character/s.  While some have found the show to be frustrating due to several unanswered questions regarding the mysteries and circumstances surrounding the island, its essential in building tension and excitement.  Surely one should not expect that the show's creators and writers would expose all secrets before the season is even over.  If they did, what point would there be to continue producing?  While it may be excruciating to be constantly kept in the dark about what's really going on in that insane island, I only look at it as the show's way of preparing us for greater things to come.",1126915200,5,1035,4.556756756756757
1550842,5,B00005JNOG,"It is a pleasant surprise to come across a network television that is both immensely good and immensely popular.  Many of my favorite shows (Boom Town, Wonder Falls, Firefly) from earlier seasons have sufferered premature demsies brought on by short sighted networks.  Judging the response to the first season of Lost I think that we will have our mysterious island for quite a while yet.

First and foremost Lost is a psychological drama, built around an enormously talented and diverse ensemble cast.  They are stranded on an island and confronted with situations that range from the mundane to the truly bizarre (polar bears and an unseen monstrous entity for instance).  Each episode highlights an individual character and uses flash backs to pivotal events in their past that inform their current actions.  These flash backs and the ongoing story line mesh to reveal the nature of the characters, and pieces to the puzzle that is the mystery of the island.

Standout characters include Jack, a heroic surgeon afflicted by blind stubborness and guilt; Kate, a beautiful women of many talents and a dark past; Charlie, a strung-out, burnt-out, has-been rock star looking for a purpose in his life; Locke, a man who embraces the strangeness of the island and is duly rewarded; Sayid, a one time Republican Guard Intelligence officer seeking redemption; Sawyer, a sarcastic, self-loathing con-man with a heart of... well that would be telling; and Hurley, huge, good-hearted, optimistic and very funny.  Other characters have yet to be fully fleshed, but I looking forward to seeing more of Michael, Walt, Sun, Jin, Shannon and Claire in the next season.

Overall, Lost is an experience that I could not recommend more strongly.  With production values, writing, directing and acting all better than most movies; this sprawling, novel for television is also one of the most daring and innovative series to come along in a long time.",1126828800,7,1933,5.0886075949367084

1550844,5,B00005JNOG,"Having seen about half of an episode (the one dealing with Sawyer's first flashbacks), I was hooked enough to buy the entire season for my girlfriend's birthday.  I'm normally a little skeptical of anything on TV not created by HBO, but rest assured, this DVD is worth the money and more.  The basic structure of the show, following the double-episode pilot which introduces all the characters and the thrilling post-crash incidents, is to use 3/4 of the running time on events occuring within the island, and about 1/4 on flashbacks regarding a specific character.  To say the least, this structure works out beautifully.  The cinematography, acting, and especially the writing is on par with the best you'll see in any television serial or movie these days.  However, these compliments are not without concerns.  The quality of this show goes through a very specific shift, from great to good, following the completion of the fourth disc (there are six in total and 24 episodes).

  I'd like to focus first on the great four discs that begin the show, or 16 episodes.  In these, the cinematography and acting are absolutely amazing.  The events on the island are varied and consistently fascinating, and the ensemble cast is handled somewhwere in the level of mastery.  The viewer never knows what to expect, or what will happen next, and beyond that, there are a plethora of well-acted, believable characters that are certain to have their own respective fan-following.  Taking this to the next level, however, are the flashbacks sequences.  These minute to two minute scenes, sprinkled across each and every episode, transcend regular television and truly blew me away.  Instead of being cliched scenes that fit the characters into blocks, they were complex, expertly written pieces that were sometimes borderline heartbreaking, sometimes simply gripping character studies.  Think of a small, perfectly crafted art-house film sandwiched in between a well-made suspense/adventure series, and that's the way every episode on those first four discs felt.  Literally, the first 16 episodes, and for sure the first 12, are astounding feats of television.  I remember looking at my girlfriend and saying, ""this is better than Sopranos, and there isn't a single weak episode.""

  Unfortunately, these things changed.  It's hard to determine why, but the series sent certain characters on second flashbacks, and they suddenly began to loose their powerful, well-acted hold and began to jump into the realm of melodrama.  Furthering the problem was that the events on the island became way too plot-oriented, and there was more and more of characters acting like puppets for the forwarding the plot instead of acting three-dimensional like they did before.  Also, the three main plot elements...the existence of ""others,"" the identity of the violent creature, and the truth behind the ""hatch"" in the ground...none of these were ever uncovered.  I understand the need to build this into a second season and beyond, but after 24 episodes there should be SOME revelations regarding everything the first half hinted at.  Don't expect ANY revelations in this first season...or at least not much.  Despite these disappointments, the last part of the first season was still good and even gripping, but it just didn't touch upon the professional, almost mesmerizing quality of the first four discs.  Again, it's hard to explain exactly why, but the series just slipped up a little bit.  Not much--but enough to notice.  Nevertheless, I would recommend the DVD set for the show as a whole and especially for the superior quality of the first four discs, which borders on expertise film-making, acting, and writing.  Think of it as owning 16 perfect mini-movies...regardless of the final product.  Just don't be surprised when the melodrama and vagueness takes over a little at the end.  Here's hoping that the second season began how the first did--and not how it ended.",1126742400,5,3956,5.160125588697017
1550845,5,B00005JNOG,"Last season my friends urged me to watch this show and I didn't listen. I don't watch a lot of television anymore. Other than sports, there never seems to be much good on. I figured this show would be a sappy cross between a nighttime soap and Survivor, with beautiful people posturing on the beach.

Nothing could be further from the truth. This show is an existentialist masterpiece. A group of unrelated people are stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific when their plane goes down. Nobody comes for them and they have to survive on their own. To make matters worse, strange things seem to be happening on the island. Creatures they can't quite see, but which are big and strong enough to knock down trees, chase after them when they venture too far into the jungle. To top it all off, the survivors have carried as much emotional baggage onto the island as they have regular baggage.

Besides the happenings on the island, each week the show flashes back to the past of one of the major characters. This makes the show as much a character study as it is anything else. I like how the characters are shown as fully developed people rather than the melodramatic heroes and villains you find in most series. There is an Asian couple from the old school. The husband is very strict with his wife but you can see how deeply he loves her. The protagonist, played by Mathew Fox, is a pretty good guy but he's got his issues too. By far, the most fascinating character in the show is the enigmatic John Locke. Locke alternates between noble and creepy. In many ways, he personifies the island and the show.

Every once in a while I'll come across a movie or novel that captures my imagination and I can't wait to get back to it. Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Matrix come to mind for movies. The best of King, Grisham and Clancy come to mind for novels. Someone will ask me if I can recommend something and after I do, I'll envy that person for the incredible journey they are about to take.

Each person has something in their past and while nothing really seems to add up as to why they are on the Island, it gives the viewer a deep insight into who each person is. Kate is a fugative but is she ""bad""... her flash backs indicate no, although they leave us craving to know exactly what it is she did. Jack is a doctor (a quite good one considereing how many people he saves with limited supplies) who was supposed to bring his father back for a funeral. Unfortunatley, the crash altered those plans, but his past comes back to haunt him in a near fatal way. John Locke is a mysterious hunter type who keeps to himself. His past is troubled with rejection and scams and he seems to find it hard to have faith in people, but he still does nice things for everyone else. Clair is pregnant and her baby seems to have a mysterious nature behind it... Jack Sawyer is bent on revenge and is quite cold towards everyone else... Hurley is a multi-millionaire who seems to be haunted by bad luck... Sayid is the Arab intellegence officer who everyone thought was responsible for the crash (his knowledge has helped with the survival very much though)... Shannon and Boone are step siblings who seem to be a little too involved with each other, and Sun and Jin are married, don't speak english, and are torn apart by the secrets each harbor. Michael and Walt are estranged father and son, brought together by the death of Walts mother. Walt seems distant and Michael seems hesitant to try... but their bond will be revealed in the seasons stunning cliff hanger ending.

So much happens. So much goes wrong. It is at the end when it takes on an eerie tone as the ""others"" are comming for them. Yet, who the others are is not really determined, but I have a feeling they are involved with Michael, Walt, Jin, and Sawyer.

It was nearly impossible to stop watching. I sat through it in 3 days... and now I really want more.

A great TV show that deserves to be on DVD.",1126483200,2,2344,4.40877598152425
1550931,5,B00005JNOG,"This show is incredible.  If you like Alias, you'll love this show.  It is one of the best, most multi-genre shows i've seen in a long time.  This not only goes for the drama, but adds suspense, horror, thrills, action, and even a little comedy.  These actors have incredible skill, as does Abrams.  When i first saw the previews for this show, i wasn't sure if it would be all that great.  But when i read a preview about it in a magazine and saw that it looked like a pretty neat show, i watched the pilot.  I INSTANTLY FELL IN LOVE WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!  This show somewhat resembles the essence of buffy, with less humor.  If you can only watch one show this fall, watch lost.",1126396800,5,676,4.301587301587301
1550932,5,B00005JNOG,"First of all, let me just say that I love Lost.  I started watching it for Dominic Monaghan (Go Charlie!), but I stayed for the drama, humor, action, and just plain fun.

Now for the actual DVD set, it's pretty good.  The blooper real is fun, all of the extras on the seventh disc are worth watching.  They are insightful, humorous, and concise. Most of them are fairly short, usually under twenty minutes.  My personal favorites were Kate's audition tape, On Set with Jimmy Kimmel, and the Salute to Lost.  The pilot commentary (both parts) was informative and entertaining.  The Moth commentary was also worth listening to, with lots of self-deragatory jokes shared all around.

There are a few problems, though all of them are practical.  They got entirely too clever with the menus.  They attempt to channel the Lost logo with every title on the screen, fading them from view.  Unfortunately, on the menus, this means you can barely read text on the bottom or side of the screen.  Also, they package the actual DVDs on top of each other... So to remove the second DVD from the case, you also have to remove the first.  I understand that they did this to save space on our shelves, but it's one of those things that are minor and REALLY annoying at the same time.  Other than that, the DVD's great!

Aside from some minor practical issues, this DVD set is perfect!  The content contained within is wonderful, and the price is awesome.  7 discs for 40 bucks?  It's a great deal nowadays.  I recomend this set if you haven't watched the show, and especially if you have.",1126396800,7,1571,4.586330935251799
1550933,5,B00005JNOG,"Before buying this DVD set, I had never seen the show.  But, I had heard nothing but good things about it and really wanted to start watchin it before Season 2 started.  And now I must say that if you are gonna take a risk on buying any TV DVD set, without prior viewing of the show, this is the one to get.  From the first episode I was hooked and as Im getting through the first season I am becoming more and more amazed at how good a show this is.  At the point Im at right now, there has not been too much revealed about the island, but what has really sucked me in is the incredible writing and the characters/back stories.  Several times, events will unfold or be shown in flashbacks that will just make the jaw drop.  The unexpected twists and events will leave you wanting more.  This is by far, one of the best new shows out there.  So, to anyone not knowing if they should get it or not, just get it.. you'll be glad you did.",1126396800,,935,4.0710382513661205
1550934,5,B00005JNOG,"I watched the first season of Lost in summer reruns, and marvelled at JJ Abrams' ability to weave a story of mystery and intrigue.  If you merely think it's ""Castaway on TV,"" you have no idea the delight that awaits you.

The show has a rich ensemble cast with fantastic chemistry.  Characters love and hate each other exactly as much as they should, and the constant flashbacks to life before the crash are subtle and surprising enough to constantly redifine your perceptions of them all.  (Much like his show, Alias, Abrams succeeds in redifining the characters and plot line of the show with plenty of artful and shocking twists).  The island itself is the grandest character, however, and with strange shadowy monsters, hidden weapons, walking dead, strange transmissions, cursed lotto numbers, and a mysterious hatch, there's plenty to keep any viewer interested.

If you like action or romance, this show has both of them done to perfection.  I'm a huge fan of Alias, and I thought JJ Abrams first show would be his masterpiece since it is one of the best on TV.  Lost, however, proves Abram's skill (and actually makes me want to watch Mission Impossible 3 which he's set to direct) and perhaps bests Alias.

Refreshingly, this show breaks many TV formulas, and in a welcome change, characters you come to love over many episodes are just as likely to die as the ""redshirt"" newbies who pop up from time to time.  I love a show where any character can die, and this one proves that's the case.  When a creature stalks a character, I get nervous now, wondering if he/she will actually make it--that's rare and welcome to mainstream television!

The DVD set is a solid one as well.  The packaging is unique and nice, with solid plot summary for each episode.  The extras are awesome on the final disk with great documentaries on the making of the show, how they faked the crash site, some entertaining deleted scenes, and even interesting commentary in an age where commentary is often dull.  Even watching the opening screens for the DVDs is fun with some random variations, and there are plenty of easter eggs (I found two already).

The other perk is that if you don't have a DVR, the disks will let you see minor things in the background.  (Scenes like Hurley being put in a cop car on the nightly news in the background of a flashback long before we see any of Hurley's flashbacks are easy to spot and revisit on DVD.)  There is so much embedded in each episode, DVD is the only way to untangle the mystery.

The only downside to this set is that it's only the first season!  Don't wait.  Buy lost and watch the new season, so they keep making them, and I can keep watching them.  If you like the mystery and awesome character redefinition Lost, you should rush to Alias next.  It's just as good.",1126310400,5,2805,4.610887096774194
1550935,5,B00005JNOG,"I saw all but 2 of the episodes during the first season (I managed to miss BOTH when they were re-run for the first time too) and have finally gone back to watch them (""Walkabout"" and ""Solitary"").  Both were among the best of the first season, especially ""Walkabout.""

My one minor quarrel with the set was that I wish they had taken the deleted/extended scenes (incl. the 2 unused flashbacks) and dropped them in where they were originally supposed to go, a la the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies.  It wouldn't have extended the episodes more than a couple minutes here and there and would have made the viewing experience that much higher a quality.

The bonus stuff would still be just that: a bonus, but now I have the feeling that ""there's something that should go here but I'd have to change discs to see it"" whenever I watch an episode that was cut to fit into an hour of primetime TV.

Can't wait for season 2.",1126310400,2,936,4.4186046511627906

Just the mystery that surrounds this show will keep you coming for more! What is that monster that lurks in the bushes? Why are people after Claire? What's the deal with the numbers? What's inside the hatch? And why did the plane crash there in the first place? It is so mysterious, funny, and pleasurable that it will keep you wanting more!

This set gave me the chance to watch a few of the episodes I had missed during the season, and allowed me to ""catch more details"" on the episodes I had already seen.  I really enjoyed watching the audition tapes of the various cast members (Hurley originally read for Sawyer's part, Sun read for the part of Kate, Michael Keaton was slated to play the part of Jack.....) and was interested to learn how characters were actually created based on the actor and actresses auditions!  For example, Sun read for the part of Kate - she wasn't right for that character, so they actually created a character for her because they were so impressed by her tape!  I'm a big fan of ""bloopers"" so I would have liked to have seen more than the 5 minutes or so of what was provided, but they were fun to watch none-the-less!  All in all, if you are a fan of the show, this is a great behind-the-scene look at a show that really must be seen more than once to get ""the whole picture""!",1126224000,,1081,4.279411764705882
1551018,5,B00005JNOG,"I just finished blasting the House DVD set for its poor presentation of a great series, and Lost came in the mail.  I was really impressed not only by the 5.1 sound, but the mixing as well.  In CSI, for example, the sound is 5.1, but there is little benefit to it.  Here, the mixing is wondeful, and if you want proof, just listen to the first time the thing in the forest starts roaring and moving trees!  Furthermore, this one is in beautiful anamorphic widescreen.  The care in production is on a par with the Star Trek DVD's, but at a far lower price.  If I must register a complaint, it is in the package itself.  What is with this new thing where each disk is staggered over another?  If you want disk 2, you have to remove disk 1 to get at it, and so forth.  Nevertheless, this is a must buy.  I hope other producers look to this as a gold standard for DVD sets.",1126224000,3,869,4.119047619047619

1551021,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost was easily the best show of the 2004-2005 TV season, and one of the better shows to debut in the last 10 years or so. By now everyone knows the premise. What makes the show great is the amazing cast and film-worthy production values. Each week couldn't come fast enough and when watching an episode, the hour flew by leaving you breathless and wanting more - pretty much everything you could ask for from an hour long network drama. Yeah drama, that's right. It does have elements of fantasy & sci-fi, but they're just devices to put the characters into situations where they can really shine. Lost is a character study and is at its best in the quiet moments in between the mechanical/black-shadow beast and the hatch to God-knows-where. It's interesting to see where these people are in their lives on the island, what came before, and where they are headed as individuals and as a group. There really isn't a single uninteresting one in the whole bunch.

As far as the DVD goes - every studio and production company take note: this is how it's done. Just as the special editions of Lord of the Rings are the benchmark of Movie DVDs, Lost represents the best of TV DVDs. Excellent commentary (with asides -great feature) and great docs/bonus content. It's a seven DVD set (25 hours just of the actual show excluding extras) and you get it for less than $40. This is one of the best values out there. HBO DVD take note: $100 for a 13 ep run is a rip off.

If you're a fan, buy it. If you haven't seen Lost yet or are intimidated by a show with an arc that demands you pay attention from week-to-week, show-to-show, and rewards you with fine escapist entertainment - Buy It Now... you won't be sorry, don't miss out on a wonderful and intelligent show.

NOTE: Some fans have complained that the first season finale didn't answer enough questions and raised new ones - Welcome to serialized TV. What did you expect? They weren't gonna blow their wad at the end of only one season. Yeah I want answers too but having a little patience and trusting that the writers know what they're doing is all part of the experience. Relax, season two is only weeks away and in just like no time the new eps will fly by and we'll all be wondering what the hell is going to happen in season three.

Note 2: Season four just ended and after a few stumbles in seasons 2 and the first part of 3, Lost is better than it has ever been. If you ditched out of frustration or for whatever reason, do yourself a favor and catch up on all the episodes because season 4 is right on par with season 1. Answers have been given and the plot is lean and progressing nicely. Plus, Lost is the only show that hasn't seem to diminish in quality since the writers strike. Lost is currently the most compelling show on TV right now.",1126051200,10,2800,4.399613899613899
1551022,5,B00005JNOG,"On a routine flight from Australia to Los Angeles, an Oceanic Airlines flight crashes.  The survivors find themselves on an uncharted island, miles off course.  If anyone is looking for them, they are looking in the wrong place.

If it were a matter of simple surviving, these survivors might have had a chance.  But that's not all there is.  A strange creature kills the pilot.  A group finds a radio signal calling for help that's been going for years.  And this group is not alone on the island.

Of course, as the group settles in, they get to know each other, and relationships begin to develop.  Other relationships begin to fall apart in the stress of the situation.  And everybody has a story, which is told to us in flashbacks, complimenting the action on the island.

I tuned in for the pilot for many reasons.  Survivors on an island always interest me.  And I'm a big fan of ALIAS, also from one of the creators of this show.  I was hooked from the beginning and couldn't wait to tune in each week to see what was going to happen.  With 14 main characters, some only get a scene or two in some episodes, but we might learn about them in the next episode with a series of flashbacks.

Everybody seems to have their favorite characters.  Many people tuned in for Dominic Monaghan, fresh off of LORD OF THE RINGS.  Matthew Fox was also a well-known name before hand.  Personally, I was thrilled to see Daniel Dae Kim, who I've been watching show up on various shows since his days on CRUSADE.  And I've also enjoyed seeing Mira Furlan from BABYLON 5 on another show, even if it's only as a guest star.

It seems the more we learn about the characters, the more questions that are asked.

Some people find that frustrating.  The season finale leaves us with no answers to the questions we've had all season, and the number of questions have only increased.  Personally, I don't expect all the answers until the show is over, so I'm willing to wait out the ride, hoping that Abrams won't give in to pressure to give us answers like he did in ALIAS.  I also hope we get answers before the show ends and it's not dragged out needlessly.

So, is the set worth it for fans of the show?  Absolutely!  The show is presented in wide screen, which was what it was shot for.  The surround sound is incredible.  You can hear the bugs in the jungle or the waves on the shore.  Yet the sound effects aren't overwhelming.  They're just right to make you feel like you're there.  There are five commentary tracks with various members of the cast and crew.  And the seventh disc is nothing but bonus material, with documentaries on the creation of the series, casting (with interesting casting videos, sometimes of an actor auditioning for another roll), and creating the pilot.  For fun, there's information on Driveshaft and bloopers.  Plus nineteen minutes of deleted scenes.  The set itself looks nice, but the way the discs are set in the case makes three of them hard to get out.  You have to move out the one in front to get to the one behind.  It's not a big issue, but it is annoying.

This shows combines an intriguing story with interesting characters and great writing and acting.  I can't wait until season 2 starts.",1126051200,3,3221,4.503460207612457

1551024,5,B00005JNOG,"LOST The Complete First Season is one of the best TV shows (along with Desperate Housewives) to come out in a long time. In a world where silly reality TV seems to have taken over, it is refreshing to see a quality show out there like LOST. I had never seen an episode of Lost until I watched the entire DVD set. I was afraid to give it a chance when it was on TV, but after seeing mostly positive reviews from people here on amazon I figured I would give the show a chance. All I can say is I am glad I did. Lost is one of the few shows that hooks you in, gets you addicted, and takes you on this emotional journey with the characters. I give Disney a lot of credit for releasing such a beautiful DVD set. They really put much time and effort in to the LOST DVD set and it shows. The set is a digipak which slides out of the plastic sleeve from the bottom, and opens to hold the 7 discs. Three of the digipak panels contain 2 overlapping (think Lois & Clark: the New Adventures of Superman) discs, and the 7th disc stands alone. People may complain about the overlapping discs, but the packaging looks great and is a space saver on the shelf. I was very pleased with the amazing piture quality and the amazing sound. LOST is presented in its original anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1) presentation. The sound is in 5.1 Dolby Digital and makes you believe you're there in the middle of the action.

1551118,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost was rejected by some viewers just due to all the re-runs. Which is probably the only excuse anyone could come up with to not like this show. It's a poor excuse too. Sure re-runs are frustrating when you're hooked on a show and want new episodes. However I remember times when Buffy or Smallville were on re-runs for weeks and weeks. I've even seen 1 star reviews here for that reason and it's just dumb. Every show has a big ammount of re-run breaks after a certain time. If you're hating on this show for that reason and then you're a baby and this show is too good for you lol.

  Lost offers engaging stories, a fine cast, interesting plot twists and some of the best acting I've seen on tv in years. A plane crashes on an island and 40 people survive. There's only 14 of them that we really get to know though. Matthew Foxx plays a doctor named Jack who takes charge of the situation. Whenever there's a problem people come to him. Whether someone needs to be attended to or if they're out of bottled water, he's the man they complain to. Since he always does the right thing, he's not a bad guy to have in charge. There's also Kate (Evangeline Lilly) who's a misunderstood women on the run. She and Jack  strike a friendship right away with some friendly flirtation. They'll probably get together sooner or later. But she also has Sawyer (Josh Holloway) as an option . He's a slick wiseass who's also misunderstood and fighting inner-demons as well. Both can have trouble getting people to trust them too.

  Although Jack, Kate and Sawyer have their love triangle going on. This isn't no mushy soup opera. It's about people who were lost before they even got on the island.  Because they were lost almost mentally and  find themselves again on that island. We get flashbacks showing how their lives weren't exactly great before the island. Plus the show is brilliant how it handles prejudice and humanity. How people get things done quicker if they learn to get along.

  It also has it's supernatural side with something lurking in the jungle ripping survivors of the crash to shreds. Plus with a crippled survivor finding he can walk after the crash  on the island. A pregnant women who gets told by a Psychic that only she can raise her baby and that it's special. Also polar bears  are on the island causing havoc and no one knows how they got there. They also have to contend with dangerous mysterious people that weren't even on the plane.

  Lost is the most daring and unpredictable show to land on tv in a long long time. This review doesn't even give the show justice to how good it is. There's so much to cover but it's better to just let you see for yourself if you haven't already. If you gave up on this show because of re-runs then you should get this dvd to see how much of a mistake you made.",1125964800,5,2820,4.434108527131783
1551119,3,B00005JNOG,"In the act of establishing about a dozen regular cast members the television show Lost wore many people's patience thin.  There were standout characters like Sawyer, Kate, and Locke just to name a few but in setting up backstory it often seemed like nothing was really happening.

  Mysterious creature chases lead character in jungle..., flashback.  Lead argues with other lead..., flashback.  There was quite a bit of compelling story to tell but the extreme amount of backstory will deter many from this solid TV show.

  Its also very different from most programs on TV.  It deals largely on flashbacks about the characters lives before the plane crash which made them lost to begin with, but bigger than that the show often delves into the supernatural which can also put off many who are expecting easy answers and tidy solutions to the characters problems.  The supernatural element is most prevalent in the character Locke who has changed the most in the plane crash but also seems to become the wise old sage on the island and he knows much more than someone with his backstory would seem to know.

  Overall if you enjoy a good mystery with solid acting (except maybe by Hurley played by Jorge Garcia) then Lost will keep you entertained, especially the DVD where impatient viewers can skip through boring characters and dull storylines.",1125964800,3,1347,4.902654867256637
1551120,5,B00005JNOG,"Clearly the creators of Lost know their audience very well judging by the number of meaty extras that cater to the obsessive fan. These commentaries and featurettes explain a lot about the mechanics of the show without giving away any of the mysteries.

On the first DVD, there are audio commentaries for both parts of the ""Pilot"" episode by executive producers J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk. They talk briefly about how they pitched the show and take us through the making of the episode. In an interesting moment, Abrams actually stops the episode to show us how they did an explosion in the crash site sequence. These are very informative tracks with lots of anecdotes about filming.

There is an audio commentary on ""Walkabout"" by executive producers Jack Bender and David Fury and actor Terry O'Quinn. Bender talks about the challenge of working with trained wild boars that ate too much and didn't feel like moving in a scene that required them to charge the actors. Unfortunately, O'Quinn doesn't talk much only offering brief insights.

The second DVD includes a commentary for ""The Moth"" by Lindelof, Burk and actor Dominic Monaghan. The Lord of the Rings alum tends to spend most of the time cracking jokes and offering little insight on this so-so track.

The fourth DVD features an audio commentary on ""Hearts and Minds"" by executive producer Carlton Cuse, supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach and actors Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder. The two producers dominate the track as they talk about their intentions with the actors offering their occasional two cents.

The bulk of the extras can be found on the seventh DVD. ""The Genesis of Lost"" is a good look at how the show's story came together. The network had a script but it was awful. At the time, Abrams was the network's go-to guy and he had already been toying with an idea of a plane crashing on a deserted island.

""Designing a Disaster"" takes a look at how they put together the chaotic crash site in the ""Pilot"" episode. The creators had no script and very little time but the production crew was able to find the right plane, take it apart, ship it and put it back together (sort of).

""Before They Were Lost"" examines how the cast came together in only three weeks. The actors talk about how they got the gig with footage from their audition tapes.

""Welcome to Oahu: The Making of The Pilot"" takes us through the first day of filming to completion. Cast and crew recount the sometimes harsh weather conditions they had to shoot in but it did help them bond as a team.

""The Art of Matthew Fox"" is a collection of photographs the actor took while shooting the ""Pilot."" He talks about them as they flash on the screen in this nice extra.

""Lost@Comicon"" is a brief clip of some of the cast and crew at that year's San Diego Comicon and their impressions of the event.

""Lost: On Location"" is a collection of behind-the-scenes featurettes that give insight into how certain sequences in select episodes were achieved, like the least-threatening wild boars, the humanizing of Sawyer, the revelation of Kate as a fugitive bank robber and a look at the climatic season finale.

""Onset with Jimmy Kimmel"" features the late night talk show host visiting the cast on location in Hawaii in this whimsical extra. Kimmel asks Monaghan to compose a (lame) theme song for the show and goofs around with everyone.

""Backstage with Driveshaft"" takes a look at Charlie and his fictitious band, which thinks of themselves as the next Oasis but is probably only a one-hit wonder.

There are two flashbacks from the season finale with Claire and Sayid.

Also included are 13 deleted scenes that feature mostly minor exchanges between characters, like a nice bit where Charlie bums a cigarette off of Sawyer, that are interesting but not essential and were probably cut because of time.

""Bloopers from the Set"" is an amusing montage of blown lines and funny pratfalls on this very physically demanding show.

Finally, there is a Q&A session ""Live from the Museum of Television and Radio."" The select cast and crew joke with each other in this entertaining if not frivolous extra.

1551122,5,B00005JNOG,"I don't know why people have to speak so poorly about shows like LOST.  I think it's a great story and it's very captivating.  I don't think they dwell too much on the secrets and I love the flashbacks.  Just watching a bunch of people walk around an island can get boring so the flashbacks provide some relief.  Personally I think I'm one of the few people who was not taken in by the SOPRANOS and I don't really like the show but I realize that many people couldn't live without it, it's just not for me.  I think LOST is an AWSOME show and everyone should at least give it a chance.  I wouldn't spend $40 on something without watching some of it so watch an episode or two before you but the first season.

Imagine my disapointment then when I was confronted by poor casting, weak characters, poor dialogue and one helluva drawn out plot. The few moments of action are often interspersed with long periods of boredom and the characters sometimes behave ridiculously and beyond reason.

If you want to watch monsters maruading about on an Island then watch Jurassic park instead.

If HBO had made this series, it would've kicked ass!.",1125792000,32,559,5.1208791208791204

If you loved the later seasons of The X-Files or Alias, where they kept dancing around the same ""secrets"" without ever giving any answers, then Lost is the show for you.

If you want to watch a show that actually goes somewhere and whose writers have an idea about where they are taking the story, then stay as far away from Lost as possible.",1125792000,32,590,4.25
1551125,5,B00005JNOG,"ABC was in the ratings dumpster for so long that they finally decided that they had nothing to lose, so they took a chance a put show in the 2004-2005 lineup that was actully worth the time.

""Lost"" is great storytelling, great writing, great acting, and great television.  Those that are irritated by the flashbacks are missing a lot of important layers to the story.  Letting the characters reveal what they're about in a flashback has much more dramatic punch, and makes them more believable, than just having them tell you, ""I was a paraplegic"" or ""A psychic told me that danger surrounds my unborn child"" or ""I broke into a bank to steal a toy airplane out of a safe deposit box"" or ""I won the lottery using cursed numbers"".  The flashbacks also offer some juciy bits of information that could never believably come up otherwise, clues to the mystery of the flight, the crash, the island, the ironies, and how it's all connected, and how all the survivors paths have crossed before.  It's not just a TV show; it's a jigsaw puzzle to be solved.  And trying to solve it is part of the fun of the show.

It's so sad to me that some people really want to skip the puzzle and just have everything resolved for them.  Anything to not exercise the brain - and unfortunately, for many years now, that has pulled down the quality of television overall, because the powers that be have been providing what this crowd has been demanding.  Too many people would rather be spoon-fed.  The best television is a show that makes you think, question, or consider what you never would have considered before.  This show is not for the lazy viewer looking to just kick back after work and allow their brains to turn into mush.  If you'd rather not think about anything at all, then this show is not for you.

When I first heard about it, my first thought was that the producers were crazy to limit themselves to a deserted island - how could it ever get to Season 2 since they're limiting the number of storylines/episodes that they could tell.  After all, one of the things that made Gilligan's Island so stupid was that there were only so many stories they could tell before it became completely redundant, with only one location and only 7 characters, so it got stale very quickly (and I'll never figure out why that show lasted as long as it did).  But I've liked Matthew Fox ever since ""Party of Five"" (another excellent TV show), so I decided to just watch the pilot (and I'm so glad that the producers decided not to go with their original plan to kill him off).  I've been hooked ever since.  My original thought was wrong - they didn't limit the stories they could tell at all - they're telling one huge story that can't be contained in one episode, and ""limitation"" that they placed on themselves actually forces them to be more creative.

Like ""24"", this series transcends the series format.  Each episode is like one chapter of a great book, as opposed to most series television, where each episode is designed to stand by itself and the rest can be tossed aside.  Watching it requires a commitment to the story, and most shows aren't worth that kind of commitment.

But this one is.  Go along for the ride.  This journey is worth your time.",1125619200,17,3239,4.527491408934708
1551126,5,B00005JNOG,"US TV Drama has become a mighty force to be reckoned with in the last 5 years or so and LOST possible represents the best example of the fearless and groundbreaking dramas to emerge, (see also Sex and the City, The Sopranos, Six Feet Under and Desperate Housewives).
 LOST manages to weld great scripting and storyline pacing with technical wizardry, superb acting and sublime character development. All this alongside a greater sense of the anxiety of the experience of being from, or part of, western culture in the current decade.
 So much of what makes LOST work is the fear experienced by the characters, of their situation, of the unknown and most disturbing of all; fear of those at close quarters.
 What Sex and the City did and and continues to do for updating our notions of sexuality, so LOST seems to capture our looming sense of modern anxiety, the unseen enemy and his/her tactics and the fact that this enemy could be ""out there"" or right next door.
 Undoubtedly bound to be a classic, LOST nudges the great American tv drama another notch up the pole of credibility while yet again showing a floundering Hollywood where it is going wrong. Superb stuff and important social commentry for both now and the future.",1125446400,7,1227,4.746478873239437

1551198,5,B00005JNOG,"We all know that with so many channels available to us, there is a literal ocean of shows, and very few that are really good. In fact, much of what's on TV is just a bunch of programs that distracts us from being bored.

LOST is different, VERY different.

At first I thought, ""A show about a bunch of people stuck on an island? How lame!""

The first 10 minutes WERE visually impressive, packed with the kind of action one usually only sees in a major motion picture. But still, PEOPLE STUCK ON AN ISLAND??? I needed it to be more.

Then I watched as some unseen massive creature wailed and moved through the island forest, bending trees like they were nothing.

And I thought, ""Okay, a bunch of people stuck on an island that apparently has dinosaurs. Really lame.""

But then I wondered, ""Why aren't they showing the creature? I mean, we're not seeing ANY part of this creature. Why the mystery?""

The characters seemed to be more than one-dimentional, what little we were learning about them so far. So I continued watching.

Then the polar bear showed up! A POLAR BEAR? ON A TROPICAL ISLAND?? What the...???

Then there was the radio transmission, a distress call running on a loop. A loop that had been going on for the last 16 years!

The line that followed from Charlie, one of the survivors, summed up my feelings about what all I had just watched: ""Guys, where are we?""

And this was all in just the FIRST EPISODE!

As I watched each week's episode, each week showing us a ""flashback"" from one character (Their life before taking the ill fated flight), as well as what was currently happening on the island, I found myself drawn in deeper...and deeper.

Each character was fresh, I'd never seen characters like these before. On TV or even in movies!

Little (and even BIG) clues would be presented, making me speculate what it meant. Moments and comments in one episode making me think ONE thing, only to reveal itself to be something else by the end of that episode, or in a later episode.

Like the shocking scene of what kind of person Locke was before the plane crash.

Like who Sawyer really was, and why he was acting like such an as...*ahem* jerk.

Like why that toy plane was so important to Kate.

Like what terrible thing Jack had done to his Father.

And interwoven through these moments, is a SOLID story of mystery, humor, and that burning question, ""What IS this island?""

I'm personally not a big TV watcher, since VERY few shows strike me as being more than mind numbing distractions.

LOST however, is more than just a great show, it's one of the most thrilling mysteries I've experienced for as far back as I can remember.

There is NOTHING else that has ever been like this show. Watch just the first episode, and I'm confident that you'll agree.

So to have every single episode available to you, as well as cool bonus features, make this MORE than just another DVD collection to own, it's an adventure in a box!

1551199,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is a cross between the computer game Myst (an interactive mystery staged on an almost deserted island), Survivor, and X-files, which produces a mysterious island filled with action, drama, strange creatures, compelling characters, and true intrigue... and yes it works on many levels.  This is a show which places character development, and strong story lines as its top priorities.  Why did they crash?  Who are the other people on the island?  Why does the miraculous seem to occur?  Is there a dreaded disease infecting the island's long term inhabitants?  Who really are these people on the plane?  What is the monster? And what power or powers are really controlling their fate?

2. great characters.

The story is really deep and there are a lot of little details in the stories that just add to the mystery, but you didn't realize they were important until after the fact (e.g., the consistent reappearing of Hurley's numbers). Being able to go back and watch earlier episodes you can see how the story was coming together and how many aspects of the story have been decided since before the pilot aired. I love stuff like that.

I think the problem that a lot of people have is that they were ""late to the party."" If you haven't seen all of the episodes, the show is boring and probably doesn't make a lot of sense (you might think you understand what's happening, but you probably really don't). Knowing the backstory of the characters is what makes everything interesting, and with each episode we learn more of that backstory, thus making everything that much more exciting. If you're a fan of shows where no thinking is involved, you probably won't enjoy ""Lost.""

1551202,1,B00005JNOG,"""Lost"" is so disappointing. The idea, if not new, is very good, but most of the characters and the storylines are really cliche (the episode ""The Moth"" with its emphatic comparison between Charlie's struggle against his heroin addiction and the moth trying to break its cocoon... please!!). And what about the presence of an eight months pregnant woman on a plane? Isn't it weird, if at all possible?
The flashbacks have no interest except keeping the show running and they don't even make the characters look less archetypal- except for Locke, the most interesting character of the show. The mysterious events that happen on the island may make pepole want to know what is next, but they are never solved because the producers want to make the show run for at least another 3 seasons and they have to keep the audience waiting because it is obvious that they don't have much to tell.
And whatever the explanation for the mysteries may be, nobody will be satisfied because everybody is now expecting too much!
This show could have been good without all these flashbacks which keep you waiting and waiting... So far, there is no clue that the writers know what they are doing. They might as well be the ones who are lost.

1551255,4,B00005JNOG,"I began watching this show during the summer reruns and I have to say that I have never been so quickly addicted to a show, and I love watching TV!  I appreciate programs that are smart, have clever writing and a talented cast, and also are new and innovative.  ""Lost"" combines all of these elements.  It takes a simple lesson that we are all taught at an early age--don't judge a book by its cover--and proves week after week that you never know a person's motivation for doing the things they do.  With each passing episode and each new flashback, I am amazed at how my opinions of characters change.  It's incredible how fickle we are as humans.

I'm not greatly into the supernatural aspects of the show.  They provide an interesting level of tension, but I am much more interested in fleshing out these characters.  Scenes such as Jack explaining to the ticket counter woman in the airport why he needs to be getting on the plane or Jin telling his father that in a good world, his wife would love him instead of her father are not simply good acting, but incredibly talented writing as well.  Everything in this show works so that the CGI effects are the least of my concerns.

The only drawback to watching the reruns this summer was that ABC had to skip certain episodes.  Therefore, I have been salivating at the thought of when the DVDs come out.  Rest assured I will be one of the first people to buy this.  Superior TV doesn't come around very often, so when it does (as in the case of 'Lost', 'Scrubs' and 'Arrested Development') I like to invest in it.  The only reason I gave this set 4 stars instead of 5 is that I haven't seen all of the episodes yet.  I can't wait!!",1124841600,5,1684,4.387096774193548

(Go JJ Abrams)  Two: The trailers made it look like an awesome, freaky monster flick.  I tuned in for the premiere and I absolutely loved it.  I was a lost fan.  The premiere episode had everything that was needed for a premiere ep.  Characters were starting to build relationships and there was suspense around every corner.  It was a phenominal episode.

  As the season progressed though it started to get dull. The first ep was full of the monster but the rest of the eps went on to reveal things about the characters.  Don't get me wrong, it was cool seeing how everything came to be and I liked the originality of how they did the flashbacks, but it got repetative and dull.

  Also, some of the things were just plain too out there.  One character (Awesome Terry O'Quinn - also from Alias) was paralyzed but after the crash he could walk.  Also, some guy had numbers that he thought were unlucky.  OOH spooky.  It just got to unbelievable.

  The main point of the season is ""the hatch""  They find it about half-way through the season.  Then they spend like 10 episodes trying to open it.  The finale give absolutely no answers to the questions that they arose.

  Overall, Lost really drags on the story (what else can they do? They're stuck on an island) If I were you, just stick to buying the pilot DVD or just watch on TV.  It's not worth $50.",1124841600,13,1477,4.406716417910448

Unless the producers and the network decides to establish a finite lifespan for this series, things can only stall out from here. For the successful mystery/thrillers that came before it, there are two paths to mediocrity: the ""X-Files"" approach of leaving the continuing story arc unresolved until the audience drifts from the show or the ""Twin Peaks"" approach of finishing the primary arc and the subsequent story being so weak that interest wanes.  One could argue that two successful mystery/thrillers, ""24"" and ""Buffy"", avoided these pitfalls, but these series have less restrictive concepts than ""Lost"" or ""Twin Peaks"", and their creators wisely structured those shows so that a complete story arc is told in a season and the next season becomes a new adventure.

I suppose in comparison to the reality shows Lost does appear amazing but there are a number of scripted shows (most on cable channels) that are far better, have much more actual depth and thought put into them.

Some people praise Lost's amazing character development but I didn't find it very note-worthy. Kate's toy airplane backstory was just ridiculous.

I doubt the writers have a plan about how to resolve the mysteries.. that they even know where they're going. After 23 episodes viewers still know hardly anything about the island. The writers keep opening new mysteries instead of resolving the existing ones. I suspect they're hoping viewers will forget about the other mysteries because they have no resolutions that wouldn't be a letdown.

I wish I hadn't spent so much trying to figure out what was going on with the island and its characters. The writers are just stringing us along.",1124755200,32,1072,5.045197740112994
1551260,5,B00005JNOG,"First off, I would just like to say that Lost is the greatest show that has ever been aired on television. It is suspenseful, dramatic, emotional, and everything else a show should be. It is unlike any entertainment on television today and deserves to be recognized for that. Yes, I will admit it is slow moving at times and some of the plot twists are a little beyond belief (Charlie coming back to life hint hint), but the island is one of the biggest mysteries on the island and everything can't be believable without explanation.

This Show is what it inspired me to start screenwriting. The writing is phenomanol and never fails to be interesting each week. Everyone is complaining that none of the questions were answered by the end of the season, but the mysteries are not the only focus of the show. If it ewas, it would be like every other stupid sci-fi show that has no depth to it and is only based on thrill and action and intrigue. Yes, that is a very essential part to lost, but should not be the focus.

The focus of the show is to tug on your emotions. You can't tell me I am the only person who felt a deep sense of sadness inside for the characters as they boarded the plane, enkowing of their fate in the last episode. I felt like I knew these people and connected with their pasts. Am i the only one that felt a pang of sorrow as they showed Boone looking for Shannon's inhaler on the plane before takeof? The only one that felt moved as Jack and Locke shared a friendly strangers smile, oblivious of the fact that they would be so connected fourty days later? I think not. And none of that would have been the same if they hadn't connected us with the characters and shown us their pasts.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS

And I wish everyone would stop saying the finale didn't deliver us any answers. Maybe it didn't reveal the huge secrets that keep the show running, but it gave us plenty of info. We found out that the others were people. We found out that the others kidnap children and wanted Walt instead of claire's baby. We found out Danielle had something to do with Claire while she was missing. We found out Daniel's baby Alex was a girl. We got to see the Korean couple make up and express their true love for each other. Many things were resolved. And they blew open the harch so there is no possible way to keep us from seeing what is down there any longer. Shouldn't that be a promise for next season.

Anyways, I think this is a spectacular show. It makes you think, unlike all the other dumbed-down shows on television today. I have total trust that the writers know what they are doing, where this is going, and have an explanation for everything. I am a diehard fan and can't wait til I see what happens to these people.

Unlike a lot of TV shows (especially when they center around action or adventure), you don't really get to know the charectors too well or it either takes a long time, well this is not the case, each episode, you see flashbacks of each charector before they got on the plane that would eventually crash on the island. You think you know them but you have no idea until you see the flashbacks and gasp in awe when you see something completely different and unexpecting. The same for aspects of the island, so many things happened that are either left open for further devolopment or are soon explained in the next or couple of next episodes. Your constantly looking for details that could answer a question you had for the previous episode. The whole package is great and is cleverly scripted. The cast is excellent and i'm sure all will have good careers, Matthew Fox stars as Jack, the doctor and 'hero', who blames himself for his dads death, Evangeline Lilly is the strong minded Kate who has some mysterys behind her which she trys to keep secret while also having a crush on Jack, she is considered the second leader by many. Domonic Monoghan as the funny and to many, attractive Charlie who is fighting a drug addiction, he also used to be in a band by the name of 'Driveshaft' before landing on the island. Theres so many cast members that I can't possibly name them all and give descriptions. At first I thought it was not such a good idea having so many charectors but boy was I wrong, they handle it perfectly. I usually don't just run out to buy TV Season Boxsets and wait a little while until they cheapen or after I finally get off my butt, but for this show, i'll be buying the box set on the very first day. You will not be dissapointed one bit! I can't wait for season Two to air and i'll definetly be buying the future box sets as well.",1124496000,6,2043,4.3090909090909095
1551332,5,B00005JNOG,"From the brainchild of J. J. Abrams comes by far the best show on TV. Period. Let's just hope down the road a few seasons it doesn't turn sour (I can't imagine how, however), like Abram's other creation, ""Alias"". I can't wait until I can have this and the following seasons in my DVD collection.

ABC made the best decision in it's history to pick this show up, and it's been worth it. The show fully deserves the top spot for viewership, I wouldn't think twice if it displaced ""Desperate Housewives"" or one of those ""CSI"" shows as No. 1.

Not nearly as difficult to jump into the story as rumor has it; I've done so more than once. With gripping flashbacks and even more do-or-die consequences on the island, ""Lost"" knows how to hold it's own, keeping me cursing at the commercial breaks and coming back for more.",1124409600,3,814,4.456375838926174
1551333,2,B00005JNOG,"Firstly Id like to answer a previous reviewer who said we shouldnt be reviewing it because it wasn't out yet. Listen - I don't care what colour the DVD's are, I buy and read reviews as to how good the programme/film is. So it is ok to review it prior to release.

Ah, where do I start. Well what a disappointment. It really isn't as good as many have said here in my opinion. I loved the idea and concept. I was really hoping for some Twilight Zone-like series.

What this is is a show where the whole script is dragged out to slowly get to plot milestones the director wants to get to. You know where someone will ask a crucial question like ""do you want to know what crime I committed"", the answer ""no, we all start fresh here"". You sit there thinking, yepp they are going to drag this out till episode 23432 when we'll find out then.

This manic elongation of plot to spread it out over many episodes also results in two other things....

The first is that for long periods very little happens. In fact its boring, or as the fans here say ""character development"", trust me its boring. Set against truly great moments like a tree crushing monster, the lulls are even more boring.

The second is that a lot of illogical things happen, you find youself saying; ""they wouldnt have done that"". People running ALONE out to find a damn family dog when they've seen first hand that there is some sort of monster out there, (oh and they've a son who will be orphaned if they get killed). But no, out they run after the doggy. There are many more - like the Doctor going out to find the cockpit and putting himself in danger, when he should have known better - he's the doctor they need him. Finding a homing signal ""in the area"" and not going to look for it, but trekking back to the beach. etc etc Many more, but this would be a novel.

And the kicker......here comes a spoiler. There is no solution after this long series...guess what....another series is next. Well it spoilt it to me. You invest all that time trudging through some interesting and intriguing twists and a LOT of dull chat and for what.....to reach no conclusion. If this were honed into a two hour film, it would probably be excellent, but over a long series no way.

So in summary, could have been a classic, but fell into the ""..but the executives want a long series with the option of a second..."" bucket. Very sad.",1124409600,16,2383,4.353603603603603

1551335,4,B00005JNOG,"Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) wanders around an isolated beach for a few minutes and then realizes other people need help. He rushes to a pregnant woman, Claire (Emilie de Ravin) who is being comforted by an overweight man, Hurley (Jorge Garcia). Soon, people realize they have survived a plane crash. They manage to move Claire right before an engine explodes. Eventually, the survivors learn that Jack is a doctor and they look to him for leadership and guidance. Jack is attracted to a mysterious woman, Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) seems to be unaffected by the crash, hoarding valuable items (aspirin, glasses, etc.), using them as currency. A father and son, Michael and Walt (Harold Perrineau and Malcolm David Kelley) are working on their strained relationship while trying to survive the island. Sayid (Naveen Andrews) is a sort of counterpart to Jack, providing expertise on electronics and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) seems to have all the survivalist instincts they will need to survive. A Korean couple (Daniel Dae Kim and Yoon-jin Kim) struggle to communicate with the English speaking survivors. Finally, Boone and Shannon (Ian Somerhalder and Maggie Grace), step-siblings, struggle to get along. As they learn some of the secrets of their new home, they also learn that each of the castaways have secrets. Which will prove the more dangerous?

When I first heard the concept for ""Lost"" (the complete ""Season 1"" is available on DVD), I was intrigued. A dramatic ""Gilligan's Island""? A fictionalized ""Survivor""? I'm usually willing to give even the most far-fetched ideas a try. If they don't prove compelling, I tune out after one episode, but if they manage to lure me in, I'll stick around. ""Lost"" lured me in, but in my mind, I promised that the first time they tried to make a coconut radio, I was tuning out.

What I didn't expect was the quality of ""Lost"". Fine, compelling performances married to good writing hooked me almost instantly. This is the type of show we have recently had to turn to HBO or Showtime for refuge. Granted, the characters never swear and nudity is non-existent, but network television has shied away from multi-episode storylines. On most dramas, everything has to happen in the space of 44 minutes. Next week, new story, new 44 minutes. (Yes, an hour long drama contains about 16 minutes of commercials.)  In ""Lost"", the characters still don't know everything about their new island home, and the second season is set to start in a few weeks.

The first episode begins with the survivors on the beach. As they interact, fully realizing their situation, we see flashbacks to the moments on the passenger jet before it crashed. Each person was in a different area, so they all have different memories of what happened. What soon becomes apparent is that all of these survivors were in the same section of the plane. Where did the other sections of the plane end up? Where there any other survivors? In one episode, a married woman sits at the edge of the beach in shock. Jack walks over to comfort her. He learns that her husband was in the back of the plane. Jack tells her he is sure that he didn't suffer. ""Oh, he's not dead"". ""But there were no other survivors."" ""They probably think that about us as well.""

Throughout the season, creators J.J. Abrams (""Alias""), Jeffrey Lieber and Damon Lindelof have peppered strange incidents into the storyline. The survivors have had a couple of run ins with a large beast only they have seen. They have also killed a polar bear. A polar bear on a desert island? And they found a French woman, the survivor of a shipwreck 16 years earlier, who keeps talking about ""them"".

The bit about the people on the other parts of the airplane is ingenious. From a dramatic standpoint, it gives the show creators license to introduce new characters and new storylines. If things get a little stale with the core group of survivors, someone can walk dazedly out of the jungle and we'll accept it.

From a production standpoint, the producers have done a brilliant thing. I'm sure many fans will disagree, but a core member of the group was killed off in season 1, providing a lot of drama. It also told the rest of the cast that they are not expendable. Yes, the story is set on a deserted island but we can introduce new people and we can kill off boring, stale characters. The producers sent a loud and clear message. ""We will not be held ransom by huge salary demands"", something that happens with almost every hit show.

The strange incidents are compelling because they aren't consistent. One episode may have a brief encounter with the large beast, another may have Locke trying to unearth a metal hatch in the ground before returning to the main story. This works, because it keeps us guessing.

Watching a show about a group of people on a desert island is interesting, but it can also become a bit stifling. Each episode tells basically two stories; the current events of the survivors on the island and a back-story involving one of the main characters, depicting the events leading up to them boarding the plane. For instance, if Jack is facing a weighty decision on the island, the story is intercut with one of the back stories involving his father. A back-story about Hurley winning the lottery proves to have a strange and unexpected connection to the survivors on the island. These back stories help to open up the show, taking us off of the island, maintaining our interest. Even more important, all of these back stories are connected to the main story, that of the survivors. It would be a completely different beast if the stories had no connection and nowhere near as compelling.

""Lost"" is a fine example of what television can do when everything works. If you haven't already seen the first season, this is your chance to catch up. Don't get lost when the second season begins.",1124064000,4,5891,4.777996070726916

The writers do everything in their power to stop the plot from moving forward and actually revealing anything. I think it's becoming clear that they don't have a grand plan. The writers just want fans to talk/speculate but don't actually know yet where they're going with the mystery.

A few of the many things that annoyed me: Claire's kidnapping served no purpose at all. The other characters quickly forgot about her and then when she escaped she conveniently has amnesia so the writers can avoid telling us anything about the Others.

None of the characters demand Danielle tell them what the monster is exactly, which makes no sense at all. That information might help them survive.

Half a season to open a stupid hatch. When they finally do open it, they don't show what's inside to the viewers.

Some of the flashbacks are so dumb. Kate's a fugitive because she robbed a bank and got people killed... to get her toy airplane back which has a lot of sentimental value to her... What a stupid story.

The special numbers that keep showing up, apparently they're bad luck.. Wow.

1551339,5,B00005JNOG,"This is one of the most engrossing series in recent memory. Whether it involves the island drama as the characters encounter mysterious things after mysterious things or the back story of each character being revealed through flashbacks. I think that the show's format sustained the cohesiveness of the show since while maintaining solid major storylines in the island, the writers were able to explore a plethora of possibilities for each character in the flashbacks.

Here are my top 5 episodes of the season:

  ******** Possible Spoiler**********

1. House of the Rising Sun - It's brave to have an episode where the main characters speak a foreign language that involves juicy storyline (and not that involves terrorist plots). And it totally works, this is the most moving and affectionate episode of the season in my opinion. Yunjin Kim gave a heartbreaking performance. The airport scene was pitch perfect.

2. ... In Translation - a great companion to the House of the Rising Sun. We get to see the same story through the point of view of Jin (played by Daniel Dae Kim who gave a really great performance). This is also an episode where the island drama is as central as the flashbacks

3. Do No Harm - Matthew Fox acted every scene he's in with intensity, sincerity, subtlety, and emotional depth that makes me really mad he was not nominated in this year's Emmy.

4. Exodus (Part1) - an episode that moves the story along. A poignant episode that served as a setup (and in itself a great episode) for the finale as major storylines in the past that were untouched reemerged.

5. Walkabout - A well written episode that gave some insights (and answers that probably we didn't even ask) to the mysterious Locke. It was just brilliant how the puzzle was put together through camera close ups and nuanced reactions and movements in the plane crash flashback

Actually my personal top 5 episodes do not give justice in representing the very best episodes of the series since there are other standout episodes that could've easily been on that list (Outlaws, White Rabbit, Raised by Another, Pilot, Exodus Part 2 and 3 etc.).

Every episode gives you insight to the island, and background on each person's character and history, which becomes more important with every subsequent episode.

1551406,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is the great new show of 40 surviving plane crash people who end up on a deserted island somwhere in the Pacific Ocean. After leaving Sydney, Austrailia the plane crashes and the men and women are left to defend for their own. Of the dozen or so main characters there includes:

A young doctor by the name of Jack who came to Austrailia to find his father who disappeared only to find out he died and wants to bring his body back for burial.

A young woman by the name of Kate who is shown as a criminal with a mysterious past of running from the law.

A sarcastic ""Don't need help from anybody"" man with the name of Sawyer. He tends to stick to robbing the wreckage of the plane for money and jewels in case they survive.

A construction worker by the name of Michale who wants to build a raft to take him and his small son Walt to safety.

An obese, yet really funny, lottery winner by the name of Hurley, who seems to think that he is a jynx.

A young Japanese couple that cant speak English [Well, at least one of them can't]

A musician by the name of Charlie [You might recognize him from Lord of the Rings] who is addicted to drugs.

A young woman by the name of Claire who is nine or so months pregnant.

A young man and his spoiled step sister.

A very interesting character by the name of Jon Locke who was a handicap yet regains the feeling in his legs and learns the secret of the Island.

And last but not least an Iraq Republican Guard by the name of Sayid. [My favorite character]

While there are about 30 other survivors, the show tends to stick to the main group, but there are several episodes that show more survivors in the main stories.

Besides the flashback episodes that show each and everyone's trouble past with that character shining in their own ways, there are also numerous plots that take place:

From the raft being built and vandalism occuring, to another woman of a different group of survivors who has been on the island for 16+ years, to even the main plot of having a huge monster that you can never see, roaming in the forests.

We don't see what the monster looks like but we can certainly hear what it sounds like in several of the episodes. However the monster doesn't appear in all the episdoes, in fact, he actually disappears for several weeks worth of episodes and only untill the secret of the island is starting to come into the story does he make his return.

There are also the big, big mysteries of a hatch found in the middle of the woods that is extremely hard to open, and also the mystery of a group of other people who are living in the woods and wants to kill the survivors. Both these two mysteries added to the suspense of the last episdoe, as the hatch was finally opened and the strange people finally showed up.

The episodes are really powerful, and some are even more captivating than others. I find that the shows that revolve around Locke, Sayid, and Sawyer are the best ones, especially with Locke. This show was great, can't wait for the realease, and I definately reccomend you watch the second season.",1122768000,3,3076,4.34965034965035

The actors, well I thought Matthew Fox wasn't that good, but I did rather enjoy the John Loc character and I was hoping that his beliefs and what was happening to him was more explained.

The stories of one, or a small group of people learning to survive when detached from civilization dramatize the feelings of helplessness that many of us experience on occasion.

The Lost series goes beyond the man vs. nature storyline. We see each character's soul exposed in flashbacks. These flashbacks identify the burdens each character has to bear in addition to the challenges of surviving on a deserted island.

The series gives me hope for broadcast television

1551471,5,B00005JNOG,"When I first saw promos for ABC's Lost, I was very skeptical about how the writers were going to carry on a show about people stranded on a tropical island for a few years, let alone only a season.  I thought that there was only so many stories they could do if this was a serious drama.  The show premiered to rave reviews, but I never had the time to watch.  Then one of my friends told me a little bit about the show, and it sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try.  Oh man, is this ever a good show, and was I ever wrong about problems with stories!  In an inspired move, every episode focuses on a character, and shows scenes from their life in flashback (except for the pilot and season finale episodes, which show scenes of multiple characters).  These flashbacks reveal defining moments in the characters' lives that show why they act the way they do on the island.  With a main cast of 14 people (or castaways), there are a lot of interesting, sad, and dark stories to tell.

Minor spoilers below.

When we meet the characters in the pilot, we think we know them, but when we see their flashbacks, we get the rug pulled out from under our feet, for no one is who they seem to be.  While about 48 people survived, only 14 are focused upon.  The 14 main castaways are: Jack (Matthew Fox), a heroic doctor, Kate (Evangeline Lilly), a shy girl who develops a crush on Jack, Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), a British rocker with a drug problem, Hurley (Jorge Garcia), a large man with a large heart, Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and his wife Sun (Yujin Kim), a Korean couple who initially isolate themselves from the rest of the group, Claire (Emilie de Ravin), a pregnant Australian woman without a father for her unborn baby, Sawyer (Josh Holloway), a low-life who hoards the supplies from the wrecked plane so that he can barter them with the people who need them, Michael (Harold Perrineau) and his son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley), who have just been reunited after Walt's mother died, Boone (Ian Somerhalder) and his sister Shannon (Maggie Grace), who constantly bicker, Sayid (Naveen Andrews), an Iraqi who fought against the US in the Gulf War and is attacked due to racism, and finally Locke (Terry O'Quinn), a mysterious man who doesn't seem to mind being stuck on the island.  Of course, those are the characters that we think we meet in the pilot episodes.  The people that they truly are become revealed over the course of the season.

In addition to learning about the castaways' pasts, their present situation is dealt with superbly as well.  In the first few episodes, they run out of food and water, and they have to figure out what to do.  Later on, they discover that they aren't alone on the island when Sayid meets Rousseau (Mira Furlan), a French woman who's been on the island for 16 years and claims that there are ""Others"" on the island who plot against her.  When mysterious things begin happening to the islanders, they begin to suspect that Rousseau is right.

However, there are a fair share of miraculous events that occur that aren't the work of the Others.  I'm not going to spoil any of them, as they are too good to reveal in this review.  There are also plenty of mysteries on the island that keep both the characters and the audience perplexed.  What exactly do the others want?  What is the significance of the black and white rocks?  Why are there polar bears on a tropical island?  Where are they?

This was an amazing season of television, and it ended with an amazing season finale that is keeping all of us begging for more.  This is a quality show worth checking out.  I will say that it is slightly overhyped, but Lost deserves a good 95% of the hype that it receives.  See you on the island...",1122595200,8,3740,4.492603550295858

My only complaint about the show is that the camera work could be a little steadier.  Sometimes it looks like the cameraperson is hopping around on the hot sand while filming.

1551474,3,B00005JNOG,"Lost sounded like such a stupid show, a plane crash, a monster, come on, the only reason I watched Lost was because it was created by J.J Abrams who created ALIAS(My FAVORITE SHOW OF ALL TIME).  I was shocked to find that Lost had everything a show needed, drama, suspense, and one hell of a plot.  But as the season progressed LOST started to get dull.  Every week seemed to be the same thing over and over agin.  They spent 3/4 of the season with ""the hatch.""  It was exciting at first, but after three episodes ended with stuff about ""the Hatch"" it just got dumb.  It picked up in the end, and had a decent fanali.  Then came the cliffhanger.  J.J. Abrams is known for his killer cliffhangers,  Alias for example every season left you, ""Oh my god I can't believe that just happened.""  LOST's cliffhanger was just stupid.  Once again it ended with something to do with the hatch.  It didn't leave you oh my god, but oh I could have seen that coming.  My opinion don't buy LOST.  It isn't worth the $40.  I would suggest either to download them, or rent them from BlockBuster because watching the season once is just enough.",1122249600,13,1125,4.393203883495145
1551475,5,B00005JNOG,"But I might as well.

We've completely given up watching broadcast TV. Now, we either buy or rent DVDs of shows and watch them serially as we have the chance. Sometimes one episode, sometimes more. No commercials and if the cliffhanger is really, really good and we just can't wait... we don't!

And can I say that ""Lost"" is THE BEST SHOW ON TV in decades?

Seriously. There's nothing better. I'm into 24, but this is better. I'm into Alias, but this is WAY better. If you've never seen it you just need to give it a try...

Seriously. Get it. Now. Go!

Are you still here?

Okay.. I'll tell you more.

It's about these people whose plane crashes on an island... 40 or so of them survive.

No one comes to rescue them.

Strange things begin to happen.

They are alone... or are they?

The plotting is amazing, as are the flashbacks to how each person came to be there.

And just about every episode somehow manages to be a ""twist"" as we realize what we thought about people based on assumptions is not reality based on their backstory. The show has a very cool way of making you say ""Oh, crap!""

This is one GREAT show.

If you tire of reality shows, of cop and crime shows and want something truly original, well-written and engaging.. check out Lost!",1122076800,4,1252,4.386956521739131

That's exactly the point, it's not meant to be quick and it's not meant to be easy - if you like a story, told over time, a plot peeled like an onion that reveals not just the layers and answers underneath but new plots and questions as well; if you like characters with depth and history, where the hero isn't all good and doesn't do everything right and the so called bad guy has an all too human soft spot then this is for you.  The characters have depth and history, the plot is a well played mystery with story building upon story.  If this sounds like your thing I highly recommend this series.

The characters talk and communicate like sedated, homogenous, shadows of actual people. Maybe we're waiting for the twist where it's revealed that they're all robots from the future sent back in time to bore tv viewers? It's very much like a daytime soap, just with a more interesting premise/locale to get things started. The vague hints at paranormal phenomena are explored with such limited detail that only the most dedicated fan could feign interest in speculating about the nature of the island and the possible reason for the people being there. The slow burning plot seems motivated by similar ambitions to Carnivale, but Lost doesn't even have ambience to rest on because the atmosphere of this show is so uncompromisingly sterile. It's surprising that this show has such a significant fanbase, and even more surprising how many seemingly intelligent people are a part of it.

1551541,5,B00005JNOG,"To me, ""Lost"" is a watershed moment in TV history.  When I first saw the promos for the show back last season I wondered how the heck are they going to make a drama on people crashing on an island.  Gilligan's Island aside, this is not a screwball comedy nor is it the 1960's anymore.  I hazzard to say that TV audiences are more sophisticated today althouth shows like ""Fear Factor"" may belie that conjecture.  I'd not watched many dramas in recent years (not counting fantastic shows like Buffy & The X-files) as I grew weary of the ER-type dramas that go on and on with nothing ever really happening.

Lost only goes to prove what can be done with talened writers, directors,and for the most part, no-name actors.  The realy trick behind Lost was giving us one major plot line and then branching that out in dozens of directions.  Suddenly by season's end you realized there was still so much more we did not know about the characters and the island itself.  The skillful blend of drama, mystery, action, fantasy, and romance is something never seen in televison. in my opinion.  The characters are, seemingly, just everyday people and react the way that the average person would in this situation.  They all have their own strenghts and weaknesses...and secrets.

It's is these character which are as captivating as the main story itself.  The writers did a brilliant job by devoting an episode or two to each of the main chracters and fleshing out their backgroungs...not entirely...but just enough to make viewers want more.  We see Jack Shepard (Matthew Fox) as a surgeon who seems to have it all in life but is unhappy and searching for something more...Kate (Evangeline Lilly) the flight's mysterious prisoner and yes, killer...Sawyer (Josh Holloway) the cocky, sarcastic, greedy rogue whose on his own lifelong quest for revenge and absolution...Hurly (Jorge Garcia) the rotund, carefree lottery winner plagued by a nefarious spate of bad luck...

And then there is John Locke.  Terry O'Quinn had been one of my favorite character actors for years..from his roles in ""The Stepfather"" to playing Howard Hughes in ""The Rocketeer"" to his stints in the X-Files and ""Millennium"", I have never seen this man give anything other than a brilliant performance and he is the key to this show.  His almost spiritual connection with nature and his miraculous recovery from paralyzation make him the most intriguing character in the show.  I've a feeling that we're going to learn much more about Locke and it may not all be good.

I'd be remiss not to mention the character of Sayid (Naveen Andrews) playing a former Iraqi soldier.  I love the character but am curious why they chose and actor of Indian heritage rather than Arabic...The mysteries of the island abound...the lost aircraft and ships...the strange creatures and sounds, the french woman, the distress signals, etc...it's a dizzying array of plot-twits which the writers and directors have skillfully juggled.

In this wasteland of brainless reality TV, ""Lost"" was like a beacon of light that brought viewers back to TV for a quality show.  Hopefully its success will cause other networks to stand up and take notice at just how good a show can be if you work at it and not take the cheap way out with low-rent reality TV.

1551543,5,B00005JNOG,"A group of strangers stranded together on a deserted island, forced to survive each other and the elements. It's been done before, from ""Gilligan's Island"" to ""Lord of the Flies"" to the mother of all reality television ""Survivor"". But it's never been done quite like `Lost'.

A plane runs into trouble and crashes on a tropical island, leaving the passengers to fend for themselves. Among the forty-eight survivors are a range of intriguing individuals: a doctor, an ex-rock star with a drug addiction, an Iraqi man regarded suspiciously in a post-9/11 world, a convict, an easy-going joker who considers himself cursed, a lifeguard and his catty sister, a Korean couple who can't speak English, a red-neck jerk who loves to stir up trouble, a pregnant woman, and a paraplegic who has inexplicitly regained the use of his legs on the island.

There are the usual social issues; mistrust among the group, hunting for food, romantic tension, post-traumatic stress, etc, and if you like social dramas, this would be enough to sustain the show. But ""Lost"" goes one step further, since each of our main characters have a Deep Dark Secret. Each episode is based around a particular character, who is explored through a series of flashbacks that reveal their past life and the circumstances leading up to their boarding of the fateful plane.

And if this wasn't enough, the writers also throw in a few curveballs as to the unknown nature of the island. There's a giant creature of some kind that's already chomped down a few people, a series of ghostly appearances and a polar bear. Yes, that's right, a polar bear. Whether these mysteries are going to end up as something amazingly clever, or utterly stupid remains to be seen, but the way in which it's unfolding is both intriguing and spooky, and the show's creators have already stated that there is a master-plan in terms of the gradually infolding mystery.

Some components induce eye-rolling: with only a few exceptions, all the survivors are both very attractive and in great physical condition - which means that the writers are constantly coming up with new ways to undress them. One particularly innovative episode was a run-in with a bee's nest that had our models rushing around tearing their clothes off in a frenzy. Oy.

But the show's fascination cannot be denied, nor can its underlying theme of fate that draws all its main characters together. The flashbacks hint toward an uncanny connection between the characters (for example, one character unknowingly has a conversation with another character's father, and another owns the box factory in which another works)and the continuity is drawn out with immense care.

It is this intriguing connection between the characters, the ongoing mystery, and the care with which the pieces of the puzzle are brought together that makes ""Lost"" compulsive viewing.",1120867200,9,2863,5.016842105263158

1551636,5,B00005JNOG,"I must say that I believe Lost is one of the greatest television shows I have ever seen. It has everything that you look for in a good TV show: action, drama, a little romance, great acting etc. It's a show that's not to be missed.

Lost is about a bunch of survivors that just happened to get out of a plane crash alive. They've ended up on a deserted island thousands of miles off course from where there were suppose to go. Nobody knows where they are, and they've just about lost hope of a rescue. Not only do these complete strangers have to survive the elements of the island, they have to survive each other and confront their own personal issues. That's one of the great things about Lost, you have a story of people on an island, but you also have amazing characters with complex storylines. Each episode deals with a different character, and during the episode, you have things happening on the island, but you also have flashbacks of that person's life before the plane crash.

But the island these people are on, isn't an ordinary island. You've got polar bears, giant monsters that nobody's seen, a crazy Frenchwoman who's been there for sixteen years, and mysterious whispers belonging to the ""others"".

But like I said, it's all about the characters. You've got a doctor named Jack (Matthew Fox) who has been a leader to these people, Kate (Evangeline Lily) a fugitive, Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) an ex-rocker with a drug habit, Sawyer (Josh Holloway) a bad boy that likes the read a hoard things, Sayid (Naveen Andrews) an Iraqi soldier, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) a man who sees beauty amist the terror on the island, Claire (Emilie de Ravin) a pregnant Aussie, Shannon (Maggie Grace) and Boone (Ian Somerhalder) step-siblings who don't get along, Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) who are husband and wife, Michael (Harold Perrineau) and Walt (Malcom David Kelly) father and son, and Hurley (Jorge Garcia) a man with a sense of humor. Each one of these characters have secrets; Some they don't want revealed to the other people they now must live with and help survive.

I've given this show such a high rating because I think the writing is great, and so is the acting. The premise of this show is so original. We have so many cop dramas, doctor dramas, and sitcoms already, and this is a breath of fresh air that primetime TV needed. Thumbs up to J.J.

1551638,5,B00005JNOG,"Their plane crashed on a mysterious island, and 48 survived. But the show revolves around 14 main characters: Jack (a Spinal Surgeon), Kate (A fugitive), Sawyer (A guy with a need to kill someone who ruined his life), Sayid (Served in the Republican Gaurd), Shannon (A brat), Boone (Shannon's stepbrother), Michael (Just gained custody of his son), Walt (Michael's son), Locke (A guy who was in a wheelchair for 4 years before the plane crashed), Charlie (Is in the Band Driveshaft & is addicted to heroin), Claire (Is 8 months pregnant), Jin (Only speaks Korean & Sun's husband), Sun ( Jin's wife), and Hurley (A Lottery winner that is cursed with bad luck).

In each episode except the Pilot and the Last episode, are centered around one of these 14 people. It shows flashbacks of their past. I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat! Because there are so many details that you can miss.

I found the 4,8,15,16,23,42 (bad luck numbers) mystery the most interesting (of the many many others ones). Hurley won the lottery with the numbers, Danielle and her team changed course because they heard those numbers, they are engraved on the hatch, they all seem to tie in with the characters, Jack and another woman's seats on the plane were 23 and 42, the gate to the plane is 23, Hurley payed 16hundred dollars to a guy for his scooter, while Hurley was trying to catch his flight he passes some sort of team that has the numbers on their backs in order, and Kate's reward money to capture her was 23thousand dollars.

1551639,4,B00005JNOG,"Lost is a very good drama serial. 48 passengers crash land on a deserted island, 1000 miles off course. Of these 48, the show focuses on 14, making it very easy to remember the main chracters. Each person has a past before he or she boarded the plane. They were all strangers when they landed - soon they become friends (or enemies). Combining the elements of past and future, the effect is one that is captivating and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Also, a person might think because they are on an island, there should not be any guest stars. That's wrong, for guest stars pop out in the roles of mysterious French women, mysterious men and some others of the 48 passengers. The thriller is very exciting, by developing each charcter's relationship with each other well.

What I am quite unsatisfied with is the presence of the beast, a creature that lives in the jungles. We have seen every beast possible in every movie shown. Unless the beast really is a three-headed dog with a big appetite, it would not be new. Oh wait. Three-headed dog appeared in Harry Potter.

Other than that, the show is beautifully-written and masterfully-directed by J.J Abrams, creator of Alias. The concept is original and the reason that it doesn't become Lord of The Flies-based is due to the fact that there are little flashbacks of certain charcters every episode, to remind us they were civilised before they landed into this mess.

Overall, I would give it 4 stars, and would recommend this DVD. Unless you're the kind of person who would wonder how 48 people survived a plane crash, how come there's a rampaging monster which probably doesn't exist in real life, and how a paralysed man would recover after that crash, you would thoroughly enjoy the show and all its major fictional proportions.",1120176000,,1791,4.697452229299363

We like (most of) the characters, or at least find them interesting. We enjoy a show that establishes a premise and runs with it. Shows that have to conclude every storyline in a single episode get old so quickly; you don't really need to watch them at all, you could write the stories yourself after a season or two. But ""Lost"" keeps us guessing. There have definitely been a few ""Whoa! Never saw that coming!"" moments. Also, it's refreshing to have some normal-looking actors, instead of all those pretty youngsters.

That said, if they establish a pattern of killing off characters for impact or because of contract disputes, I doubt we'll stick with the show. Why get invested in characters who may not be around next season? And if you can't care about the characters, no amount of clever plotting will make up for it.

1551684,5,B00005JNOG,"From Alias creator J. J. Abrams, the landmark first season of Lost became a critical success and a ratings juggernaut for ABC.  Beginning with a mysterious plane crash, a large group of survivors find themselves stranded on a seemingly deserted island.  As the season unfolds, each character is given a flashback-style glimpse into their past and the events that lead them to boarding the plane, while they each learn that there is something lurking on the island; something strange, and very deadly.  All this leads the survivors to discover that they are not the only ones on the island, and the season ending discovery of a strange metal hatch and what lurks inside will leave you salivating for season two.  Lost's large cast, including Matthew Fox as the resident doctor Jack, Lord of the Rings' Dominic Monaghan as heroin raddled fallen rock star Charlie, newcomer Evangeline Lily as the mysterious Kate, Milennium's Terry O'Quinn as survivalist John, and Oz's Harold Perrineau who is here along with his young, disobedient son.  The rest of the cast, including Daniel Dae Kim, Ian Somerhalder, Naveen Andrews, and Jorge Garcia among others, do great work, and by the end of this season, one of them will be dead, and there will be more questions than answers.  The storytelling is sharp (including David Fury as a staff writer, who wrote and directed some of the best episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel), and with the unique aspect of the show, it's no secret why Lost has become such a runaway hit.  As a previous reviewer stated, superb shows of the last few years such as the X-Files, Buffy, Angel, and Farscape didn't achieve true perfection until their second season, and if Lost manages to fall into the same category, then it's time to prepare for something really special, and now has never been a better time to get Lost.",1119225600,9,1849,4.832278481012659

1551687,4,B00005JNOG,"""Lost"" is good TV. But is it GREAT TV, and will the writers be able to pull all the dispariginly loose threads together? While some viewers are hailing ""Lost"" as THE show that saved scripted TV, I reserve judgment.

  In season 1, we have been given puzzles, more questions than answers, clues we don't know are even clues yet (? and what do I do with those? ), mythology, and some heavy-hitting character development, or so we think.

  Early on in Season 2, they will have to provide a little carrot on a stick or I, for one, won't be sticking around. I'll be catching the first first-class flight OFF of this Island.

  Resolution, or even something that LOOKS like resolution and then flipped all-ways-'round a few episodes later would keep me at the watering hole. Without SOME kind of resolution to at least SOME of the minor mysteries on the Island, I fear this show will be just another ""Dark Shadows""....raising new mysteries before the old ones are resolved/revealed/answered.....where old plot lines fade into distant memory and new characters with new dilemas take off as the force of the day.....all to lead........nowhere.  Without ever giving the audience some gratification of a resolution, how long do they think they can keep this up?? It makes me wonder if they really ever had a storyboard or complete plot line thought out when they started filming, or is this production akin to others done without a firm road plan (anyone remember the movie ""Zanadau""???).",1118620800,5,1479,4.833333333333333

CSI has been spin-offed to death, Raymond's gone, Simpsons should be cancelled, Angel, Buffy, bla bla bla etc, E.R bites and so-called ""reality"" shows can kiss my derriere. Let's face it; apart from late night shows like Letterman, it's mighty slim pickings. Thank God (Or rather JJ Abrams) for this fantastic show. Never have I ever become so immersed in such a compelling story. Fantastic characters, sharp action and a premise that seems so simple at the beginning but has a myriad of layers yet to be revealed. The acting is so heart-felt, the stories so rich and rewarding, I don't miss a minute of this top-notch drama. The only annoying thing is having to wait a week between episodes, but the DVD will be here soon, so, along with special making of features, I can relive the GREATEST TV SHOW EVER.",1118275200,8,922,4.628048780487805

I mean Jack is the perfect straight white male superman that can do EVERYTHING, whether it be saving lives or beating people up or telling people what to do or making the best decisions or whatever.  Why are the writers so lazy with his character?  He's like this warm blanket they wrap themselves in to make their writing easier...their very own Indiana Jones/Rambo/He-Man/Aragorn/(insert more here) that doesn't need to make sense and can be perfect because they're so used to growing up watching flawless moral heroes kick butt and save lives.  (And don't say he's got character cuz of his problems with his father...all he did there was make the right decisions) The one challenge to his perfect machismo was that crazy Canadian (never trust a Canadian) who beat him up...but good ol'Jack got himself a round 2 and beat him down good.

1551762,5,B00005JNOG,"JJ Abrams' LOST is the best show on Television (at least after HBO cancelled Carnivale)... :(

The show concerns the exploits of 14 main characters in a group of (to start) 48 survivors of an Oceanic flight from Sydney to LA that lands on an island in the middle of nowhere.

This is not Gilligan's Island. It's got polar bears, hatches, bizarre numbers, a creepy Frenchwoman, some kind of monster that acts as a security system for the island, wild boars, and that's not getting into the cast itself!

We follow overzealous doctor Jack (Matthew Fox), ex-Iraqi soldier Sayid (Naveen Andrews), ex-band member/drug addict Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), a non-English speaking Korean couple (well, almost - played by Daniel Dae Kim and Yunjin Kim - no relation!), a Colonel Kurtz-esque regional vice president for a Box company (Terry O'Quinn - incomparable!), an overweight lotto winner named Hurley (Jorge Garcia), a stepbrother and sister named Boone and Shannon (Ian Somerhalder and Maggie Grace), an estranged father - Michael  and son, Walt (Harold Perrineau and Malcolm David Kelley), a conman named Sawyer (Josh Holloway), a pregnant and single girl Claire (Emilie de Raven), and a fugitive named Kate (Evangeline Lilly).

The Episodes:

1/2. PILOT - Parts 1 & 2: The plane crashes. The survivors explore. The weirdness begins. Rain at strange intervels, that monster and a Frenchwoman on a loop transmission for 16 years!

1551763,5,B00005JNOG,"Being a crazy fan of Alias, I thought I would give this show a try last fall, and I am so glad I did. The first episode starts out with people waking up from a crash to find wreckage and bodies everywhere. The island seems to be magical, but not in a weird fantasy way. It has a monster that crushes trees and kills people, but is never seen by the viewers. Each character in this show has an interesting and twisted story in their past and the viewer gets to see it with flashbacks of a character in every episode. Each episode reveals something new about a character that explains their behavior and their motive. The way the writers tie everything together is amazing and perfect. The season ends with a bang and leaves the viewers craving more. This is an awesome show from the writing and directing to the acting and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing show to watch.",1117670400,7,890,4.367469879518072
1551764,5,B00005JNOG,"After being drawn into this show from the very beginning. I had various expectations. Most of those expectations weren't fulfilled. But, in a way, that's okay. I learned to love this show throughout the season. The hidden mysteries that reveal themselves over time are brilliant. What is the meaning of the Island? What do the numbers mean? What's in the bunker? What is the nature of the beast?

Hypothesizing about these mysteries is just one of the great things about LOST. Good television is credited with many outside conversations. LOST is pure watercooler television. Few shows build discussion like this one.

In the middle of the season, LOST hits a somewhat slow period. But the back story built in the middle episode ends up serving a greater purpose. I was drawn into the characters like I never thought I could.

I welcome a second viewing of LOST any day. This DVD set should do good to hold the many LOST, like me, until a second season.",1117584000,6,952,4.72289156626506
1551765,5,B00005JNOG,"My wife & I don't watch a lot of TV.  There are only two shows we watch lately.  Survivor and Lost.  If we are particularly busy we might forgo Survivor and watch Lost.  We record all our shows on our DVR so that we have a chance to watch them at some point in the week.  Lost in HD is simply awesome, I might be a bit let down on DVD as this is the first show we've ever watched in HD and it beats current DVD format.

Enough about that.  I am pre-ordering the 1st season.  We've re-watched many episodes that we'd seen before.  To date, we've missed a couple of episodes (Comcast DVR is NOT smart, doesn't catch time/date changes of showings) though we will probably see them over the summer, I am sure we'll watch them on DVD again next season.

Other favorite shows:

Northern Exposure (Thank Goodness for DVD, Season's 1 & 2 are out).

I love the plot twists and the cliff hangers at the end of each episode. The writers are incredible at what they do and they are awesome story tellers. I can't wait for the next season.

1551767,5,B00005JNOG,"It is too early to state for certain just how good LOST is compared to the great shows in television history, but by the highest possible standards its first season has to stand out as one of the great seasons in the history of the medium.  Season One of LOST was not merely good but great television, and not merely great television but great narrative storytelling.  But the impact of LOST goes completely beyond its aesthetic success.  Along with another show on ABC (albeit one that I do not care for), DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, LOST has managed to cause the prodigiously stupid television execs to realize that there is a huge demand for quality scripted television.  After years of an endless string of simply awful reality shows, all of the networks suddenly want shows that are written ahead of time and feature casts of actual actors.  Although final schedules have not yet been announced, it looks as if the 2005-2006 season is going to have both a dramatic decrease in reality shows and an increase in scripted shows.  The stunning success of LOST has played a major role in this sea change.

We have in recent years seen genre shows that were huge hits with critics and managed to generate a passionate cult following.  Probably no show was more critically praised than BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (with hordes of high brow critics preferring it to more respectable hit series like THE SOPRANOS), but at its peak it managed only a small audience.  LOST has generated critical praise almost as strong as BUFFY, a core of fans nearly as passionate, but unlike BUFFY managed absolutely stunning ratings.  It is one of the few instances in recent television history where what is arguably the best show on TV also managed among the strongest ratings.  In fact, LOST would be considered a cult show based on the number of websites that it has inspired and the passion of the fans, except that the ratings instead make it a mainstream hit.

Who would have thought that a series dealing with plane crash survivors on a most unusual island would have been this successful?  Before it debuted I remember people joking that it sounded like GILLIGAN'S ISLAND without the humor.  But it ended up matching or surpassing the most optimistic expecations, in quality as well as in ratings.  The mention of ratings is not gratuitious.  So many superb shows have been cancelled in recent years (FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS, DEAD LIKE ME, ANGEL) that there was even a ""Save LOST"" website started . . . before the show even debuted!  Luckily, the ratings have made cancellation seem not only remote but impossible.

It is almost impossible to acknowledge everything that LOST does well in the space allotted here.  Above all else, it is a superbly written show, not merely on an episode by episode basis, but in the way all of the episodes mesh with one another.  The continuity is the best that I have seen in a long time.  For instance, the first time we see one character in the show, she is rubbing her wrist.  Later, we learn that she had been a prisoner of a U. S. Marshall and had obviously gotten rid of her handcuffs just before we first met her.  Almost any detail like that will be dealt with at a later date.  But the scripts are just as strong on character development, humor, excitement, and adventure.  I do have a tiny bit of fear about Season Two:  former BUFFY and ANGEL writer David Fury, who wrote many of the finest scripts of the year, including ""Walkabout,"" which could very well win Fury an Emmy for best written episode of the year, has left LOST to work this summer on the new FOX series THE INSIDE, before joining 24 as a writer and executive producer.

My initial fear when the show started was that the central cast was perhaps too large, but it turned out to be unjustified, and the great ensemble cast is unquestionably one of the reasons for the show's success..  Yes, there are a lot of characters, and sometimes I wish some were more central than others, but the depth and power of developing the stories of a dozen characters ended up being both unique and exceptionally entertaining.  Jack is the titular lead of the show, although show creator J. J. Abrams has confessed that their original idea was to have Jack assume leadership in the first couple of episodes, and then have him die off, forcing the lovely fugitive Kate become the leader for the castaways.  But they quickly realized that Matthew Fox's Jack was too valuable a character to toss aside so cavalierly.  If there is a second main character, it is Kate, who is performed by a remarkable newcomer, the excruciatingly beautiful Evangeline Lily, who despite virtually no prior experience (I did recently spot her in a very, very tiny role from the first season episode ""Kinetic"" on SMALLVILLE, where her only task is to kiss her supposed boyfriend).  One of the most consistently fascinating characters is John Locke, played by Terry O'Quinn, a veteran television actor familiar to anyone who has seen shows like ALIAS, THE X-FILES, MILLENIUM, and THE WEST WING.  Although he has always performed marvelously, LOST has made him a star.  Every one of the major characters has his or her own set of fans.  Naveen Andrews, for instance, a Londoner of Indian descent, has been a big hit playing Sayid, the former Iraqi soldier, as has Jorge Garcia as Hurley, the obese lottery winner who is as unlucky for others as he is lucky himself.  And while Dominic Monaghan shared in the enormous success of THE LORD OF THE RINGS playing one of the Hobbits, he has achieved more individual success as Charlie, the heroin-addicted bass player for the fictional band Driveshaft (one hit wonders famed for their song ""You All Everybody"").  So rabid are the show's fans that there are websites dedicated to Driveshaft.

Structurally, the narrative shifts between the efforts of the survivors to adapt to and understand the island on which they are marooned and flashbacks that explain the personal history of each character.  Some people object to this, wishing instead that they focused exclusively on the events on the island, but I think that this is wrong.  If you focused merely on the events on the island, it would be only an adventure story, but through the flashbacks we learn so much about what makes the people tick that the series becomes as much a character study as an adventure.  By the end of the season, we get to know the characters so well that we can anticipate how they are going to respond to even the smallest events.  We learn very quickly that the island contains a host of mysteries, including invisible monsters whose location and function remain unknown until the end of the season (if we even understand them then), other inhabitants whose intentions seem both sinister and unknown, and a lone insane Frenchwoman named Danielle Rousseau.  But there is not much more than we know about the island.  Rousseau talks of the Black Rock, but it isn't what we expect when we finally see it.  And then there is the metal doorway that Locke discovers in the middle of the jungle.  How can it be opened and what lies behind the door?  By the end of the season many of the mysteries are explained, but more are left open-ended.

LOST clearly has the potential to be one of the great series in the history of television.  The producers are highly ambitious, but so far their execution has matched their aspirations.  I read an interview with David Fury before the first episode aired in which he said they had a plot line that runs over several years, so their clearly is a well-conceived storyline.  I have only one concern with the show, and that is the executive producer and creator J. J. Abrams.  Although he has two prior hit shows, FELICITY and ALIAS, he has had some problems with taking his shows to higher levels.  What made BUFFY so extraordinary was that each year they managed to do something new and amazing, even if some fans were disappointed by some directions it headed.  But ALIAS has started to disappoint some fans by the fact that it hasn't progressed much beyond what it was in the first season.  Instead of doing strikingly new things, Abrams just tends to recycle the same general storyline.  And there has not been much of a payoff for all the focus on Ramaldi (for nonfans of ALIAS, a Renaissance genius whose artifacts provide much of the narrative force of the show).  Abrams clearly is brilliant at conceiving and initiating great shows, but he has not yet demonstrated that he is a great finisher in the way that Joss Whedon has.  I'm forever the optimist, and I believe that Abrams either will come to terms with this or the other creators and executive producers will help LOST get to a place that we will all find satisfying.

Regardless of the future, this nonetheless is one of the most remarkable rookie seasons any television series has ever enjoyed.  I'll end with food for thought.  THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and FARSCAPE, to name just a few shows, were much better in their second and third seasons than their first.  What if two years from now we are able to say the same of LOST?",1117497600,"1,038",9120,4.690326633165829
1551768,1,B00005JNOG,"Don't get me wrong.  This show is very, very entertaining.  I was hooked after watching the first 3 shows and I watched it very faithfully to the end.  The story is very suspenseful, thrilling and full of action.  You will be on the edge of your seat the whole way through.

The main problem that I have with this is that there are NO answers to any of the main puzzles in the first season.  There is a lot of background and the characters are developed with their back stories.  But, even as the characters' backgrounds are developed, we only find more puzzles with very few answers.  (I would say that there are no answers to any of the significant questions.)  For me, there are too many questions after 25 episodes.  I feel that my faithfulness in watching the show to the end paid off to nothing.

Granted, as I stated in the beginning, I was entertained.  But, how long is it going to go on until we get some answers?  Season 2?  Season 3?",1117411200,23,945,4.325714285714286

The character developement throughout the season is phenominal and you grow attached to each character. I look forward to the show each week and am looking forward to season 2. If you don't watch the show, or are skeptical, take my advice, give it a try and start from the beginning. I promise you you will love it. I just can't express in words the mystery and unbelievable feeling you get after each episode; those of you who watch the show, im sure you know what i mean. It leaves me breathless, especially in the season 1 finale and after a question is revealed.

1551816,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost is incredible. It is by far the most intellectual show on television, and like the Simpsons, it appeals to low-brow and high-brow tastes. Some viewers may watch it purely for the adventure and supernatural element (it's Jurassic Park and the Shining and Robinson Crusoe---together at last). Others may watch it for the richly nuanced characters (what other show has a regular character who speaks only Korean?). And others still may watch it for the philosophical undercurrent.

What's great about the philosophy is that the writers present it without pretentiousness. Most of it is subtle. The most philosophical character is, of course, John Locke, who happens to share his name with the great seventeenth-century English philosopher (who had some interesting things to say about the behavior of humans in the State of Nature). Also on the show is a mysterious and ambiguous French female character named Rousseau, who also happens to share her name with the great eighteenth-century French philosopher (who also had some interesting things to say about the behavior of humans in the State of Nature).

Lost is very existential. The main themes of the show, expressed a few times by Locke, are the inevitability of fate and the opportunity to change oneself for the better. These 47 (and dwindling) survivors are given the rare chance to focus on their lives, question their past mistakes, and become better people. And these characters have a lot to think about. One character is a drug addict; one was a torurer for Saddam Hussein; one was a hitman; one had an (arguably) incestuous relationship with her step-brother; two are murderers. Only Jack, the doctor, seems to have a sense of morality and decency, but this could easily change with a surprising flashback (for being the main protagonist, we know little about Jack's past).

When I first started watching the show, I thought it was too much like William Golding's Lord of the Flies. The characters are in the same survival situation; the island serves as a convenient microcosm of the Earth (especially since there's practically one of every ethnic group, except American Indian); there are wild boars; the survivors have established separate bands. Even Sawyer, one of the aforementioned murderers, says in an episode, ""It's Lord of the Flies time!""

But since I've been watching the show more and more, I care less and less how much it resembles Golding's classic novel. You won't find a better, more engrossing and intellectually stimulating drama on television on any network today.",1117152000,27,2554,5.1028708133971294
1551817,5,B00005JNOG,"I've been watching Lost this past TV season. The season finale was last night. I have to say that this show is one of the few TV shows which offers intelligent, detailed storytelling these days. The cast is strong and varied as well. The episodes all offer flashbacks to previous events in the characters' lives, before the airplane crash which left them stranded on a rather strange island in the Pacific, and this has a way of making the characters richer...fuller. Not all of the characters are likeable; all have human flaws and issues which make the whole story more real.

The supernatural strangeness of the island also has a way of pulling you in. From the character which shouldn't be able to walk, but does, to the airplane wreckage which is pulled away into the ocean, leaving no traces, to the mysterious numbers which have drawn people to the island, you know that something's not right, but the characters have little time to spend to figure it out, as they are struggling to survive. And struggle they must, for limited resources, for shelter, and against the island's monster and the islands other, mysterious, vicious inhabitants.

Now, with the first season over, and few of the mysteries really resolved (though, one of them, being what the island's monster looks like, has been at least partially answered), and I've been left wanting more.

1551818,5,B00005JNOG,"47 people survive a plane crash on an island somewhere in the Pacific.  Each brings their own story and past to the island, and this dictates how interact with each other.  This is the story of Lost, the television show by J.J. Abrams which twists the minds of viewers as he tells the tale of the survivors, their attempts to leave the island, and the fact that they are not alone on the island.

The leader of this group is Jack, a doctor with father issues that he is willing to put behind him to protect the forty-six other survivors.  As the survivors come to realize that they will not be rescued, they delve deeper into the island, learning the secrets of an expedition sixteen years ago and dealing with the mystical creatures that plague them.

Lost is a brilliant TV show that explores the human psyche and how it reacts in events of extreme stress and turmoil.  It is without a doubt the best show on Wednesday nights right now.",1117065600,4,938,4.456140350877193
1551819,5,B00005JNOG,"I'm writing this review right after watching the season finale. This is one hell of a good show. I wish I could meet the writers of this series and ask them ""Where on earth do you come up with this stuff?"" That's some really good $hit they give us every week. At the end of every show, I go ""F**k!"" because it's so nerve wrecking thinking what's gonna happen next. The intensity is just unbelievable!

OK, I guess I should calm down and write this review. As you can see, the excitement really gets to me. When I first heard of this show, I thought it was some lame Survivor kind of rip-of. But right after watching the first few minutes of the show, I knew I couldn't have been more wrong. This show is basically about a group of plane crash survivors. They land on this island that they know nothing of. Every episode, we see how these people survive. We are given glimpses of the person's life before the crash, and how it led them on to the flight which crashed. Most, if not all of the people's stories reveal a side of the people that we do not expect, some more surprising than others. And that's not all, the island itself is a mystery. Weird noises are heard at night, but what is making those sounds? Strange events start to occur which is impossible to explain. The survivors soon find out that they are not alone in the island, there are others but who are they? These are just some of the many things that progresses over time in this show. C'mon, how anyone could resist this show is totally beyond me.

First of all, I have to say kudos to the writers. The stories are written in such a way, that it intrigues you, it draws you in. The anticipation to watch the following week's episode is really killing you. I am usually at the edge of my seat watching this show, literally! And I didn't even realize it until someone pointed it out to me. That's how much this show grabs you. Next, this show has a killer cast. Never have I seen a cast which works so well with the show. Their acting never fails to evoke some kind of emotion within me, and that sure doesn't happen much. You find yourself really caring what happens to each of them. Other than those factors, I just think that everything works in perfect symphony for this show, thus the 5-star rating. The lighting, the set, the directing...everything!

In short, this is THE show to watch. The DVD set is not even released and I've already pre-ordered it. And I've never pre-ordered anything before. At a time when TV networks are flooded with teen dramas and reality crap, this is a refreshing change. I love this show, it's off to a good start and if these guys can end this series with the same intensity that they started it...this might very well be one of those classic TV shows that people talk about 10, 20 years from now.

1551820,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost, is of course, the series in which 48 I belive different and odd people wind up in a horrible plane crash that pits them on a strange island.

Each episode, in some form or shape flashes back to each character before they got on the plan or other activities leading up to boarding the plane.

1551821,3,B00005JNOG,"I feel that this show, Lost, is a bit over-rated. It is a solid, decent show, but it isn't great. It's not on the same level as the other serial shows like 24, Alias or Battlestar Galactica. It's watchable enough, but I feel that it could be a lot better than it actually is.

If I had to describe it in one sentence I would say that Lost has a great concept but a weak execution. The premise of the show - the mysterious island - is brilliant. I find the island fascinating and would love to know more about it, what is it, what is the monster, why did the plane crash? and so on. I feel that they could do some really amazing, strange, terrific stuff with this premise. It's full of potential.

Unfortunately, the show itself rarely concentrates on the island.  The bulk of the episodes are about the characters and are devoted to character development. There are long flashbacks week after week. And so a series which could be brilliant sci fi instead becomes a character drama. This wouldn't be such a problem, however the characters themselves aren't actually that interesting! Main characters like Jack and Kate are rather bland and boring. Some of the other characters - like Locke, or Hurley, or Jin and Sun - have much more compelling back stories. But they don't receive as much attention. Also, as a character study, this isn't as good as something like The Sopranos or Six Feet Under.

I feel that this show is a waste of potential. The idea of the island is sort of wasted. It would be like on The X Files if they devoted all the episodes to character development and never made any episodes about aliens. It's not quite what you're expecting.

The main reason I watch Lost is because the island mystery intrigues me. The characters, not so much. Sadly, character drama is all that you get. If they wanted to make a character piece, why did they even bother setting it on a mysterious island? They just sort of ignore it in place of mundane stories like Jack's surgeon father or the love triangle between Jack, Kate and Sawyer.

One other complaint: the pace of plot development is slow. Almost glacial. This show is very keen to keep its mysteries unresolved. By the end of the season very little has been revealed. You may feel a bit cheated. I get the sense that in season 2 there probably won't be any plot development until the season finale. If then. We shall see.

All in all, Lost is merely average. This review might make it sound like I hate this programme... I don't. It is quite good and is certainly better than most regular television shows. But it could be so much more.",1117065600,19,2598,4.479915433403805
1551822,5,B00005JNOG,"This review is for the show not the unreleased DVD.

A friend of mine (who is a fan of the show) told me about it. She said they spent more than 5 million dollars to shoot the pilot and gave me the tape of the pilot to watch.

Having watched a lot of TV in my life I thought, well, it will be from OK to Good. I mean what can surprise me and especially the story was about plane crash and survivors, seemed I saw it somewhere before.

After watching the pilot I can say with confidence that this is probably one of the best (if not the best) pilot episodes ever filmed. And after watching every episode so far I can say this show is the best show I've seen in a long time. I basically wait from episode to episode waiting for what will happen.

What I like about this show is the stories, the actors, the characters and the sets. This is truly a well made show. Every episode masterfully crafted, I can't even say there is a lame episode. It's Drama with a splash of science fiction(?) and mystery.

The acting is superb by name and no-name actors. You will get attached to the characters even the ones you wouldn't like in real life. Everything is believable yet creative and inventive. The flashbacks are fantastic and while I usually don't like them, here, I did like them, they are inserted into the mix with ease and continuity that will lead you to the climax of every episode.

While the flashback tell you about past lives of the survivors, new stories develop and problems arise from their situations and conflict between different characters who wouldn't be together in real life. It is just fantastic story telling.

The sets are magnificent. The show is filming in Hawaii although they could've used a sound stage. I believe all the filming was done outdoors in Hawaii (except some of the flashbacks) No show I can remember did this for it can be a bit expensive.

I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who didn't watch yet, but start watching, and buy the DVD when it's out. You'll love it. The idea of solving the puzzle of why and how every passenger got on that Oceanc flight 815 is alone worth your watching time. Also, for me, the math aspect and some logical problems are enjoyable as well; I just hope they don't disappoint us at the end but I doubt it. As one of the producers said ""The last thing we want to do on LOST is be illogical"". I trust him.

I write this review as I await the finale episode; while I downloaded some episode I missed, and probably could download the entire season, I have every intention of buying this DVD when it comes out as a thank you to the producers for such a good ... well, product.",1116892800,19,2643,4.334008097165992
1551823,1,B00005JNOG,"We started watching this show and we were hooked.  But, unlike 24, they only have a new episode every three weeks! They play reruns constantly.  Then, out of desperation, they made up a new episode by combining highlights from old episodes and narrating it! We turned that one off!  Also, have they answered one question of what's happening on the island this entire season? NO!  I'll stick with 24 which has a new episode every week! I give up!  No more Lost for me.",1116720000,15,467,4.511904761904762
1551824,5,B00005JNOG,"At one point in my life, I had three shows that I looked forward to watching every week.  Three programs that I could lose myself in and escape the real world for a short while.  But then the ""Ninja Turtles"" from the old cartoon fought their final battle in May of 1996, and I had to say good-bye to those pizza-loving party animals.

It was all good, though.  I still had my other two favorite shows that I could tune into each week.  But then ""The X-Files"" closed its office in May of 2002, and I had to bid farewell to my favorite agents, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.

No worries, however.  Even though the aforementioned programs had ridden off into the TV Land sunset, I still had that one show I could make time for every week.  But then the cast of ""Friends"" took their final sip of Central Perk coffee in May of 2004, and I was forced to part ways with Chandler, Joey, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel, and Ross.

And then, for the first time in 17 years, my television screen fell silent.  Well, maybe not completely silent.  I still watched ""Survivor"" every now and then, but I wouldn't call myself a devoted fan of the series - perhaps more of a casual viewer.

Then they came.  Previews for a hot new fall show.  Blathering on about a bunch of people stranded on a deserted island after their plane crash-landed.  Something called, simply enough, ""Lost.""  I figured it was ""Survivor"" meets ""Cast Away,"" only without the immunity challenges and a volleyball named Wilson.

The show looked interesting enough, so I made plans to watch it after work on Wednesday night.  And, just like with ""Survivor: Australian Outback"" (the only season of ""Survivor"" I became a rabid follower of), I was hooked within the first two minutes and never looked back.  Week after week, month after month, I have sat in the comfort of my home and watched these lost souls battle themselves and each other.  I've seen Jack accept his role as reluctant leader, Kate redeem her past demons and relapse again, Sawyer grow a heart, and Charlie mature over his drug addiction.

And I've loved it.  I loved it all.  I have a new favorite show again!

My only quibble - and it is a minor one - is the fact that Rose's character was dropped by the writers.  I felt the storyline about her husband still being alive on a different part of the island, which Rose believed so deeply, could have been woven into the threads of the series.  However, this is understandable given that the actress has been involved with other projects so the show hasn't been able to use her.  Hopefully, we will see Rose's character again during the second season.  And, again, this is my only nitpick against a show that has otherwise fired on all cylinders.

I cannot wait for this DVD set to come out in September.  I am already counting down the days.

Congratulations to the cast and crew of ""Lost.""  Your effort into making such a quality show in all aspects of the word has earned you the right to take the summer off.  I look forward to the DVD release, as well as the highly-anticipated first episode of Season Two, this fall.",1116720000,24,3082,4.495495495495495
1551825,5,B00005JNOG,"Since LOST first aired, I have been riveted to the screen. The amazing thing about this show is how it takes what at first sounds like the basic clich premise of a group of people being stranded on an island, and turns it into something very original and unexpected. There is something in this show for fans of any genre, whether it's mystery, suspense, sci-fi, drama, and even some occasional comedy. The plot and character development is superb, and the visuals are spectacular. LOST is full of many twists, turns, cliffhangers and surprises.

1551917,5,B00005JNOG,"From the opening scene, a plan crash, this series draws the viewer in.  As Jack Sheppard (Fox) awakens to find that the plan has crashed and that survivors are laying on the sand dying, he is thrown into command mode making his character both a hero and a martyr.

The supporting cast as a great seedy background too.  For example Kate Ryan (Evangeline Lilly) was on the plan with a U.S. Marshall, why? Nobody knows.  Then there is Charlie, the lead singer of Drive Shaft who has a drug problem.  Also on the plane is Claire, who is about six or seven months pregnant when the plane crashes.  John Locke is another survivor who was being sent home after he was turned away from a nature walk in Australia.  A comic relief to the show is Hurley, who thinks that he is cursed becaused he played the lotto with certain numbers.

Throughout season one the survivors try to find shelter, build a raft, and encounter a French woman named Danielle Rosseau.  Danielle keeps warning the survivors that their are others on this island and shows up in the series periodically from time to time to warn them.

There is also a supernatural component to the story, such as when Jack, Charlie, and Claire stumble across the cockpit.  They find that the ill-fated piolot is still inside, and as the piolot tells them that they are about 200 miles off course a monster eats him.

With so much exitment in this one show, it is likely to be around for a while.  All that is really nessesary to say is...Get LOST.",1115856000,11,1493,4.485185185185185

1551919,5,B00005JNOG,"Lost occupies two spaces simultaneously. The one space is an island, presumably somewhere in the Pacific, though if anything is for sure about this show, it is that one should never presume. The other space is the past lives - full of love, hate, revenge, regret - of the main characters. And in both cases, these characters are ""lost.""

Like The X-Files, you are to believe that the creators of this series have it all figured out, that it all makes sense to them. Don't believe it. There are plenty of plot inconsistencies and oddities and elements that don't add up. One of the characters even points out some of these in an episode. But here's the kicker - Don't care. Because this is grand entertainment.

In both spaces, Lost blends true human drama with the odd and seemingly supernatural, teetering on occasion on the brink of credibility and melodrama while never taking that last step. You will care about these people. You will want to see what happens next. You will hang on each detail about their past live and current predicament. And you won't care about the inconsistencies except to have something to chat about on Thursdays in the office.

Like many of the great X-Files episodes, Lost episodes give you details that many never be explained absolutely. But the overall effect is emotional, deep, and lasting. With its humor, pathos, action, and creeps, Lost is a show as much felt as watched. Some of it is visceral, and the show features many ""beautiful people"" and tough action. Some of it is almost whimsical, such as during the golf matches. Much of it is poignant with plenty of melancholy thrown in.

I'm not saying that you should turn your brain off - much of the fun is trying to figure things out. (Note, that's ""trying"" to figure them out, not ""actually"" figuring them out.) What I am saying is that you shouldn't spend so much time evaluating the wine that you forget to enjoy it when it's in your mouth. Lost is fun and fascinating - and almost always mesmerizing. Time well spent, whether you spend it in the past or present live of these castaways.",1115769600,13,2082,4.649456521739131
1551920,5,B00005JNOG,"This is bar none the best show on TV right now.

For those of you who have never watched it but have seen ABC's other new megahit Desperate Housewives, you'll love this show.  It has the same sort of aspect about it when it comes to mysteries.  Albeit in my opinion lost is the better show of the two.

The series comes from creator J.J. Abrahams, who's other show Alias, launched him to fame.  This show centers on the survivors of  an oceanic flight from sydney to LA.  The plane crashed and 48 people survive, this show is not like survivor or giligans island or any other show that involves a beach or an island.

When I first saw the previews for the show I thought it looked interesting and would make a good miniseries but not a full fledge season, boy was I wrong.

The way the show develops the characters by telling you little bits at a time about where they were before they were on the island.  THe use of flashbacks is amazing, and such an ingenious way to tell the story.

TRUST ME this is the best show on tv and after one episode you will be hooked! this is the only show to dvd that I would actually suggest buying!!! worth it~~~~~",1115683200,8,1148,4.244239631336406

Anyway, with TV a wasteland of reality programming and predictable drama's like CSI and Law & Order, Lost shines above the silly quips of William Peterson. I just wish ABC (and other networks) would take more risks. Given a bit of creative freedom and less network suits saying shows have to appeal to the straight, white teenage boy demographic, TV can be so much better. Sure, there is room for dumb shows like CSI and Law & Order, but do we need so many? I don't think so. Anyway, Lost reminds me of why TV can be good and not just an idiot box. The characters are flawed, and no one is a hero, even Jack (who I still think hates being the defacto leader). And despite the death of Boone (played by the guy with bedroom eyes and perfect cheekbones, Ian Somerhalder and was really a mistake) the show has yet to stumble. With the success of this and Desperate Housewives, maybe the networks will parade more character driven shows next fall, instead of CSI: Hoffman Estates and Law & Order: 22nd and California.",1115424000,3,1109,4.4411764705882355

1551995,5,B00005JNOG,"Just seeing the promos last Summer, I was more excited about this show than anything else on television in recent memory.  Since the show premiered, it has not disappointed.

""Lost"" is arguably the greatest thing I've ever seen on the tube: a slick, ambitious and blazingly entertaining hybrid of drama, sci-fi, action and more than a little comedy.  It blends all these elements seamlessly (a majority of the time, at least) while operating on a level of psychological complexity that most shows would never dare attempt.

If you've never seen the show, I'd advise you not to start watching this season, since you will be cluless as to what's going on (if the show is like a novel, then every episode is another chapter; an action in episode #4 will have serious ramifications in episode #16 - that sort of thing).  Buy the DVD set of season one in September, catch up, then pick it up with season two in the Fall.  I warn you: this show is addictive!

""Lost"" is intelligently written and extremely entertaining.

I can't remember the last time I looked so forward to watching T.V.

""Lost"" is truly refreshing and thought provoking. It is exactly what we needed after the excessive amount of brainless fluff that has been forced down our throats at every angle. (ie: reality television)

So as we wait for the release of the ""Lost"" DVD, here are a few tidbits that you may or may not know about:

The ""Lost"" set was once a crime scene: Some crew members decided not to work on ""Lost"" because of the location of the set; inside a former Xerox warehouse that is the site of the worst mass murder in the history of the state of Hawaii. The building had been left vacant since November 2, 1999 when a Xerox employee shot and killed 6 of his coworkers. The building had to be blessed before the first day of work on the set of ""Lost"".

Matthew Fox was not supposed to play the role of ""Jack"" and Jack was not supposed to live past the pilot episode. Fox originally read for another character. He was stopped in the middle of his audition and was asked to read for the role of ""Jack"" instead. Originally, they had asked Michael Keaton to play the role of ""Jack"" but he turned them down.

Emile (Claire) read for the role of Shannon.

The character ""Charlie"" was supposed to be a much older man.

Dom (Charlie) originally read for the role of Sawyer.

Hurley was the first to be hired.

Sayid is married to Barbara Hershey.

Charlie & Kate are a real life couple.

Kate was hired only after she pulled her hair back.

During a break in shooting, 2 ""Lost"" stars were in the LA airport. They said that there were several people that came up to them, not for autographs... but to ask what flight they were going to be on. They wanted to make sure that they were not going to be on the same flight.

The guy who plays the role of ""Ethan"" is the cousin of Tom Cruise.

Instead, the producers have made it possible to make educated guesses on what's really going on. Plus, everyone is mysteriously, unknowingly connected and the audience has to figure out those connections, sometimes through fleeting clues. It's absolute genius.

JJ Abrams created a magnificent world for ""Lost"", full of mystery, beautiful scenery and strong characters. It takes only 10 minutes into the Pilot to see the show is not like anything previously seen on television. The production value in the pilot amazed me, and the thriller part grabbed me. But since the third episode, I was hooked for the characters, and the mystery aspect of the show. I sure hope all the questions the fans asked all season long will be partially answered by season's end (the powers-that-be promise they have a ""show bible""), but with this show, after every questions is answered, a new one arises.

There's a big cinematic feel to the show (The Hawaiian landscape dosen't hurt), great directing, writing (JJ assembled great writers to create great team), and masterful acting. The casting is almost perfect, for example Terry O'Quinn as spiritual Locke, Josh Holloway as con-man Sawyer, or Jorge Garcia as lovable Hurley (fantastic comic-relief, far surpasses Marshal on ""Alias"", another Abrams show).

The DVD is really worth it: Seeing previous episodes in second-viewing after you get to know the character's stories (through the flashbacks, a great narrative the show uses almost-always successfully) is really interesting. I hope the show continues to fascinate in further seasons, cause it looks like we've got ourselves a winner.",1111881600,4,1553,5.011627906976744
1552278,5,B00005JNOG,"I'm not going to talk about the show, I'm assuming if you're reading this you already know what its about.  I think we all can agree that Lost is one of the deepest and coolest television shows to date, but the real question is, will this DVD be worth it?

After watching Alias Season 1 on DVD and seeing how incredible the DVD is, I think that this package will be very desirable. It is likely that the cinematography will be improved and digitally reenhanced. TV reception will no longer be a factor, and no little ABC icon in the corner. It will probably have added bonuses that will be cool to see. If price doesn't change from now until it comes out, $38.99 is incredibly cheap! Alias S1 or any other TV DVD box set is usually $50+.

Of course if these don't cut it, theres always the fact that you might want to buy this solely for the love of Lost, because it is such an interesting show each time you watch it you will get something new out of it. I'm not going to jump to buy this yet, its a long time from now! The seasons not even over. But right now it looks like a deal.",1111363200,4,1083,4.123222748815166
1552279,5,B00005JNOG,"I LOVE this show, it is absolutly amazing!!!  I am certianly buying the DVDs, and watch as much as I watch JJ's other show...Alias :)",1111104000,6,133,4.32
1552280,5,B00005JNOG,"What makes Lost so addictive?

The first time I saw Lost was in Anchorage, Alaska. I saw the promos for it, and decided to check it out; though I spent most of the two hour pilot divided between watching the show and talking to a friend on the phone. I didn't get a feel for the characters, and I thought it wasn't going to be worth following, but I gave it another shot the following week. After the first flashback, I was hooked...but why?

I think it is because of the characters of this show. If the writers know what is good for them, they had better not lose sight of the fact that this is a character-driven show, even if it means that you have to account for all 14 or so main characters (plus the 4 or 5 semi-regulars). However, that doesn't mean to say that the plot elements on the show are to be tossed by the wayside; oh no! Perish the thought! It is simply that while the plot elements thus far are quite intriguing, what makes it all tick is the character interaction to these plot elements.

So, what has happened on the show in the past season? It's...well...almost impossible to tell without watching it. One can tell of the island events, but that's only half the story if you don't know the flashbacks to life events that helped shape each character and influence their reaction to the island events. The Cliffnotes version is...the plane crashes, everyone sees weird stuff happening on the island, monsters uproot trees, polar bears attack, fights occur, people begin to pull together, an infiltrator tries to steal a pregnant girl, and gets wasted by a drug addict for his trouble, a hatch is discovered and when opened, a Scotsman is found....a PIRATE SHIP is found inland (almost forgot about that), and the people in the tail end of the plane meet up with the main people.

That doesn't even begin to do it justice, and the second season thus far is even more involved.

I'd be hard-pressed to give you a fave character. If I were forced, I'd say it's a tie between Locke and Eko at this stage...I would have said Locke before Eko came along, but now it's a tie...however, the characters I like the best besides those two are Sun (hot!), Sayid, and Jin. I liked Michael, and I guess I still do, but his nutjob actions recently are kind of making me less sympathetic...I like Hurley but I need some more interaction between his storyline and the island storyline to get him on a higher level of concern. I'm interested in most of the other storylines to see how they interact with the island story but my least fave character is Kate. Not that I hate the acting (because I don't) but she is just an annoying character as portayed in this episode past. I don't want to get rid of her though. Yet. I used to be annoyed by Sawyer, but his redemption thread was getting interesting...until he proved himself nigh-unredeemable! Jack, I'm conflicted about. He's the unofficial leader of the group, his flashbacks are interesting, he's involved in a lot of the stuff that goes on...but he needs a huge chill pill.

I don't hate Ana Lucia like many others do. I'm willing to wait and see what goes on with her later.

While I didn't hate Boone or Shannon, I agree that they were the least likely to be missed if they died. I fear that Claire is headed into the same region right now, since she's had the baby and nothing much has been said of that. At least Charlie has been doing stuff on the island, irritating though he is...but I'm intrigued by his character, I'll see where it goes.

Do not mess with the Others. Who are they anyways? I do believe that they are the de Groots (the leaders) but who are the other people?

And finally, the deux ex machina characters, who pop up at various times as plot catalysts...like Desmond and Danielle. No flashbacks for them, but they have their own story to tell...

I can't wait to see what's next for the castaways! In my tier of shows, I wouldn't put Lost as better than ""The Wire"" or ""Battlestar Galactica"", but it would be a little bit higher than ""24"" and ""The Sopranos"". It is definately the best TV show on Network TV right now.",1111104000,,4097,4.457943925233645
1552351,5,B00005JNOG,"A comment about the show, not the as-yet-unreleased DVDs:

My wife and I agree that this is the best show in television.  Casting, acting, writing, everything is top-notch superb.  We've kept all the episodes so far and have been passing them around to friends so they can catch up before the season ends.

Though the show is classified officially as a drama, it's SO much more than that... it's drama, suspense, mystery, thriller, action, and adventure all rolled into one fantastic package. (See the other reviews here also.)

The short of it is if you like any of these genres, you owe it to  yourself to see this show.",1111017600,359,622,4.660550458715596
1552352,5,B00005JNOG,"This show is so refreshing to watch. It actually requires the viewer to think a little bit and draw conclusions, unlike most of the shows on television currently. The show has an AMAZING cast and  equally incredible writers.

The plot is so much more than just surviving a plane crash. There are so many elements to it. I highly recommend this show to EVERYONE. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it will ALWAYS leave you wanting more.",1111017600,8,446,4.5625
1552353,5,B00005JNOG,"Watching the first epsiode of this addicting series, i was on the edge of my seat. It was one of the most thriling experiences i have had while watching tv. Who knew that this show would become one of the most watched, talked about, aclaimed shows on tv.

Since the first epsiode, Lost has become one of the most addictive tv shows in history. This is the next X-Files.

When a plane crashes on a mysterious island, where they eventually find polar bears, giant ""monsters"", wild boar and other mysterious things, the 48 survivors have to learn to live with each other and fend for themselves in ways they never imagined they would.

The show has a great ensemble cast and smart, twisted writing.

Its been a long time since a show has held my intrest like Lost has. I never miss a epsiode.

1552354,5,B00005JNOG,"From J.J. Abrams, the creator of Alias, and Damon Lindelof (Crossing Jordan) comes an action-packed adventure that will bring out the very best and the very worst in the people who are lost. Out of the blackness, the first thing Jack (Matthew Fox, Party of Five) senses is pain. Then burning sun. A Bamboo forest. Smoke. Screams. With a rush comes the horrible awareness that the plane he was on tore apart in mid-air and crashed on a Pacific island. From there it's a blur, as his doctor's instinct kicks in: people need his help. Stripped of everything, the 48 survivors scavenge what they can from the plane for their survival. Some panic. Some pin their hopes on rescue. A few find inner strength they never knew they had -- like Kate (Evangeline Lilly), who, with no medical training, suddenly finds herself suturing the doctor's wounds. Hurley (Jorge Garcia) - a man with a warm sense of humor despite the desperate situation - does his best to keep his cool as he helps those around him to survive. Charlie (Dominic Monaghan, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring trilogy) is a faded rock star who harbors a painful secret. Sayid (Naveen Andrews, The English Patient) is a Middle Eastern man who must wrestle with the racial profiling directed at him by some of his fellow survivors. Jin (Daniel Dae Kim, Spider-Man 2, 24) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) are a Korean couple whose traditions, values and language are foreign and thus causes much to get lost in the translation. Sawyer (Josh Holloway) has an air of danger surrounding him, and his intense sense of mistrust for everyone around him could prove to be fatal to his fellow castaways. Michael (Harold Perrineau, Oz) has just gained custody of his nine-year-old son, Walt (Malcolm David Kelley, Antwone Fisher, You Got Served), after the death of his ex-wife - they are a father and son who don't even know each other. Locke (Terry O'Quinn, Alias, Primal Fear) is a mysterious man who keeps to himself, and who harbors a deeper connection to the island than any of the others. And self-centered Shannon (Maggie Grace, Oliver Beene) - who actually gives herself a pedicure amid the chaos - and her estranged controlling brother, Boone (Ian Somerhalder, Smallville) - constantly bicker and must learn to get along if they are to survive. The band of friends, family, enemies and strangers must work together against the cruel weather and harsh terrain if they want to stay alive. But the island holds many secrets, including the intense howls of the mysterious creatures stalking the jungle, which fill them all with fear. Fortunately, thanks to the calm leadership of quick-thinking Jack and level-headed Kate, they have hope. But even heroes have secrets, as the survivors will come to learn. This show is awesome it is absolutly perfect! I know it's a little  early to be thinking but It would be so cool if they made a movie.  If there is going to be as many special features as they are predicting this will be the DVD of the year.

Special Features:
  * The original pilot
  * Behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the show
  * Audio commentaries
  * Blooper reel
  * Roundtable discussions with cast and crew
  * A Matthew Fox photography featurette
  * Deleted scenes

1552355,5,B00005JNOG,"I've gotta admit, I'm an HBO person. The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Deadwood...Usually, network tv can't compare to the greatness of HBO's programming in my eyes. Cable comes close with Nip/Tuck, but not quite. The past couple of years, especially with all the reality tv and painfully redundant and formulaic ""procedural dramas"" such as CSI and Law & Order, the only network show that held my attention was J.J. Abrams's Alias. So, when I heard Abrams was developing another high-concept show, I figured it would be worth checking out. And boy, was I glad I did. I love science-fiction when it's done well (Joss Whedon's extremely short-lived Firefly was an example), and Lost is sci-fi at it's best. Why? Because the sci-fi elements never overpower the storytelling and character development. There will be tons of reviews here that give a summary of the show, so I'll skip that. I'll just say why I love it:

The Characters: While there are initially 48 survivors on this island, the show chooses 14 of them to focus on. With each episode, largely through flashbacks to their lives before they boarded the ill-fated flight, we learn more about these characters. And over time, the viewer grows strongly attached to each of them. It's always fun knowing things about these people that no one else on the island knows, and it helps us as an audience understand why they act a certain way and do certain things while on the island.

The Mystery: Yes, there's an unseen ""something"" that kills people on this island. There's also a crazy French woman who's been stranded there long before the survivors of Flight 815, and she has mentioned more than once that there are ""others."" And there do seem to be manifestations and miracles on the island born out of the castaways' minds. And there ARE connections this island had to these people before they were stranded there. For every answer we get, a new question is posed. But what can I say, that's good tv. Needless to say, Lost is full of intrigue, along with agonizing cliffhangers (which is why owning the DVD set will be so great. It'll be hard to just watch one episode without starting a marathon). J.J. is the king of plot-twists (no one predicted who was wearing those handcuffs, or the truth about Locke, for example), which makes Lost constantly unpredictable, shocking, and addictive.

This show has something for everyone. It's got action (the 5-episode storyline in which the survivors are terrorized by someone on the island - someone who kidnaps and kills - particularly stands out), horror (the unseen ""monster""), romance (not any overly-cheesy WB-type romance, but there are a few budding relationships on the island), comedy (pretty much anything Hurley says or does), and great old-fashioned character drama and development. There's also some truly memorable moments (The peanut butter scene, the ""Pee on my foot!"" scene, the Kate/Jack hug, a castaway hanged from a tree, the torture of Sawyer, and ""the kiss,"" just to name a few...). It is also full of big themes and great messages, making it intelligent storytelling that works for the viewer on multiple levels.

I enjoy Lost more than any other show on television. The only reason I called it the best show on NETWORK TV is because it's only had one season. Time will tell if it can sustain its brilliance as long as The Sopranos and the other great dramas, but it's off to a really amazing start. This DVD set sounds as great as Abrams's Alias DVD's with behind-the-scenes features, his always interesting commentaries, and of course, the highly anticipated gag reel. Standout episodes include the two-part Pilot (one of the most expensive in history), which will hook you immediately, Episode 4 (""Walkabout""), which tells us about the most mysterious character on the island, John Locke, and Episode 18 (""Numbers""), which finally gave one of the most beloved characters, Hurley (played by Jorge Garcia), his due, along with introducing a major new element to the mystery of the island that will probably carry on a major role for seasons to come.",1110672000,19,4071,4.895652173913043
1552356,5,B00005JNOG,"Hopes were not terribly high for ""Lost,"" the action-drama about a planeful of castaways lost on a tropical island. ""Gilligan's Island"" all over again? Not quite. This mysterious show rapidly turned itself into a runaway hit. Mystery, drama, the supernatural and horror seep into this series, turning it into one of the most intriguing shows on television.

The series opens with a wrecked plane on a beach, surrounded by panicking people who manage to escape the wreckage. Jack (Matthew Fox) manages to group the refugees into a makeshift camp on the shore -- but soon they hear strange noises and see palm trees being trampled by a gargantuan monster. And when he ventures into the jungle, with the mysterious Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and junkie rocker Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), they find the still-living pilot. The pilot reveals that they are hundreds of miles off course, and no one will be able to find him. Then he gets eaten by an unseen monster.

Now the island is occupied by a motley band, including a strange warrior-sage with a knife-throwing knack, a traumatized con man, a pregnant girl whose baby holds a secret, a secretive Korean couple, a snobby rich girl and her exasperated brother, an Iraqi ex-soldier, and a ""dude""-talking chubby guy who has a dark secret of his own. Despite Jack's best efforts, the group splits into two camps, and tensions grow between them.

And there are even worse things coming -- the survivors are not the only ones on the island. A possibly crazy Frenchwoman (Mira Furlan) is hiding somewhere in the jungle, and the murderous ""Ethan"" kidnaps and nearly kills two of the survivors. The island itself has mysteries -- mysterious monsters, voices in the woods, radio towers, a metal hatch in the jungle ground, and a string of numbers that bring madness and ill fortune...

Yes, it's a weird show. But in the midst of shallow sitcoms and endless reality TV, it's refreshing to see a twisty-turny show like this one. J.J. Adams, best known for ""Alias,"" outdoes his first hit TV show with something totally different. The best way to describe it is as ""Swiss Family Robinson,"" as written by Stephen King.

The gorgeous Hawaiian landscape is a contrast for such a dark storyline. Adams never reveals everything, which keeps up the suspense -- the mysterious monster (a dinosaur?) is only briefly seen by the characters, and nobody knows exactly what it is. Nor are we sure who has been there, or what is up with the island. Adams keeps viewers guessing by slowly peeling away the layers.

What's really interesting is that ""Lost"" is truly an ensemble show -- Adams gives every character a chance to shine, and flashbacks reveal what makes them tick. Some, like ex-con Kate, are a bit more mysterious than others, but some like the Korean marrieds and the haunted, smart-alecky Sawyer get a lot more dimension and humanity.

Matthew Fox is given a lot of attention, and he is a good actor. But it's the secondary actors that really catch your attention: Dominic Monaghan gives a simply amazing performance as Charlie, especially when Charlie goes through withdrawal, Jorge Garcia is equally good at comedy (""Dude, that was a Jedi moment!"") and drama, and Terry O'Quinn is stellar as the enigmatic cubicle-worker-turned-jungle-warrior. Evangeline Lilly gives the debut performance of a lifetime, as tormented criminal Kate.

""Lost"" is a well-written, well-acted show that brings a bit of mystery back into prime-time television. Creepy, funny, romantic, tragic and sometimes just weird, it's definitely worth checking out.",1110672000,32,3563,5.006756756756757

1552358,5,B00005JNOG,"I live in Hawaii and was immediately intrigued when talk of 2 new shows were going to be filmed on Oahu.  While the show ""Hawaii"" was cancelled, LOST became an immediate hit, with similar audiences who find the show ""24"" appealing.  It is not just some castaways/gilligan's island idea.  Rather, it mixes the daily survival stories of the cast with flashbacks of their lives before the crash, their hopes and struggles, and perhaps why they happened to be on that flight.  It also mixes realism of basic survival skills with a hint of science fiction/mysticism.  Are there really dinosaur-like creatures on the island?  What about the ""others"" who reside there?  Is this actually a level of hell or afterlife, as each character seems to be working on their inner demons from their life before becoming lost?  It is questions like these along with hints and foreshadowing throughout each episode (that I believe become easier to see when viewed more than once) that make this show so fascinating to watch.  If you haven't seen it yet, I highly suggest starting from the beginning, use surround sound, with your house lights off (and preferably raining and thundering outside)!",1109289600,14,1175,4.954081632653061
1552359,5,B00005JNOG,"I have to say that I don't watch very many television dramas.  After hearing Dominic Monaghan (Lord of the Rings) was to be appearing on Lost, however, I knew I had to watch it.  I was pleasantly rewarded.

The premise of the story is simple: a plane crashes on a deserted island.  48 people survive the crash under strange circumstances, and must band together in order to survive.  But the island is not what it seems - mysterious and dangerous creatures inhabit the jungle, and the most mysterious and dangerous of them all has, as of yet, not been revealed.  The island is a chest full of secrets, and the challenges test both their survival skills and their bonds together.

The cast of Lost is quite large.  The most focused on characters include a surgeon, a sweet-natured woman with a dark past, a drug addicted ex-rock star, a pair of rich siblings, a former member of the Iraqi Guard, a pregnant girl, a Korean couple who do not speak english, a mysterious man named Locke, an estranged father and son, a friendly and comical man named Hurley, and an angry Southern loner.  Feel these descriptions aren't nearly adequate enough?  Watch the show - their mysterious stories are revealed with each episode, in a series of flashbacks.

I am very excited about the coming release of the Lost DVD.  In the meantime, watch the show every Wednesday night.",1106438400,14,1357,4.679324894514768
