495157,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B000007T1D,darragh o'donoghue,"[33, 35]","'Band of outsiders' is Jean-Luc Cinema Godard's most endearing film - a teen movie played by adults, a love story, a heist movie, a serial, a slapstick comedy, an anthology of New Wave magic.  As with previous films, Hollywood genre is made a complete nonsense, continually deflated by extended bits of business, my favourite being the attempt to beat the record for racing down the Louvre's corridors just before the heist.As with all early Godard, the joy of 'Band' is in the bouyant playfulness of his style - the high, long shots looking down on bustling activity; the long car-journeys through Paris streets; the intense close-ups on Anna Karina (Godard's wife), eluding all meaning, or the sheer rapture in watching her running along pavements, or crossing a river; the messing around disused yards; the lengthy quotes and allusions that stall the action and give resonance to the silly goings-on and the turmoil of the characters in them; the unwavering long takes with exciting real sound; the playful homages to old Hollywood; the narrator's bumptious intrusions, equating events with 'bad B-movies'.More than Louis Malle's 'Zazie dans le metro', 'Band' is the ultimate Raymond Queneau film - Karina's character is named after the heroine of Queneau's roman a clef 'Odile', a book about the writer's break with the Surrealists, just as 'Band' signals Godard's outpacing the New Wave - with its deadpan marginal heroes, its elusive heroine who doesn't want to be elusive; its romanticising Paris, especially its margins  and its pull to the embankments; the attractions like circuses and funfairs intruding on the everyday.  Godard finds a cinematic equivalent for Queneau's narrative voice - its flip melancholy; its casual intellectualism; its move from messing about to the philosophical to slapstick to dreams to the tragic and back again; in the self-consciousness of the characters; in the narrative mix of whim, genre and destiny.",5,Godard bids a fond farewell to the New Wave.,1000339200,"09 13, 2001",2001,1945,"[""'Band"", 'outsiders', 'Jean-Luc', 'Cinema', 'Godard', 'most', 'endearing', 'film', 'teen', 'movie', 'played', 'adults', 'love', 'story', 'heist', 'movie', 'serial', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'anthology', 'New', 'Wave', 'magic', 'previous', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'genre', 'made', 'complete', 'nonsense', 'continually', 'deflated', 'extended', 'bits', 'business', 'favourite', 'being', 'attempt', 'beat', 'record', 'racing', 'down', 'Louvre', 'corridors', 'just', 'heist.As', 'early', 'Godard', 'joy', ""'Band"", 'bouyant', 'playfulness', 'style', 'high', 'long', 'shots', 'looking', 'down', 'bustling', 'activity', 'long', 'car-journeys', 'Paris', 'streets', 'intense', 'close-ups', 'Anna', 'Karina', 'Godard', 'wife', 'eluding', 'meaning', 'sheer', 'rapture', 'watching', 'running', 'pavements', 'crossing', 'river', 'messing', 'around', 'disused', 'yards', 'lengthy', 'quotes', 'allusions', 'stall', 'action', 'give', 'resonance', 'silly', 'goings-on', 'turmoil', 'characters', 'unwavering', 'long', 'exciting', 'real', 'sound', 'playful', 'homages', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'narrator', 'bumptious', 'intrusions', 'equating', 'events', ""B-movies'.More"", 'Louis', 'Malle', ""'Zazie"", 'dans', 'le', 'metro', ""'Band"", 'ultimate', 'Raymond', 'Queneau', 'film', 'Karina', 'character', 'named', 'heroine', 'Queneau', 'roman', 'clef', ""'Odile"", 'book', 'writer', 'break', 'Surrealists', 'just', ""'Band"", 'signals', 'Godard', 'outpacing', 'New', 'Wave', 'deadpan', 'marginal', 'heroes', 'elusive', 'heroine', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'elusive', 'romanticising', 'Paris', 'especially', 'margins', 'pull', 'embankments', 'attractions', 'circuses', 'funfairs', 'intruding', 'everyday', 'Godard', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'Queneau', 'narrative', 'voice', 'flip', 'melancholy', 'casual', 'intellectualism', 'move', 'messing', 'philosophical', 'slapstick', 'dreams', 'tragic', 'back', 'again', 'self-consciousness', 'characters', 'narrative', 'mix', 'whim', 'genre', 'destiny']",Band of Outsiders VHS

Although the traditional structure is present--small-time criminals get in over their heads and meet with tragedy--director Jean-Luc Godard does not choose the earnest emphasis on plot that usually distinguishes such material.  He strips the ""plot"" to its bare essentials--three people are going to burglarize a house--and, as if to acknowledge that such characters could never exist in the real world, he presents them as existentially-challenged, melancholy misfits who lack a sense of connection with the everyday world and amuse themselves with impromptu breaks with reality such as an spontaneous dance in a cafe, a race through the Louvre to see everything in the shortest possible time, and pantomimed gunfights in the street.  This film walks a fine line between inviting both contempt for the unsympathetic characters as well as delight at the liberties Godard takes with the conventions of film and his chosen genre./",4,Daring and playful,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,1107,"['Arthur', 'Franz', 'are', 'amoral', 'pair', 'who', 'have', 'enlisted', 'naive', 'Odile', 'scheme', 'steal', 'wealthy', 'aunt', 'playful', 'French', 'homage', 'American', 'genre', 'film', 'noir', 'traditional', 'structure', 'present', 'small-time', 'criminals', 'get', 'heads', 'meet', 'tragedy', 'director', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'not', 'choose', 'earnest', 'emphasis', 'plot', 'usually', 'distinguishes', 'such', 'material', 'plot', 'bare', 'essentials', 'three', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'burglarize', 'house', 'acknowledge', 'such', 'characters', 'could', 'never', 'exist', 'real', 'world', 'existentially-challenged', 'melancholy', 'misfits', 'who', 'lack', 'sense', 'connection', 'everyday', 'world', 'amuse', 'impromptu', 'breaks', 'reality', 'such', 'spontaneous', 'dance', 'cafe', 'race', 'Louvre', 'see', 'everything', 'shortest', 'possible', 'time', 'pantomimed', 'gunfights', 'street', 'film', 'fine', 'line', 'inviting', 'contempt', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'delight', 'liberties', 'Godard', 'conventions', 'film', 'chosen', 'genre./']",Band of Outsiders VHS
495159,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000007T1D,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 3]","Even though I haven't gotten around to finish watching Jean-Luc Godard's celebrated  Breathless (1960) despite trying a couple of times, I'm pretty sure I like Band of Outsiders better.  Main reason: Anna Karina.  I have little doubt that most women would prefer Breathless since it stars Jean-Paul Belmondo who, as cinematic history has it, anticipated Richard Gere's performance in Truffaut's American Breathless (1983).What I love about Karina's Odile is her incredible naivete.  Although 20-years-old playing perhaps an 18-year-old, Karina, then Godard's wife, manages the complete and total personality of someone say 12-years-old.  It is her naivete that makes the film work as two petty, would-be criminals, Arthur (Claude Brasseur) and Franz (Sami Frey) seduce her into helping them rob a surprisingly large number of francs from her Aunt's house.  At least they think they're going to score. We'll see how the fates feel about that.They meet in a beginning English language class.  Obviously it is not just Godard who admires American culture, our three beginners in life do as well.  Appropriately enough the film is adapted from Fools' Gold, an American novel by Dolores Hitchins.  In a sense this is a French film imitating not an American film but an American attitude toward life, a free and easy world in which riches are liable to just fall into your lap, where it's chic to be young and run with the wind and drive your convertible onto the sidewalk when you feel like it and in crazy circles for no reason at all, and it is especially fun to jump into the vehicle without opening the doors while it is moving.  It is an existence in which you feel spontaneous and uninhibited and can dance the Madison without looking at your feet.Well, Odile and Franz can.  Arthur watches his continuously.  And this tells us something about Arthur, who is a bit mean and a bit shallow, but intent on getting his and getting it right.  It is he with whom Odile falls into puppy love.  She is attracted to his confidence and his crude masculinity, and his interest in her, nothing more.  She is further seduced by the joy of finding friends and something exciting to do.  She hasn't a clue about who they are or who she is, and that in part is the charm of the film.She has lovely limbs that we do not see.  She runs gracefully, stretching her legs out like a colt.  She delights in sitting in the front seat of the Simca, the men on either side of her.  Steal the money she has spotted in her uncle's closet, money that she herself would never think of stealing?  Okay.  And then we go to England or better yet, South America like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Childish, very childish and charming because Odile is so pretty, just that, pretty as every young girl should be.  But surely something tragic is going to happen.  Surely this is a cautionary tale about how innocence is lost.There are gray day shots of Paris and the suburbs now covered with concrete and asphalt.  There's a nine-minute run through the Louvre, young people just having fun; and then the denouement and tragedy.  Of some sort.  And then the fantasy life returns as the film ends.Godard's story, his plot, isn't to be taken seriously, but his characters are.  Arthur is the bad guy, the primitive, just an animal acting out his animal life.  But Franz is sly, reflective, reads books, is well-mannered, is finding himself.  Odile is a child who will be a woman soon.The Criterion Collection DVD is nicely presented with some of the usual extras, including excerpts from interviews with Godard and Anna Karina.

495160,A2NWMKTGGROUM8,B000007T1D,"""doctor_smith""","[72, 75]","If there are any films that offer a wonderful sense of love for the cinema, they are the films of Jean-Luc Godard. But, as he explains in a brief interview from 1964 that is included with this fine DVD, he was also against film; that is, against the conventions and rules that predominated French cinema. So he introduced unconventional methods of telling stories and making movies and decided to include elements that films typically left out. &quot;Band of Outsiders&quot; is a playful, unconventional, mesmerizing tale of small-time gangsters and young love set in 1960s Paris.  Its source material runs the gamut from the pulp crime novel on which it is based to the American B-movies and film noir that inspired its look. It's Godard's best love letter to Paris since &quot;Breathless,&quot; and also one of the last of his true New Wave films.The story might be simple enough: Arthur and Franz enlist the help of the young, beautiful Odile to stage a robbery. But if the story is simple, everything else around it is not. Here we find allusions and homages to Arthur Rimbaud (the poet whom one of the characters is named after), Franz Kafka, film composer Michel Legrand, &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,&quot; T.S. Eliot, Shakespeare, American cartoons, Jack London, Charlie Chaplin, Andre Breton, Andre Malraux, and numerous others. That's Godard doing his thing, and even if we miss those allusions, there's so much more to be cherished: the famous minute of silence, the running visit through the Louvre, the dance scene, the glorious closeups of Anna Karina, riding on the underground metro, the trio driving through the streets of Paris.&quot;Band of Outsiders&quot; is playful, wondrous, hilarious, breezy, but at the same time melancholic, dark in its undertones. Raoul Coutard's photography gives it a stark look, but its playfulness is its most alluring aspect, along with Godard's wonderfully appealing, inventive visual language. It might not be the finest example of the French New Wave, nor is it as perfect as a work of art as &quot;Breathless&quot; and &quot;My Life to Live,&quot; but in its flaunting of cinematic invention, its richness, and its embodiment of pure cinema, it's in a class by itself and certainly a film that should be seen, if not owned, by lovers of cinema. Its most memorable moments will remain in your mind forever.Many Godard fans, myself included, have been waiting eagerly for this Criterion edition of &quot;Band of Outsiders.&quot;  It's a remarkable digital transfer; the images and contrasts are crisp; the mono soundtrack is as clear as possible.  The additional features are worth the price of the DVD alone, including a visual glossary that explains many of the film's allusions and a brief interview in which Godard explains the philosophy behind the New Wave.  Criterion has really outdone itself with this disc, and that's saying something.I recommend that, even if you do not know French, you should watch this film at least once with the subtitles off since they sometimes obscure the closeups that make this film so memorable. When the camera is on Anna Karina's face, believe me when I say you don't want anything to stand in its way.",5,Dancing the Madison in glorious black and white!,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,3198,"['are', 'films', 'offer', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'love', 'cinema', 'are', 'films', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'brief', 'interview', '1964', 'included', 'fine', 'DVD', 'was', 'also', 'film', 'conventions', 'rules', 'predominated', 'French', 'cinema', 'introduced', 'unconventional', 'methods', 'telling', 'stories', 'making', 'movies', 'decided', 'include', 'elements', 'films', 'typically', 'left', 'out', 'quot', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'quot', 'playful', 'unconventional', 'mesmerizing', 'tale', 'small-time', 'gangsters', 'young', 'love', 'set', '1960s', 'Paris', 'source', 'material', 'gamut', 'pulp', 'crime', 'novel', 'based', 'American', 'B-movies', 'film', 'noir', 'inspired', 'look', 'Godard', 'best', 'love', 'letter', 'Paris', 'quot', 'Breathless', 'quot', 'also', 'one', 'last', 'true', 'New', 'Wave', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'simple', 'enough', 'Arthur', 'Franz', 'enlist', 'help', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Odile', 'stage', 'robbery', 'story', 'simple', 'everything', 'else', 'not', 'Here', 'find', 'allusions', 'homages', 'Arthur', 'Rimbaud', 'poet', 'whom', 'one', 'characters', 'named', 'Franz', 'Kafka', 'film', 'composer', 'Michel', 'Legrand', 'quot', 'Umbrellas', 'Cherbourg', 'quot', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'Shakespeare', 'American', 'cartoons', 'Jack', 'London', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Andre', 'Breton', 'Andre', 'Malraux', 'numerous', 'others', 'Godard', 'doing', 'thing', 'even', 'miss', 'allusions', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'cherished', 'famous', 'minute', 'silence', 'running', 'visit', 'Louvre', 'dance', 'scene', 'glorious', 'closeups', 'Anna', 'Karina', 'riding', 'underground', 'metro', 'trio', 'driving', 'streets', 'Paris.', 'quot', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'quot', 'playful', 'wondrous', 'hilarious', 'breezy', 'same', 'time', 'melancholic', 'dark', 'undertones', 'Raoul', 'Coutard', 'photography', 'stark', 'look', 'playfulness', 'most', 'alluring', 'aspect', 'Godard', 'wonderfully', 'appealing', 'inventive', 'visual', 'language', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'finest', 'example', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'as', 'perfect', 'work', 'art', 'quot', 'Breathless', 'quot', 'quot', 'Life', 'Live', 'quot', 'flaunting', 'cinematic', 'invention', 'richness', 'embodiment', 'pure', 'cinema', 'class', 'certainly', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'owned', 'lovers', 'cinema', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'will', 'remain', 'mind', 'forever.Many', 'Godard', 'fans', 'included', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'eagerly', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'quot', 'Band', 'Outsiders.', 'quot', 'remarkable', 'digital', 'transfer', 'images', 'contrasts', 'are', 'crisp', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'clear', 'possible', 'additional', 'features', 'are', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'including', 'visual', 'glossary', 'many', 'film', 'allusions', 'brief', 'interview', 'Godard', 'philosophy', 'New', 'Wave', 'Criterion', 'really', 'outdone', 'disc', 'saying', 'something.I', 'recommend', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'French', 'should', 'watch', 'film', 'least', 'once', 'subtitles', 'off', 'sometimes', 'obscure', 'closeups', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'memorable', 'When', 'camera', 'Anna', 'Karina', 'face', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'stand', 'way']",Band of Outsiders VHS

495164,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000007T1D,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 5]","""Band of Outsiders"" is the epitome of a great film and embodies, for me, exactly what a film should be. The film has inspired, at least partly, a large number of films over the year. Most famously a few scenes in ""Pulp Fiction."" It is also the film that Quentin Tarantino named his production company after (A Band Apart). If you've seen Pulp Fiction, as many times as I have, you'll notice a lot more inspiration than the casual viewer will. ""Band of Outsiders"" was released in 1964 and doesn't follow the typical movie formula. It's completely spontaneous, strung together, and fresh after all these years. The film is about two budding criminals named Franz (Sami Frey) and Arthur (Claude Brasseur), who conspire to rob the aunt of the beautiful Odile (Anna Karina, ""My Life to Live""). Both men are in love with Odile, but much more preoccupied with getting the money. In a review I read for the film it called the script ""incoherent"" while another review said the film felt ""strung together quickly and without much thought."" Both of these reviews are incredibly inaccurate. The plot does feel strung together, but that's what is so great about it. We meet Franz and Arthur as they're driving a car, they talk about Odile, they reenact the death of Billy the Kid, they take a stab at learning English before meeting up with Odile and putting their plan into motion. In one scene (at a coffee shop) the three stand up and dance in one continuous take. A movie does not have to have a coherent plot to be great. A great movie was once defined by Howard Hawks as being ""three great scenes, no bad scenes."" This film has no bad scenes and more than three great ones. Jean-Luc Godard, a director whose work I've only recently discovered (the other Godard films I've seen are ""Weekend"" and ""My Life to Live""), directed films that have a timeless quality to them. Movies that still feel new today and will continue to do so until the world looks like an episode of ""The Jetsons."" This film (and his others) have aged better than films like ""Citizen Kane"" (which isn't to say this is better). His movies feel so fun and spontaneous; it's hard not to be sucked in. The Criterion Collection has, once again, done a magnificent job with the DVD. The sound and picture quality is superb and the bonus features are good, although one wishes for more, but they're still interesting. Any person who likes unique films or liked ""Pulp Fiction"" and wants to see a film that inspired it should check this out. It's one of the great movies.GRADE: A",5,A Great Movie...Don't Miss It,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,2532,"['Band', 'Outsiders', 'epitome', 'great', 'film', 'embodies', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'inspired', 'least', 'partly', 'large', 'number', 'films', 'year', 'Most', 'famously', 'few', 'scenes', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'also', 'film', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'named', 'production', 'company', 'Band', 'Apart', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'many', 'times', 'have', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'lot', 'more', 'inspiration', 'casual', 'viewer', 'will', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'was', 'released', '1964', ""n't"", 'follow', 'typical', 'movie', 'formula', 'completely', 'spontaneous', 'strung', 'together', 'fresh', 'years', 'film', 'two', 'budding', 'criminals', 'named', 'Franz', 'Sami', 'Frey', 'Arthur', 'Claude', 'Brasseur', 'who', 'conspire', 'rob', 'aunt', 'beautiful', 'Odile', 'Anna', 'Karina', 'Life', 'Live', 'men', 'are', 'love', 'Odile', 'much', 'more', 'preoccupied', 'getting', 'money', 'review', 'read', 'film', 'called', 'script', 'incoherent', 'review', 'said', 'film', 'felt', 'strung', 'together', 'quickly', 'much', 'thought', 'reviews', 'are', 'incredibly', 'inaccurate', 'plot', 'feel', 'strung', 'together', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'meet', 'Franz', 'Arthur', ""'re"", 'driving', 'car', 'talk', 'Odile', 'reenact', 'death', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'take', 'stab', 'learning', 'English', 'meeting', 'up', 'Odile', 'putting', 'plan', 'motion', 'one', 'scene', 'coffee', 'shop', 'three', 'stand', 'up', 'dance', 'one', 'continuous', 'take', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'have', 'coherent', 'plot', 'be', 'great', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'once', 'defined', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'being', 'three', 'great', 'scenes', 'bad', 'scenes', 'film', 'bad', 'scenes', 'more', 'three', 'great', 'ones', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'director', 'work', ""'ve"", 'only', 'recently', 'discovered', 'other', 'Godard', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'Weekend', 'Life', 'Live', 'directed', 'films', 'have', 'timeless', 'quality', 'Movies', 'still', 'feel', 'new', 'today', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'world', 'episode', 'Jetsons', 'film', 'others', 'have', 'aged', 'better', 'films', 'Citizen', 'Kane', ""n't"", 'say', 'better', 'movies', 'feel', 'so', 'fun', 'spontaneous', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'sucked', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'once', 'again', 'done', 'magnificent', 'job', 'DVD', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'superb', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'good', 'one', 'wishes', 'more', ""'re"", 'still', 'interesting', 'Any', 'person', 'who', 'unique', 'films', 'liked', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'see', 'film', 'inspired', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'one', 'great', 'movies.GRADE']",Band of Outsiders VHS

The vision is of two men and a woman planning a robbery of a large sum of money.  The planning itself is a fruitless accomplishment as the three characters diverge cognitively, and instead end up entertaining their thoughts and egos.  Nevertheless, they are certain about setting their plan into action.  Occasionally, it seems as if Godard has lost it, but there is always a designed thought behind each action and scene.  Throughout the film Godard uses quotes from books, films, and music of his choosing, which colors the personalities of the characters.  These characters are what creates the cinematic experience together with Godard's rebellious directing and the groundbreaking cinematography.

This is early 60's New Wave spirited, movie convention bashing Godard, not the abstract inpenatratably political Godard of the late 60's and on. Spontaneous and joyful the picture has that wondeful feel of Paris in the early 60's. Godard punctuates the film with brilliant witty asides that are among his finest. The Louvre tour and Madison dance are some of the coolest moments on film. In fact the entire movie conveys a great sense of cool, a quirky cool. For me the film is especially notable because it introduced me to Anna Karina. This is one of the seven films she made with Godard and with this film I became captivated by her prescence as icon of the New Wave.Video: Thank you Criterion for providing a gorgeous transfer of the film. Extremely clean, perfectly sharp, nice contrast and this film is nearly 40 years old!Extras: Way to good, this is cheap for a Criterion disc and has more extras then most. A fun bonus identfies several in jokes and literary references, although the narrator is annoying. A short documentary actually has footage of Godard directing on set and is great for historic purposes. A recent interview with Coutard is interesting, but the highlight for me was an recent interview with Anna Karina. My college term paper on Karina took a lot of material from this. Another great bonus is a short silent film starring Karina and Godard. This short is in the film Cleo 5-7 and is lots of fun is you know a thing or two about Karina and Godard's relationship.

Cinema today would not be what it is without the classics; without Godard, without Kurosawa, without Fellini we would have no Tarintino, Spielberg, or Scorsese.  Band of Outsiders is an example of how fun a movie can be, and an even better example on how early cinema gave a blueprint for modern classics.  In one of the greatest scenes in a film I've ever witnessed, the films three main characters, Odile, Aurthur, and Franz, dance the Madison for several minutes inside a cafe, while taking a break from their drinks and, seemingly, their reality.  Their reality, for the moment, is the thought of performing a crime; stealing several thousand Francs from the house where Odile stays with her aunt.  It is not the only place in the film where the characters do this (another memorable scene is a race through the Lourve in an attempt to beat an American's record for the fastest visit), but it is easily the finest.  The scene is mimicked, but not mocked or re-created, in less a revealing or personal scene in Pulp Fiction.  Although it was funny and odd to see Uma and John dance the way they do, it is a far cry from the trio dancing the Madison.  However, I don't think Tarintino was trying to BE Godard in that scene, simply to pay homage to him (the name of Tarintino's production company is A Band Apart.  Bande a Part is the french name for Band of Outsiders; thats not a coincedance!)Just as Scorsese pays deliberate homage to Sam Fuller during a Boxing scene in Raging Bull, Tarintio uses his films to pay due respect to the brilliant films and film-makers that inspired him.  My point in all this is to fans who attack modern film makers, and often times cut them down for showing such respect to those who inspired them, just as much as it is to say to fans of modern cinema to take a much-needed gander back to the classics.  Pulp Fiction got me interested in the art of film making, and I will always love that movie for it.  And if I decide that Tarintino used bits and pieces from his favorite movies to make his own, so what?  It shows an amount of personality and respect that is lost on most of today's (my!) generation.  Don't be mad at Tarintino for being too obvious; be glad that someone who is considered hip has the guts to do it at all and not sell himself, or his heros, short.",5,Take the New with the Old...,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2327,"['vice', 'versa', 'Cinema', 'today', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'classics', 'Godard', 'Kurosawa', 'Fellini', 'would', 'have', 'Tarintino', 'Spielberg', 'Scorsese', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'example', 'how', 'fun', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'example', 'how', 'early', 'cinema', 'gave', 'blueprint', 'modern', 'classics', 'one', 'greatest', 'scenes', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'films', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Odile', 'Aurthur', 'Franz', 'dance', 'Madison', 'several', 'minutes', 'cafe', 'taking', 'break', 'drinks', 'seemingly', 'reality', 'reality', 'moment', 'thought', 'performing', 'crime', 'stealing', 'several', 'thousand', 'Francs', 'house', 'where', 'Odile', 'aunt', 'not', 'only', 'place', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'do', 'memorable', 'scene', 'race', 'Lourve', 'attempt', 'beat', 'American', 'record', 'fastest', 'visit', 'easily', 'finest', 'scene', 'mimicked', 'not', 'mocked', 're-created', 'less', 'revealing', 'personal', 'scene', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'was', 'funny', 'odd', 'see', 'Uma', 'John', 'dance', 'way', 'do', 'far', 'cry', 'trio', 'dancing', 'Madison', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Tarintino', 'was', 'trying', 'BE', 'Godard', 'scene', 'simply', 'pay', 'homage', 'name', 'Tarintino', 'production', 'company', 'Band', 'Apart', 'Bande', 'Part', 'french', 'name', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'not', 'coincedance', 'Just', 'Scorsese', 'pays', 'deliberate', 'homage', 'Sam', 'Fuller', 'Boxing', 'scene', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Tarintio', 'films', 'pay', 'due', 'respect', 'brilliant', 'films', 'film-makers', 'inspired', 'point', 'fans', 'who', 'attack', 'modern', 'film', 'makers', 'often', 'times', 'cut', 'down', 'showing', 'such', 'respect', 'who', 'inspired', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'say', 'fans', 'modern', 'cinema', 'take', 'much-needed', 'gander', 'back', 'classics', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'got', 'interested', 'art', 'film', 'making', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'movie', 'decide', 'Tarintino', 'used', 'bits', 'pieces', 'favorite', 'movies', 'make', 'own', 'what', 'amount', 'personality', 'respect', 'lost', 'most', 'today', 'generation', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'mad', 'Tarintino', 'being', 'too', 'obvious', 'be', 'glad', 'someone', 'who', 'considered', 'hip', 'guts', 'do', 'not', 'sell', 'heros', 'short']",Band of Outsiders VHS

This is the underside of the New Wave, a lesson in why doing things simply because they have not been done before does not make good art. ""Band of Outsiders"" takes inspiration from American crime films of the 1940s and applies it to aimless youth of the 1960s to create a sort of lackadaisical caper movie. Best friends Franz (Sami Frey) and Arthur (Claude Brasseur) know pretty young Odile (Anna Karina) from English class, where they halfheartedly compete for her attentions. When Odile lets slip that the boarder at her Aunt's house keeps a large stash of cash, Arthur jumps at the chance to steal it, coaxing a passive Franz and reluctant Odile to take part in his plan.Claude Brasseur is good as shameless, domineering Arthur. Anna Karina, who was married to Jean-Luc Godard at the time, gives an annoying stilted performance, however, as the witless Odile. The only emotion she does convincingly is fear. Beyond that, we have an endless stream of allusions to other films and literature, gimmicks that draw attention to themselves, and a wholly superfluous voice-over narration spoken by the director himself. There was hardly a scene in the first hour of the movie that didn't have me waiting impatiently for it to end. In Godard's defense, the interminable and often unnecessary scenes may be the result of the minimum feature film requirement of 90 minutes in France at the time. But I would suggest that he write a film with more substance in order to meet that requirement instead of padding a simplistic storyline with junk.""Band of Outsiders"" improves in the last half hour, as the need for filler decreases. But there is not enough depth of character or intricacy of plot to support a feature-length film. I'd like to be able to call it an exercise in style, but I think a project in self-indulgence would be more accurate. Maybe the reflexive elements such as removing the sound for 2 minutes or having actors speak to the camera were eye-openers when ""Band of Outsiders"" was released in 1964. But audiences are more sophisticated now. They're conscious of cinema's contrivances and their own complicity in them. If you show audiences that films are fake and manipulative, you insult their intelligence. Directors of the French New Wave are part of the reason that this is true today. But there were better examples of reflexive filmmaking in the 1960s than ""Band of Outsiders"". The film gets 2 stars. My 3 stars are for the Criterion Collection disc. In French with optional English subtitles.The DVD (Criterion Collection 2003): ""Visual Glossary""  (18 min) explains the many allusions and references in the film.

That face: Those big almond shaped eyes; innocent, curious, mysterious, mischievous. Odele caught in the prison of her budding sexuality. Oscar and Alex stuck in a web with her, each trapped for different reasons, but all three caught in a struggle manipulated by the puppet master, Godard. ""Three weeks earlier, a pile of money. An English class. A house by the river. A romantic girl."" A story as improbable as the ""legend"" of Billy the Kid! This film is derived out of a mixture of boredom, desire and desperation from a filmmaker at odds between love and revulsion of Americana and the cinematic experience in general. One often wonders if making movies is Godard's guilty pleasure. Rather than construct a story, he often seems more interested in deconstruction. His Paris is visually stark and cold, but there is also much beauty. Sadness and beauty: ""it all depends upon how you frame the picture."" Again I fall back to Odele/Karina. Odele is constantly reinventing herself, bouncing from sensation to sensation and Oscar, Alex and even the director himself are trying to grab hold, but she's far too illusive - even for the puppet master! Godard is in love with Odele/Karina and this is infectious. He is also in love with Paris and American movies and cannot help it. An intellectual trying desperately to reign in his emotions but failing brilliantly. This is why ""Band of Outsiders"" succeeds so well. There is much more at work in this film than Godard merely trying to be clever; the moment of silence, the ""Madison"" dance sequence, the Louvre world record. There is a welcome spontaneity fused together with impeccable technique. A scene in the film that is particularly instructive takes place with all three characters in an English class. As the teacher reads the death scene from Romeo and Juliet, the three star crossed lovers seem oblivious to the words, and yet the emotion behind the words seem to color their actions. They are creating their own love story of sorts - but it is a story that lives and breathes inside a movie, where even tragedy is tempered by that good old American ""happy ending"".",5,Godard at his best!,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2208,"['Clearly', 'Godard', 'camera', 'love', 'Anna', 'Karina', 'entire', 'film', 'face', 'big', 'almond', 'shaped', 'eyes', 'innocent', 'curious', 'mysterious', 'mischievous', 'Odele', 'caught', 'prison', 'budding', 'sexuality', 'Oscar', 'Alex', 'stuck', 'web', 'trapped', 'different', 'reasons', 'three', 'caught', 'struggle', 'manipulated', 'puppet', 'master', 'Godard', 'Three', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'pile', 'money', 'English', 'class', 'house', 'river', 'romantic', 'girl', 'A', 'story', 'as', 'improbable', 'legend', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'film', 'derived', 'mixture', 'boredom', 'desire', 'desperation', 'filmmaker', 'odds', 'love', 'revulsion', 'Americana', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'general', 'One', 'often', 'making', 'movies', 'Godard', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Rather', 'construct', 'story', 'often', 'more', 'interested', 'deconstruction', 'Paris', 'visually', 'stark', 'cold', 'also', 'much', 'beauty', 'Sadness', 'beauty', 'how', 'frame', 'picture', 'Again', 'fall', 'back', 'Odele/Karina', 'Odele', 'constantly', 'reinventing', 'bouncing', 'sensation', 'sensation', 'Oscar', 'Alex', 'even', 'director', 'are', 'trying', 'grab', 'hold', 'far', 'too', 'illusive', 'even', 'puppet', 'master', 'Godard', 'love', 'Odele/Karina', 'infectious', 'also', 'love', 'Paris', 'American', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'intellectual', 'trying', 'desperately', 'reign', 'emotions', 'failing', 'brilliantly', 'why', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'so', 'well', 'much', 'more', 'work', 'film', 'Godard', 'merely', 'trying', 'be', 'clever', 'moment', 'silence', 'Madison', 'dance', 'sequence', 'Louvre', 'world', 'record', 'welcome', 'spontaneity', 'fused', 'together', 'impeccable', 'technique', 'scene', 'film', 'particularly', 'instructive', 'place', 'three', 'characters', 'English', 'class', 'teacher', 'death', 'scene', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'three', 'star', 'crossed', 'lovers', 'seem', 'oblivious', 'words', 'yet', 'emotion', 'words', 'seem', 'color', 'actions', 'are', 'creating', 'own', 'love', 'story', 'sorts', 'story', 'breathes', 'movie', 'where', 'even', 'tragedy', 'tempered', 'good', 'old', 'American', 'happy', 'ending']",Band of Outsiders VHS

pulp crime movies of the 40s and the love affair with his wife,Anna Karina.The plot is taken from Fool's Gold,a crime novel,by Dolores Hitchens.Godard uses a basic plot,Odile meets Franz(Frey)in an English language class and with his friend,Arthur(Brasseur),forming a semi-love triangle,embark on a plan to rob her aunt of some laundered cash in a cupboard.This is at least up there with Breathless and Pierre Le Fou.There is no narrative.There is a string of inconsequential set-pieces,sly cross-references,literary allusions and quotations.These range from Rimbaud,Kafka,Poe,Novalis,Shakespeare,Jack London,Aragon and Queneau.Arthur and Franz act out the shooting of Billy the Kid by Pat Garrett,prior to their inept criminal adventure.This is a suburban western, replete with suburban boredom and banality.The men's stamping ground is drab streets,dingy cafes and builders' yards on the city's outskirts,along the Marne,in pre-war type settings.Their car is another character,driving round in circles,expressing their freedom and ebullience.Misfits even with each other,they remain isolated andself-absorbed.'Isn't it strange',Franz muses.'how people never form a whole?'Even in the iconic Madison dance sequence, and the 9 minute record-breaking run through the Louvre, though in sync,their disconnection is their cool.The men read out from newspapers about local petty murders,crimes,world news on a riverbank.Karina,Godard's muse,has never been better,gauche,nave,giddy and starry-eyed, drifting helplessly between the two men,making love with her eyes.Godard at his most experimental,plays with the conventions of cinema,with voice-over narrations, commenting upon the character's thoughts;mocking the banality of the story:'the robbery must wait until nightfall,thus respecting the tradition of bad B-pictures'.Godard charms us breaking all the rules of cinema,eg,observing a minute's silence by cutting off the soundtrack,speaking to camera,letting you know you're watching a film,mingling real deaths with fake deaths.Under the comedy is a painful sense of suburban drabness and boredom, unemployment, frustration, and disillusionment -- reflected in Raoul Coutard's superb capturing of overcast weather and polluted river vistas in varying shades of grey, as well as in the sad and wistful waltzes of Michel Legrand's score.Summarising for 'latecomers':""a pile of money, a home by the river, a romantic girl.""Godard keeps us in touch with his process.",5,"""a pile of money,a home by the river,a romantic

Godard practically invented the 'intellectual B-movie' with &quot;My Life to Live,&quot; and made &quot;Band of Outsiders&quot; after his nauseating experiences with big-time producers Ponti and Levine on &quot;Contempt,&quot; just to prove, once again, that a man bursting with ideas doesn't need too much to express himself magnificently (he later continued in this direction with &quot;Alphaville,&quot; another cheaper than cheap masterpiece, this time in &quot;Science Fiction,&quot; without any special effects or 'futuristic sets' to speak of).Don't be fooled by the cheesy production values (that in itself is a calculated joke mocking big-time Hollywood films with million dollar budgets and nothing to say). You have to give this film a little time to reveal its poetry. It's subtle and relaxed yet crazy, and that's good. People usually take a while longer to warm to this one than &quot;Alphaville,&quot; or &quot;My Life to Live,&quot; but it's just as brilliant. It took me 3 viewings back when I first saw it some 6 years ago, but now I know very well why it's considered a great poetic film: every time I watch it I get a unique, almost ecstatic emotion from it no other film provides, like reading a great humorous romantic poem full of Bukowski-like eccentricities.",5,B Movie Poetry,970012800,"09 27, 2000",2000,1472,"['ultra-low-budget', 'cliche-slaying', 'tribute', 'expressive', 'possibilities', 'cinema', 'gonzo', 'New-Wave', 'master', 'who', 'influenced', 'thousand', 'one', 'directors', 'now', 'all', 'much', 'richer', 'Godard', 'practically', 'invented', ""'intellectual"", 'B-movie', 'quot', 'Life', 'Live', 'quot', 'made', 'quot', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'quot', 'nauseating', 'experiences', 'big-time', 'producers', 'Ponti', 'Levine', 'quot', 'Contempt', 'quot', 'just', 'prove', 'once', 'again', 'man', 'bursting', 'ideas', ""n't"", 'need', 'too', 'much', 'express', 'magnificently', 'later', 'continued', 'direction', 'quot', 'Alphaville', 'quot', 'cheaper', 'cheap', 'masterpiece', 'time', 'quot', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'quot', 'special', 'effects', ""'futuristic"", 'sets', 'speak', '.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'cheesy', 'production', 'values', 'calculated', 'joke', 'mocking', 'big-time', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'million', 'dollar', 'budgets', 'nothing', 'say', 'have', 'give', 'film', 'little', 'time', 'reveal', 'poetry', 'subtle', 'relaxed', 'yet', 'crazy', 'good', 'People', 'usually', 'take', 'while', 'longer', 'warm', 'one', 'quot', 'Alphaville', 'quot', 'quot', 'Life', 'Live', 'quot', 'just', 'brilliant', 'took', '3', 'viewings', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'saw', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'why', 'considered', 'great', 'poetic', 'film', 'time', 'watch', 'get', 'unique', 'almost', 'ecstatic', 'emotion', 'other', 'film', 'reading', 'great', 'humorous', 'romantic', 'poem', 'full', 'Bukowski-like', 'eccentricities']",Band of Outsiders VHS

Jamieson Jr.,"[3, 8]","This movie is replete with brilliant moments, gorgeous B&W (mostly grey) photography in Paris and a desolate suburb, and wonderful music, but still manages to be a mess. Two jerks trying to be crooks team up with one moronic girl to pull off a half-fast robbery: what could possibly go wrong?  Everything.  So far so good, but the film itself succeeds no better than the robbery. Godard's second best film after ""Breathless"", it was a favorite of mine for many years (I even raved about it not long ago in a comment on one of the five star reviews here), but a recent viewing proved very disappointing. It's certainly worth sitting through a couple of times for the great moments, but then, sadly, enough is enough.",3,Bande a Part,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,715,"['movie', 'replete', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'gorgeous', 'B', 'W', 'mostly', 'grey', 'photography', 'Paris', 'desolate', 'suburb', 'wonderful', 'music', 'still', 'be', 'mess', 'Two', 'jerks', 'trying', 'be', 'crooks', 'team', 'up', 'one', 'moronic', 'girl', 'pull', 'off', 'half-fast', 'robbery', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'Everything', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'film', 'better', 'robbery', 'Godard', 'second', 'best', 'film', 'Breathless', 'was', 'favorite', 'mine', 'many', 'years', 'even', 'raved', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'comment', 'one', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'here', 'recent', 'viewing', 'proved', 'very', 'disappointing', 'certainly', 'worth', 'sitting', 'couple', 'times', 'great', 'moments', 'then', 'sadly', 'enough', 'enough']",Band of Outsiders VHS
