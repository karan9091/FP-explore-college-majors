667878,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005NFZB,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Jiri Menzel's `Ostre Sledovane Vlaky' has been heralded as one of the definitive films of the 60's, a deliciously engrossing `coming of age' story that mixes enough humor with drama to create a beautifully complete depiction of life.  It reminds me somewhat of `Lasky Jedne Plavovlasky' and the brilliant `Le Souffle au Coeur' in that it uses natural adolescent curiosity to elaborate on even deeper and more mature revelations.In `Ostre Sledovane Vlasky' we are introduced to young Milos.  Milos is a young, nave virgin.  I want to make something clear.  One particular reviewer accused this movie of being nothing more than an exploitive message to viewers that promiscuity is acceptable and expected.  That is not the case.  This film doesn't endorse this action (the character of Josef alone somewhat shows a condemning attitude towards this course) but it simply uses it as a way to explore the insecurities and very real fears of adolescence.  Young men especially are raked with these very curiosities, and the feeling of inadequacy, especially in the intimacy department, can scare a man for life.  `Ostre Sledovane Vlasky' merely uses this avenue of life to serve as a foundation for deeper character development.  I just felt the need to say that, since this reviewers ignorance irritated me.  So, back to the movie.  Milos is young and questioning his ability to perform (as a man).  The thing is, his insecurities run deeper than a mere intimacy problem, but he's not really aware of anything else at his young age.  Taken under the wing of middle-aged rebel (and ladykiller) Hubicka, Milos gets a crash course in the ways of love, which he attempts to use on the beautiful Masa.Yes, there is a political turn in the film towards the end, which I won't elaborate on so as not to ruin anything for the viewer, but I will say that this point is one that the reviewer I mentioned failed to notice.  This turn of events (which he claimed as pointless) is the crux of the film, for it shows how the director's use of intimacy was merely a mask for greater things.The acting here is astonishing, especially from the supporting players.  That isn't to say that Vaclav Neckar isn't wonderful as young Milos, but Josef Somr and Jitka Scoffin are just brilliant.  Somr especially takes a very despicable character and makes him likable and enjoyable.  Despite the fact that the actions taken by Hubicka are at times reprehensible, the charismatic way in which he carries them out (that stamp scene is just marvelous) make him delightful almost.  Scoffin is far more than a pretty face here (she is stunning), for she uses a mixture of restrained sensuality and nave awkwardness to flesh out the object of Milos' affections.With a cheeky humor that makes the more serious aspects of the film stand out, `Ostre Sledovane Vlasky' is a must see for any fan of foreign film, coming of age stories or humorous splices of human drama.  It is a beautiful and sincere film that lives up to the hype.",5,Much more than tongue and cheek...,1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,2992,"['Jiri', 'Menzel', 'Ostre', 'Sledovane', 'Vlaky', 'been', 'heralded', 'one', 'definitive', 'films', '60', 'deliciously', 'engrossing', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'mixes', 'enough', 'humor', 'drama', 'create', 'beautifully', 'complete', 'depiction', 'life', 'Lasky', 'Jedne', 'Plavovlasky', 'brilliant', 'Le', 'Souffle', 'Coeur', 'natural', 'adolescent', 'curiosity', 'elaborate', 'even', 'deeper', 'more', 'mature', 'revelations.In', 'Ostre', 'Sledovane', 'Vlasky', 'are', 'introduced', 'young', 'Milos', 'Milos', 'young', 'nave', 'virgin', 'want', 'make', 'something', 'clear', 'One', 'particular', 'reviewer', 'accused', 'movie', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'exploitive', 'message', 'viewers', 'promiscuity', 'acceptable', 'expected', 'not', 'case', 'film', ""n't"", 'endorse', 'action', 'character', 'Josef', 'alone', 'somewhat', 'condemning', 'attitude', 'towards', 'course', 'simply', 'way', 'explore', 'insecurities', 'very', 'real', 'fears', 'adolescence', 'Young', 'men', 'especially', 'are', 'raked', 'very', 'curiosities', 'feeling', 'inadequacy', 'especially', 'intimacy', 'department', 'can', 'scare', 'man', 'life', 'Ostre', 'Sledovane', 'Vlasky', 'merely', 'avenue', 'life', 'serve', 'foundation', 'deeper', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'felt', 'need', 'say', 'reviewers', 'ignorance', 'irritated', 'So', 'back', 'movie', 'Milos', 'young', 'questioning', 'ability', 'perform', 'man', 'thing', 'insecurities', 'run', 'deeper', 'mere', 'intimacy', 'problem', 'not', 'really', 'aware', 'anything', 'else', 'young', 'age', 'Taken', 'wing', 'middle-aged', 'rebel', 'ladykiller', 'Hubicka', 'Milos', 'crash', 'course', 'ways', 'love', 'use', 'beautiful', 'Masa.Yes', 'political', 'turn', 'film', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'so', 'not', 'ruin', 'anything', 'viewer', 'will', 'say', 'point', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'failed', 'notice', 'turn', 'events', 'claimed', 'pointless', 'crux', 'film', 'how', 'director', 'use', 'intimacy', 'was', 'merely', 'mask', 'greater', 'things.The', 'acting', 'here', 'astonishing', 'especially', 'supporting', 'players', ""n't"", 'say', 'Vaclav', 'Neckar', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'young', 'Milos', 'Josef', 'Somr', 'Jitka', 'Scoffin', 'are', 'just', 'brilliant', 'Somr', 'especially', 'very', 'despicable', 'character', 'likable', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'actions', 'taken', 'Hubicka', 'are', 'times', 'reprehensible', 'charismatic', 'way', 'out', 'stamp', 'scene', 'just', 'marvelous', 'make', 'delightful', 'almost', 'Scoffin', 'far', 'more', 'pretty', 'face', 'here', 'stunning', 'mixture', 'restrained', 'sensuality', 'nave', 'awkwardness', 'flesh', 'out', 'object', 'Milos', 'affections.With', 'cheeky', 'humor', 'more', 'serious', 'aspects', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'Ostre', 'Sledovane', 'Vlasky', 'must', 'see', 'fan', 'foreign', 'film', 'coming', 'age', 'stories', 'humorous', 'splices', 'human', 'drama', 'beautiful', 'sincere', 'film', 'up', 'hype']",N/A

Gorgeously filmed in black and white, each frame by frame echoes of a past when life was still mired in concealment and innocence.The story centers around a train station in a Czech, German occupied small town and an apprentice train watcher, Milos Hrma, who is confused about his place in the world. He is a young man and is approaching an instance in his life when sexuality is flourishing all around him and yet he can not comprehend it. Scattered throughout the film are leitmotifs that represent sex: the train blowing steam, a horse with a woman riding it, a skinless rabbit being fondled by a woman cook, etc. He is under the tutelage of a train dispatcher who seems a zealot when it comes to seducing women. Although he notices that the train dispatcher is a sex fiend, he does little to elicit help from him. The general thought of the males is that a young man should be bestowed with the foreknowledge and insight at birth. Thus, his inability to perform when his girlfriend Masa is in bed during a bombing causes him great existential crisis and leads to his attempted suicide. In fact, the war was subliminally to blame for his impotence.This isn't a political film but uses subtle innuendos to trace the history of a young man into adulthood. Scattered throughout the film are affable characters such as a pigeon loving, crap covered Train master, a noble, aristocratic woman, a benign, slightly insane, photographer uncle of Masa, and a Nazi ideologue who refuses to believe that the Reich is in ruins.The sexual metaphors are spread in gusty humorous episodes such as when the train dispatcher 'stamps' a girl's buttocks in a moment of ecstasy. In the finale, the boy is finally cured of his 'impotence' by a big bang, I won't give it away, you'll have to see this delightful film.",5,Train Station at the End,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,1963,"['film', 'quirky', 'resonance', 'history', 'Neo-Freudian', 'interpretation', 'human', 'sexual', 'psychology', 'film', 'Bertolucci', '34', 'Conformist', '34', 'Gorgeously', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'frame', 'frame', 'echoes', 'past', 'when', 'life', 'was', 'still', 'mired', 'concealment', 'innocence.The', 'story', 'centers', 'train', 'station', 'Czech', 'German', 'occupied', 'small', 'town', 'apprentice', 'train', 'watcher', 'Milos', 'Hrma', 'who', 'confused', 'place', 'world', 'young', 'man', 'approaching', 'instance', 'life', 'when', 'sexuality', 'flourishing', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'Scattered', 'film', 'are', 'represent', 'sex', 'train', 'blowing', 'steam', 'horse', 'woman', 'riding', 'skinless', 'rabbit', 'being', 'fondled', 'woman', 'cook', 'etc', 'tutelage', 'train', 'dispatcher', 'who', 'zealot', 'when', 'seducing', 'women', 'train', 'dispatcher', 'sex', 'fiend', 'little', 'elicit', 'help', 'general', 'thought', 'males', 'young', 'man', 'should', 'be', 'bestowed', 'foreknowledge', 'insight', 'birth', 'Thus', 'inability', 'perform', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'Masa', 'bed', 'bombing', 'great', 'existential', 'crisis', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'fact', 'war', 'was', 'subliminally', 'blame', 'impotence.This', ""n't"", 'political', 'film', 'subtle', 'innuendos', 'trace', 'history', 'young', 'man', 'adulthood', 'Scattered', 'film', 'are', 'affable', 'characters', 'such', 'pigeon', 'loving', 'crap', 'covered', 'Train', 'master', 'noble', 'aristocratic', 'woman', 'benign', 'slightly', 'insane', 'uncle', 'Masa', 'Nazi', 'ideologue', 'who', 'believe', 'Reich', 'ruins.The', 'sexual', 'metaphors', 'are', 'spread', 'gusty', 'humorous', 'episodes', 'such', 'when', 'train', 'dispatcher', ""'stamps"", 'girl', 'buttocks', 'moment', 'ecstasy', 'finale', 'boy', 'finally', 'cured', ""'impotence"", 'big', 'bang', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'delightful', 'film']",N/A
667880,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,B00005NFZB,Bomojaz,"[2, 3]","A neat little comedy set during WW II at a Czech train station, where the generally bored station personnel have sex on the brain. Every now and then they have to listen to the inspector tell them how they're working for the Reich and the future of the world, but despite the pep talks, at the end they help blow up a munitions train anyway.The hero of the picture is a young man (played by Vaclav Neckar) who has taken the job as station employee to avoid work; he has trouble with his girlfriend (premature ejaculation) and gets ""cured"" by a saboteur. Neckar is the one who blows up the train - and is killed in the process.There is a funny ongoing scenario where a girl gets stamped on her rear end with Nazi rubber stamps - her mother complains to the authorities, but the girl is obviously pleased with the whole thing. It's this rather comic scene with the authorities that's taking place when the train blows up. It's a very engaging movie throughout - a very amusing combination of sex and patriotism.

The framing of this (black & white) film is most accomplished.  For instance, you might see a distant  frontal shot of something, then a medium shot---also head-on (and stationary), then an alternate side angle close-up of what the camera was drawing in on.  Of course, the director does pan his camera at times & shots are tracked, but what's most noticable (and interesting) about this film are its multiple stilled shots at varying distances to convey space crossed.  Likewise when characters talking to one another are filmed we aren't subjected to head shots of each in alternating succession---showing that only 2 camera were used, but are given a variety of responding shots which gives the impression of 3-5 cameras being employed (whether so many were actually or not, not being the point).  In this sense it has the mood of an accomplished silent film, wherein the visuals convey most of the story by themselves (thanks to able direction).  So, if you are a fan of filmmaking do give this film some of your time.  Incidentially, the World War 2 aspect of this film is rather secondary to the human side of this story, which concerns  the separate sex lives of a freshly recruited train station attendant named Milos Hrma & his superior; the latter being a ladies-man & the former rather clueless (being quite despondent about being so---which is effectively captured in stilled, varying angled, close-ups of this man).

667882,A3B1QVMBW7YVOQ,B00005NFZB,C. J. Hardman,"[8, 8]","A funny look at a dramatic world through the eyes of railway workers in a small town in wartime Czechoslovakia.  I enjoyed watching this movie, it really is a hopeful and humorous story about human beings in times of turmoil.  This is Czechoslovakia during World War II. The Nazis are officially in control, and actively imposing their bureaucracy on the nation.  Our protagonist is young Milos Hrma, whose father is a retired railway man, spending his days sitting at home, looking at his watch, and telling everyone where each train is now.  He encourages his son to find employment at the local village railway depot.Easily the youngest employee at the depot, Milos wants to fit in, be admired, be a man.  He wears the uniform of a train dispatcher, but doesn't seem comfortable in it yet.  While other reviewers have mentioned young Milos' talk of wanting to have sex, which is actually quite funny in its stark honesty, much can be lost in our descriptions.  This is a comedy, not a prurient display.  It seems that sex is simply the path Milos believes he must take to be a man.  It is his naivety and honesty with his fellow railway employees that makes the whole deal such a riot.  This self-created drama keeps his mind off of what is happening around him.  Some may be offended by this, in which case I'd suggest you'd probably be happier buying a Thomas the Tank Engine DVD.  Milos does show himself a man...and it has little to do with s-e-x.  Very worth watching!Some of the scenes are terrific--I liked the scene where Milos goes up to kiss the female conductor as the train is about to pull away and then...oh, I won't ruin it for you!  It really is a funny film set in a heartbreaking time.  All the more interesting that it was shot in 1966.  Reccommended for comedy buffs and railway workers everywhere.

667884,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005NFZB,Dennis Littrell,"[7, 7]","The ""Closely Watched Trains"" are those that are carrying supplies to the German army in and through occupied Czechoslovakia during World War II.  That is why they are closely watched--so that they run on time.  But they are also closely watched by the people of Czechoslovakia, especially dispatcher Hubicka (Josef Somr) and his trainee Milos Hrma (Vaclav Neckar) for another reason, which will become apparent as the movie ends.Not that Milos and Hubicka are especially diligent workers.  On the contrary.  What Hubicka is especially adept at is seduction of females while Milos is distracted by his worries about becoming a man.  He has what must be seen as a problem demanding comic relief (if you will).  He has trouble pleasing his girl friend because of premature ejaculation.  He is so consumed by this embarrassing failure that he seeks quietus in the warm bath of a bordello.  Meanwhile Hubicka is able to please the pretty young telegraphist Virginia Svata (Jitka Zelenohorska) by playing a kind of strip poker with her and rubber stamping her pretty legs and butt much to her delight and to the consternation of her mother when she finds out.  The German Councilor Zednicek (Vlastimil Brodsky) who tolerates no hanky-panky when it comes to keeping the trains moving conducts an investigation and comes to the conclusion that Hubicka is guilty of misuse and abuse of the great German language because he stamped German words onto Virginia's body!This is the tone of the film, wryly ironic, irreverent and mildly comedic, employing in a sense a kind of off-center ""theater of the absurd"" treatment.  Director Jiri Menzel, who appears briefly in the film as Dr. Brabec who diagnoses Milos's ""affliction,"" spun this off from a novel by Bohumil Hrabal, but it could easily have come from a novel by Jaroslav Hasek, who wrote the celebrated Czech classic, ""The Good Soldier Svejk,"" so alike in treatment and tone are they, and so very characteristic of the Czech national mind-set vis-a-vis all the horrors of the European wars.  Menzel concentrates on the petty affairs of day-to-day peasant life, sex, the raising of pigeons and geese, the boredom of bureaucratic jobs as he works toward the culminating scene in which the heroics seem almost light-hearted and to come about more from happenstance than from careful planning.Some of the scenes in the movie are absolutely unique in the world of cinema and suggest a kind of cinematic genius.  The creepy goose-stuffing (for foie gras pate) scene in which Milos seeks help with his ""problem"" from an older woman is riotous--or would be riotous if we were not so amazed as what she is doing while talking to him and what it LOOKS like she might be doing!  The scene in which Stationmaster Lanska is torn between the prospect of seducing a voluptuous woman and the chance that he might miss supper reminded me of a little boy at play with his mother calling him home for dinner.  The final scene in which it looks like Menzel may have employed a wind machine is just so perfectly presented, combining as it does the stark realism of the war and a delicious (but soon to be mixed) personal triumph of the resistence.This is one of the classic films of all time.

Wood ""Vicarious Life""","[0, 0]","Based on the eponymous novella by Bohumil Hrabal, Closely Watched Trains wryly portrays the coming-of-age Milos Hrma a train-dispatcher-in-training at a Czech backwater railway station during the late stages of World War Two. The film deservedly won the Oscar for the best foreign language movie in 1967.Hrma is almost pathetically proud of his new position and the uniform he gets to wear. It soon becomes apparent, however, that the young man is increasingly obsessed with losing his virginity. His pursuit of sex lends comic and tragic aspects to the tale. Indeed, everyone in the station is quite horny.The film is also a hilarious send up of bureaucracy.  When the train dispatcher uses the station's official seal to mark the legs and shapely derriere of another delightfully attractive young woman, her outraged mother complains first to the police and then to court. The mother diligently shows the highly interested officers and judges the offending markings. The court demurs; this is a railroad disciplinary matter. A disciplinary committee is convened. The girl happily testifies how she gladly let the dispatcher play his game on her backside. The committee members gulp and shift in their seats as they try not to betray their prurient interest.Meanwhile, Milos has learned that a German armament train is going through the station. A bomb is provided by a beautiful partisan, who also teaches him a thing or two. Milos is given the job of planting the bomb.Wonderfully acted, the movie is by turns sublimely sardonic, tragic, and erotic.

This golden period (1965-68) has been called the Czech New Wave. One critic wrote,""Czech comedies--with their focus on the ordinary life of indivduals--used an indirect approach to criticize the state of society.""Czech humor is like the sadness of clowns--their smiles are painted on--and they found solid ways of delivering levity surreptitiously--poking fun at the bayonets and rifle butts aimed at their hearts. This film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (1966). Menzel was 27 when he made the film. He said,"" We are quick to spot a paradox. We can always see Mr. Brezhnev in his underwear.""Menzel was not allowed to direct films from 1969-1974. He collaborated with maverick poet, writer, and rabble rouser, Bohumil Hrabel--who wrote the novel this film is based on.The movie was shot in crisp B&W--giving; it the look of a newsreel or documentary.Vaclav Neckar was wonderfully naive, gullible, and horny as the protagonist, Milos Hrma. He played a young man who was excited about doing nothing--who got to wear a uniform and got paid for it too. He was wide-eyed, shy, nervous, and randy. The scene where Milos tries to kiss his girl, Masa, just as the train is pulling out--and their lips never meet--became the poster for the film--signifying things yearned for but hard to achieve.I felt that the film never really seemed to be a service comedy--it was a thinly veiled sex comedy. Menzel's choice of keeping WWII at a distance--to concentrate on the human foilables never quite reached M.A.S.H. status. But it did point out that having sex while in a war zone must be a form of erotica second to none. This film may be flawed and less than perfect--but put in its proper perspective we find it to be a fragrant flower blossoming midst the turgid turds of totalitarianism.",3,Innocence Derailed,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1920,"['Director', 'Jiri', 'Menzel', 'made', 'film', 'middle', '60', 'when', 'Czech', 'artists', 'found', 'immersed', 'joy', 'Prague', 'Spring', 'golden', 'period', '1965-68', 'been', 'called', 'Czech', 'New', 'Wave', 'One', 'critic', 'wrote', 'Czech', 'comedies', 'focus', 'ordinary', 'life', 'indivduals', 'used', 'indirect', 'approach', 'criticize', 'state', 'society', 'Czech', 'humor', 'sadness', 'clowns', 'smiles', 'are', 'painted', 'found', 'solid', 'ways', 'delivering', 'levity', 'surreptitiously', 'poking', 'fun', 'bayonets', 'rifle', 'butts', 'aimed', 'hearts', 'film', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', '1966', 'Menzel', 'was', '27', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'said', 'are', 'quick', 'spot', 'paradox', 'can', 'always', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Brezhnev', 'underwear', 'Menzel', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'direct', 'films', '1969-1974', 'collaborated', 'maverick', 'poet', 'writer', 'rabble', 'rouser', 'Bohumil', 'Hrabel', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'on.The', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'crisp', 'B', 'W', 'giving', 'look', 'newsreel', 'documentary.Vaclav', 'Neckar', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'naive', 'gullible', 'horny', 'protagonist', 'Milos', 'Hrma', 'played', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'excited', 'doing', 'nothing', 'who', 'got', 'wear', 'uniform', 'got', 'paid', 'too', 'was', 'wide-eyed', 'shy', 'nervous', 'randy', 'scene', 'where', 'Milos', 'kiss', 'girl', 'Masa', 'just', 'train', 'pulling', 'out', 'lips', 'never', 'meet', 'became', 'poster', 'film', 'signifying', 'things', 'yearned', 'hard', 'achieve.I', 'felt', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'seemed', 'be', 'service', 'comedy', 'was', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'sex', 'comedy', 'Menzel', 'choice', 'keeping', 'WWII', 'distance', 'concentrate', 'human', 'foilables', 'never', 'quite', 'reached', 'M.A.S.H', 'status', 'did', 'point', 'out', 'having', 'sex', 'war', 'zone', 'must', 'be', 'form', 'erotica', 'second', 'none', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'flawed', 'less', 'perfect', 'put', 'proper', 'perspective', 'find', 'be', 'fragrant', 'flower', 'blossoming', 'turgid', 'turds', 'totalitarianism']",N/A

I've also seen it about forty times and, like the wonderful book you read over and over, this film continues to be a revelation. It is darkly comic, wonderfully well drawn and has, to my mind probaby the single sexiest scene ever put on film (the famous &quot;rubber stamp&quot; sequence).The real tragedy of this film however, is the director Jiri Menzel, whose many films have never seen the light of day in this country. A victim of the Soviet crackdown on Czechoslovakia in 1968, Menzel's follow-up film, the absurd and outrageously funny &quot;Larks On A String&quot; was banned until only a few years ago when it was briefly shown in the U.S. and had an even briefer run on VHS (hint-hint: a DVD please??). Clearly, Menzel was/is a genius whose gift was stopped in its tracks by the ugly spectre of politics.Menzel, like his fellow film makers Milos Forman, and Ivan Passar has a unique and important voice. &quot;Closely Watched Trains&quot; is a masterpiece in its richness of character and observation on the human condition. There is not a single false moment, nor badly cast character in the entire film. It is a rewarding experience and one to savor over and over again.

667891,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,B00005NFZB,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[12, 16]","A young Czech man named Milos Hrma begins work in a train station in Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia.  His father retired from the same job and is now on paid retirement.  Milos is very pleased to have a job that doesn't require hard work, and his mom is very proud that her son has been given an attractive uniform, the envy of the neighborhood.At the station, the employees are more interested in romance than in work.  There's a lot of sex going on during those slow hours in the night when few trains appear.But our poor hero Milos is not part of the sex play.  He is a virgin, and a very funny and naive one.  There is a beautiful, sweet girl interested in him, but she doesn't know that he is a virgin and she is in for a disappointment during his first attempt.  He's really not ready for her.Meanwhile, his funny co-worker is having a ball.  In one cute scene, the co-worker uses the official German stamp presses to decorate the body of a beautiful girl.  In other words, he puts a few official stamp imprints on her butt and elsewhere.I like one of the characters, a German fool who explains the troop movements in World War Two to the boys on the job.  He describes all of the military setbacks as strategic withdrawals, pretending that his side is winning the war, even as the Allies roll back the German defense in Europe.Near the end of the film, things get a bit political, yet still in a comedic way.  There is a plan to sabotage an ammunition train, to blow up a trainload of German ammunition.  The central characters in the plot are the Czech playboy with the stamper, our poor hero Milos (who is distressed at his inability to make love to a woman, to the point of suicide), and the other boys at the job.A stunning young woman comes by with a bomb.  She represents the Czech underground.  She hears of Milos's problem and decides to take action.  Leave it to a Czech undergrounder to solve the problem.  She makes a happy man of him.As a result, now that he is a man he is more than able to join the resistance to Nazi oppression.The film has a powerful ending.  It is really a wonderful story.The only criticisms I have are that it starts a bit slow for me, not really picking up until the middle chapters, and that it is overly flattering to the Czech population, a bit self serving, as if every Czech male was happy to lay down his life for the chance at fighting the Germans, as if all of the Czechs were as kind and innocent as the characters in this story, without a hint of racial hatred in them.  We know that to be false.Czechoslovakia was caught up in the vicious antisemitism of most of Europe, so the people weren't as kind and funny and adorable as the characters in this film.I almost hear the director saying ""This is who we were, we were wonderful, innocent, funny people"", and it simply wasn't true.  Europe of the 1930s and 40s was a cesspool of hatred and prejudice, a land that could only be described as hellish and demonic, because the people themselves were that way, partly as a result of economic difficulties.The strength of the movie is in its heart, and in its comedy.One of my favorite moments is when poor Milos, who has already tried to kill himself because he thinks he will never be able to have sex like a normal man, is instructed to find an older woman to help him learn, and he asks a co-worker ""What about your wife?""

667893,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005NFZB,Only-A-Child,"[2, 6]","Note to American viewers: ""Closely Watched Trains"" (1966) is one of them ""fereign films"". It has subtitles and is in black and white (actually a strength as it is superb film stock). The setting is German-occupied Czechoslovakia during WWII. The setting and the use of the Czech resistance movement (to the German occupation) as a plot element may confuse Americans; many of who believe that Czechoslovakia was an Axis country or have never given the subject any thought. But just prior to the start of the war, Britain and France sold out Czechoslovakia. They backed out of their treaties and allowed Hitler to break up the country; establishing the German Protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia and annexing the Sudentenland (which had a significant German population).  Also useful in understanding the film was a revisionist trend by European countries in the 1960's to rehabilitate their images; suppressing any record of cooperation/assistance to Germany while proclaiming their resistance to the Nazi agenda. The film is a product of this trend which is why the resistance elements seem rather tenuously inserted into the story.The film revolves around young Milos Hrma (Vaclav Neckar) who follows his father's example and goes to work for the railroad; becoming an apprentice dispatcher at a rural station. The impressionable Milos becomes fascinated with Hubicka, a veteran train dispatcher who devotes most of his energy to various on-the-job seductions. The second act involves Hubicka's on-going conflict with their superior, the pigeon-raising and feather covered stationmaster.But ""Watched Trains"" is really Milos' coming of age story, complete with the requisite line: ""you mean this is the first time you have been with a woman"". Milos' first time proves a disaster and leads to an unsuccessful suicide attempt.Meanwhile, it turns out that Hubicka has more on his mind than girls. He is a member of this resistance and is planning to destroy a German munitions train when it passes near the station. Unfortunately for Milos, Hubicka's recreational activities are reported to the authorities and he must attend an investigatory hearing inside the station, scheduled for the same time that the ammunition train is expected. Milos, who has finally demonstrated his manhood in bed, must now demonstrate it my climbing the signal tower and dropping an explosive device onto the train as it passes beneath.The film goes out with a bang and one is left to decide on the relative merits of the two methods young men have of proving their manhood.I forgot to mention that the film is actually a comedy. And for that matter the whole thing about the resistance movement is pretty much a side story to the coming of age stuff. And the female characters are all a little too good.As tends to happen with good little movies, the plot has very little to do with what the movie is about, and nothing to do with the effect it had on me. And as tends to happen with them ""fereign"" films there are allegorical elements. The characters are seen from Milos' innocent point of view, a nontraditional hero who is neither heroic nor particularly intelligent. But he does fall in love and that reshapes his destiny.All in all a very entertaining production. Especially good is Jitka Zelenohorsk&aacute; as a female telegraph operator, who becomes the object of Hubicka's playful attentions.Then again, what do I know?

Gorgeously filmed in black and white, each frame by frame echoes of a past when life was still mired in concealment and innocence.The story centers around a train station in a Czech, German occupied small town and an apprentice train watcher, Milos Hrma, who is confused about his place in the world. He is a young man and is approaching an instance in his life when sexuality is flourishing all around him and yet he can not comprehend it. Scattered throughout the film are leitmotifs that represent sex: the train blowing steam, a horse with a woman riding it, a skinless rabbit being fondled by a woman cook, etc. He is under the tutelage of a train dispatcher who seems a zealot when it comes to seducing women. Although he notices that the train dispatcher is a sex fiend, he does little to elicit help from him. The general thought of the males is that a young man should be bestowed with the foreknowledge and insight at birth. Thus, his inability to perform when his girlfriend Masa is in bed during a bombing causes him great existential crisis and leads to his attempted suicide. In fact, the war was subliminally to blame for his impotence.This isn't a political film but uses subtle innuendos to trace the history of a young man into adulthood. Scattered throughout the film are affable characters such as a pigeon loving, crap covered Train master, a noble, aristocratic woman, a benign, slightly insane, photographer uncle of Masa, and a Nazi ideologue who refuses to believe that the Reich is in ruins.The sexual metaphors are spread in gusty humorous episodes such as when the train dispatcher 'stamps' a girl's buttocks in a moment of ecstasy.

I finally got to see it today and I was quite favorably impressed.  The movie can best be described as a comedy (and a very good one at that).  However, the ending doesn't quite fill the expectation of a comedy.  As a matter of fact, I'm still trying to sorrt out the ending.""Closely Watched Trains"" is the story of a ne'er-do-well from a family of ne'er-do-wells in German occupied Czechoslovakia during WWII.  He is excited about finding a job that will enable him to earn a good salary without having to break a sweat.  His job is at the train station and is ridiculously simple (and there is a crew of four to do it).  He works with some unusial characters including a real Don Juan who gives him misleading impressions about a man's role and function.  When the time comes for his to show his manhood, he fails and, after near tragedy, the humor gets even better.  There is a scene with an elderly woman stroking a gooses's neck that has to be seen to be believed.  Intrigue enters the script and we go back and forth between our hero's sexual quest and a planned sabotage of a Nazi ammunition train.  The movie ends somewhat ackwardly but I guess I understand it to mean that one ne'er-do-well in a long line of ne'er-do-wells finally broke the monotony and did something noble.I saw the movie in what I assumed was Czeck although it sounded German to me.  I was alright with the subtitles, especially after watching an Italian movie the night before that was dubbed in English.  Foreign language movies dubbed in English might free a person to look away from the screen from titme to time but there's a phoniness to it.  It's as though the dubbing voice is more focussed on matching lip movements than to matching emotional expression.If you've never seen ""Closely Watched Trains"" before (and I gather that most people haven't), it's worth a look.

He is preoccupied with wishing for sex.  He considers, and is even attracted to, joining the Resistance but that would require serious effort.  So he spends his time doing as little as possible and flirting with the female conductor of a passing train.This dark comedy is also a wonderful coming of age story in which the loss of innocence naturally parallels the greater losses in the increasingly mad world Milos inhabits.Small town misadventures and petty rivalries are suddenly forced into a new perspective with the indomitable presence of the Germans and the surprising but inevitable hand of destiny.  This is a comedy about Everyman enjoying his little realm of freedom and the System that eventually devoured it.In some ways, this film has renewed meaning in our rapidly shrinking world where we question old beliefs and increasingly welcome the surrender of cherished Freedoms for the illusion of greater Security.

The station is manned by a middle aged station master who spends his time feeding his flock of pigeons and wistfully helping his wife weave woolen sweaters. The station master's main train dispatcher Josef, who is a smart, but flirty Josef. Josef is a silent rebel, with a nonchalant air of defiance around him.Josef takes Milos under his wings educating him about dispatching trains and the art of impressing girlfriends effortlessly. The story meanders around slowly. Josef disobeying the station master, romancing the countess and other women in the station (to the chagrin of the station master). Milos on the other hand is struggling with the usual adolescent problems whilst learning to send telegraph messages, dispatching trains and timidly attempting to date Jitka (a train conductress).  His first date and first kiss doesn't go too well, so he attempts suicide and is then counseled by a rather stern area commander who believes that the Nazi forces (occupying and ruling Czechoslovakia at the time) will salvage them and show them the way.Amidst and beneath this rather simple story is anther subtle, undercurrent story of Nazi occupation, their ideals and brutalities. Josef's nonchalance is a metaphor for the subterfuge & rebellion against the occupation. One day, the area commander visits the small station and tells them about an explosives-laden ""closely watched train"" that will pass by the station the following day. Josef immediately hatches plan to blow it up. Gorgeous Victoria brings a neatly packaged time-bomb (hinting at the efficient undercover rebel movement) and the unsuspecting Milos volunteers to plant it on the ""closely watched train"" with childlike innocence. The next day, the area commander arrives at the station just minutes before the train is supposed to and threatens to sabotage Josef's plan, but young Milos acts smartly, sneaks with the time-bomb, changes the train's track, scampers up the signal post and drops it on one of the train bogies. But, he loses his balance and falls on the train. Minutes later, bomb explodes with ferocious intensity & shaking everybody with a powerful shockwave. Josef relishes the stirred air, fellow villagers & townspeople seem contend and the area commander is stunned. Milos has (in his usual unsuspecting ways) become a martyr and graduated into adulthood.The movie has been directed wonderfully. Two very different stories have been mixed with effortless ease. It is essentially a comedy movie with serious patriotic underpinnings. The cinematography is perfect. Here are some salient points:1. Milos running after a slowly moving train whilst Jitka is waving at him from the last compartment. Milos can't keep up and fades into the distance.2.  Numerous shots of a passing train blow dust & sand as Milos gives it salute with full attention and the nonchalant Josef whispering something into his air with his cap sideways cap and disheveled hair.3. Josef and others being swept away by the shockwave of the train explosion, holding onto their caps and smiling with utter content.",5,Very Nice,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,3276,"['very', 'simple', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'called', 'Milos', 'who', 'verge', 'breaking', 'adulthood', 'living', 'usual', 'adolescent', 'problems', 'job', 'small', 'train', 'station', 'rural', 'Czechoslovakia', 'station', 'manned', 'middle', 'aged', 'station', 'master', 'who', 'time', 'feeding', 'flock', 'pigeons', 'wistfully', 'helping', 'wife', 'weave', 'woolen', 'sweaters', 'station', 'master', 'main', 'train', 'dispatcher', 'Josef', 'who', 'smart', 'flirty', 'Josef', 'Josef', 'silent', 'rebel', 'nonchalant', 'air', 'defiance', 'him.Josef', 'Milos', 'wings', 'educating', 'dispatching', 'trains', 'art', 'impressing', 'girlfriends', 'effortlessly', 'story', 'meanders', 'slowly', 'Josef', 'disobeying', 'station', 'master', 'romancing', 'countess', 'other', 'women', 'station', 'chagrin', 'station', 'master', 'Milos', 'other', 'hand', 'struggling', 'usual', 'adolescent', 'problems', 'whilst', 'learning', 'send', 'telegraph', 'messages', 'dispatching', 'trains', 'timidly', 'attempting', 'date', 'Jitka', 'train', 'conductress', 'first', 'date', 'first', 'kiss', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'well', 'suicide', 'then', 'counseled', 'rather', 'stern', 'area', 'commander', 'who', 'Nazi', 'forces', 'occupying', 'ruling', 'Czechoslovakia', 'time', 'will', 'salvage', 'show', 'way.Amidst', 'beneath', 'rather', 'simple', 'story', 'anther', 'subtle', 'undercurrent', 'story', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'ideals', 'brutalities', 'Josef', 'nonchalance', 'metaphor', 'subterfuge', 'rebellion', 'occupation', 'One', 'day', 'area', 'commander', 'small', 'station', 'explosives-laden', 'closely', 'watched', 'train', 'will', 'pass', 'station', 'following', 'day', 'Josef', 'immediately', 'plan', 'blow', 'up', 'Gorgeous', 'Victoria', 'neatly', 'packaged', 'time-bomb', 'hinting', 'efficient', 'undercover', 'rebel', 'movement', 'unsuspecting', 'Milos', 'volunteers', 'plant', 'closely', 'watched', 'train', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'next', 'day', 'area', 'commander', 'station', 'just', 'minutes', 'train', 'supposed', 'threatens', 'sabotage', 'Josef', 'plan', 'young', 'Milos', 'smartly', 'sneaks', 'time-bomb', 'train', 'track', 'up', 'signal', 'post', 'one', 'train', 'bogies', 'balance', 'train', 'Minutes', 'later', 'bomb', 'explodes', 'ferocious', 'intensity', 'shaking', 'everybody', 'powerful', 'shockwave', 'Josef', 'stirred', 'air', 'fellow', 'villagers', 'townspeople', 'seem', 'contend', 'area', 'commander', 'stunned', 'Milos', 'usual', 'unsuspecting', 'ways', 'become', 'martyr', 'graduated', 'adulthood.The', 'movie', 'been', 'directed', 'wonderfully', 'Two', 'very', 'different', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'mixed', 'effortless', 'ease', 'essentially', 'comedy', 'movie', 'serious', 'patriotic', 'underpinnings', 'cinematography', 'perfect', 'Here', 'are', 'salient', 'points:1', 'Milos', 'running', 'slowly', 'moving', 'train', 'whilst', 'Jitka', 'waving', 'last', 'compartment', 'Milos', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'fades', 'distance.2', 'Numerous', 'shots', 'passing', 'train', 'blow', 'dust', 'sand', 'Milos', 'salute', 'full', 'attention', 'nonchalant', 'Josef', 'whispering', 'something', 'air', 'cap', 'cap', 'disheveled', 'hair.3', 'Josef', 'others', 'being', 'swept', 'away', 'shockwave', 'train', 'explosion', 'holding', 'caps', 'smiling', 'utter', 'content']",N/A

This coming-of-age story seems fairly standard at first but has enough novel twists to be original. Good performances and cinematography are icing on the cake. My only compliant is the usual subtitle one: reading and watching a scene is not fun. The movie isn't rated but is probably PG-13 for adult situations and sexual themes but almost no nudity.,4,Original Coming-of-age tale,1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,447,"['Sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'film', 'plot', 'summary', 'would', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'fairly', 'standard', 'first', 'enough', 'novel', 'twists', 'be', 'original', 'Good', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'are', 'icing', 'cake', 'only', 'compliant', 'usual', 'subtitle', 'one', 'reading', 'watching', 'scene', 'not', 'fun', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rated', 'probably', 'PG-13', 'adult', 'situations', 'sexual', 'themes', 'almost', 'nudity']",N/A
